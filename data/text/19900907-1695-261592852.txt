In honour of the occasion, generous donations were made through Wizo Dafna. As a result a plaque will be placed in a Wizo project in Israel in memory of Ziggy’s wife and six children who all perished in the Holocaust. Since 1947 Ziggy has been res ponsible for helping hundreds of immigrants come to Australia by acting as guarantor for them. His story appeared in the Jewish ”52^ News and the Australian Bicentennial book, “Unsung Heroes”.
