I Vital Statistics. i _ The population of the State has now reached 200,000. This is a matter for congratulation. The influx is a cause as well as a result of tho prosperity of Western Australia. Looking to the future it is most essential that we should hare an enlarged population, so os to maintain the revenue returns and pre- vent the full effect of the reduction in income due to the operation of the slid- ing scale being left. A larger population will mean an equal revenue from reduced duties. That would render it possible to maintain the public expenditure on use- ful public works at the present level. An increase of population has of course a far wider significance than mere revenue. People are the best wealth of a State ' and if we can only gain sufficient of them, the full resources of Western Aus- tralia may be adequately developed. Full statistics regarding the influx of population for the last quarter of 1901, are now to hand and convey very useful information. During that quarter there were 7,680 arrivals in the State,, and 7,1G3 departures. Some 0,410 came from the other States, but we actually lost on the inter-State figures as 6,541 went from us to them. This apparently dis- couraging result was due, however, to holidayers, who went east in December, that month showing 2,428 arrivals from the east and 2,967 departures to it. Taking the different States, on the quar- ter we gained 241 from Victoria but lost 12 to Squth Australia, 328 to New South Wales, 32 to Queensland and 1 to New Zealand. New South Wales indeed gain- ed on us in each mouth of the quarter. We'gained more largely than is usually supposed by English arrivals, 553 coming from Great Britain and only 175 going there. The total arrivals in the State during the quarter, were 7,680, and the departures were 7163. When the nation- ality of the arrivals and departures is taken into account, it seems that most of our eain was British. Against the 318 who belonged to our own race there were, '. 128 Italians and 51 Chinese. We gain- ed a few Germans, Greeks,and Austrians, ; but lost French, Danish and Dutch. In Asiatics, not counting the Chinese, we lost, if it is a loss for their departures to exceed their arrivals. There is no , doubt as to the fact of Italian immigra- tion. There seems to be some as to what industrial effect the arrival of these immigrants has on the community, j It is to be hoped that such immigrants ? will conform to our own standard of wages, j and not make themselves the more un- j popular, and provoke the use of the Restriction Act, by undercutting our own people. While the additions to our populÃ tidh by immigration were thus satisfactory, the additions by birth were still more so. During the quarter there were 1334 births and only 640 deaths in the State, while the marriages amounted to 461. . East Coolgardie has a good re- cord with 209 births and 86 marriages to 93 deaths. Perth is worse in proportion with 277 births and 139 marriages to 143 deaths. In many of the smaller dis- tricts the proportions of births to deaths is high. Subiaco has 35 births to 13 j deaths - are enteritis 88, phthisis, 43, deaths. >The chief causes or deaths were enteritis 88, phthisis, 43, pneumonia, 39, cancer, 25, typhoid, 22, while 71 were due to violence.
