DAIRYING SUPERSTITION. oupbostition and oxtromo conservatism an tlio part of any peoplo are always ludricrous to thoso who uro a few degrees ahead of ' tliem. Furmors will rend with incredulity and amusement of tho difficulty with which modern dairy inutliods were introduced into Siberia " In the Altai region tlio supersti tious peasantry referred to separators as devils,' and luid upon them tho hlnmo for a famino that occurred, and lasted for threo years. Towards tho end of tho third year tho peoplo attacked tho creameries, owned principally by Danish immigrants, aud wlion not drivon off with firearms, carried off the separators, which they throw into tho near- ost rivor. Unfortunately, this raid on tlio separators was followed by tho end of tho famine, and a harvest much better t.liRn that of previous years. This coincidence con firmed tho peasantry in thoir belief that tlio separators wero of diabolical origin, and strengthened their resolution to make an end of them. This singular belief had dona mucu lu reiaru i>uu ucvoiopmons or dairying in tlio Alticoiintry." -. .
