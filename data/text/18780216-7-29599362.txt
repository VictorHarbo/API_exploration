MISCELLANEOUS SHIPPING. The Ams was towed down the river on Thursday morning, taking a load of cereals for Brisbane. She arrived here on October 20, and has therefore had a good stay in harbor. The Loch TThs proceeds to Port Pirie to load cereals. On Thursday she made a start from the roads with a light northerly wind blowing. The BRIERHOLME is a handsome iron ship, and another addition to the wheat fleet. She has brought a full cargo of Puget Sound timber. She has not only an ordinary deck load up the height of the main rail, but the poop has a bit of timber on it. She is a very fine ship, almost new, having been launched at Sunderland, in1876. She is fitted out with the latest appliances,and her cabin is extremely handsome. On leaving Puget Sound, heavy gales, veering from S.W. to N.W. were en- countered, but no damage was sustained beyond the loss of a mainsail, which was blown away. On January 1 the vessel crossed the equator in 140* east, and then came a succession of fine winds all across the Pacific Ocean. After making the Australian land the weather became thick and foggy, with calms, which prevailed to so great an extent that for 12 days before reaching Cape Willoughby she was within a two days' sail of the land. She came to in the roads early on Thursday morning. The arrivals of Friday were of a very miscel- laneous character. At 2 o'clock in the morning the Brierholme was boarded. Soon after 11 o'clock another vessel hove in sight, and a fresh start was made, and at 5 o'clock the officers landed, having boarded four vessels. Tbe Crro, is a Danish-built barque, which has been sold to ooVmfal owners, and ha* been trading on tbe coast. She is now loaded with coal from Newcastle, and had made a very fair voyage, except when off the Dromedary, when she fell in with a severe gale, which lasted with extreme violence for several bouts. $Kce then she bad fine weather. The StarzKOxr passed Cape Bocda on Xhurav day afternoon, bat not knowing that there was aay triegrayWc nf mimication*he master did nothoUthSflagt, iVWbow^MraprooI of the Io*-outbeiifcr«efrw4fflki>pl?* CjapeBoraa, when the sigwahwn her juune on the bows. '93>e Peveronisa most complete .vessel, •Ad *V«tnl*aa«rea*rom^a?tCpeT«nt?p portunity was afforded of admiring the lines of her hull. In crossing the gangway the appoint ments on deck were seen to be of the very best description. Ot course iron is the principal j feature, but "where wood is introduced as in the decks and rails, it is not only of superior quality but is well kept, and from end to end she looked iike a new pin. She is classed Al 100 at Lloyd's, and nautical men will understand by this that nothing is spared in her equipment. The poop is accord ing to recent fashion contracted to meet the requirements only of the master and officers; but they are well eared for in quarters. The master has a beautifully fitted state cabin with bathroom attached, and abaft all on the transoms are two apartments also devoted to the master should he be fortunate enough to carry a wife at tea.. The officers have well appointed state-rooms before all, and in passing from the cuddy to the deck it is seen that every improve ment is at band. There is an engine in the fore deckhouse capable of driving the windlass or the pump, lifting the anchor or the topsails, or when in harbor working out cargo. Belonging to this department is a condenser for the supply of fresh water, and the whole is in very ood order and condition. The Deveron took 'o the Cape a cargo of iron and sleepers from London, and made a very good passage of 48 days. She hauled into the new docks there, and on discbarge of her lading was ordered to this port to load. She sailed on January 7. and shaped a course as far south as 41?, having fair winds all the way. On one occasion ehe made considerably over 300 miles as a day's run, and wbb close to it on another occasion. After reaching the longitude of the Lenwin the easterly wind delayed her progress, but after making Cape Borda on Thursday night she anchored in the roads on Friday at noon, and the master landed to seek farther orders, as he considered it probable she wonld have to go on to Port Pine. The Athens is a vessel of the old school, having been built at Sunderland in 1857. The master reports an extreme dulness in shipping at Calcutta, as many as 100 iron ships and 50 steamers being there waiting employ. The Athene crossed the line when 14 days out. and then had a singular run of calms until reaching the longitude of Cape Lenwin, whence she has been a fortnight detained by east winds. On arrival in the roads she anchored to await a tug to tow Her into harbor. The Redbreast is a barque which has arrived her under singular circumstances. She was chartered in Melbourne to proceed to Maldon Island, and on November 4 she took her departure from Hagan's Group, and five days afterwards she was away to the southward of New Zealand, and on November 25 was off Chatham Island. She then bore away to the northward, passed Tahiti, and was 21 days thence to Maldon Island, where she arrived on tiiesameday as abarque named the Helga,which had left here on a similar mission. The master was disappointed with the prospect of loading, and finding there- were some vessels there with priority of turn, he resolved to shape a return course, and on January 3 he set sail to retrace his track. On the 13th January she reached Falmerston Island, and on the 29th she touched for supplies at Norfolk Island, where it was learned that Bishop Selwyn's wife had died but a few days befpre. The land at Hagan's Group was made on Saturday last, and on Friday she came to anchor in the reads to seek further orders. When she left Maldon Island there were there the Speedy, Dan Diego, Dictator, and Helga. PUBLIC SHIPPING TELEGRAMS. ' 'KQRWTOtr. Arrived—February 14. Gambier Lass, ketch, Adelaide.
