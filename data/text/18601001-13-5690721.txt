Melbourno abounds in valuablo institutions, (of which the Hospital is pre- eminent,) oach of which Bhould hove a BclontiQo as well as charitablo scope. Tho orphan asylums, howover, contributo nothinc! to tho etiology of infantile diseases. Tho Benevolent is silent on tho affections of advancod life : the Yarra Bend furnishes no exposition of the physical and mental treatment of its inmates ; tho Lying-in Hos- pital is equally unproductive * and tho Melbourne par excellence, certainly not in advanco of the rost. Our oleomosynory institutions furnish a page or two of "annualreport,"but they contribute nothing to tho progress of knowledge, whilst the military, police, and Immigration barracks, together with the gaols, maintain the reserve characteristic of Governmental departments. A monopoly has hlthorto oxisted, but mon con- scious of their power and earnest for 1 »bour now look to you, on publie grounds, to brook down tho spirit of exclusivonoss that prevails. They look also for the establishment of a medical Fchool, inasmuch as tho duty of teaching supplies the moBt efficient incentivo to accurate observation and scientific labour.
