PASSING OF SAIL, FURLING THE WHITE WINGS. The following is a further instalment of ships with respect to the end of which information is available: — IDA ZEIGLER: A favourite immi- grant ship of the sixties. She made in all eight voyages to Auckland, and many New Zealanders heard of the "Ida" with their cradle songs. She was lost at Napier anchorage on Feburary 27th, 1868, during a heavy gale, and for once the shore authorities were brought in to blame for the disaster. IDOMENE: A 1390-ton iron ship, built in 1874. She was the third of Fer- nie's "omenes" and was stranded near East London in 1887. INCONSTANT : Running short of pro- visions while on a voyage from Ade- laide to Callao, this barque made for Wellington to recuperate, and stumbled over the then untidy door-step on the night of 19th August, 1850. She was salved and beached at what now is Lambton Quay. Probably from read- ing of old Pegotty's home in David Cop- perfield, the owner decided to roof her in, and for many years she did duty both as a landing stage and a ware- house. A chair now used by the chair- man of directors of the Bank of New Zealand is made from a piece of her timbers. INCHCAPE ROCK: A 1599-ton iron ship, built in 1886 by Russell for Corn- foot's "Rock" line. She finished up with 17 other sailing ships during a father of a blow at Algoa Bay on Sep- tember, 1902. Two tugs and sundry lighters brought up the tonnage of lost shipping to 12,500, and the loss of life to 63. It was a mighty smash. INDIA : One of the early colonisers. She was bound from the Clyde to Mel- bourne when she was burnt in the South Atlantic. The French ship Roland took off 198 out of a total of 216 souls and the other 18 perished. Illegally decant- ing spirits from the cargo with the aid of a naked light caused the trouble. INDIAN EMPIRE: A 1738-ton steel barque, built in 1897 by Reid for Dun- can's "Empire" line. Unlike her elder sisters, she was a carrier rather than a flier. She was burnt in 1899 at the early age of two. INDORE: A 2088-ton iron ship, built in 1885 for Eyre, Evans and Co. She was a fine powerful ship, but not in the thoroughbred class as fliers went. Bound from Hamburg in 'Frisco in 1897 she made one more victim in that grave yard of ships — Staten Island. INDUS: A 364-ton barque. She gave up the ghost while on a voyage from Newcastle to Dunedin on February 13th, 1892\. Her crew got clear INGEBORG: A Danish barque of 1079 tons. Bound from Wellington to New- castle, she was cut down by the s.s. Arawatta on the early morning of August 14th, 1907, when off Port Step- hens. She took down her master and six of her crew. INVERCRGILL: A 1265-ton ship, built for the Shaw Saville and Albion Co. for the N.Z. emigrant service in 1874\. She made in all 26 voyages, usu- ally carrying from 350 to 400 passen- gers, so that she carried upwards of 10,000 passengers out to their new home in the course of her career. She was sold to Norway in 1905, and left Glas- gow to load timber at Christiana on February 20th, 1905, and that was the last ever seen of her. INVERCAULD: An 1100-ton ship. Bound from Melbourne for Chili she piled up on Auckland Island on May 10th, 1864. INVERCAULD: A 1416-ton steel barque built in 1891 by M'Millan for Milne's "Inver" line. She was the third of the fleet, and ranked among one of the fastest of a speedy lot. A torpedo ended her days in 1916. INVERCOE: A 1412-ton steel barque, built in 1892. She fell a victim to the German raider, Prinz Eilel Friedrich, away down off Staten Island in 1914, and her crew was landed in the U.S.A. INVERERNE: A 912-ton barque un- der charter to the N.Z.S. Co. for their immigrant service. She originally was the Atlanta Banfield, under which name she accumulated a crop of troubles, so that her new owners were glad to drop them with her name. She made only three trips to New Zealand, and was lost off Java in May of 1876, coal laden from Newcastle for Java. One boat load of survivors reached port, another was never heard of again INVERKIP: A 1466-ton steel barque, built in 1893. She was one of the Greenock ''Invers," and her going caused a profound sensation. On the night of 13th August, 1904, she and the Loch Carron collided when about 60 miles S.E. of Fastnet light. It was a vile night and the Inverskip foundered in a very few minutes, aud only two souls who were thrown aboard the Loch Car- ron by the force of the impact were saved. INVERLOCHY: A 1471-ton steel barque, built in 1895. Hers was not a long life, as she piled up on Ingoldsby Reefs, on the Victorian coast in Decem- ber of 1902.. INVERLYON: A 1450-ton steel barque, built in 1893. While bound from Port Pirie to Antwerp she was rammed and sunk by the barque Khorasan in the North Atlantic during January of 1904. INVERLYON: (Formerly the Gos twyck). A 1827-ton steel barque, built in 1904. She was bought by Milne to replace the previous Inverlyon, and stopped a torpedo off Limerick in 1917. INVERMARK: A 1430-ton iron barque, built in 1890. She went missing while bound to Iquique from Fremantle in 1916. INVERNESS: A 1959-ton steel barque, built in 1902— the last of the line. She had no pretensions to speed, and man- aged to put in 212 days on a voyage between New York and Brisbane in 1916 Two years later she was aban- doned at sea, with the fire demon in charge. INVERNESSHIRE: A 2307-ton steel 4-mast barque, built in 1895 for Law's Shire line. Hers was a chequered life — even for a sailing ship. In 1908 she was trying to head-reach against the triumphant westerlies that give added terror to Cape Horn. She was out- ward bound from Hamburg to Santa Rosalia and her crew were about done in when the harassed captain decided to run back under the lee of the Falk- lands for shelter. He anchored near Sea Lion Island, and all hands went ashore to stretch their legs. They stretched their necks and strained their throats when a salvage tug from Port Stanley picked up their deserted ship from under their very noses and towed her into Port Stanley. That leg stretching expedition cost the owners £3000, and the utmost ingenuity of re- sourceful mariners would be working overtime for the remainder of the voy age in an effort to prove, to testy own- ers that it was money well spent. In 1915 she left Fremantle in ballast for San Francisco and the weather which had assembled to the S.E. of Cape Leuwin in conference, started to search her for weak spots. The first thing to go was the fore topmast and for the next five days she was shedding her top-hamper piecemeal, being left at the end of that time with only the jig- ger mast standing. She then did three weeks wallowing, and few places offer better facilities for this swinish exer- cise than the Southern Ocean. She was picked up and towed into Hobart and the amphibious Norwegian bought her, history and all. He inflicted on the wayward lady the name Svartokog, and she squared the account by carrying it and her crew into oblivion sometime subsequent to October, 1920. INVERSNAID: A 1614-ton iron ship, built in 1882 by Steele. She was only four years old when she was sold to the "Sierra" line, and sailed from Pen- arth on 15th October, 1886, for Singa- pore. That was the last of her, unless her figure-head and part of one of her lifeboats that came ashore on Lundy Island are taken into account. Another Inversnaid (Milne's) was built in 1892. She was of 1418 tons and became the Garthgarry in 1922. INVERURIE: A 1417-ton steel barque, built in 1889. She was the first of the Inver line, and was over the quarter-century mark when she was tor- pedoed in the early part of the war. IRANIAN: A large 4-mast barque, built in 1895. She was wreck- ed on April 3rd, 1900, but I have no further particulars. IRON DUKE: A 1435-ton ship. She went missing on a voyage from Blyth to Iquique in 1895. She was coal la- den, and seven others similarly laden did likewise in the same year. IVANHOE: A 1385-ton iron ship, built in 1868 for the Waverly line. She stranded in Ringarooma Bay and was sold as she lay, at auction, in Mel- bourne for £400 to two astonished squat- ters who had merely nodded to give the auctioneer a hand. They thus became possessed of a very fine clipper ship that at the moment was roosting on the sand in Ringarooma Bay, growing bar- nacles instead of wool. However, she was refloated, docked and her dishevell- ed apparel attended to, by which time she had cost them about £2500. Her first voyage returned a clear profit of £7000, and the Ivanhoe became a fav- ourite ship in the London-Melbourne run. She went eventually to the Chi- lean flag and was wrecked near Hono- lulu on December 30, 1915. ISABELLA: A 730-ton ship. She piled up on Chesterfield Reefs in July of 1875, and portion of her crew (23) lived on an islet, while others sailed in the life boats to Queenlsand and re- turned with help. ITATA: A 950-ton barque. She stirred things up a bit at Newcastle on 12th January, 1906, when she took fire and was beached. She burned for three days, by which time there was only a crumpled hull to argue over.
