Every person who has taken lessons in Motor Driving and Motor Mechanics at the A. E. Terry School has found it most fascinating work. Manv things which appear at the siart to be what is tenned "hard" are found to be quite easy to the student when couched by the Principal (Mr. A. E. Terry) and a capable staff. . He becomes so "wrapped up" in his work that he never wants to leave off. The A. E. Terry establishment is I \ equipped with everything of interest to the motor ? : driver and motor mechanic. No expense is spared to keep v/cll abreast of the times. So soon as some new model or now part is announced Mr. A. E. Terry immediately secures a sample for the imp of his.students. BEGIN NOW. The terms arc extremely moderate. There are always good jobs for good men, and the A. E. Terry School is the place where good men are made. Motor traction is becoming more and more general every day. Before many years go by the "knowing all" about the mechanical vehicle" will be a necessity-the use of the horse for tran- sit purposes will be past. , , LESSONS BY POST. Tile A. E.
