It is well known to the world that it cures many complaints other remedies cannot reach. This fact is as well esta blished as that fat- Sun lights the vori J. DISORDERS OF THE LIVER AND STOMACH. ! Most persons will at some period of their lives I suffer from indigestion, derangement of their liver, stomach, or bowels, which, if not (illicitly removed, frequently settles into a dangerous illness. It is well known in India, and other tropical climates, that Holliiway's Pills are the only remedy that L-an be wlied upon in such cases. Almo-.t every soldier abroad carries a box of them in his knap iaclc. In England most persons know that these Pills will cure them whenever the liver, stomach, or bowels are out of order, and that they need no physician. WEAKNESS AND DEBILITY. Such as suffer from weaicness or debility, and those who feel want of energy, should at once have J ?ecourse to these Pills, as they immediately purify I ;he blood, and, acting upon the mainspring iif ife, give strength and vigour to the system. v To roiiiig persons entering into womanhood, with a lerangement of the functions, and to mothers at ;he turn of life, these Pills will be most efficacious in correcting the title of life that may be on the turn. Young and elderly mc-n sillier in a similar ' manner at the wune periods, when there is always j [l.mirer; they should, thcrcforet undergo a course I of this purifying medicine, winch ensures lasting ! health. j DISORDERS OF CHILDREN. All young children should have administered to I them from time to time, a few doses of these Pills, ivhich will purify their blood, and enable t'lem to pass safely through the different disorders inci- I dental to children, such as measles, hooping-cough, | cowpock, and other infantile diseases. These Pills ; are so harmless in their nature as not to injure the i most delicate constitution, and are therefore more peculiarly adapted as a corrective of the humours affecting them. DROPSY. Hundreds are cured yearly by the use of these Pills conjointly with the Ointment, which should be rubbed very bountifully into the parts affected. DERANGEMENT OF THE KIDNEYS. If these Pills be used according to the printed directions, and the Ointment rubbed over the region of the kidneys, at least once a day as salt is ? forced into meat, it will penetrate the kidneys, :md \ correct any derangement of their org:ins. Should the affliction be stone or gravel, then the Ointment should he rubbed into the ni'.-k of the bladder, ami a few days will convince the snlTerer that the effect of tln'se two remedies is astonishing. DISORDERS OF THE STOMACH i Are the sources of the deadliest maladies. Their Cii.-ct is to vitiate all the Ihiids of the body, and to send a poisoned stream through all the channels of circulation. Now what is the operation of the Pills J They cleanse the bowels, regulate the liver, bring the relaxed or irritated stomach into a natural condition, and, aitiii-r through the secretive organs riic* Tin: blood itselk, change t'sesitate I of the system from sickness to health, by ever- j cisiug a simultaneous and wholesome effect upon ! all its parts and functions. COMPLAINTS OF FEMALES. The functional irregularities peculiar to the weaker sex are invariably corrected without pain j nr inconvenience by the use of llollnway's Pills. . They are the safest and surest medicine for all , diseases incidental to females of all ages. BILIOUS AFFECTK )NS.
