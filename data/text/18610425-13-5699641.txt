TO LET, tho RAINBOW TAVERN, established for tho last 20 (twonty-six) years, and now doing up- wards of £300 per month, independent of the out- door family connexion, which Is again fast returning to the old establishment, and has all the scopo, even ia the present times, for doubling the above pro- ceeds, as nearly one half the establishment is not made use of. Any industrious couple on tho look-out for a good houso anda rnsdo ready money business, aro infirmcd that tho Rainbow 'lavern is the only establishment of its kind now in tho markot (worth notice) capable of carrying on an extensive business, oither as a tavern, as It profesaos to bo at the prosont time ; as an hotol, which It abounds with nil and every accommodation, required for an eslabll'hmont of tho kind ; or as any other business requiring large and extensive promises, v. hich the Rainbow establishment can afford for any kind required. Tho proprietor, in again submitting this establish- ment to tho notice oí tho public, either in Sydney, Melbow» e, or any other part of the colonicB, bogs to remind them that a'l up to tho present time who havo conducted tho working of tho establishment with their own capital have, at tho expiration of their lease, retired n ith large profits ; and others who havo conducted tho establishment with borrowed or com- mission capital could havo .done tho carne thing had they thought proper to do so whon offered them by mon of moans For inetanco, Mr. Myers, In Septem- ber, 1857, was offered a ohequo for £6,000 for bis in- terest in the lease and goodwill only of the establish- ment, but refused on tho grounds that that som .was not its value ; then, again, in the early part of 1860, James Simpson, now of. tho City Wlno Vaults, Goorge-Btroet north, but then conducting tho Rainbow establishment for mo in his own name, upon one-half prouts, in the Bhape of com- mission, was offered £800 for the position I had placed him in only a few weeks previously, but refused on the same ground as Mr. Mjerihad done before-not ita value. Many parties who havo inquirod, and havo felt inclined to take the whole of the establishment, havo been under the impression ((rom talk about town by various porsons) that Mr. Simpson had taken tho Rainbow establishment from mo solely upon his own responsibility (and paid mo a largo bonus), but could not mako it nay expenses. This, I must Btate, is not oorrcot-far from it-Mr. Simpson boing responsible only for tho conductine of the establishment, paying eui rent potty oxponooa out of the proceeds (stock exceptod, which, of course, I bound myself to supply), and handing mo over what balance remained every Saturday, If any. Tho ostablishmont at the present time is repleto (or carrying on an extensive business, and room for Im- provement upon the present trade hy an industrious couple, who will give it the Bamo amount of attention that all businesses require. In sodolcg, there ia little rea>on to doubt the Incoming tenints would find the] had takon a good and protltablo concern. The coffin and luncheon rooms are attended daily by hundreds and from tho central and commanding position havo little to fear of any competition affecting them BO long as tho comfort and convenience of thi publie is studied. The Bar and other branches ol tbo establishment will speak for themselves, by thi weekly accounts, which aro properly kept The cellarngi and Btores aro dry and extonslve, capable of storlni many hundred tona of goods, ior carrying on an' wholesalo business. The wino vaults, which aro buil underneath the stroet, at an enormous oxpenso, wer built expropsly for tbo maturing of wines, do not onl answer all the purposes they wero built for, but, fror! my own experience In the wine trade, will ripen am ?TDÇ, forward winos lit for use in leas than one-ha the time than what la allowed in any wine vaults 1 London, providing the wines are properly stowed, an the temperature cared for.
