The most important item of news con- nected with the mining interest is the an- nouncement that the delegates of the various Mining Boarda are to meet on Monday, for the consideration of the proposed regulations with reaped to leases of auriferous land. The Board of Delegates is not looked upon by the miners as a fair representation of the interests of the great body of the working miners, but merely as a representation of the Mining Boards, which, although formed, have been found practically useless in many of the mining districts. It would be im- possible, however, to bring together any body of men to represent, in reality, the varied interests which exist on the gold- fields. The delegates for the Mining Boards, at all events, represent various districts, and aro at the fame time men of practical experience ia mining, and if they rise with the opportunity above local jealousies, and give the full weight of their experience in the framing of sugges- tions for the settlement of the important questions relating to the granting of leases of auriferous lands, much good will acorue. The session of this body will be watched with great interest by the mercantile community ! and by moneyed men. We are still without accurate reports of the prospects of the Gordon diggings. At M'lvor, experiments in the fusion of quartz are still being carried on. The Tarrengower Tima reports : " The person whoae experiment we previously quoted is prosecuting the inquiry with increasing success, and we trust soon to be enabled to place further important facts before Our readers respecting this most interesting Bubjcot." The spurious-nugget case, heard before the Bench at Castlemaine, has resulted in a break- down of the information against the manu:, faoturer. It was proved in this case that tha prisoner, an expert aBsayer¡of the name of Ah Sing, had manufactured, or rather alloyed, the gold in question, though in auch a small proportion that it actually repre- sented very nearly 20 carats value, or two carats more than gold to which the Gold- smiths' Company of London affix their stamp. The alloy used by tha prisoners was S.(copper, and the proportion-gold, 20 parta; I 1 copper 4 potts ; being only two parta inferior -to sovereign gold, which la 22 carata fine. The party who Hold the nuggets has beau committed for trial. Only 834 persons landed at the port of Mel- bourne daring the week, consisting of 225 from the neighboring colonies, 48 from, the United Kingdom, and 61 from Hamburg.

The export trade remains altogether without movement, and, In consequence of the non« arrival of advices of the London May sales, without transactions. Sales of somo smalt parcela of wool have been effected at 91d. to ia. per lb. for sllpe, according to condition, 1B. 8d. to Is. 5d. for handwaahed, and la. 7d lo Is. Öd. per lb. for scoured.

The following is from tho San Francisco Evening Bulletin of tho latoafc anio. : Son Francisco, Tuosdny Evening. May l8. The business of the past fortnight has boon he&vy; with reapoct to no article, but thu do mand, both from the Interior and coast- wise, has been tolerably fair for most kiuds of staple goods. Owing to the expooted arrival of a largo number of vessels duo and over due from home Eastern ports, and uveral supposed to bo due from foroigu ports, tho jobbers havo naturally felt unwilling to woko considerable additions to their stooka, n_d accordingly havo purchased solely with au tjo to daily requirements. Prices in the «.oin are without chango since last mall; the leading exceptions to this remark ard American liquors and spirits of turpentine, which have materially declined. Adamantina candies are without noticeable change. The demand from the trade for coffee has beau better, but priceB are unaltered. CigarB aro dall of sale and not covering the cost of importa- tion. Dry goods generally are realising fair prices, and in moderate stock. Considerable receipts of whale oil have taken place, the mest of which will be stored. The bulk of the provisions arriving have gone into second hands at full prices. Butter has rather improved. Bice has not varied matorlally ; the demand for foreign has been good. Both raw and refined sugars have been firm, but have not advanced, although with lighter stocks present than had previously been known for some years, and towards the close almost entirely in second hands. Americaa brandy and whiskey have seriously declined, and other kinds of Eastern Bpirita are heavy and drooping. Fine brandies are also dull, and .saleable only in small parcels! »3 wanted for the tiade. Teas have been dealt in to a moderate extent at about the former íangeof prices. Notwithstanding the demand from the country upon the market for bread stuffs during the past fortnight has been large and steady, and the receipts of flour and wheat from thence have almost ceased, yes piices, se far from improving, have rather de- clined. The maintenance, however, of rates ranging from 10 dois, for common Oregon to 16 dois, for the favorite brand of extra do- mestic, with the new harvest not more than six weeks off, affordB the moBt incontestable proof tbat wo are likely to have no surplus worth talking of to carry over. Barley and oats have been purchased to some extent for ship- ment to Australia, but the quantity thus sub Btructed from stocks has not been large enough to influence prices. The prospects of the growing crops in some ccctionB of tho State aro now spoken of dis (ouragingly, but as regards wheat, the Li ead t h of land sown last fail was so enor- mous, that in almost any event we may count upon a sufficiency for our own wants. __The Herald of the previous date reports : Flour.--Sales of 800 quarter-sacks domestic, for export, on private termB ; 160 quarter-saoka Alviso at 14 dois. Grain.-SulcB of 300 bags barley at \\\ cents; 1,000 bags barley and 2,600 bags wheat, on private termB ; 670 bags oats at 1 dol. 65 cents to 1 dol. 60 cents.

Our dates from New York, by way of Cali- fornia, are to the 20th April, but the commer- cial news contained in the Californian papers is very meagre. Monday Morning. We have Adelaide papers to the 22nd ins t., brought by the Durra Burra. The South Aus- tralian Advertiser of that date reports of the market : The opening of the telegraph toViotoria, after so many delays, took place to- day, and several messages havo been sent : but np ti 6 o'clock no repIieB had reached Adelaide, 1 The market for colonial produce generally i has been dull throughout the last 10 days. Ia flour best country brands have been offered at ¡£l7, and town at £18, during the last three days; but transactions have been very li- mited. Wheat has fluctuated a good de_l but after being down to 7s. 8d. at the milla iu town, it has been again more in demand foi export, and parcels have changed hands al 7s. 9d. and 8s,, dolivered at the Port. Bran ließ been sold at Is. 8d. In grain for horse feed we quote no transactions. The vessels loading at the Melbourno borfct last week are still here, and some difficulty ii experienced in inducing shippeis tosend floai forward even at low rates of freight. Thor; is still the same inactivity in general bust ness ; and the only quotations sinco ' las Saturday at uuction were as follows, viz. by Messrs. WickBteed and Co., to-day, 150 tom English house coals, at £2 12s. 6d. per toa, do livered on the wharf, at the Port: and bj Messrs. Solomon and Co., Goonin China watti sugar, at £43 10s. per ton. The Btringent state of the discount markel still continues to be an absorbing topic o interest; but the anticipated opening of'i new bank, under the title of " The Nation» Bank of Australasia," is looked for as Ilkelj to be the means of protecting trado from th: present undue pressure. i MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRIOE8 CURRENT. The Argus Ofllco, Saturday Evening. Tho import market during tho past week has bee i vory limited in tho amount of transactions, and Ins afforded but littlo to report. With tho exception of u low Bales by auction, business boa boen conOned to tho same retail character, both for couutry orden and. the supply of (bo town trade, which has prevailed f jr the loEt two months. Stocks in second bouses aro ad- mitted to be vory much reduced, and It is oxpoctod that euch houses must shortly becomo buyors, whloh will nccojsarlly create a livelier (oeling. The extent of ttocks In first bands 1B far too hoavy to admit of any prospect of Improvement in prices gene- rally. Within the last few days country orders havo como in more frocly than for some limo past, a<-d although the chief demand bas boon for spirits and other liquids, a better tone has been given, und hopos havo arisen of an Improved trado during tbe coming wook. Tho absence of tho overland null Is now scarcely remarked on, tbo irregulari- ties of tho mall steamers having become so usual as t j render tho probability of their punctual arrival no longer a matter for speculation. Liquors.-Tho demand for draught boor, as Is usual during tho winter months, has been light, though steady, first brands moving off in email parcels with- out chango in price, about 81.12s. Cd. to ii. 16a. being the ruling price of Bass's No. 8 Burton, other brands bringing proportionate prices, although, owing to amount of Blocks un hand, of less roady sala. By auction during tbo week, Tennent's No. 1 ale hu been sold for 71.10s., and Salt's for 01.16s. per hhd. For bottled beer ol preferred battlers there has boen a steady demand, cbioily for country supplies, and best brands havo been of tolerably ready salo on oqual proportions of ale and porter, at about 10s. per dozen. We quote ale and beer (duty paid) : - Ale-Bass's, hhd., 82. 12s. 8d. to 81. 16s.; Inef, Ooope, and Oo.'s, Si.; other Burton, do., 01. 10s. to ii. 10s. ; Tennent's, 72. 16s. to 82. ; Charrlugton'a or Coding's, do., 02. to 02. 6s.; Byass'a and Friend's, quarts, dozon, 9s.

LABOK MARKET.-Ibero ia no improvement whatovor In this markot to roport; tho demand, indeed, appears to havo rather lessened than Increased. For farm ser- vants thoro has boon no demand, and for rough ogrl cullilla! laborers tho Inquiry has boon very light, The employment expected to bo required on tho railroad] docs not as yet neatly como up to tho anticipated de- mand, and numbers who have loft the diggings in tho hopo of procuring employment In this branch of In dustry aro loitoriiig about the town without moans, or, until the works aro further procecdod witb, any proapect of proourlng employment. Married couplos, without children, havo neon moro inquired for, for country service ; but those oncumborod with young families und difficulty lu procuiing situations. Mo chaules, tradosmon, and skilled laborers aro Humo- rously unemployed, and, though willing to work at "reduced wages, aro unable to procuro omploymont.

SKAMES'S WADES,-Tho demand for hands continues tolerably brisk, but tho number of acauion offering to ship is quito equal to tho requirement, and rites of wages are unchanged. Tho following a'O tho ratos paying:-India or China and back, 4i,; China, India, or West coast of Amoricu and England, 41, ; coasting voyages, 4Í. 10s. lo 62. ; and England direct, 42. to 42. 10s. a month.
