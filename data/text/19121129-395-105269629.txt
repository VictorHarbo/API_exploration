Hundreds of women hail Dannebrog as a blessing to 1 womankind, because no other remedy can so satisfactorily destroy superfluous hairs. No woman is looking her best if she has hairs on her face; and even slum people pity the unfortunate woman with moustache or a beard. Old age is niaie more ugly by long hairs on the ohi'i. ami young women desiring marriage singly cannot afford to have hairy laces. Dan nebrog helps to keep the married wonian looking younger.
