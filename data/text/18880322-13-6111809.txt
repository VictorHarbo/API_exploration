The refusal of the Royal assent to the Divorce Bill passed during the last section of the Legislature of New South Wales is an event that was anticipated by many advocates of the measure, and that is, perhaps, not to be so deeply regretted as the member who took charge of it in the Sydney Assembly seems to imagine. A reform of the marriage law is certainly required; and it would be advis- able that the present system of legal separation, which continues the galling bond of a merely nominal relationship, should be replaced by the granting of divorce for such causes as crime and desertion. Drunkenness and desertion so far affect the social and personal standing of men and women that they ought to be taken into account by the marriage law. Nevertheless, the con templated reform is one which an English Cabinet may be expected to shirk, unless there is, first of all an intercolonial agreement. Whatever may be the divergence of legislation on other points, the colonies should endeavour, for obvious reasons, to adopt the same standard in regard to this particular subject,' It is true that the majority of them are following in the direction taken by New South Wales; for the question has been mooted in South Australia and New Zealand, and a similar bill has been read for the second time in the Victorian Parliament. Were they equally advanced ; were the legislation uniform ; were the anomalies that must arise from partial legislation satisfactorily prevented ; there is no reason to fear that the Imperial Government would enter into a conflict with the colonists by continued opposition to their wishes. Disadvantages, indeed, would still exist, inasmuch as there would be a di(Ver on ice between the law of Australia and that of England. Those, however, we already have in some measure, and they may be overcome in time by legislative changes. They are not of sufficient weight, or likely to prove so serious, that they could be counted against Australian opinion. The objections made by the Imperial Government to the bill are two in number, and one of the criticisms is worthy of taking into consideration when the measure is devised and again in troduced It is desired that the operation of the law should be expressly limited to those who are " permanently done " cried " in the colony In other words, the extended facilities of divorce should only be open to those who are genuine residents, and not to all conditions of people who might be tempted to visit the colony for the mere purpose of undoing an irksome knot Such a provision might reasonably be inserted, in order to prevent as far as possible the complications that would rise from the difference of the law within the empire. It may be some time before Australia is agreed in regard to the subject, it will probably be a long time ere ecclesiastical influence and tradition permit of any alterations in England. A limiting clause, therefore, might reasonably be adopted in order to further the act There can be no desire either in Parliament or outside of it to make Sydney the Gretna Green of divorce, the place where people may Hock to throw oil re- responsibilities that they would be compelled to observe in their own country. The second objection of the Imperial Government, though it is fair and plausible, can hardly have any other effect than that of delaying the measure for a comparatively short time According to the theory of the constitution, a measure of so much longer range, and of so great interest to every household, ought to be clearly endorsed by the electors But it may safely be assumed that a general election will make an timely no difference in the opinion of Parliament. The principle has been repeatedly after mad, and that in spite of the very strong agitation which was carried on by the leaders of the churches of England and of Rome Considering the sensitive response which colonial Parliaments often exhibit even to a passing phase of popular opinion, it may be taken for granted that the representatives are in accord with the majority of their constituents The advisers of HER. MAJESTY have, of course, acted strictly within the limits of the constitution and in accordance with the prerogatives of the Crown But, properly read, the despatch must be construed as meaning that the bill is deferred for further consideration. The Imperial authorities simply i require some proof that the people are desirous of amending the marriage law, and some precautions against the mischievous effects of legislative anomalies Fortunately, the Imperial Government need not be swayed by party considera- tions. The question has not come within the range of practical politics in England, and while there are Conservative journals that favour on extension of the law of divorce, there are Liberal organs that cling obstinately to the traditional theory There is no reason to believe that Lord Svrisnunv and his colleagues have yielded to ecclesiastical influence They may have attached more weight to BISHOP BARRY'S meetings in Sydney than would politicians belonging to the colonies But then objections are confined to very practical points, which betray no ni tention of domineering for the sake of one religious body over a colony where all denominations are equal We may hope that Mr. Ni an, who has given notice of his intention to introduce the bill again, is now able to see that no high handed course is taken with the Legislature or the colony of New South Wales. It will be time enough to do pass a constitutional difficulty, when the difficulty arises, whereas at pro sent, so far is the Imperial Government from forcing a quarrel upon the colonies, that we may wisely take heed to its kindly expressed suggestions The fact that a Conservative Ministry has introduced into the House of Commons a bill which is described by Mr GLADSTONE as a large, bold, and just measure, shows how great is the change which has come over the spirit of British politics The change, indeed, is quite as great in the case of Mr GLADSTONE as in that of the Conservative Ministry At the very beginning of the session Mr GLADSTONE appeared before an astonished House in the very novel garb and guise of a penitent He plainly stated that on his side of the House there was no desire to renew the constant agitations and combats of the preceding session, and that he was anxious that the present one might prove useful and even distin " guished " It would be unwise to expect too much from the attitude so unexpectedly adopted by one who was the chief instigator of the Faith mentary conflicts that disgraced the last session of the House of Commons And doubtless the Government know how to appraise at its proper worth an expression of penitence which, so far as the favourite scheme of the distinguished penitent is concerned, has almost the aspect and possibly the efficacy, of a death bed repentance of Mr GLADSTONE IS probably intensely sincere when he says that he will do all he can to promote expeditious legisla- tion But he is sincere now, because his convictions at the moment all point in that direction What the next phase of these convictions will be, and when the change will take place at of questions which no one, not even Mr QL V.D siONL himself, can probably answer It would, however, be idle to deny that the present Government differs widely from previous Conservative Administrations, and, in the opinion possibly of a good many Tones of the old school, quite as widely from what a Conservative Administration ought to be But, as we have pointed out more than once before the whole Conser value party has undergone of late a transformation which is becoming every year more and more thorough The excesses of the Radicals threw into the ranks of toryism a number of men with ideas that a few years ago would have seemed dangerously ad vinced, but which are now looked upon as being little more than abreast of the requirements of the time These have leavened the whole Conservative mass, and the Tory of the old school is becoming more care, and his voice less frequently heard He has done good service in his day, and, for all we know, may be called upon at some future time to do it again Meanwhile, he has not much weight with the party and most assuredly had no voice or same in the new Local Government Bill, the provisions of which have just been explained to the House of Commons by the President of the Local Government Board The bill is to be the chief measure of the session, and, with its accessories will probably occupy a large portion of its duration Both parties are pledged to a measure dealing with this question and a settlement of it has been essayed ahead), once by lord BE \to\sm rry, and twice by Mr GLADstoNe It has long been recognised at home that some change is necessary in a system which gave the power of controlling the local affairs of the counties, and of spending the late raised from them, to a body who owed their appointment to nomination and not to election Some of the powers and functions of justices of the peace are rather an anomaly in an age when the maxim " no taxation with "out representation " has become an article of faith The remedy is sought in the establishment of county councils, the construction of which represents a reasonable compromise between the elective and the nominative pi principles The ratepayers will probably be content with the power of electing three four His of the members of the new councils And the influence of the landowners should still be sufficient to ensure that their interests shall be properly represented the transference of the duty of licensing to the county boards is one that should work well, but will probably not produce much change in the manner in which the business is conducted in the rural districts of England the licensing question is not a burning one, and if the change merely tends to render favouritism and patronage of particular traders less likely in future everyone will probably be content the new powers vested in the councils to close publichouses on Sunday will constitute an important or an unimportant reform, according as to whether these powers will be put in force or not but the increase in the cost of the licenses for publichouses shows that the Government are prepared to aid the temperance movement in a way where aid can be given with least inconvenience to the public and least disturbance of vested interests Until we receive details of the scheme by which assistance is to be given to persons desiring to emigrate, it is impossible to pronounce an opinion upon the merits of this part of the bill Much will depend upon the way in which such a power is carried out But it would seem that county councils would possess exceptional facilities for picking out and helping such persons who, like agricultural labourers, would derive most benefit themselves from emigrating, and would be the most desirable kind of immigrants for other countries to receive the existing justices of the peace are not to be done away with, but, conjointly with the councils, are to have the control of the police And it is to be presumed that then pull cial functions, which have in the main been wisely, beneficial 1) and cheaply exercised, will also be preserved to then there is much to be discussed and settled, no doubt, before the bill just introduced will be allowed to pass into law But the Government have avoided such mistakes as that of interfering with the in him councils in the towns which already possess them These will be left untouched by the bill, and thus the only difficulty in this connection will be that imposed upon the Boundary Commission, of delight ing the bounds which separate the boroughs from the counties A matter that has for long been a vexed question for Londoners, is dealt with by the proposal to supersede the Metropolitan Board of Works by a council based upon the model of the county boards There are other matters in connection with the bill which require further light thrown upon them, but in the meanwhile we are able to gather that the old country is about to take another forward step in sympathy with the spirit of the times, and that once more the Conservatives have shown that their policy is one of steady progress. The progressive con- servatism of PITT was checked by the French Revolution and the Tory im- mobility of PERCEVAL, and LIVERPOOL succeeded, but Lord SALISBURY desires apparently to revive the best traditions of the greatest of England's Conservative leaders PfTr aspired to be popular at home and feared and respected abroad. The Working Men's College has attained that measure of success, at which all men speak well of it , and we may now ask what idea of education the pro motors and teachers set before themselves It is late in the day to observe, as did the Chief Justice at the President's dinner, time brain- power is not limited to those who are " bred in the lap of luxury and '. fortune of South -,, with his unfortunate habit of buttonholing people in the street, and asking them troublesome questions about first principles, may have made some very Renmark The universities of Germany, France, and Scotland, where for centuries students have pinched themselves for the sake of learning, bear somewhat hackneyed testimony to the fact Nor can we see the merit, which Professor Pi ARSON discerns, of turning the University into an enlarged Working Men's College 01 general poll technical school and ware- house There are heights beyond the hills, and the standard of the University should always remain something beyond that of other institutions, and its course should be designed not to cram the intellect but to bring out what power it possesses. Mr. PLAISOV, however, made a famous historical illusion, the true moral of which might be of some importance. The world owes much to small countries, and to countries that had no special facilities for education, like Palestine and Greece and Rome, and, as the Speaker might have added, England in the most stirring days of English literature. Education will not create the genius that makes men and nations great. By itself, it will not produce perseverance, ambition, steadiness of character, of the power of applying theoretical principles The knowledge of facts discovered by other observers is but a pool possession, unless it can be used in the right spin it And what should be aimed at in all training, in schools and working men's colleges and universities, and all other devices for bringing the human intellect into a mould, is to instil a certain town, a certain deter men ttion, a certain desire to use know ledge well and wisely. It is sometimes forgotten by educationalists that the mind which has created science is of a little value. The annual meeting of the Employers' Union is a plain and visible mark of continued progress. While the chairman was able to congratulate the members on the growth of their own union, and on the friendly relations that had existed between the representatives of capital and labour, he had also the satisfaction of referring to the fact, that similar associations had been established in South Australia and Queensland. The principal topic of his brief i curing all dress was naturally the Board of Coach tion This institution is still at the experimental stage, and differences of opinion regarding ing its constitution and its powers are una; voidable. Captain CURRIE points out, for example, that there is no provision which thoroughly secures absolute finality for its decisions But it may be doubted whether finality is possible under any constitution until experience has given the board such a standing and authority in public opinion that its judgments can be received by both sides without question. We can fairly expect nothing more at present than the prevention of the inconsiderate and unnecessary strikes and lockouts, that create as much bitterness of feeling as graver disputes. We may trust that, as time goes on, both parties will invariably seek conciliation, and slum the more barbaric strife, in which the endurance of a bank account is pitted against the endurance of a strike fund. But Captain CuitniF is also inclined to think that a special board should be chosen for every separate inquiry, because those members who are in forested in the dispute are unable to take part in the investigation Such an argument must surely cut in two ways. The board consists of an equal number of employers and trade unionists, and the labor representatives are equally dis qualified if they are directly interested. Moreover, there are some obvious ad v stages in the existence of a permanent Board of Conciliation. By experience the members must acquire a judicial, calmer, and more dispassionate frame of mind. A new board would be utterly inexperienced , a permanent board would learn to make allowances. Captain Currie, seems to fear that the representatives of labour must always voted against the capitalists The public are hoping that they will work together and perhaps, they can- not be brought to respect each other more surely than by the method of appointing the leaders of both sides to act on the same pew manent committee, and to meet constantly for the purpose of con- ciliating. The great pressure on the advertising columns of 'The Argus on Saturday renders it necessary that advertisements intended for insertion in that day's issue should reach the office before half-past 8 o'clock on Friday evening Those received later cannot be inserted His excellency the Governor and Lady Loch yesterday visited the Glenlyon, Franklin, and Daylesford Agricultural Society's Show, which was held at Daylesford. 'The viceregal party were received on the station by a numerous company, representing both Houses of Parliament, the mayor, councillors, and burgesses, and the society. Addresses of welcome having been presented, the party were driven to the town hall, and thence to Wombat lull, the public gardens and the tower, from which a One outlook of the picturesque country is obtained. His excellency afterwards opened the show, and was entertained at luncheon. The toast of the health of His excellency and Lady) Loch was honoured with every mark of cordiality, and in responding, His I'.icolleiicy acknowledged the very kind welcome which had been accorded, and praised the beauty of the surroundings of Daylesford, and the evidences of prosperity which the district presented He also found much to admire in the show. In replying to toast of " Her Majesty's Ministers," the At Home) General said that the Government would submit to Parliament carefully formulated measures which the Cabinet believed it would sends the colony to pass into law, and that they should expect these measures to receive careful and impartial consideration at the hands of Parliament. In replying on behalf of Parliament, Mr F Fitzgerald and Mr, Zeal asked that some of the bills alluded to by Mr. Wrixon should be introduced in the Legislative Council, in order that the Upper House should have time to carefully consider them, instead of the business being rushed for June as it sometimes was at the end of the session. The formation of a railway from Day) less- ford to Guildford in order to give the district north of Daylesford direct railway common cation with the northern districts of the colony, and with Melbourne, was advocated by several speakers during the proceedings After luncheon His excellency and Lady Loch were driven to the well known Hepburn Mineral Springs, in the evening, before returning by special train to Macedon, Lady Loch opened a bazaar in the town- hall, which is being held in aid of the Church of England [ It has by ed mentioned in defence circles that Commander Collins, of the Victorian Navy, will, in all probability, be appointed Secretary for Defence vice Major-General Downes, who has resigned. The report has not received Ministerial confirmation, but it appears to be very well founded. The Public Service Board, a week or two ago, reported that none of the applicants from among officers in the Public Service were qualified for the position, and as it became necessary to go outside for a suitable gentleman, Commander Collins was no minutes If he receives the appointment, it will be without any solicitation on his part, and will depend upon the report of the board as to his qualifications. The records of the Defence department show that the career of Commander Collins is to a large extent colonial He originally belonged to the Imperial Navy, and served for three S ears as sub-lieutenant and lieutenant on H M S Barracouta under the late Commodore Goodenough on the Australian station. In 1878, when hostilities between Russia and England appeared to be imminent, the Berry Government applied to the Admiralty for the services of a lieutenant qualified in torpedo work to take charge of the torpedo boats which the Government then purposed to obtain Some 20 candidates presented themselves for the position, from among whom Lieutenant Collins was chosen His engagement was for five years but pending the decision of the Victorian Government in regard to the torpedo boats he was attached to the gunnery ship Excellent, where he paid special attention to torpedo work He subsequently came to Australia, where he joined the Victorian Navy In 1883, when Colonel Sargood, M L C , re- organised the naval and military forces, he was selected to go to England to assist in bringing out the gunboats While in Great Britain he took the opportunity to pass a gunner) on the Excellent the Vernon, and at Woolwich He subsequently came out in the command of the gunboat Albert, and on his arrival resumed his position of executive officer of the naval forces. Last year he was promoted to the rank of commander For some time past the postal authorities have had under consideration the question of increasing the number of letter deliveries within the city At present there are four deliveries, are boundaries being as follow -On the north, the south side of Victoria street, on the south, the River Yarra, on the east, Spring street, and on the west, Spencer Street and Adderley street The earners leave the General Post office at 9 a m , then at noon, pm, and 4 15 p m Under these deliveries complaints have been made from time to time in reference to the delay which has taken place in the distribution of the mails received by the Adelaide express train, and, in fact, of the whole of the western mails of the colony. These mails arrive at the Post-office about 10 a m , and they are not sent out until the second delivery at noon Latterly the desirability of increasing the number of deliveries has been accentuated by the introduction of the Sandhurst express train After consulting with the branches of the department concerned, the Postmaster General has decided to give an extra delivery and the arrangements will, in the future, be as follows - first delivery, 8 a.m , carrying all the mails which have accumulated during the night, second delivery, flora,, including the mails from the Adelaide express, the whole of the western mails, the Sandhurst express mails, and the first clearance from the suburbs, third delivery, IS30pm, including the correspondence received by the Sydney express, the bulk of the North eastern mails, and the mails by the Sandhurst ordinary train, fourth deliver), 3p m , including the Gipps- land line mails, the North eastern line mails and the second clearance of suburban mails fifth deliver), 4 45 p.m., in cluding the Ballarat mails, the Sandhurst mails, and third clearance of suburban mails the alteration will necessitate an increase in the staff of carriers whose journeys will be shorter in point of time, but more frequent It is not improbable that the appointment of Inspector of 1 schemes will be made from the Public Service, and that a person of practical experience will be appointed in preference to one of theoretical scientific knowledge. The salary which was paid to Captain Mandeville the late occupant of the position, was 000 but it is likely that in connection with the appointment to be made the re- muneration offered will be below this sum the opinion of the Customs authorities in reference to the appointment of a I Fisheries Commission is that such a course is not necessary, inasmuch as the work which is being done by Mr Saville Kent is quite sufficient for all the purposes required. The petition presented to the Chief Secretary by residents of Corinella, Mornington, in favour of an increase in the number of grocers licenses in the place, has been found to be informal, owing to the absence of the requisite number of signatures. A second petition, praying that additional hotels might be allowed to be opened in the town ship has been rejected, on the ground that the statutory number has already been reached Dr Quick Mr Bailes, Mr Brown, and Mr Highett, M L.A.'«, accompanied by the members of the Trades and Labour Connell of Sandhurst, yesterday waited on the Secretary for Lands, and asked that the sale of the View place Government offices, Sandhurst, should be postponed from the 27th inst, for a period of three months the deputation explained that the council were anxious to acquire the property for the purposes of a Trades hall At present they had not the funds available to complete the spur claUse, but they hoped during the course of the period mentioned to arrange to obtain the necessary money They were also anxious to ascertain whether in the event of their buying the property payment could be extended over a term of years. They also asked that the property should be divided into two blocks, and sold in that way Mr Monash, in reply, said that when the local city council wished to purchase the old post-office, Sandhurst, the date of the sale was postponed on their application, and he saw no reason why a similar course should not be followed in the present instance He would obtain a report whether it was desirable that the premises should be offered in two blocks No objection presented itself to him against allowing pig) ments to be made over five or six years, and he would make a recommendation to that effect to the Minister of Lands Mr J L Thompson, principal of the Dookie Agricultural College, has forwarded to the Secretary for Agriculture four samples of stack ensilage made on the Dookie farm, together with remarks upon the processes adopted in the manufacture 1 he ensilage was composed of (1) variegated thistles, (2) peas, (J) lucerne, (1 a mixture of barley, tares, c The fodder was stacked in a succulent condition early in November, the stacking built up three times to 20ft, but it ultimately settled down until it was only 10ft high. The system of pressure employed was Johnson s patent ensilage press, which was selected by members of the Board of Agriculture at the Agricultural Society's show held in Melbourne in August last. The appliance in use on the farm provided a pressure of 100 tons, and cost £38 Cs 1 he sue of a stack. of 100 tons was 20ft, long, 17ft wide, and Hit to the cave when settled down When opening up the stack it was found that the materials were musty and worthless for a depth of 18in on the top, while there was about 6in of wash at the side With these exceptions the ensilage was of superior quality), although in Mr Thompson's opinion for the use of milch cows It could not be compared with sour ensilage (made in a silo) for the production of milk and butter Mr Thompson also draws attention to a sample of sour ensilage made from chaffed vetches, barley, Van. He writes that there was very little waste in the pit, and the result of his experiments made him confident that the pit system was the best for use in the colonies Estimating the cost of a silo at dO, formers would find that the amount of interest would be covered 10 times over by the extra yield of milk and butter from the cows fed on ensilage Mr Thompson also sent for inspection two samples of golden syrup made respectively from amber sugar cane and from um alum Mackay team, the latter of which he considers the best sample. The aroma and taste, he states, were not to be surpassed, although the colour was not quite satisfactory.

Mr. C Watson, head master of the South Geelong State School, was recently selected by the Public Service Board to fill the position of head master of the Long Gully State School, Sandhurst, but he has written to the Education Department declining the appointment.

The tram which usually leaves Wyche proof at 8.15 arm and is due at Korong Vale at 10 55, did not run as usual yesterday. It was discovered, when the engine was brought out of the shed, that, for some reason at present unexplained, it was unfit for service As there is only one engine kept at Wycheproof, the running of the last tram had to be cancelled. A letter has been received by the Archbishop of Melbourne from Dr Kirby, rector of the Irish College, Rome, in acknowledg- ment of the munificent jubilee offerings sent to the Sovereign Pontiff by the clergy and laity of the archdiocese of Melbourne, The amount (£2,000) is, we understand, by far the largest contributed by any of the Australian dioceses Dr. Kirby whiCH - Rome, January 22, 1888 -My dear Lord Archbishop am delighted to inform you that I received your offering and that of your diocese (£2,000) through the medium of a draft from a London bank on that of Plovvden in Home. On Thursday last I had the honour and consolation to lay it at the feet of the Holy Father in the name of sour grace and that of your clergy and laity of your diocese. His Holiness was greatly moved at so expressive and generous a testimonial of his devoted children of Melbourne towards himself enhanced by the circumstances of his sacerdotal jubilee), and of their inviolable attachment to the chair of St Peter, now more than ever acceptable on account of the critical circumstances in which it is placed. His Holiness was pleased to charge me to convey to your Grace the expression of his gratitude, together with his apostolic benediction for yourself, your zealous clergy, religious com minutes, and entire dock Your Grace will be glad to hear that the health of his rich ness is excellent, notwithstanding his continued occupations during the past weeks In fact addresses, congratulatory letters, audiences of innumerable bishops and other exalted personages, deputations, and pilgrim- ages from all parts of the ("lobe are constantly besieging him The enthusiasm caused by his jubilee bus, as your Grace knows, outstepped the confines of the church, and seized upon the minds and hearts of our separate brethren, including even pagan Sovereigns and peoples, such as the Grand Sultan of Constantinople, the Shah of Persia, the Emperors of China, Japan, and other non Christian nations, who seem to vie with Catholics in offering not only their congratu- lions, but also their costly presents to the head of the Catholic Church in honour of his sacerdotal jubilee. This wonderful demonstration cannot be explained on any merely human reasons, but must be referred to Ihm quifectl muabilm magna solus, and who thus decreed to move so many enemies to His sacred name to pay such sublime and public honours to His Vicar upon earth, and to His church, of which He is the head. -I remain, my dear lord, jours devotedly m Cnriet, 4 T KIUDT " A meeting of the council of the Victorian Rifle Association was held that evening at the Port Phillip Club Hotel, Colonel Disney presiding A letter was received from the secretary of the Melbourne Rifle Club asking whether orthoptic spectacles, which were in use at nile competitions in England and New South Wales, were sanctioned by the association rules A reply was directed to be sent stating that there was no rule with reference to the matter at present, but that a regulation prohibiting the use of such spectacles would be taken into consideration at the next meeting of the council Several schemes for the prevention of accidents to markers through riflemen firing at wrong targets were submitted, and referred to the committee which had been up pointed to deal with the subject The association having been practically unsuccessful in its appeal against the rating of the rifle ranges by the Williamstown Town Council, it was decided to have a case stated for the Supreme Court. The Mercantile Finance, Guarantee, and Agency Company Limited yesterday officially reported that they had arranged the sale of M'Cracken's City Brewer). The prospectus of the company formed to take it over is expected to be issued on Saturday. It is understood that the large block of city property acquired with the business will probably be offered for sale shortly Messrs. C. J and T. Ham and Munro and Baillieu yesterday effected an important sale of properties on behalf of the Melbourne Tramway Company The total sum realised was £03,824 It was arranged some months ago that a system of inter collegiate lectures should be established between Trinity and Queen's colleges, As a part of the scheme the whole of the teaching of science for both colleges was to be carried on in the biological and chemical laboratories, which were erected at Trinity College some two years ago through the liberality of Sir William Clarke The work in common of the two colleges has been already begun as regards science, and it has now been further arranged that the colleges shall also combine for the teaching of modern languages, which will be conducted by Dr. Wiechmnnn, of the University of Heidelberg, who has held for some years the post of lecturer on French and German at Trinity College It is intended also, if possible, to include several other subjects in the scheme. The Australian Eleven, who are proceed- ing to England for a cricketing tour, took their departure yesterday afternoon by the M.M.S. Oceanien, and a large number of the supporters of cricket were present on the Port Melbourne railway pier to give them a hearty send off Before the steamer hauled off the company assembled in the saloon, and "Success to the Australian 'team" was enthusiastically drunk, and as the vessel left the pier three cheers for the eleven were called for by Mr D Scott, and heartily given. The members of the eleven who were on board were-Turner, Ferris, McDonnell, Jones, and Bannerman, New South Wales, Boyle, Blackburn, Edwards, Worrall, and Trott, Victoria, and the business manager, Mr. C W, Beal Lyons and Jarvis will be picked up at Adelaide, and Bonner, who is now in England, will join the team upon their arrival A large addition will shortly be made to the existing buildings in the 'titles Office, in Queen-street, in order to provide for the very great increase which has taken place lately in the business of the office At the present time there is not nearly sufficient accommodation in the buildings for the officers and the titles and records and other documents connected with the business, and plans have been prepared of the increased accommodation which is necessary in order to carry out the work of the office satisfactorily. The new buildings will be of a rather extensive character. They will have a frontage of about 200 feet to Queen-street, and will extend from the existing buildings to the corner of Queen and Lonsdale streets. The facade will be in accordance with the original plan of the Titles Office, and similar to the portion of it already built, but the interior arrangements will be different, the great increase in the amount of work having rendered it necessary to depart from the original designs so far as interior rooms are concerned. During December, January, and February last the business transacted in the office was 30 per cent. more than it was during the previous December, January, and February, and in the last mentioned months, it was far larger than in the corresponding portions of previous years. Tenders for the new buildings are to be called for shortly, and their erection will be commenced immediately the tenders are accepted.
