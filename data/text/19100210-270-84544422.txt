WILL THEY bFeBCONCILEDP The Bt, Petersburg correspondent of the 'Times' mentions that the pros pects of a reconciliation between Aus tria and Russia must be from the basis of a declaration of , non- intervention in the Balkans and adherence to the sta tus quo. . (Ever since the action of Austria in annexing Bosnia and Henegovina, the relations of Austria-Hungary and Rus sia have been strained. Russia, as the operative instrument of the triple en tente oordiale, between Great Britain, France, and Russia, was put forward to interpose in the Balkans question. Aus tria resisted this, and when diplomatic pressure appeared to be at breaking point, Germany, as the friend and ally of Austria, played a strong hand. Rus sia was bluntly told that a pursuit of her policy would involve the mobilisa tion of the German Army on her Iron tiers. Russia reoeded from her posi tion. If she had not a war, in which all tiie leading European powers would be involved, would have broken out. In this we have the secret of why Ger many is profoundly hated in Russia. The belief in that country is that the Kaisor desires to use Austria to further the ambition he is said to entertain of one day creating a great Confederation of which he will be Emperor and dicta tor ruling manv added millions and various titular Kings).
