SCANDINAVIA AND BRITAIN. To the Editor Recorder : Sir,—1 wish to contradict some of the statements made by your Danish friend in Thursday's issue regarding the Scandinavian countries. In the first place the Garmans have done much to injure the countries named i by laying mines, etc., and thus in juring her shipping. Our friend sees I no harm in that kind of thing, but : ; when Great Britain closes the North j Sea to traffic because of these mines ; he is up in arms at once. He does I not seem to understand Scandinav^, i or he would not think that calling .in the reservists was a hostile move ment against Britain. And as far immigrants getting to Canada foi' 15/,. that-is not right, as it costs them £5. And, what is: more, our friend does not know his own mind. He distinctly , tells us-that ^8, be lieves. this calling of reserves is hos tile to Britain, and then states that he does not mean to say that these countries would like to sea Great I Britain in a hole, which proves that | his other statement is not worth much. Also it shows very bad form coming from a Scandinavian, and only tends to stir up strife and bad feeling here between- Britishers and Scandinavians, of which I am one, for I come from Sweden, and. am confident that Sweden will not take up arms asrainst Britain •I am, etc., 1 ; " ALBERT JOHNSON, k Port Pirie.
