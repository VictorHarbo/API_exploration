Gentlemen—As yen have now the power of appointing Six ' Members to the Legislative' Council, I have the honor to submit myself as a Candidate, and -to request the- favor of your support.. - ; I have resided in this "Province for nearly; thirty years,. during, seven of- which I have: served in Parliament, which I entered in 1868, pledged to " Unlock the Lands ;" the first real f- reform of the land laws,'kriown as " Strahgways Act" being based upon "the resolutions tabled by• me on 6th October,*. .1868.—Vidie "Totes arid: Proceedings." . . • Were I now to address you upon public wprKs, " taxation:,'lobal improvements, arid money votes, | I should; manifestly be iii error," for these matters can only be introduced in'the House qf • Asseriibly, arid must be carried therS before! being submitted to the Council for its'sanction. The Council'has not the power 'to iritroduce ; such .measures, or. indeed any. which' would | cause the expenditure of moriey; : but it is : clearly their duty, and indeed their obvious ' interest, to sanction all plans for the real benefit of the colony, for which the. Assembly may find the means, either by loan or taxation. ; : I consider that the Council should discard party feeling, "and should calmly -discharge -their duty to the country, irrespective of any question as to Minister or party. . Eriergy arid action are needed iri the Asr sembly, but calm judgment and political expe rience are wanted in the Council, where the subjects of Federation, Legislation, and Consti tution ought to be thorofl gJ ily considered. In considering- the pr si ibility of rendering our Constitution more pei feet,: a question , has ariseii as to'the best meai is of guarding. against or remedying any possibl ? deadlock "between the two Chambers, and i t seems to me that in the event of any dissolrti m of the Assembly consequent upon such dea l ock it might be well that a proportion • of the ( c mcil—say' one-third —should also retire for re-election, thus giving" to each Chamber a direct interest in avoiding any serious difference; but in the more usual case of a dissolution arising from the inabi city of the Miriistry to: guide the House of As sembly, it is obvious that the Council has no interest whatever in the matter. The best remedy may af*er all be fonrid in a careful selection of men who would look upon a deadlock as a national calamity, and would do their utiuost to prevent it. The federation of the colonies is highly to he desired, hut weiriusthe careful that our Pro vince is not thereby placed in a position preju dicial to its interests. I shall attend with pleasure at any Metro politan meeting which may he convened by the Electors. And have the honor to he, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, 60o93zx62-90 H. KENT HUGHES. T;0 THE ELECTORS OE EAST TORRENS. Gentlemen—In response to the call of your large and influential deputation, I beg to offer myself as a Candidate to represent you in the House of Assembly. I shall avail myself of an early opportunity to meet you at the different centres of the dis trict, to enable you to ascertain my opinions re garding the various matters likely to engage the attention of Parliament during the approaching session. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, 62zcx62c DAVID JUTRRAY. TO THE ELECTORS OE THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen—I wish specially to direct yovr attention to my opinions on the following six : points:— Legislative Council Reform.—I think that whenever any penal dissolution of the House of Assembly takes place, one-third of the.members of .the Legislative Council should retire in order that you may give your opinion on i the ques tion which has caused; such dissolution. . This would render the Legislative. Council; more ra-. sponsible to you, and prevent any deadlock between the two Houses. ; Land Laws.—Having been a consistent land reformer ever since the question first arose, I congratulate the farmers of this colon; on their success, in breaking up. the monopoly;. which formerly existed in land. I shall be happy to advocate any amendment of the law,'shown to be required, especially the reduction of the • price of scrub laiid to a nominal sum to those willing to clear and.cultivate. Mining Laws.—I advocate a peppercorn rent for unproductive mineral lands, with conditions enforcing the employment of labor, in order to prevent monopolies, and a Royalty or percentage on dividends. Taxation and Free Trade.—If it can be shown, as asserted by some, that no further taxation is required I shall be most happy to be convinced, as nothing but absolute necessity justifies the imposition of taxes; but if further taxation is required it should fall on the wealthy classes, who have hitherto never paid their fair share of the expenses of the Govern ment of this colony. Every one should :con ; tribute according to his means, whether such means are derived from shares, lands, mines, sheep, or any other description of property. That " large and important class, the men of no property," who ; have ' hitherto through- the Custom-House paid more than their fair share of taxation^ should be relieved:by the intreduc tion-of Free Trade, has been done, in England. ; Immigration should be carefully conducted,; ahd stopped by-telegraph as soon as the first symptoms of bad times or scarcity of. employ ment manifest themselves.; - ! ■ : 'J , Law Reform.—I am and always have been an ardent admirer of the Real Property: Act and all other endeavors to simplify and cheapen the law of the land and the procedure of the Courts. I advocate the adaptation of the Local Court procedure'to the Supreme Court. : • I remain, i , Your obedient servant, T8zcx83c R. C R AKER. , JgAST TORRENS .ELECTION, Mr. MURRAY'S.

YILLENEU YE SMITH, , TO THE ELECTORS OF THE COLONY. six plain; reasons why we : SHOULD EACH GIVE ONE VOTE TO MR. JOHN CROZIER FOR THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL.. -1; Because: although a' New [South [Wales colonist,.',he has made South Austraiia£hisQ home, and has- thoroughly identified himself ! in every .way with,our colony. ; 2\. Because-^no Absentee, he has freely in vested his capital in South Australian] trade. 3\. Because he has been a spirited and liberal supporter of mining in South Australia; 4\. Because we are all anxious to secure the c •, Iiiverina trade, and . the pre-eminence of South -Australia as an Australian colony mainly de- [ pends upon our getting it. In the. River Murray Nature meant we should have it. Mr. [ Crozier has for many years brought the whole of his New South Wales and Biverina produce to South Australian Ports, and has taken his supplied from us, dealing with South Australia alone. . The example of one man like Mr.,Crozier is worth the advocacy of a hundred others. ; No one has done so much as Mr. Crozier to secure to us the trade with Biverina, by showing that it can be best done. here. We can only get it by. New. South Wales and Victorian tradesmen and squatters following his example. \- 5. Because he is a man with a thorough: practical knowledge of What is required to develop the cornitry, a hard-headed Scotchman, . who has raised himself to his present honorable | position,' and whose advice is worth -having, for he really understands what he is talking^ about. Unlike many, when he does hot thoroughly " understand, he holds his tongue and listens. 6\. Because he has served us well in the past. He was an independent but .consistent ]sup-, porter of the Morgan and Boucaut Government. He yielded his own opinion on subsidiary matters, so as not to endanger or delay the execution of a great policy which the country : approved. He is no obstructive. . A severe domestic affliction and consequent illness have compelled Mr. Crozier at this time to seek a short change. No one can blame or resent his absence; it was unavoidable, ■ and I trust his canvas will not suffer from this Do not forget him therefore, but give ONE VOTE TO MR. JOHN CROZIER. 72zcx76c AN ELECTOR.
