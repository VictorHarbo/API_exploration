A Natural Remedy Time was when disease was thought to be due to the direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic were invoked to cast it out. Science bas taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist still. We call them "Disease Germs," and they also must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with its aches and pains, is the result, EIMO'S FRUIT SALT is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs. Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines, rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates the whole digestive tract. It may be safely taken at any time by young- or old. It is very effective in the early stage of Diarrhoa by removing the irritating" cause. Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a bottle in the house. Prepared only by J. C. ENO, Ltd., " Frnh Salt *- Works, London, England. SOLD BT CHEMISTS AND STORES EVERYWHERE.
