MONETARY & COMMERCIAL! Friday evening. "The general condition of affairs in Canada, according to latest mail advices, continue to look rosy. Reports from the north-west (says the "London Stock Market Report," of August 30) state "that the bountiful harvest is being successfully gathered in, and the result will be to give yet another fillip to Canadian industries of all kind. Manitoba, British Columbia, and the north-west territories, are rapidly in creasing their population. A great influx of immigrants from the United States and from overseas is reported, and the land fronts on the lines of railway are rapidly being applied for. Another splendid harvest will put more money into the secrets of the farmers and general population, and increase their consumption, which means further stimulating Canadian industries. The iron and steel trades of the Dominion continue to boom' Under present conditions Canadian securities, despite occasional set-backs, will keep on the up-grade, and are well worth the attention of investors, whether to hold for their return as permanent investments, or to hell on a rise of price." The last mail advices, did not disclose anything specially new in connection with -, the London butter trade. Messrs. Weddel and Co., in their colonial dairy produce , report, dated September 5, made the fol * lowing reference to the market -"The de demand for Canadian butter is somewhat checked by the lower prices at which in a fervor butters are offered, and which re- railing at a shilling a pound, bring the re 'JJ trailers a greater profit than Canadian. It is true the consumer gets an inferior but 'a ter, but that is his fault for not being will ^ ing to pay more than a shilling.

'Sugars, are going out freely, and with the approach of warmer weather there should upon be an increase in the output Teas "" remain dull, and only moderate lines are advised as moving off.
