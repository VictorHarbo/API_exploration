The yields of gold had boon uniformly large; the worst timo. of tho year had passed leaving storekeepers unembar rassed, merchants full of confidence, and stocks bo reduced as to induce speculative purchases. It impresses ou merchnnts the desirability of im porting all their supplies direct from Europo, so that they may bo enabled to send all their gold thither direct,'- and so increase the colony's attractions to emigrants. It congrntuintce them on increased banking facilities m affording a proof of the wealth pro ducing character of Otago. and because of tlio greater probability of an open money market. It trusts that when tho city Is well supplied with water, tho ratea of insurance will be reduced considerably. .It cites the age ot latest dates from Melbourne (twenty-four days) as a proof of tho inadequacy of their steam communication with Australia, and instances as assurance of tbo success of au Otago Steamship Company that tho Now Zoslaud Steam Navigation Company, originated in Wellington, showed at its first half- yearly meeting a net profit of L2810 0s lid. Tho total export of gold since its discovery is sot down at Ll!055,654 139 ; tha gold in the treasury at L21,412, nnd in the banks L21,000: Spirits iu bulk wero in good supply, and caaod were dull of sale. The Bupply of ale and porter in bulk was in excess of tits demand; bottled brought fair rates. Stocks of sugar were lteavy. Stocks of flour were fully equal to the domaml. Horscfeed was in request ; colonial oats at 7s Od. Bacon and hams had advanced in value. Butter was iu heavy supply. There wa little inquiry for candles. Cheese was in. excess of demand. The trada was fully stockod witli oilmen's stores. Cattle had fetched good prices, as had horses, (specially good hacks nnd psckliorses.
