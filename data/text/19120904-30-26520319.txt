Dannebrog has been oper ated for nine or ten years in Mel bourne, where this infallible rem edy is very popular among ladies in Society, on the Stage, in the pro fessions, and in business. Dannebrog neither scars nor burns the skin, but leaves it velvety, and restores youth to the face by banishing worry and the shame caused by bristly hairs. The Dannebrog In stitute is daintily furnished, and ladies are relieved of annoying de fects while resting amid cheerful surroundings. Country clients are treated by post, and every care is taken, the instructions being clear and very easy to understand. The most stubborn growths of hair yield to the Dannebrog treatment, butl ladies' should not allow even soft hairs to remain, for these may be come bristles. Consultations are free at the Dannebrog Institute, and full particulars will be sent to country clients on application. Remember that only one fee is charged, and that Dannebrog has already bene fited an army of women, who are now singing its praises. DANNEBROG CURES SUPERFLU6US HAIRS. A BLESSING TO WOMANKIND.
