Smith vacated. The wisdom of- such -a policy immediately strikes -ono . on meeting . Mr; Smith. ..This officer carries , in his , -mind . the minutest details o£ the great organisation- frbm' end to end. Mr. Smith is still- comparatively :a- young man, .and he stands himself for-suoqessful Canadian immigration, -as ho is by birth -a Britisher who achieved success as: a -Canadian farmer; Therefore bo can speak as tho: emi grant and as the Immigrant, as" tha:sclcctor,/.as the prosperous farmer, as the reooiver -of ithe . Immigrant, and- as tho recruiting- officer of the \- emigrant. I-Ie overflows with a zeal anil- a love for his work which- is dangerous in its infec tiousness. - . Canada's emigration forces- are: to.'.bo .-found ' everywhere in this -country. , The: Dominion/has'' written her name in c very village;-! f noLin every home; in Great Britain. In : addition/, tb the head office staff in. London,- there are -.10 other Canadian Government offices In- tho United' Kingdom, at which public service men arc' per-' manently employed. The whole of Great Britain . is divided into districts;- and eaeli group of dls- trlcts is controlled by one of .. those Yp lolficoys. All goes; by system, i Then there -Is -the great- army of' recruiting commission- agents; .whovget- -- £l a head each emigrant; but as the cost /of each,' ono .to' the Dominion is estimated 'at/only il'or a little more, it follows that very large numbers are picked up by the Government direct, or that they )>rbceetl' voluntarily; ' . , v' ' : .-. . J; RECEIVING THE STRANGER! : And the systein'on' this side Is not less-far- reaching and complete than that in CanadaXone gets glimpses of- it -talking ;to .'Mr. Obed Smlth. "We don't assist vin the passages at all," 'ho says. "Our; immigrants pay " their own fares-1 about £11 by sea and rail. ' But we don't botlier particularly whether Lhey havc money - on ar- rlval. While we do. ."not guarantee work, . \so. keep the men at Winnipeg and at other receiv ing halls until they get ' it. :i have1 hiid 2000 immigrants living under . the Government roofs at one time." The Canadian Government /main tains a score or more of these great- halls, and in times of- great pressure, supplements them with tonts. Mr.. Smith's -last year's report ; us Commissioner of Immigration. contains the/fol lowing, which is a striking instance of the'eiaii- ticity of this immigration. machine: — "The class of persons rocblviug accbmmoiiatlon has been in every respect desirable, and they flnd. tho free aecommodatlon of material 'assistance.: in making' their arfangements. ' This Van'- be:' best understood, when, it is remember, ed thit't a Vqfy - largo proportion .o these .arriving from, the pid- country have oxhausted tlie greater portion of their ' means in paying the transportation charges for. such a long distance, and if men with families .ivore obliged to. pay for hotel ac commodation at western rates, it would entail hardship that many of them could not stanil. The regqla.tlons 01 the department permit sevii'n . free days' accommodation, but this office has steadily pursued the policy of getting- the peo ple out to work, or on to the land immediately, so that a large ''proportion of them" do not "re main more than, one.. dny;, while in other cases where, unfortunately, . sicknis or /other tempo rary disability has. overtaken; a. family, i have not hesitated tb care for them and permit thein the use of the building for such period as might appear to bq advisabie,- or necessary; in order to enable tlieih to make a fair start. I have given the same Instructions to outside age:it3 ' -,u charge of buildings, and -to this general -pol icy of protection and assistance for tho new comer may, to a large extent, bo attributed tho lack - of complaint connected with the work of handling so many thousands of people." Frqiu tne centres at. which our buildings are situated' our agents have been able to afford .assistance In any difficulty which may have; arisen' during the past winter, or at any other time, anil ' I cannot too strongly recommend tho c'ontinuance ot the policy which enables us to have sufficient offices reasonably near the new settlements 'to afford protection for the neiv 'arrivals;"' NO -TWO EMIGRANTS ARE ALIKE; In short, there is no rod/tapo about . Canada's methods. Not long ago a member ot tho British Cabinet congratulated a Canadian emigration cfficer on' tho 1 wonderful success ot the 'Do minion's campaign. "Of course," he remarked, "you have the land to bltor them, but" wlthbui doubt you owe most ot your success to the taqt that you have broken away altogether from ibr. ordinary Government methods of business.. This department o£ yours is not like a Government department at all. You have made departures . to meet each fresb necessity." And that surns up tho situation. "Wo have ulways recognised," said Mr. Obcd Smith to me this week, "that, we were dealing ivith human beings. No two emi grants are 'alike. No two can be '"fiiin'dlcd ' lie iUc samo manner. ' Each wants slightly different treatment to tho other. We try to size a man up, and treat him, not according to hldc- boun-.i Government routine, but according to his own peculiar per&onailty.;" Which means that Can ada- has picked strong,, capable, resourceful men £cr this big national- job, and has ' given lliein lots of license. She laid down a broad, states manlike policy, voted heaps of money, &nd; left the work to fresh, enthusiastic minds. From the jump the campaign lias been markod by hustle and originality— by the effort .ofhigh quality brains. The grooved Government ser vant is not worth his salL at this ciaES of work. If you want to shake, up a community as settlor an this British community, you must givo tne job to v-ofy live men, and open up the Treasury to thom. Of all expenditures of public .money this looks the best. It is not possible to refer here to Canada's many schemes for imprcssiug the European, but mention may be made of the importation of „a considerable number ot suc cessful Canadian farmers who went through Great Britain; and talked to farmers and farm laborers in their own language about the' agri culture possibilities of the Dominion.- - CLASSES AND ORIGIN.

These Europeans take lo. the prairie like "poddies" to new milk. Tho ratio of women and children to the men. varies' con siderably with tho different countries of origin. For instance, of the 22,819 English who arrived nt Canadian ocean ports in the period slated 9470 were women and 8867 children; while Of lito . : 4480 Italians' arriving at ocean porta there verb only 3S4 women and. 800 phildren.
