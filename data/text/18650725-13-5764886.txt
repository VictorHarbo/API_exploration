NOTES OF'TEE' MONTH. : ' ; (CONTINUED FROH'THE SUPPLEMENT.) . ?: i. AGRICULTURE. The farmers have been able to get in their wheat under favourable circumstances as re- gards the condition of the land, but tho want of rain in the first instance, and latterly the coldness of the nights and of the weather generally, have kept the young plants baok I very much, and at present there is a prospect of the season being a late one So much frost, and even snow, in the higher tracts of coun- try have not been experienced for yoars, so that, no sooner did the rains give the grass and young wheat a start, than these were checked by the cold. However, this may not continue long ; and, when tho warmth does come here, the growth íb exceedingly rapid, and backward crops quickly recover their lost ground, so it is entirely too Boon to say whether the delay in getting the seed in, ond the present backwardness of the crops, will be followed by a very late harvest or not. As a mild winter is often followed by a cold spring, so the present rather Bharp winter may be the precursor of a mild spring, daring which the lost time moy be regained ; and it Is to ha hoped that such muy be the case, for the I breadth of land sown with wheat is much gunter than it lins been for some years pa-,t, and the farmers need encouragement in groin-growing. Prices are still comparatively high here, both for breadstuffa and horse corn, and are likely to remain so for a whilo. Vegetables are tolerably abundant and cheaper again, but good meat is both scarce and dear, owing to the great scarcity of feed in this colony and South Australia. New South Wales is botter off in this respect, and prices are so much lower there that it is found highly profitable to slaughter fat beasts at Sydney and send the carcases lound by water. The same thing is done from here to Adelaide, the scarcity of good meat being even greater there than with us Ia ordinary seasons, the deficiency of one colony is made good with fat stock sent overland from another, but this year the absolute want of feed along the roads renders it impossible for stock fat at starting to reach market in much better than store condition. Meat is also sent down by rail from Echuca, and a rather largo trade must ultimately be done wah that place in this way, for the loss of weight in cattle ccming to Melbourne from the other side of the Murray must be considerably more than would pay the cost of carriago. Accounts of the lambing in different parts of the country aro very contradictory, the psr contage being good on the few stations where the ewes have feed, and very small indued elsewhere-this latt word embracing an ex- tent of country ou which about three-fourths of the flocks are kept. Very many of the ewes have died, as well as the lambs, and it is much to bo feared that the clip of wool will bo unusually light, after the sheop having been kept on short commons for at least half the year. Ploughing matches are not quito overyet, Geelong having a Grand Champion Match for the residents within the county of Grant fixed for this week ; but the first of the spring shows of stock will be held in a few days, and there will not be a week of tho next three months without one or more of theso meetings, so numerous are the agricultural and pastoral societies now becoming. The Ballarat Socioty, determined to take the lead in c\ery way if it can, has added the second word lo its title, and, as a proof of being iu earnest, offers prizes amounting to £247 in. thodiffeient classes for sheep. The Skipton Scciety, having its head-quarters a little to the west of Ballarat, and including amongst its members a large proportion of our most enterpiising breeders of merinoes, was the first of the up country societies to get up a really good show of sheop, which was followed by the annual saIoS of young rams bred in the district, and the Ballarat salesmen wish to transfer this part of the business to their town-hence tho liberality. But good collections of merinoes aro now to be seen at nearly all the shows in pastoral districts, and the farmers are taking more interest each year in the coarse woolled varieties, so that sheep have at length be- come an important feature at nearly all tho shows, both agricultural and pastoral. After a lapBO of one year, the next intercolonial show of merinoes is to ho held in Tasmania, and there will, wo believe, be representatives from nearly all our best flocks sent over to compete for the prizes and honours of championship. New Suuth Wales sheep, breeders have not condescended, as yet, to enter for any of these, except by sending a sample or two of wool, and it is a pity that sheep ennnot be brought together from all the colonies, so that a fair estimate might be formed of the relative merits of thote bred in each. In order to throw soma light on the disputed point as to whether the agricultural and the pastoral produce was of the most value in this colony, a return of figures likely to Bet the question at rest was atked for in the Legislative Council two or three months ago, and has since been laid on the table and published. This shows that the number of acres occupied by farmers in 1S64 was 2,097,981, and by squatters, 81,083,306. The value of the agricul- tural produce raised in that year was £8,076,250, and of the produce raised by the squatter;", £3,316,793. Thus the farmers raised a greater amount of producá than the squatters, and from less than a tenth part of the land, the year having also been a most unfavourable one for them, as tho yield of wheat was le°s than half what it usually is, owing to the fuiluro of the crops. The total number of persons engaged in agricultural pursuits, both male and female, was 41,218, and in pnstorol pursuits, 9,724. The value of machinery UEed by the farmers, including one steam plough, one steam engine used for ¡irigation, reaping and thrashing machines, &c.; was calculated to be about £129,960, while the number of men in attendance on these machines was almost equal to the number employed by the squatters for all purposes. Unsatisfactory as is the condition of the agricultural Interest in this colony compared with what it ought to be, these figures prove beyond a doubt that the value of the produce raised is very much greater than that contributed towards the wealth of the community by the more pros- perous stockownors, and to the former ought by rights to bo added £1,186,716, the declared value of tho flour, wheat, barley, oats, and maize imported, to make good the quantities of theso things required for consumption within the one year. THE VINTAGE. Wine-making in Victoria is yet in its in- fancy. Our population has been bo absorbed hy the amor auri that it has not found time to imitate the example of South Australia and New South Wales, where the settlors now produce more wine than their own market can consume. Still, the Victorian vintage is j ear by year becoming of more importance to the colony. We havo now our largo vine- yards, Buch as those of Tabilk and Yering ; we have flourishing and increasing settle- ments of vignorons lu the neighbourhood of Geelong, Castlemaine, and Sandhurst ; while about Melbourne, merchants, doctors, lawyers, and tradesmen, havo entered upon tbe work con amore, and aro rapidly becoming versed in the mysteries of vine-planting and wine m ii ki tig. Large arcas have been and are being planted, and every year now now vine- yards will be coming into bearing. From re- cently-published statistics wo learn that the total number of vines in tho oolony is now 8,150,000, of which 1,250,000 were planted during the preceding twelve months. Ab regards the 18G5 vintage, it would ap- pear that throughout the colony tho yield of wine will be short as to quantitj- that is, in proportion to the increased area planted and Euptrior as to quality. Tho deficiency is mainly attributable to tho cold southerly gales, accompanied with luilstormB, which prevailed during the flowering season, whereby many vineyards, especially thoso which were exposed in situation and in which the plants were young, suffered severely. The floods and cold of the 1801 season had weakened the vines materially, so that thoy wore the less able to resist this additional trial, and were in many instances checked from fruiting. Fol- lowing the long winter came a well-nigh unprecedented drought, whicb, though it pre- vented some crops from attaining their full size, was the making of the vintage, for in the production of fine wines a dry season is of course a sine gua non. Throughout the actual vintage time, also, the weather was m obt favourable. Under these circumstances, it Is not surprising that good accounts as to tho quality of the wine bave been received sfrom almost every district. Geelong and Sandhurst producers unite in assorting that the liquors will be exceptionally strong in body and fine iu bouquet, and it is only about Melbourne Itself that expressions of,doubt aro beard. It is expected, in point of fact, that ,the Australian vintage of 1805 will take the ii' 'J rank in after years of a continental 1832. The old belief in tbo virtues of a " comet year" is euro to acquire additional confirmation by tho experi« nee of tliiJ. About Melbourue, the peculiarities of the season have occasioned singular discrepancies in the yield. Many of the vignerons will not obtain better results as to quantity than they did last year, though their groj ids have been increased, and tho bearing power of their vines has become matured. On the other hand, with sholtotcd grounds and old vines, the quantity wob equal to the quality. In some instances, returns of 500 gallons to the acre were obtained, aud in others a total failure occurred. At Geelong, matters appeau ¡¡to be somewhat better than they aro about Melbourne, though even there less wine has been made in pro fiortion to the area planted than was the caso n 1803. Trom Yering and Tabilk the returns are most satisfactory. At the former, where thirty acres are now in bearing, some 10,000 gallons were obtained ; and at the latter, where 160 acres are coming into bearing, the yield rose from 9,000 gallons in 1863 to 22,000 gallons in 1865. It is understood that the falling off in tho Sandhurst and Castlemaine districts is but slight, while the wine, as ia other instances, is spoken of as extraordi- narily strong and fine.- Hence, locking nt the great bucccbb of the Tabilk aud Yering vineiies-a success which outweighs scores of private failures-it appears probable that the total yield for the colony will not bo behind- hand, if it does not exceed, that of last year, which is estimated at 105,000 gallons. MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRICES CURRENT. Tho import markets «luring the period under re- view havo boon favourably influencod by foreign adilcos recch ed in tho curly part of tho month. Tho 'April mails, recch rd by tho Salsotto, with advices from China, India, and America, firmed all pro- duce imported from thoso countries, nhilo tbo con- firmation of the news by tho succeeding mall, the arrival of which was telographed on tho nth, tho Jeddo > nrrh Ing in tho bay on Saturday forenoon, tho 15th, added strength to tho market. Since thon a consider- able biuliiess has bcondono ; tho trade demand has con- tinued satisfactory, and speculators havo likewise operated to a. fair extent. Bull: beers evidence a weale market. Corusacks and woolpacks havo also declined. Candles have continued steady. A reduction has been submitted to in cement. An extensivo purchase of plantation coffee, In the commencement of the month, advanced the price of this stnplo. Currants at one period showed great activity, but are now dull.

Ale and Stout.-Influencod by tbo oxtrotnely heavy shipments advised in April and Moy-though the ch cunistenco has been accounted for by the f. c\poiters were pressing on their shlpmonts, appro heinlTO that nu anticipated hot season might interfere with their future operations, and that In tho aggre- gate tho shipments for the soason would not exceed thoso of previous ones-tho tone of tho market has not bcon so firm. A decline has been submitted to on all brands, though not to such an extent as it is clear it will ultimately load to. Sales of every description havo, in most cases, been limited to" tho mero supply of trade vants. Mar rlsn's' has been placed at £7 17s. Od. down to £7 15s. The Carlisle Company's Is offering at £7 16s. ; and to place quantities a conccsiion on this figure would bo granted.

Allsopp's has this season como very little undor our notice ; wo quote £710s. as fair value for the brand. Proportionately, Joule's has not gonodown somuch as the others ; latest trade sales elTected having bcon at £8 7s. (k1. Dawson,'« can bo had at £0 10s. ; but we hear of few sales.

Coffee. - The only feature worthy of special notice in this staple is the speculative purchase, early in the month, of the whole of the plantation in the market, comprises the balances of the Jeannie Oswald, F. Martin, Stanley, and Eliza Blanche cargoes, amounting to 140 tons, which changed hands in a line, at about lOd. to 10Jd. ; up till this period prices rulod at 10Jd. tolOJd., but immediately afterwards enhanced rates wero required, and since tho price has boon established at lljd. to H3d., at which it now stands.

Supplies from South Australia have been on too moderato aséale to lead to anything beyond a retail business to meet trade 'requirements, 'save In exceptional cases, when the market was stimulated to greater activity by the arrival of shipments from foreign ports. "'All the three, or four ojrgoos which dropped in from South America, were promptly taken up and absorbed by the trade at very full rates. Tho total advance on flour cannot bo reckoned moro thin 10«., and on wheat, Cd. per bushel ; tho latter all along keeping dearer In proportion than the price of, flour. On the 2Uih ultimo the- Pot, from TomC, 4th April, armed, and her cargo, amounting to 12,000, bushels, w as next day placed atSs, 0d.net. During tbo Meei: ending 3rd instant, Adelaide wheat at tho prlco wanted, Os. Gd., met with little attention from, town bujers, bnttlio country dealers showed every' desire to purchase Adelaide flour. Town brands wero In slow sale nt £21 10s., and country brands at £21 the following week. Besides tho ordinary trade de- mand for flour, pureliases of Adelaldo country brands were made to the extent of 150 tons, but tho spécula- tion did not then go further. At the close of tho samo week, how oi or, on receipt or telegram advising the arrival at Auckland ot the Francos Henty, Waver- ley, and Ann Matilda, with about 1,200 tons bread stuffs, and reporting an advance to £12 In Valparaiso, a speculative purchase of 250 tons, Bart's flour, at ¿2110s., was made.

Malt.-The unlimited amount of shipments ad- vised of thin article has created tbo utmost depression in the market, and for trade lots as low as 7s.

This week, howover, there lui been moro general inquiry and better prices have been realised ; some 5,000 bushola w ero placed at 7s.

Metals.-Pip; Iron, after touching £0, declined to £6 10s., from which, howover, it still Inclines to recodo, buy ers refusing to giro over £5 Gs. Scotch corrugated iron bos been in fair rtquest ; early in the month, fifty tons, ox Bruce, were placed at equal to £25 6s. for 24, and £27 53. for 20 guage ; 28 gauge Is worth £28 5s. ; transactions have not been numerous. English brands aro weaker ; for Hamilton's, Smith's, Davls's, &a;, wo quote £j0 10s. for 20 gauge ; 24 gaugo realised £28 10s. for twenty tons.

American nails bring 10s. and 21s. Od., according to assortments. Oils.-Kerosene last month closed with rather an unsettled aspect, but after the delivery of the April malls, notwithstanding the quantity advised on the way was equal to 14,000 cases, while 23,000 cases had accumulated in store, the market became steadier, and in trade lots some 2,500 cases were placed at 3s. 8d. to 3s. 9d. for best brands, and 3s. 6d. for outsiders. The follow big week there was more of a speculative Inquiry perceptible-upwards of 3,000 cases changing hands at equal to 3s. 8d. to 3s. 8½d. ; the week after, the trade still refrained from purchasing, the only sale reported being 1,000 cases Cozzens's to arrive ex Moggie Leslie, at 3s 8d. Last week a speculative purchase of about 4,000 acses at 3s. 7d., or thereabouts, was made, and a few trade lots were placed at 3s. 8d. to 3s 8½d. for Cozzens's ; while for Oriental, 3s. 6d. was realised.

Tobacco.-But a moderate trade has been done in this staple ; there havo been no speculative purchases ; ' tho trade demand has not been li' avy, while the quan- tity sold ot auction has beau comparatively trifling. Advices by the null last arrived havo been of a favourable tenor, and such as to induco holders of good samples to demand higher rates, In some in- stances an advance has boen obtained, but as the buyers exorci-o great caution, we have to report tho month, taken altogether, as a quiet one. The news brought by tho April mail, though of an exciting naturo, did not lead to anything, ns. in the absence of information regarding the probable stocks in Kich mond or Petersburg, dealers eilocol no dosiro to operate. By the last mail, however, tho Information on this point wai more definite ; nevertheless no great Improvement has as yet resulted therefrom. In the commencement of the month some 300 boxes Bu- chanan tens wero placed on privato tonns. At auction, on 27th ult., 200 cases half- pounds brought Od. to 0{jd. ; while 82 packages twist, tens and half-pounds, out of condition, realised only middling prices. 42 half-tierccs twist wero sold, as per sample, at from Is. OJd. to Is. lljd. ; tho faulty portion, at same timo, biought Ggd. to Is. 2|d. A few half-tlcrcoa, sold as faulty at Is. OJd. lo Is. 10i¡d., comprised tho bulk of tho following week's sales. Privately, half-pounds and tens wero placed at 13d. to lfld., and GO boxes inferior at less money. This week, 160 boxes tons realised lSd.,-an advanco on rates ruling prior to re- ceipt of late advices, At auction, 138 packagos damaged brought 6Jd. to lOld. for tens, 0JJ. to Sid. for half pounds, and 5}d. to lljd. for twist. The trifling quantity disposed of to trade purchasers realised Od. to 12d. for Northern twist and halvos ; 13d. to 18d. for Western. Southern twist in sound condition com- mands 2s. to 2s, Gd. in round lots ; for Western, valued at 13d. to lCd , thoro is little demand. For colonial tobacco an Increasing consumption is experienced, and for good carefully made up tons a ready sale is ob- tained, at prices ranging from 2s. 3d. to 2s. Od. Alanilla cigars are offering freoly at 56s. ; choroots realise 00s. to 01s. ; Schearer and Co. 's Swiss cigars bl lng 80s.'to. 35s., and Onnond's 40s. to 42s. Gd. Tea.-Mo«srs. J. C. Robertson and Co. report ofthls staple :-" During tho month a rather better demand has existed, and laleB, although not of any magnitude, have been numerous, and fully sustaining^ previous quotations. Tho tailff has been advanced ono stage further, having tom amalgamated with tho Appro- priation Bill, and sent up to the Council.

Tho reduction of the duty in England to Gd. per lb, and tho high ratos at which teas havo opened in China, have tended to glvo holders confi- dence, and stocks aro hold with great firmness.

Auction Sales.-A fow sales have tskon placo during tho month at prices lather under quotations ; but as they havo been piiucioally odd lots belonging to insolvent estates, and sold without reserve, the prices realised cannot he taken as offoctlnr the market, .

Tho markot continues to bo glutted, and the demand having to tomo extent fallen off, high prices, oveu for prime samples, aro not easily obtained. Of busi- ness in this market Messrs. Butlkr and Moss report : -" The supply was moro than sufficient durlugtlio early part of the week, and sales wero difficult to ef- fect at former quo ations.

Mr. William Fentox reports also, as under : " Tho supply, although light, Is abundant for tho de- mand, and prices aro not as firm, even for a first class article :-Best, £8 to £0 ; second, £6 10s. to £7 Es. ; straw, £4 to £4 15a."

WOOL, TALLOW, HIDES, &3. Messrs. R. GOLDSDliouotr and Co. furnish the sub- joined report:-"Wool.-Our English advices per Jcddo are to tho 20th of May, mid we have received files of catalogues of the May series of sales up to that date. Hie enormous oggrcgato of 107,077 balos was ontered for thcsosale», the wholo of which, with the exception of about 20,000 hales, were from the Aus- tralian colonies and New Zealand. Port Phillip woola especially were In unprccedeiitedly large supply, and comprised nearly one-half the entire quantity. Price? opened moro firmly than was at one timo antici- pated, and, stimulated by several favourable circumstances, bujers were purchasing freely. Manufacturing operations In tho North wero biginniiig to evince signs of Increased activity, whilBt tho almost certainty of a speedy renewal of tho American trado, conjoined with fino weather and an easier money market, had a tendency to cauio a higher range of quotations. These encouraging lu , Audioes were, however, to a gre-it extent counteraeted by such a largo quantity pressing forward for salo.and the fact of nn average declino of about Id. per pou I on February and March rates having- been established iwlll not occasion surprise ; indeed, under tho circuffl i stances it was to bo looked for. Wo find, on reference i to the catalogues and reports, tint half-bred sorts 'have not sold at such high ratos as In the pre- vious series, and this is in n groat measure to bo attributed to the heavy decline in English wools. On the oilier hand, lambs'-wool has secured moro than its usual share of competition, and rea- lised within a shade of the value of floeco, with fair prospects of a maintenance of this advance. Sheepskins.-Tliero Is a good demand, and late rates ' aro fully supported. Hides.-Our English advices 'continue to hold out gloomy prospects for tho Aus- tralian trado In this export. Stocks aro heavy, anl nosjniptoms of Improvod rates. In this market we lia\ e effected sales at from 8s. to flj. Od. each. Tallow. -There is no chango in tho demand, and prices aro well supported in consequence of the limited supplr. We quoto :-Beef, £27 to £30 ; mixed, £30 to £33; and mutton, £83 to £85 per ton. Stations.-Whilst the present excitcmint about tho agricultural arois continues there is not likely to he much biqulry for station properties in Victoria, but for those In New South Wales there Is an active demand, and very full rates are obtainublo." Messrs. J. H. Clough and Co. furnish the following monthly report :-" Wool.-During the month thoro liav o been two small finies by auction, which cannot, however, bo regarded as having In any degree tested this market, as they were only catalogues of sonio odd bales, tbo remainder of larger clips that have already beon disposed of. It is Impossible from these sales to furnish e\cn nu approximate idea of tito prices actually ruling here. Tho few lots, however, that havo been placed havo changed hands at figures satisfactory to owners. It is generally anticipated that the coming clip will no*, bo up to tlio usual high standard of Port Phillip wools. Tho lack of rain in the earlier months of the,seaton, and the late Unusually severe and unfavourable weather, havo not only destroyed aniiumonse number of the lambs, but will also, we fear, prejudicially affect the length and strength of tho staple. During tho past few days wo have had a rather fjYourablo chango ia tho weather, but even tills, should It continue, will not go far to remedy tho evil already worked. Tho account solos on the London market that have reached us by tbo last mall havo caused great disappoint- ment to the producers In this country. The following have been the ships whicb havo cleared during the» month :-Es'cx(lst July), 424 bales; William Duthie (18th July), 800 bales ; Lincolnshire (July 22), 321 bales; total, 1,011 bales ; to which add previous ship- ments 130,641 bales, which makes a grand total to date of 132,161 bales.

Tallow. - Wo ? havo no transactions of any importance to report In . this market, and prices remain without alteration. Muttoa is worth from £37 10s.

Hides.-Tho William Duthie has cleared with the only shipment of hides this month-viz, 8.057 hides, and 652 calf-skins. Stations.-Good stations readily find purchasers. We have to note the . sale, since our last report, of tho Cow Station, in tho Swan Hill district/with 3,000 sheep, for £0,250, oit short terms. Wo aro now in treaty for the salo of two or tbrce other good properties." Messrs. B. GOMwmtouoii »nd Co. roport as follows: -" Wool.-So far as regards transactions in wool, our report is but n ropotltlon of that of last month, for, as Is usually the caso at this season of tho year, thoro li scarcely any buslne's, doing.

Tho per-centago of increase will bo far below au average, aud It Is certain that such au uri .favourable season has not bo n experienced In to.» colony for years past, Advices received by last m»U from England, reporting on tho May series of sato In Loudon, confirm, the gloomy anticipations of our ' buyers concomlng a considerable' portion of their last season's purchases. Inforlor ' descrip- tions will, In many cases, leavo large deficiencies, and ' we look for Tory' careful competition next . season, feeling ns,ured that clips well got up will command increased attention, whilst inferior sort« will ' do neglected.

LABOUR MAEKET. ' Tho demand for labour of every description hal been exceedingly limited sinco last summary, but this isa characteriBtlo of the vvlntor mouths generally. Operations in tho squatting and agricultural districts aro not being carried on to any oxtont whatovor, so that vory few engagements hivo beon effected for labourers suited for such localities. Competent and respectable femalo servants'aro in requost, and havo tlio least difficulty of any class of domestics in socurln" situations. Young women unusod to household work", or accustomed only to farm 6orvlco, meet with no Inquiry. Mr. Eldorton reports-" Tho labour Harket in Holbourne has been dull during the rast nionlh ; which may be much attributed to the ecverity of the vvcathor, and that agricultural work has been noarly at a stand, and also that now, in most of the Inigo townB and neighbourhoods, mon are to bo found suitablo for station and agricultural works. Somo few mon as stockmen, ploughmen, and farming men havo met with situation», but to a vory limited extent. Marriod couples, without families, suitablo foi domestic work, havo boen cngagod for near town tuburbs, and Interior. Malo domestics, with tho ex- ception of grcoms, cooks, and genorally useful men, hnionot been inquired after. Female Bervants, vvoll suited for gontcol families, and who nro capiblo of cnrrjiiig out tho usually required duties in woll rcculatcd families, and who possess good tes- timonials, have boon ongigod to a moderato cvtent. Those females who aro only Buitcd for farming work, dairies, &c; , have not been asked for, which is generally the caso at this season of the year, and largo numbers aro out of employ- ment. Last weok tho immigrant ship Oceánica arrived, with 154 single women, and sovoral marrieii couples. Somo havo met with situations at reduced wages, and others aro being sent to various seaport ton us for engagements. Wages havo not undorgono much chango, and tho following are asked-Stock- ing, £1 a week ; bullock-drivers, 15s. ; ploughmen, 15s. ; labourers, 12s. ; wniters, 20s. to 30s. ; barmen 20s. ; coachmen, 20s. ; grooms, 12s. to 15s. ; lads, 8s! and 10s. a week, with rations ; barmaids, 20s. to 25s. ; vnltresscs, 16s. to 20s. weekly ; housekeopora, £40 female cooks, £30 to £40 ; cooks and laundresses, £30; house and parlour maids. £20; nursos, £30; nursemaids, £10 to £20 ; general servants, from £20 to £30 a year and found ; married couples from £55 to £70 a year.
