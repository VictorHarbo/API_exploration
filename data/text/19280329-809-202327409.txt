It shows that in the year under review 113,882 per- sons were admitted lo the Lonimonwciiiin without being asked to pass the dicta lion test; that 88 were refused admission to the Commonwealth, and that 3831 colored persons departed from Australia. Of tlic 113.882 migrants admitted to Australia, no fewer than 93,382 were llri- tisli, though only 49,546 cninc dircet from Great Britain. Tho others came from nearly every part of the world, the major ity from the other Dominions. Froni New Zcnlnnd there were 26,401, from Cniuiiln 2245, India and Ceylon 2364 and South Africa 1002.

A number of Asiatics and other colored people, in cluding _ 1707 Cihncsc, were admitted to Australia, but the great majority of those were people who had been domiciled for merly in this country. A few, including ten , American negroes, were granted exemption certificates entitling tliem to remain in Australia for a limited period, some were admitted by special authority, and a small number owed their arrival here to police proceedings. Of the 88 persons who were refused ad mission 58 were Chinese and 12 British. For some apparently strange reason, which is not disclosed in the return, 53 of the Chinese came from Holland. All the Britishers were stftwaways on steam ers. So were many of the others who were refused admission when after all their trouble and risks ' tliey aVrived nt Australian ports.
