We learn from the SYDNEY Moiinnfc Hr.KM.r) tliat tlxe chief reason of Premier EETD'S late visit to England was to obtain the Royal assent to liis Alien Immigration [Restriction Bill, and the same journal publishes a very interesting verbatim report of Mr CHAiEBEKLAix's speech on the subject. The Secretary for the Colonies does not disguise from himself that Australians have a right to protect themselves against an invasion of a class to which they can justly object, but- he asks them to bear in mind the traditions of the empire -which makes no distinction in favor of oragainstrace orcoloi, while to exclude by reason of their color, or by reason of their race, all Her Majesty's Indian subjects, or even all Asiatics, would be an act so offensive to those peoples that it would be most painful to Her Majesty to have to sanction it. And the right hon. gentleman goes on to indulge in a panegyric on Indian rajahs and people who, during the Indian mutiny, saved the empire by their loyalty. As a matter of sentiment, all this sounds very well, but we nevertheless prefer to regard the Asiatic as a man and a brother-at a distance, realising how numerically small this Australian community is, and how easily, under non-restrictive laws,we might be over run by a colored horde alien to our political and social system, and ready to sell their labor at less than the price that a white man could subsist upon. We hear enough of the racial difficulty in the United States to. make us resolve not to allow it to crop up here. At the same time we may agree (with a qualification), with Mir Chameeklain that it is not because a man is of a different color from ourselves that he is necessarily an undesirable immigrant, but it is because he is dirty, or he is immoral, or he is a pauper, or he has some other objection which can be defined by an Act of Parliament, and by 1 ?which, the exclusion can be managed 1 ?with regard to all those -whom, we J really desire to exclude. Thus it may be inferred that we may exclude the Asialio for any reason save that he is a " colored pusson," and that being the case, it simply remains for the ingenuity of Australian law-makers to devise means of checking under sirable immigration in the manner prescribed by the Secretary for the Colonies. NoTirwuHSTAXDETG the great strides in the production of butter made by this colony, our exports of this article to the home country are not to be mentioned in comparison with the Danish output. Last year the Danes sent 137 million pounds weight to England. This competition we have always had, but, according to the London correspondent of the AGE, we are to find another for midable rival in Canada. 'Within two years the export of the butter from the Dominion to Great Britain" has increased from a iittle more than two and a quarter million pounds to nearly 10 million pounds weight, and pro duction promises to advance by leaps and bounds under the Government system of establishing co-operative creameries andleasingthem tothedairy farmers. This system embodies the principle we have long advocated of the establishment of State farms with a view to first instruct men in the busi ness of farming, and subsequently to make the property over to the learners on terms alike profitable to the State, and the individual. So far as dairy farming is concerned, the Canadians find that the system an swers well, and there is no reason why, under proper management, it should not be a success here also. The Dominion Government, we are told, is endeavoring to secure cold storage from the dairy to the English port, and are arranging for refrigera tors on 17 steamships, at a cost of £2000 per ship, of which the Govern ment pays half the cost. The Canadians, in fact, promise to run us very closely in a num ber of articles in which we have flattered ourselves we should have something like a mono poly. They are about to make trial shipments of dressed meats, and fruits, comprising grapes, peaches, pears, and tomatoes, and the shorter voyage to the mother country will always give them a great advantage. Already Canadian cheese is exported of the value of three millions sterling annually, most of which is con signed - to Great Britain. In fact, in Canada theso colonies are destined to find their most powerful competitor in the home markets. She can, and does, raise nearly everything that we produce here, and as we have frequently pointed out in these columns, the establishment of steam communication between the Canadian Dominion and Australia, with a view to an inter change of commodities, was at least premature, and indicated but slight acquaintance with the natural and industrial resources of the two coun tries.
