IRON SHIP-BUILDING-WILL IT SUCCEED + At ûrst sight it looks Uko a paradox, though it ifcalty It flot so, to say that a splendid success createa a great mis-Prtuno, by raising a host of imitators aud copj fats, each endeavoring and promising to oxcol the other, and perauau.'."1!-. others tboy can do so, ero the original be itself proveu It is» and always has boen, the case in ovory oUBine*?8 a-d profession ; by this reason-that which was orlgl-.«11? roaUVgoodoften bo comes embarrassed and thwarted, ?8 woll as the nume- rous offsprings .Hallways, as a grand system, had they bee. carried out as originally propounded, would have paid luros tors well ; but as soon as successes became probable, extensions became the ordor of tho day-oxtonBious were made to every available place; consequently land was purchased nt fabulouB prices, to appease wrong-headod landlords and quiet opposition ; legal charges in opposing, defending, pleading for and against, Parliamentary expenses, cudenco, and all the other mystorlOB and necessities kuo»»n oaly to lawyers, wore extravagantly undertaken, the bare idea of which would now even mako a director, aa veil as shareholders, tremble, and all this from the mania consequent on a great SUCCOES. Wo hope the Great Eastern steamship will prove au exception to the rule Had wo not tho foregoing instances, ve might have supposed the very magni- tude of tho undertaking would havo been a sufficient guarantee, which wo admit It should be to any calm, reasoning mind; but v. hon a mama for novelty soizes the crowd, these things arc not considered as they should he In making these remarks, we aro not to bo sup- posed to refer to, or wish to discourage attempts bslng 7tt.de to de> elope improvements or discovery-far from it ; but when we see it now proposod to construct mu iron monster ship at Liverpool, 1,000 feet long I 108 feet longer than the". Millwall wonder !-wo pâme. I Wa shall not 'discuas tho possibility or probability of Its being accomplished ; wo only mention it as proof of our proposition. Wo fear it looks like " the beginning of a commencement." It would be na I well, at all events, to try how the Great Eastern an- swers. This Is a great and costly experiment of Itiolf. We hare prevlouslyexpresaod our opinion of the «oblo (hip's capabilities : tho moro wo soo of it the nure are we confirmed of the correctness of our views. Wa cannot, ho wovor, but express a hope that no prcctpl tato BtopB will bo takon by any of our friends in con- structing a fleet of such onormous proposions, until the first specimen shall have provod the possibility of its entire SUCCCBS as, a ship, and the probability of a i imilnr result as a morcantile speculation and invest- ment of capital. That Iron shipbuilding is fast becoming ono of our national staple manufactures and employments is »»'oil known. After many years' wear and tear .which ia wucden ships would have required an oxtoustvo und exponsivo overhaul and examination, it has been proved the repairs aro merely nomina', the delay trifling. A woll-known firm in Ltvorpool 1-avo given most conclusivo evidence on this point, when they state tho repairs of one of their ships, after l8 j ears' service, stood them, except for scraping and i aiming, in tho morely nominal sum of 182. The con- tinual oxidisation of Iron by exposure to the action of the taits in sea water had boen a serious objection, weeds adhering thereto, notwithstanding tho con- tinual corrosion ; this, too, has been ovorcomo by the patent substance invontod by Mesars, Peacock and Buchanan) of Southampton, which, after repeated tiials, appears fully to answer the double purposo of rendering scraping comparatively unnecessary, as »voll a" preventing the accumulation of barnacles or algal of all kinds. Practical proofs like this are of moro weight than a thousand conjecturoa, and traolo ve lumea of speculative opinions, from whatever courcoa. If a vessel, of oither wood or iron, bo run on a rook, we can easily guoBS at the consequencos ; but when tbo vessel has boon stranded or beached, it hasbeonalsc pi oved that iron la, at all events, quite as safe as wood, li not superior. Wo havo woll considered the subjoot, and conversed with many skilful sailors and ship lui'ders. Tho proponderanoy is decidedly in favor o iron for commercial and wood for naval purposes-Iror Icing ill adapted for rosistlng the effects of heavy shot v, e therefore anticipate a considerable augmentation o ii on ships for general use. !. orne complaints havo been made of the quality o the plates supplied for ship-building. The demane «ill causo a supply of a better class of goods. Thoai mo matters that will plainly and quickly remodj themselves: tho demand becoming universal foriroi »hips of heavy tonnage (wo speak not now o leviathans), will naturally have a beneficial offoo cn the iron trade ot tho United Kingdom, and, as i cormequenco, on our coal and iron mines. As till country must be the grand depot for the material, a i» o cannot bo surpassed in price or quality, If neod be it tetB at rest for ever all doubts as to England remain ing still the sourco and centre of maritime wealth am Îiresperlty, which Bho has for so many years boon, I ter people bo but true to themselvos in fostering am iirotectlng the interests necoBsary to that end, b, :eeping in the van of discovery of those sciences ap pertaining theroto. ' In these ondeavors we hop' efforts will not be allowed to overstep the boundarlc Of discretion, and that novelties may not botray th incautious into Buch losses as not only to injure thoa selvea, but the vory cause they probably think the are thus serving. We fear we see indications of sue looming. hence this warning, which we hope will no he takenf or, or misunderstood as, a condemnation o great outorprisos.-Mining Journal.

The Information ÍB supplied by the Queenscliffe correspon- dent of that journal :-"On Friday morning early the Bhlp General Nowell loft Hobson's Bay, ni tow of a steamer under an agreement to tow the Bhlp to sea for tho sum of £160.
