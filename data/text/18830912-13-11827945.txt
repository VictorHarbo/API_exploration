WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1883. Without of at once to the personal discussion which took place at the Tariff Commission yesterday, we may conclude our notices of the errors in detail of the chairman's draft report On a future day we shall essay to lay down the great principles which ought to be asserted in connexion with tariff reform at this juncture, and which we shall hope will be maintained with success both in the commission and in the country The chairman's incurable propensity to meddle and muddle with trade is shown by his recommendations regard ing the beer duty At present the duty on imported bottled ale is " for six " reputed quart bottles, or for twelve " reputed pint bottles, 9d ' Uns charge is virtually M pot gallon, the, amount levied on sale in bulk, may much as the custom of the trade is to put all into bottles of a size which experience has shown to be convenient to customers, but which do not contain the full imperial quart No one is de ceived thereby The Standard is well known, and though it is the fashion to call the one a quart and the other a pint bottle, everybody is aware that this is a misnomer The customer buys what is known in the trade as the wine pint and not the imperial pint, com moree having changed the standard Add 6d per dozen for bottle duty, and imported ale nowadays 2s per dozen Iho Mirams proposal is somewhat un- intelligible It leads - Ale porter are in bottles containing more than an imperial pint 4d per dozen in bottles containing more than an im perms half pint la 9d per dozen The trade is troubled greatly about the application of the words "more than," as all sorts of arrangements are possible under the phrase On the 4th Inst a communicated paragraph was published in Ilu,Aigm intimating that the object sought for as the sweeping aside of the trade measure, and the instituting in its place of the imperial quart Australia is to have an ale bottle of its own, possibly with the word " Mirams " branded upon it. If all the world would fall into the arrangement there would be nothing to say against it, but it will be admitted that for us to attempt a change on our own account from the universal trade quart to the imperial quart is ridiculous It matters nothing to the importer, in one sense, what size the bottles are, as the price a is paid according to the quantity, but it would be a nuisance to him if he were shut out from buying in the general market. Imperial quarters, it may be added, have been sent to Victoria as an experiment, and the big bottles were found too large for general use. The public preferred the smaller bottle at the proportionate price, as better adapted for daily wants. So with colonial use. The excise duty of 2d. per gallon which Mr. MIIIASIS would impose, ought never to have been taken off, but the enthusiastic gentleman goes further, and would put a duty of 6d per ton on sugar used in breweries, in addition to the ordinary import duty. It is his mission, Mr Mnt.VMs conceives, to keep the bi ewes to malt and to shops. This is all very well, but in the hot weather in Australia the chemical difficulties connected with both malt and glucose are found to be almost insuperable, and the use of a proportion of sugar to induce rapid fermentation and to secure brightness in colour is held to be unavoidable. As sugar itself is innocuous there is no reason why the state should seek to divert the course of trade, apart altogether from the difficulties in the way. It is impossible to collect such a duty at the customs by imposing a charge on any special line, because the trade will use any sugar. When " brewers' crystals " went up in price some time back white counters were immediately purchased instead. An excise officer could, of course, be stationed at each brewery to prevent fraud, and the charge of, say, £250 per annum would not be felt by the large Melbourne companies, but we apprehend that the impost would have a crushing effect upon many of the small country establishments. When he comes to reflect upon his own handiwork, the chairman of the commission may be tempted to exclaim with HAMLET against the " cursed spite " which forces some men to make the effort to set the world aright. i Glancing at individual items we may expect the commission to disapprove of the proposed remission of the duties on coffee and on currants. These are easily collected revenue duties, and if they are taken off vexatious trade duties must be kept on. Why Mr. MiitAWs should desire to free coffee when he would heavily add to the charge of tea is a mystery to which no clue presents itself. It is proposed to lower the charge on woolpacks from 7s. to 5s. per dozen. The sister colonies charge 3s. per dozen, and for the sake of uniformity the right chop is to that figure. Salt, which now [pays 20s. per ton, should, according to the chairman, pay 10s. The charge of 6d. per cwt. would not be worth collecting, and to get rid of the annoyance of the duty salt should go free. Opium now pays the heavy duty of 20s. per lb., and the impost is believed to be somewhat too high, as it induces smuggling across the border, the sister colonies charging only 10s. per lb. Mr. MIRAMS proposes a graduated scale, commencing at 2s. 6d. per lb., and ending at 20s., under which evasion of the law would become more possible than ever. Of the new duties one of the most objectionable is that of 2d. per lb. on preserved milk. This charge was formerly on the statute-book. Pi ices ruled high, and consumption was restricted, but since the market has been thrown open there has been an active competition ; processes have been improved abroad ; we have had the full benefit of the new conditions, and so instead of paying 13s. to 6s. per dozen, the public, under the free-trade regime, pays only 7s. 6d. to 8s. per dozen. The articles largely used in families as a food for infants when the mother can- not nurse, and it is a domestic cruelty to place impediments in the way of a cheap supply. The object in view is to give the local maker a command of the Victorian market, but the proper course to take is to so assist the producer as to enable him not only to defy competition here but to sell abroad. Having pointed out errors in detail so numerous as to show how utterly Mr. MIRAMS has failed to inform himself as to the wants of the trades, the next task will be to lay down the lines on which the rational members of the commission should work as against their chairman. A memorial from the inhabitants of Hay and the Riverine district, urging their claims to direct railway communication with Melbourne, is now in course of signature It is addressed to the lion r A WitiGHi, Minister for Works, Sydney, and contains a succinct statement of what our neighbours across the Murray hold to be then lights in this respect Great efforts have been put forth of late years by the Government New South Wales to make the relations between Sydney and Riverina as close and intimate in a commercial sense as they are politically Ever since we were foolish enough to alienate a number of our best customers by the imposition of a stock tax, every Ministry that has held office in the mother colony has steadily pushed forward the work of railway construction in the country watered by the Darling, the Lachlan, and the Mun umbidgee Before many years have passed by, main lines will bring every portion of New South Wales territory into communication with Port Jackson The policy so steadily pursued has already produced results Only a few days ago we inserted a paragraph from the Narandera Argus, stating that the last instalment of a wool clip, which used formerly to come to Melbourne, had passed through that town on its way to Sydney, and judging from the marks by which the announcement is followed, we are led to the conclusion that our contemporary is aware of other parcels which will go the same load 'the New South Wales Railway department has not been content with merely placing the means of transport at the disposal of the Riverine glances It has canvassed for customers as energetically as any in vate firm could have done, and has sought to gain patronage by the offer of very liberal terms The authorities are, we believe, that in every instance they charge paying rates for carriage, but the freights for some distances in the direction of Sydney are so low that there is a difficulty in believing that the pi out spoken of is always direct. However that may be, there can be no doubt that River ma has been specially favoured, and that if it will only deal with Sydney it need not fear a railway tariff flamed in ascot dance with the heartless calculations of a mere commercial method But notwithstanding all the consideration shown for its interest, the people of central and southern Riverina are not satisfied with the present condition of things They desire to have direct railway communication between Hay and Melbourne, ma Deniliquin, as such a line would connect them with their nearest, and, therefore, their natural seaport In the memorial under notice they urge " that in common with all " British subjects in a British colony," they have a right to facilities for trading with the nearest capital and " the nearest seaport," so that they may take " the shortest and most convenient ' highway to the markets of the world " They point out to Mr WIUGUI that the continued refusal to construct the desired railway is not only out of consonance with the principles of free " trade 01 liberal and even handed administration," but is also useless as a means to the end in view The distance from Hay to Sydney is 151 miles, while from Hay to Melbourne is only about 270 " Our close gecko) annual relations to Melbourne," say the memorialists, " force us into to/s "mental relations with that city " which can neither be influenced " by our territorial connexion with " Sydney, nor diverted by any possible " i oil way facilities to that more distant " capital " Under the circumstances, we can scarcely imagine that the Sydney authorities will continue much longer to deny the connexion which the Riverine people so earnestly desire It would be anything but creditable to a Government which claims to be actuated by the principles of a bound commercial economy, to inflict upon any portion of its subjects inconvenience and loss for the purpose of of giving the merchants of its capital city the monopoly of a trade which nature has decided must flow in other channels It will be seen that the assertion in the memorial with respect to this point is emphatic and comprehensive Nothing which the Sydney authorities can do, short of instituting differential duties of rates of carriage which would almost or wholly j prohibit trade between Victoria and the Riverine district, can cut the connexion between this colony and the people on the other side of the Murray No matter what temptations may be hold out in order to make Port Jackson thoKivenne seaport, the attempt must fail, because as those who have had practical experience in connexion with the trade point out, no financial concessions can annihilate distance or get over the obstacles which it presents to the convenient transaction of business The memorialists declare that they have every confidence in the justice and reasonableness of their claim, and we think that it must be admitted that their assurance is well founded Whether they have equally good ground for their faith in the fairness and liberality with which it will be treated when placed before both Houses of the New South Wales Legislature, and discussed on its merits, remains to be proved We are not wholly disinterested in this matter, but we are sincere in wishing that, for their own sakes, our Riverine neigh- bour may achieve the success they undoubtedly deserve A session seldom passes in the Assembly without a discussion upon the operation of the Educaon Act, and the custom was confined to yesterday. The Government adopted the precaution of taking the debate in the full House, where members can only speak once, but as it was the whole c\ cning was occupied in desultory talk, and it appears as if another evening would be sacrificed in a discussion which has no particular object of and the conversation ranged over every man that has ever been raised in connexion with the Education question As a matter of course, a rabid attack was made by a certain section of members upon the Royal Commission, and it is pleasant to record that a strong and general feeling was expressed that if true mt officers did their duty the scandal of the general employment of young children in in any of the factories of Melbourne would not occur The Education Commission needs no defence It has done good work in the past, and there is no harm in indulging in the hope that it will not be without a measure of success in the future Its revelation of the political jobbery of the Major Smith _</"'_ has i op and the country for its appointment, and we may see the fruit of its labours in the educational clauses of the Public bei vice Bill With the views of hon. members, that it is disgraceful that children who ought to be at school should be employed systematic lily in factories, a bom ty concurrence must be expressed The act is delied in these instances, and the bodies and souls of human creatures are sacrificed for the sake of a few shillings per week The Scandal, it is probable, will not long be allowed to endure The religious question could not be excluded, and once that is raised, the flood gates of talk are opened No practical conclusion could be aimed at, but pro hally the remarks made by Mr StitvioE will command general attention Sec Darwinism, the Premier behoves, has, to use his own words, no show in Victoria, but if the seeds would be content with the teaching of the great Teacher, to worship God and to love your neighbour" the community as a whole would rally to their support It seems, also that Mr. Sievier has in very strong opinion that the clergy who object to giving religious instruction after school hours, and who want the hour at the commencement instead of the hour at the end, are manufacturing difficulties He has framed a regulation allowing Schools to be dismissed at half past 2 o'clock on the after noon when religious instruction is given, Mid if the seeds choose to discharge w hat they describe as a last duty, they can now close If they fail, his conclusion will be But their heart is not in the work Earnest men, he urges, would take advantage of the wishes of the laity, and of the facilities offered by the state It was very evident that the remains of the Premier gave gi also offered to the members who do battle for the clergy in the House, and it will be curious to note how far this hostility will take form and substance out of doors We recently published a letter from a 'Contractor," in which he ventures an opinion that if the contract for the one son of the P irh imont buildings v. ore cancelled it would be found that the quality of the Grampian stone had in some mysterious way been improved by no operation We merely mention the statement in order to express our belief that the stone, as shown by the report of the first Board that examined it, is bad in itself that the character it has gained arises entirely from its intrinsic in ferocity, and not from anything that has been said of it by persons interested in securing its rejection Our principal object, however, in noticing "con tractor's" letter in to protest against what he says about the use of granite at the latest craze in Parliament seems to be a desire to substitute Harcourt (i granite for Grampian stone, and I am surprised to find that no one has called attention to the almost impossibility of doing it, on account of its immense (i colt, unless Mr SERVICE IS prepared to float a special loan for it " He then goes on to show that, according to the Australian Builders' Price Book, 1883, the cost of the west front of the Parliament man in granite, in conformity with two present design, would not be less than £350,000. Assuming that this estimate is correct we can only say that it is beside the question. No one but a lunatic would dream of building of granite from designs intended to be worked out in freestone. In the latter material, effects are produced by elaborate and profuse ornamentation ; bat granite does not lend itself readily, to the purposes of the carver, and therefore those who use it have to depend for striking or pleasing appearances on bold outlines, and a massive o Simplicity m points of detail The reduction in the quantity of minute work which would be affected if it were decided to use granite would greatly reduce the estimate made by our correspondent, and against the extra cost we should have the superior durability Buildings of freestone are always liable to decay The library front of the Piulia mont- house has been renewed once already, and it will probably need restora- tion it intervals for all time to come , but a gtaiiite/aj-iu/e would be practically im- pel wimble The P. and O.

The treasure taken by the Assam was of the value of £117,840 A telegram from Berne states that the Swiss Federal Government have expelled from the territory of the republic Miss Booth and Miss Charlesworth, who have been engaged in a propaganda on behalf of the Salvation Army In February last these two ladies were expelled from the Canton of Geneva at six hours' notice under pain of imprisonment. The authorities of the Canton of Berne also issued an order prohibiting the meetings of the Salvation Army) Miss Maud Charlesworth is a daughter of the Rev. Samuel Charles worth, a clergy man of the Church of England 'This gentleman wrote to The Times explain- ing that his daughter was in Geneva without his permission and against his will He stated that two years ago, when she was only 16 years old, she was taken to some of the Salvation Army meetings, and being of a very impressible and somewhat excitable nature was fascinated by their novelty and charm rearing that her happiness and health would suffer if she were removed from the work of the army he took her to Paris to help Miss Catherine Booth, a daughter of the founder and general of the army, to help her in her work among the poor of the city, expressly stipulating that she was only to be regarded as a young friend and v visitor, and that she should not become an officer of the army or wear their uniform. Miss Booth, however, he asserted, took Miss Charles worth to Geneva in contravention of his stipulations. "General" Booth had an in service with Lord Granville with reference to the expulsion of the two ladies, and there was a good deal of discussion in the press at the time as to whether the act of the Geneva authorities was not a violation of international law and of the treaty rights of British subjects residing in the country A cable message this morning announces the death of M Henri Conscience, the most distinguished of 1 female novelists. He was born at Antwerp on December 3, 1842, his father being of French extraction He served as a volunteer during the Belgian revolution which broke out in 1830, and wrote a number of songs, which became very popular among the soldiers After leaving the army he was in turn a working gardener, in employé in the archives of Antwerp, and clerk to an academy of arts He took a prominent part in the movement for the foundation of a national literature in the Flemish language in opposition to the trench literature of the preceding century His first work, The Year of Miracles, published in 1897, contains brilliant pictures of the Spanish rule in 1 landers, and became very popular He followed this up with a large number of romances and tales, the most famous being his historical romance, The Lion of Flanders His memoirs appeared in the Revue Content pot came in 1858 Several of his works have b( cn translated into English as well as into It reach, German, Danish, and Italian The Right Hon Hugh Law, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, is also dead. He was born in 1818, was Solicitor General for Ireland from November 1871 to January 1874, when he held the office of Attorney-General for a few weeks in 1880, when Mr Gladstone's second Ministry came into power, he was re appointed Attorney-General, and in 1881, on the retirement of Lord O'Hagan, he became Lord Chancellor of Ireland He represented Londonderry in the House of Commons from 1874 to 1883 Another massacre by the natives of the New Hebrides is reported this morning A Mackay telegram states that the labour schooner Lavina, which has arrived from Apia, brings news of the murder of the Government agent and the second mate From the particulars to hand, it would appear that the two white men were suddenly and treacherously attacked by the natives, and murdered The island of Api is a few miles to the south of Arabrjm, where Captain Belbin was recently murdered, as described by our special correspondent, "The Vagabond " We have on several occasions recently pointed out the danger to Australia of French criminals finding their way over here in the event of the proposed transportation of rea diverted on a large scale to New Caledonia being carried out That our fears are not imaginary is shown by the capture at Ballarat on Monday night of one of gang of burglars who have committed some extensive 106 lines in that city during the past week Particulars of the arrest are given else where, from which it appears that the prisoner, who at first gave his name was Paul Jones, has since admitted that he is a French Communist named Louis Paul, and that he arrived in Victoria six months ago from Noumea He has been in Ballarat for the last week or two, actively pursuing his criminal career the Legislative Council did a considerable amount of work yesterday The Trades Unions Bill and the Judicature Bill were passed through their remaining stages Mr. Cuthbert endeavoured to obtain the recommittal of the latter measure, for the purpose of putting off its coming into operation until 1885, on the ground that time was required for studying the new English rules Dr Head said that if delay should be necessary it could be secured by introducing a short bill before the session closed To amend this bill in any form might jeopardise its passing The House negatived Mr Cuthbert's motion by 20 votes to 16 Both Houses have now as sented to the measure the remainder of the sitting was devoted to the Tram- way Company's Bill The postponed clauses were dealt with, and no material alteration made in any of them until the 62nd or lust was reached.

The bill was reported with amendments and the House adjourned until to day, when the Railways Management Bill will be proceeded with. The advisability of using Harcourt granite in the erection of the front of the Parliament houses was suggested in the Legislative Council yesterday by Mr. Zeal, who asked the Minister of Justice whether this stone could not be employed for the base course quoins, architraves, and string course. Mr. Anderson read a reply from the Public Works department, stating that as the business of the building was seen pal ted no base course quoins were require 1 Granite could only be used for the Queen travels and horizontal mouldings and large additional cost and to the detriment of the appearance of the building It would be practicable to use write for the isolated columns 14 in number but the extra cost would be 9000 Leave of absence for the remainder of this session was granted by the L tislativc Council yesterday to Mr F V Hamilton Little business was done in the Assembly yesterday The votes taken in committee of supply were reported to the House and on the 1 education dep artment bunt reached a discussion was commenced which was it is finished when the House rose Mr Wrixon led off with a statement of his belief that the compulsory clauses of the act are not being enforced and that if no improvement is effected in class of ignorant I may crs will be allowed to to grow up in the land He and other sy bakers made allusion to the sh useful condition of affairs found in the Melbourne factories where young, children who ought to be at school are HE stem the lily employed The religious education wife also freely re force 1 to in a number of members in cluding Mr Harper and Mr Nimmo applied that the passages repudiated by Mr llamsu> should be restored to the school 1 ool s Mr W M Clark rem irks that there is a great mister hereunder" upon this point the bulk of the school its buy their own I books and they purchase the ordinary editions Mr Clark did not find one of the Government bodies in a school of 700 scholars The right to give religious lessons before school hours as well as alter was also in acted upon while on the other hand Mr Richardson Mr James and other members denounce 1 all these suites tions as hints to the Education Commission to report in favour of roll gious und denominational education The propriety of levying a local rate was mooted Mr, seen ice replied at length He announced that after consulting with the local boards of advice he had agreed to issue a regulation allowing schools to be dismissed at half past you afternoons on which religious instruction is given. the people who ask for more who claim that they must hit e an hour in the morning, will be guilty in Mr "5er vices opinion of creating difficulties They will show that they are not in earnest in the work.

When the ad interim report on the stock tax was compiled a copy was sent to The Argus and Mr Mirams said he was determined that this should not occur again Hence he decided to circulate the draft report simultaneously amongst all sections of the press without undue favouritism or priority This explanation not j roving satisfactory to Mr M Intyre that gentleman as a question of privilege tabled a motion regretting that the chairman should have printed and handed his draft report to the Press for publication before submitting it to the consideration of the commission The motion was supported by Messrs Lorimer Zox Walker Grimwade and Meares whilst Messrs Nimmo and James upheld the action of Mr Mirams 1 Eventually Mr Mirams said that seeing his action had met with the disapproval of a section of the commission he would express his regret at the premature circulation of the report It was his desire that the harmony which had hitherto characterised their proceedings should continue to the end 1 his intimation was received with general applause and Mr M Intyre immediately withdrew his motion Mr Mirams draft report was then formally received and ordered to be taken into consideration this afternoon the Chamber of Manufactures at their last meeting passed a resolution requesting the 1 renner to take the access any steps for securing the more expeditious transmission from London to Melbourne of the specifications of patents registered in Great Britian Mr Service has received their re lust and in tends communicating at the first opportunity with the agent general on the s object He will inform Mr Murray Smith of the undue delay in the despatch of the documents of which the chamber complains and will ask him to adopt the course which he may deem most desirable for meeting their wishes A meeting of the University Senate was held at the University yesterday afternoon.
