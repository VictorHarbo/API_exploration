Much amusement has beon caused at the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, by tho urgent petition of two p.etty blue-eyed Danish girls, Alfiid Anderson and Ingeborg Jansen, of Copenhagen, for permission to de part immediately for Wiona (Minne sota). They are the cheerful victims of an (iceontrie will mado bv their rrrnnd father, who bequeathed them each a lmlf-.shu.ro of GOO acres of fino farm* lands, on condition that they marry 1 within 30 days of their arrival in New York. By tho terms of the will, which the two cousins explained to an inter preter, title to tho lands will not ho finally vested with either of them until they become mothers. If at the end of five years ono of cousins has a child and the other has not, tho motherless one will loso half ■ her land to the other. If neither has children at the end of fivo years tho entire-property is to revert to a male cousin in Denmark. Both girls departed for Minnesota, confidently declaring in broken English that they would find good husbands within tho stipulated term.—"Daily Mail." <
