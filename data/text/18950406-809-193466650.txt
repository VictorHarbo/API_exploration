Iline, dentist, has Resumed the Practice of ant Mr. Bauiford, 100 Exhibltion- st., 16 years usalat- NOTHER LIFE SAVED, Mr. Henry Shulz, of Bell-street, South Preston, says :— "I had suffered with a complaint in my body which ovontually reached my legs, and having been treated for years by several doctors during that time, I derived no bonelit, but gradually got worse until I was t old by then) ' I would never get hotter,' and that ' they could do no more for me.' This they oould have told mo years be fore and saved mc many pounds. Whatever this Infor. mation was, it wasa great blow to me. To think that I had to lie in bedu cripple and die for the want of proper treat ment was worse than death itself. But 1 have to thank God that one day I was hauded ' Tho Age ' newspaper and started to read it, but finding my sight was faillog ino I anked ray son to read it lo rac. On looking dowu the Medical Column one advertisement »ln- particular which took my attention was abc/ut some very successful cures effected by W. Mentiplay, of 190 Bourke-streefc. After hearing my son read I he ndvertiaenient I decided to give him a trial, and took the first opportunity of doing so, and I solcmuly declare that iu twenty- four (24) hours' time I got more rsliof than I ever got In many years' treatment by all the doctors that treated me, and continued to regain my health and strength, and in eight (8) weeks I was as well as ever 1 was In my life until about eight weeks ago I met with a tram accident, which gavo me a sevoro shaking, and from which 1 have nob quite recovered yet. But for tho sake of suffering humanity 1 would advlao all who suffer nob to waste their means foolishly, and then go to a person who can euro them, bub to go at once and save their money, for I am perfectly justified in saying that W. Mentiplay, of Bourkc-street, Melbourne, saved my life when others had givon mo up, and what ha did for mo he could do for others who havo suffered likewise." This honest confession of Mr. Sbuiz must be beneficial to public sufforcrs, and if many others whom I have saved from an early grave would boldly speak out tho truth, tho public would benefit largely from tbsir experi ence) of my troatmcnt. How many have I succeeded in curing of Hydatids after two, three and as many as seven operations have been performed upon them ? Still people wilt have the operation rather than a reliable remedy without opera tion. And again, how many have I cured of Asthma when they were told thero was no cure for it?
