• Call to national group leaders* Australians • . JOIN IN DRIVE FOR CITIZENSHIP'! The Minister for Immigration, Mr. Downer, has urged all Australians and leaders of migrant national groups to join in a citizenship drive to help increase the rate of naturalisation. In each of the last two financial years, the number of people included in applications for naturalisation has exceeded 50,000. In 1958-59 the number was 52,394 compared with 50,903 the previous year. The persons actually naturalised were 47,750 last financial year and 48,064 in 1957-58. Approximately 206.000 alien migrants have been naturalised and, at June 30 last, it was estimated that about the same number of aliens were eligible, but had not so far applied. Of these eligible people, about 40,000 would be children, who cannot apply in their own right, and would depend upon their parents' naturalisation to obtain citizenship. It is estimated that 49.1 per cent of the eligible aliens in Australia have applied for naturalisation. In various national groups of the total migrant intake, the highest percentages of applications for citizenship have come from those countries in the Russian sphere of influence. Hungarians lead with a record of 82 per cent of applications from those eligible. Applications from Czechs, Roumanians, Russians. Ukrainians, Latvians and Estonians all exceed 60 per cent of the total eligible within their national groups. Apart from the United Kingdom. the major sources of migrants in current programmes are the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. The percentages of applications from eligible people in each of these national groups are Dutch. 47.2; Italian 42.4 and German 36. Corresponding percentages from other migrant national groups include Austrian. 53.3; Greek, 40.4; Scandinavian — Danish. 35.2: Norwegian, 19.4; Swedish 17.5 and Finnish 28.6. "Taken over all this is a highly creditable record, but we are not complacent," Mr. Downer said. "Frankly, it is necessary that the rate of applications should be increased. "Acceptance of citizenship is the aim of our migration programme and of all our very considerable efforts to aid the assimilation of migrants.
