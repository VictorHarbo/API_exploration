MIGRANTS FROM MALTA Assisted passages will be provided for Maltese immigrants under an agreement signed yesterday by Mr Calwell, Minister for Immigration, and Captain H. C. Curmi, Commis- sioner for Malta in Australia. Shipping for other migrants will not be affected, as the Maltese will be transported under an arrange- ment between Malta and Britain. Mr Calwell said that the Maltese would be given the same assistance as American, Danish, Dutch, French, Belgian, and Norwegian migrants. They would not be permitted to come unless accommodation was as- sured them by relatives or friends.
