' I have been a sufferer from Eczema and an irritating skin trouble since the age of 13. While an out patient at one of the big London hospitals a doctor informed me that my disease 'was the result of looking after foreign hones. I have had as many as 30 horses under my care, my father being a horse dealer and jobmaster. He (my father) was speaking one day to a friend of mine who mentioned that he was being cured of an ulcerated leg, due to a horse-kick, by * Clarke's Blood Mixture.' I continued, however, to suffer until April 4, last, when my friend told me he was com pletely cured. Then I started to take Clarke's Blood Mixture' myself, and I em now corn completely cured, efter suffering and being disfigured for several yean. I am able to fol low my employment, and am very pleased to tbink there is such a valuable remedy obtain able for such a small sum. I should be pleased to answer any inquiries concerning my case.'— July 17, 1903.

This iB a good testimonial from the Jamiiy Doctor, the popular medical weekly, which goes on further to say : ' It is certainly the finest blood purifier that science and ekill have brought to light,and we can with the utmost confidence recommend it to our sub scribers and the public generally.
