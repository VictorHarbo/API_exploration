Population of Germany. Some interesting particulars re garding the population of the Ger man Empire are given (says the ' 'Westminster Gazette ') in the ' German Tear Book, 1914,' edited by H. A. Walter, and just published by the Anglo-German Publishing Co. (4s 6d nett). The German Empire in Europe covers an area of 208,777 sq. miles. The population of the Empire is now about 68,000,000. Its growth has been continuous during the last cen tury â€” practically since the founda tion of the new Empire in 1871. ? At present it increases at the rate of over S00,000 per year, due mainly to the snrplns of births over deaths, and to a small extent to immigration from neighbouring countries. The emigration of Germans into foreign countries is much smaller than the emigration from England, but there is nevertheless a large number in every habitable port of the globe. All European as well as oversea countries have a more or less large German population, running very often into six figures. The aggre gate number of Germans in the world in the current year, as far as can be estimated, reaches 100,000,000. A large number of foreigners live in Germany. Austrians, Hungarians, Poles, Russians, Italians, Dutch, French and Danish to a. large extent settle permanently in Germany, be cause opportunities are greater there than in their native countries. The foreign population proper in Ger many at the census of 1910 was 1,259,873. More than 50 per cent were of Austrian nationality (634, 983); Dutchmen came next (144,175), followed by Russians (137,697) and Italians (104,204). Of British nation ality there were 18,319 people, as against 16,130 in 1900. The greatest number of these foreigners are un skilled laborers. Like all other great nations of to-day Germany has become a nation of towndwellers. Almost three- fifths of the population live under urban conditions. The number of people engaged in agricultural pursuits has remained stationary since the begin ning of the last century, while all increase of population during the last fifty years has gone to swell the town population. When the Empire was founded in 1871 there were only eight towns with a population of over 100,000 inhabitants, whereas the number of such towns in 1913 was 1150\. Towns with over1 500,000 inhabitants in 1910 were ; Berlin, 2,071,257 ; Hamburg, 931,035 ; Mun ich, 596,467 ; Leipzig, 589,850 ; Dresden, 548,308; Cologne, 516,527 ; and Breslau, 512,105..
