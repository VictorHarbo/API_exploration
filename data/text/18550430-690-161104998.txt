This has been occasioned by light winds _ and Calms during the - whole *oyage. t-, When in thp meridi&n; of the , Friendly Islands, she was becalmed fpr 11 days, and, did not 'make' 50 miles of- weBting. Although the Favourite sailed 18 days before the Pride of the Seasi Captain Allan has kindly furnished us with the following report The schooner Surf, and barque Amelia were: laying at Valparaiso, ' the former was loaded -with guano and bound for Hobart Town, to sail February 8 ; the latter was offered formic or charter. ' ' There were alBO one Danish pnd one. British .barque leading vflth flour for England.1 A large ? clipper -Bhip w.as loading flout at T^cahuano;1 for ?Liverpool. - Admiral Brpc'e arrived at Valparaiso' on the- 7th February, from England via Pananaa, and wafe to 'sueceed the late- Admiral Price : In command of 'the Paciflc squadron.' H.M. Frigate President was laying at Vijlparaisb. ' On the 19th February, in latitude JS3'24 . south ; longitude (83*30 the FaVOurite speke the barque Giithbertfi, ' , ; lromCallao, bound to QUeehstOwn ; also, 0.11 the same -day, the' . Danish brig Ellen, from Valparaiso, bonnd to Melbourne. On the ? ]8th instant, in latitude 26-13 S., longltude 165-2G B., -spoke the - French frigate Endeavour, -and received from her three of the crew of the brig Spec , which wais' lost -fit New Caledonia, while endeavouring: to save, 'the remains of an old w^eek. . Captain Allan , has brought down letters from the French Commodore, . . , , Fueigbts to Londoii rfor wool are at present higher t^an they have been for ten years, lieing ljd. pen pound for Bhips com- .. mencing to load,-' to l$d.-and 3d. for A1 vessels nearly- full. Our list given above will show that the berth is as fully supplied with'. - tonnage as usual at thiB reason bntthe bulk pf the clip has been much later of being shipped, than in former, yearn when the press .. of wool was generally, over , -early in March. .Now pearly two months later it is with difficulty .-shippers can engage room. It must be borne in mind in accounting for the abundance of wool . ' thus late in tlie season, that-a considerable part of last year's clip cauld not be shipped before 1655 from the drpught then; ex perienced rendering it impoFBible -for grbwers-to send forward their -wool. This -season, too, a larger quantity of New Zealand wool has come forward for shipment, we notice the fine Belgian ship Cat(-aux Wattell, 1000 tons; on the. iberth for . London, .direct, and' nearly loaded, as we believe it is the first time a foreign 5hip of . any considerable tonnage has been fully laden for that port., - She is txpected to carry the very large number of 3000 bajeswpol, or upwards, and is to sail 5ih to 10th May. The Lady Wharncliffe, and Ascendant, are well, advanced', and. : will leave about- same time. The Scotia, has .a: portion of her car^o on board. The Washington Irving, and Speedy,; are discharging cargo,, at the circular Quay, and have b jth commenced receiving wool. On ex a- ' mination we find, thatnearly27,000 bales liave left the harbour thi* - season ; the vessels now loadiog will takei inbout 17,000, making 44000 bales-which will-be shipped in. all next month (May,), being a larger quantity than was shipped by 1st August, last season, so ; that we must .'look.- for a decline in freight; as the vessels* on the berth ? clear our wool stores. - The La 1 - Brone for . Rouen, is nearly loaded, . and - the Lucie is discharging her inward cargo, ' and receiving wool. We notice in oux advertising columns, several offers of charters, , and a considerable amount of-lonnage, could be taken uo here for. - . Ports in India, and China to load for England or back to the ' .. colonies, or to take guano at the Chincha Isiands. The ' hieh freights, however, quoted by our latett dates from all parts offtr great inducement to good thipn to go seeking. The schooner, Waterwitch from ? Melbourne reports -having sighted on the 27th, off Jervis Bay, a steamer, supposed to be the Telegraph. The schooner Wave lea :Port .-Phillip Heads, onthe ,. 20th instant. The cargo of the Grafton. (8.), from the Clarence, consists ,of 40 bales wool. 13 casks tallow, aha sundries. Captsia Wiseman has _ furnished -us with the names of the following vessels bat-bonnd at , 1 'theR;chmond:—Margarat and Mary, Christopher' George, 'Anna 7 Maria, Chieftain. Sea Gull, Josephine, Rhoderic Dhu, Cat herine and ? : Agnes, Frolick, Emma, Jane, -Australian League, Ebenezer. The Souvenir, from Moreton Bay; has on board, S3 o^sks tallow, 23 bales wool, i5 catka beef. ., tihe rejiorts the Boomerang (s.),-off the Sral Rocks, on Friday morning early. The Burnett, from Wide Bay, brings up 150 bales wool, and re ports the William Miskin(s.), as having sailed oil the 23rd for Sydney, via Moreton Bay, and also the Jenny Lind as loading for 1 this port. The Emma, brig, which.arrived yesterday from Swan River, via Adelaide, has had a very long and stormy passage from the former ' port, having met with a succession of easterly gales, and running short of water, she was compelled to put into Adelaide, where she ' sold part of her cargo. Captain' Etherington reports the arrival at Adelaide of the Furgirs from Swan River, bound to Melbourne, which vessel left some .days after the Emma,' Also, 'that the Tamar, of Launceston, ; left Gage's Roads (S. R.), on the 12th March,, bbuhd for Timor. The Apparition, schooner, from New- ' castle, was spoken'on the 23rd instant, 6 days out, 30 miles E. of 1 Kent's Group. The .Bermdndsey arrived yesterday,' having left Plymouth on the 26th December. She £as brought 231 Government immi grants to this port, who are classed, as- follows 58 married 7 couples, 57 single women, 54 single men, and 62 children. 'J here ^ have been three births on board during the passage; Not a single case of sickness or death -has ofceur red since leaving Plymouth, n The Immigrants-are nearly -all Irish, and principally agricultural ' labourers., No vessels connected with the colonies have been spoken during the voyage. * The,Launceeton, from,Newcastlejis bound to Melbourne, but was compelled to putin here forrepairs. Captain Spencer reports that shortly after leaving Newcastle, and when off Nobby's, the ves- ? iel's jibboom was carried away. On the 28th instant, when off - the Pigeon House, she - encountered' -a heavy . gale of wind from fhe southward, in which she sprang a large leak, and although '? the men were kept constantly at the -pumps since, they -could only justkeep her free. Captain Spencer- therefore thought itadvisa ble to return to this port.- ? | | The Beatrice has been 107 days on the -passage from Liverpool 1 to this port. 'Captain- Rogers reports having sighted on .the -8th March, in latitude 38* 47* S. longitude 8- 30- W., the ship Eu phrates from London, bound to New Zealand with troops. The Beatrice has been off Sydney Heads for two^ays. LHsM.S. Acheron was put up at ; auction on Monday, by^Iessrs. owden and Threlkeld, and ultimately knocked down to Messrs. 1 t-; A. Lloyd and Oo., for tlie 'sua1 of £2 150 ? — i The Caernarvon ha8'been «bBent -6even months from this port, : during 'Which'timeAe has-'been craisingon the west coast of New Zealand, and . has . been tolerably successful, having taken 560 1 barrels sper^ii She, put into Waugaroa,; having scurvy on board, land remained there ten days, but was obliged. to. leave two Of her . , jmen sick on the island.
