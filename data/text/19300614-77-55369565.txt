PASSING OF SAIL. FURLING THE WHITE WINGS. By " Junius." The following is a further instalment of ships with respect to the end of which information is available :--- IDA ZEIGLER: A favourite immi- grant ship of the sixties. She made in all eight voyages to Auckland, and many New Zealanders heard of the "Ida" with their cradle songs. She was lost at Napier anchorage on February 27th, 1868, during a heavy gale, and for once the shore authorities were brought in to blame for the disaster. MIDOMENE: A 1390-ton iron ship, built in 1874. She was the third of Fer- nie's "omones" and was stranded near East London in 1887. INCONSTANT: Running short of pro- visions while on a voyage from Ade- laide to Callao, this barque made for Wellington to recuperate, and stumbled over the then untidy door-step on the night of 19th August, 1850. She was salved and beached at what now is Lambton Quay. Probably from read- ing of old Pergotty's home in David Cop- perfield, the owner decided to roof her in, and for many years she did duty both as a landing stage and a ware- house.

She was bound from the Clyde to Mel- bourne when she was burnt in the South Atlantic. The French ship Roland took off 198 out ot a total of 216 souls and the other 18 perished. Illegally decant- ing spirits from the cargo with the aid of a naked light caused the trouble.
