A FARMER STATE. The cablegram announcing that the Victorian immigration commissioners had had no success in Denmark, is not surprising to anyone wno knows the conditions of that small, but pros perous State. Denmark is a farmer State, a country of peasant proprietors, and essentially a land of co-operation. About 90 per ceat. ct the farmers own their farms, and the average size of a farm is 39 acres. A generation ago the Danish farmer was threatened with extinc tion. To-day the country is cultivated like -1 market garden, and has captured the English market in butter, eggs, and bacon. Co operation has worked wonders for the farmers. Nearly 95 per cent, of the farmers are members of co-operative dairies, which ship Â£200,000 worth of butter every week to England. The ?Co- operative Egg Export Society has often been quoted for its methods, end exports nearly a. million and a half pounds worth of eggs a' year. Moreover, the co-operative societies buy as well as sell for their members, end through, them the farmer gets practically all he wants, from agricultural implements to clothes.
