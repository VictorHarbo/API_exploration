COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Saturday Evening. Export entries were passed today for 6,507 ouncesofgoldforshipmenttoEnglandui- Buej in the Columbian. An increased demand for shipment has imparted an upward movement to the local markets on the gold-fields, and prices have advanced about 6d. per ounce on last week's quotations. In Melbourne there has been very little doing. The bullion buyers quote the following rates Omeo gold, 6s. to 7s. 6d. ; Pleasant Creek and Goulburn 75s. to 75s. Ga, ; Bendigo, Castlemaine, and Jim Crow, 76s. 6d. to 76s. 6d. ; Ararat, Maryborough, Dunolly, Fiery Creek, Avoca, and Amherst, 77s. to 75s.; the Ovens, 77s- 6d. to 76s. ; Ballaarat, 76s. 6d. to 70s. 6d. The escorts which arrived in town yesterday brought down 49,103 ounces, against 34,90 ounces for the corresponding week of last year. This quantity is 7,178 ounces above the average of the first quarter of the year, and 8,818 ounces above! that of the second. It is also 1,438 ounces above that of 1857\. With the rise in price operating to encourage those among the miners who have been holding to come forward and realise, together with the abundance of water in all parts of the mining districts, a steady increase in the escorts is looked for during the next two or three months. Many of the less fortunate miners are, however, preparing to join the railway works, so soon as the extent of operations in hand creates a demand for their services, and the withdrawal of their labor from this branch of producing industry may possibly have some effect upon the yield of the goldfields for a while.

The previous shipments, corrected by comparison with the entries passed at the Customs, amounting to 1,422,018 ounces, bringing the total of the year up to 1,628,330 ounces, or, reduced to tons troy, to 63 tons 13 cwt. 2 15s. 10 lb. 10 ounces. The value at £1 per ounce amounts to £6,113,320. The shipments for the corresponding period of 1857 amounted to 1,671,990 ounces, giving that year an advantage over the current one of 143,606 ounces. The attempt at the fraudulent manufacture of nuggets, to which allusion was made in our last summary, has been altogether unpaced cessful, and no further specimens of theo 3 ingenious pieces of Chinese handiwork have been detected by the bullion brokers and Etssayers, notwithstanding that every parcel of gold has been very carefully examined since the attempt to dispose of them was nipped in the bud. The scheme of the "In- vendor" was simply to smelt the gold he obtained by purchase from his fellow-country Da en, reduce it about three carats, and then to re-introduce it into the market in the shape of very natural-looking nuggets. Buyers of any experience have acquired so thorough a knowledge of the appearance of the gold from the various districts that they can pronounce at once as to the locality from which any parcel submitted to them has been taken, and this practical knowledge at once operates as a complete check to the designs of unscrupulous schemes. In the instance to which allusion b made, none of the deteriorated specimens passed the first hands into which they were [placed, The monetary movements for the month have been important, although but little effect has been produced upon the even flow of colonial finance. The banks have commenced the system of advances for the public railway works on the deposit of 6 per cent. debentures, and are providing large sums fortnightly to meet the engagements of the Government with the eroitrnntorfl. The commencement of this financial operation was preceded by some tightness in the money market, which has been set down in a consequence of the arrangement It has arisen, however, more from the extreme dulness of trade than from the withdrawal of commercial accommodation to my extent. Buyers of goods on terms have found it difficult to realise in the time they had calculated on when entering into their engagements; and this, together with the fears of future supplies being in excess, hai ed to a general curtailment of transaction! to the smallest possible limit. The returns of f average weekly amounts of liabilities and assets during the second quarter of the year of the eight banks carrying on business in the colony, have been published in the Gazette, and they show, by comparison with the second quarter of 1867, that no diminution in the amount of discounts has taken place. In the subjoined comparative table of the averages of the two series, the liabilities and assets accounts re- present the transactions especially belonging to the colony of Victoria. The capital accounts represent the entire capitals, dividends, profits, c, of the branches of the several establishments all over the world. SAW; OF' AUSTRALASIA. Second Quarters. 1857\. 1858.

It will be seen that the amount of the in- debtedness of the colonists to the banks and of the banks to the colonists is pretty much the same for the second quarter of 1858 as it was for the corresponding period of 1857, In the third and fourth quarters of 1857 accommodation appears to have increased to the extent of nearly three-quarters of a million sterling, and to have been drawn in during the first quarter of the current year.

The banks have raised the selling; rate of exchange on England to 4 per cent, premium for 60 days' sight for largs | amounts, and to 11 per cent, premium for 30 days' sight for bills under £60. This movement is connected with the arrangement for the disposal of the railway debentures, and has been adopted by the banks as protective to their interests in the matter. It does not appear to arise from any serious diminution in the value of exports, or from the balance of trade being unfavorable to the colony. Freight on gold by sailing vessels is taken at from 2d. to 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London; insurance, 12 per cent.; by the overland route, ? per cent that is, 7d. per ounce as nearly as possible ; Insurance, 14 to 15 per cent. Outside the banks money is plentiful for mortgages and for building operations on freehold land, with sufficient margin, s from 10 to 12 per cent. Transactions have not been either large or numerous during the month. For commercial purposes the banks charge For girls under 95 days' currency, 8 per cent. ; from 66 to 126 days', 9 per cent.; over 125 days', 10 per cent.; and on overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent- There is nothing done in commercial paper outside the banks, except usurious rates of interest, and very little at these. There has been nothing done in Government debentures to call for quotation. Victorian 6 per cents, are out of the market, and the quotation in our list is a nominal one South Australian 6 per cents, and New Zealand 10 per cent, have been sold in small parcels. The stock and share market for local undertakings is firm, with a prospect of an advance. Colonial Bank shares have 1 changed hands at £5 19s and Hobson's Bay Railway shares at £74 10s. ; Colonial Insurance Company's shares at 16s. ; Melbourne Insurance at 13s. ; Australasian Insurance at £1 11s. and Melbourne Gas Company's shares at 35 per cent, premium. Many of the recent purchases of Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway shares have been for English account. The shares of the National Bank of Australasia and of the Bendigo Waterworks Company have been allotted, but have not yet been brought into the market by the allottees. Several periodical meetings of local joint stock proprietaries have been held during the month. The eighth annual meeting of the i shareholders of the Melbourne Gas and Coke Company was held on the 23rd ult., when Messrs. Robert Kerr, J. Carson, J. Dinwoodie, A. Sutherland, E. Cohen, and Thomas M'Com- j ble, M.L.C., were elected to the seats at the Board vacated by rotation. A dividend of 6 percent, for the half-year was declared. The financial statements of the Board were placed in the hands of the shareholders. The expenses for the half-year ending the 30th of June amounted to £16,984, and the receipt to £27,802. The sum of £2,500 was expended in the payment of interest on debentures, leaving the sum of £7,818 to be carried to the profit and loss account. The balance of that account now stands at £11,147. The gas rates for the half-year amounted to £24,000. The capital paid up amounts to £127,819; debentures, £60,000; reserved fund, £9,510; profit and loss account, £11,147; sundries. £7.648. The buildings and apparatus in use are valued at £139,014; stock in trade, £18,495; debts due. £20,310. The Melbourne Fire Insurance Company held the first half-yearly meeting on the 31st ult., when the report of the Board of Directors was brought up and adopted. The paid-up capital of the company amounts to £12,680, which sum the auditors certify has been invested with judgment, as regards both, its safety and convertibility. The premium account for the half-year amounted to £7,443 4s. 6d.; interest account, £310 6s. Id.; transfer fees, £42 5s. The preliminary expenses account, amounting to £1.381 Su. did., lender gradual liquidation from the revenues of the company, by instalments of 10 per cent. The balance of profit for the half-year amounted to £6,855 0s. ad-, which sum, under the 57th clause of the deed of settlement, has been carried to the reserve fund. Messrs. F. J. Bligh and Alexander Joske were elected to the vacant seats at the Board. A half-yearly general meeting of the proprietors of the Bank of Victoria was held on the 3rd instant, when a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum was declared. The net profit for the half-year were stated at £89,744, of which amount £25,000 was apportioned to the dividend account, £12,500 to the reserve- fund account, and £2,241 to the profit and loss account. The Hon. Mr. Henry Miller, Chief Commissioner of Customs, and Mr. Germain Nicholson were re-elected to the seats at the Board they had vacated by rotation, and Mr. William Nicholson was elected in the room of Mr. E. G. Bucknall, resigned. At the first annual general meeting of the Australasian Fire and Life Insurance Company, held on the 6th inst., Messrs. J. G' Francis, H. Langlands, and Thomas Loader were re-elected to their seats at the Board of Direction, and Mr. W. H. Tuckett, in the room of Mr B. Hawthorne, resigned. The report of the Directors was unanimously adopted, and a vote of thanks accorded for post services. Some discussion arose as to the method of disposing of the 25,000 new shares which are proposed to be issued, which ended in an arrangement by which 12,600 shares are placed at the disposal of the public at a premium of 10s. per share, the remaining 12,500 being divided pro rata among the shareholders at par. From the statement of accounts submitted, It appeared that a sum of £8,240 Is. Id. had been received during the half-year ending the 30th June, and that in the same period the disbursements of the company had amounted to £6,833 4s. 8d., leaving a balance of £1,406 16s. 5d. to the credit of profit and loss account Of this total of expenditure the sum of £8,821 Os. 2d. represents losses by fire paid or incurred, and £3,000 4s. 6d. the expenses of management. The assets of the company consist of a total of £131,155 7s. 10d., viz., un- called capital, £100,000; loans on mortgage, £26,700; interest, cash, effects, &c.; The liabilities consist of-liabilities in course of settlement, £1,025; interest received in advance, £43 19s. 6d.: subscribed capital, £125,000 and profit and loss, £5,086 8s. 4d. At the fourth annual general meeting of the proprietors of the Colonial Insurance Company, held on the 11th inst., the report of the Board, recommending a dividend of 10 per cent., was adopted after some discussion as to the necessity of carrying so large a sum Of £5,789-half the profits-to the reserve fund The retiring directors, Mr. John Curzon one Mr. George Lewis, were re-elected without opposition. The number of policies issued during the last 12 months was 2,199, and the amount of premiums £21,128. The net profit for the same period have been £11,570. I Two now joint-stock undertakings have been launched. The first general meeting of a new banking Institution, called the " National Bank of Australasia," was held on the 10th instant, when the provisional committee resigned their functions into the hands of the first board of directors Messrs. Andrew B. Cruikshank, Alfred Cumberland, Thomas Brown, George W. Porter, John Houston, and T.H. Lempriere. The preliminary expenses since the project was first started in 1857, have been £1,233. The capital paid up amounts, to £87,777 16. The provisional committee have made preliminary arrange meats for branches at London, MaY Sydney, Adelaide, and New Zealand's directors are now engaged in making the! necessary arrangements for the comm IT men of business. The bank will be porated by an Act of the Legislature, so T. as that body re-assembles. 38 The other new undertaking is of scarcely less importance, being one on the sucoS carrying out of which will depend whS. the present system of operations on thZu fields shall be subjected to a great revolt"? The object of the Bendigo VatoCta Company is to form one vast reserve!, ! the township of Sandhurst forT 2" of that municipality and of *h.TJT^c gold-fields with water at assesors year. The first general meeting of the tW holders was held on the 3rd inst., WCTU Provisional Committee handed over that! trust to the Board of Directors Messrs The Brown, on., Thomas Splatt, A. W. Gilles m Clarke, on, T. Lewis, and Adolphus Barnett: The report was, under the circumstances which have attended the establishment of the first great company in connection with the gold mining interests of the colony, as early a long document. The many nlflZT ties which have arisen in *S£¡+ tenure of the land were explained, M well 1 the correspondence to which these difficulties had led. The report was unanimously adopted. The whole of the area totaS verted into a reservoir will be excavated and the earth passed through powerful machines to be erected for the purpose, and thoroughly washed. Although the spot has been worked by hand many times over, it is calculated that the gold still remaining will repay the extra labor, and yield a handsome profit to its shareholders. The economy of labor in this; wholesale treatment of a deserted district has been proved by the experience of Clunes to be immense. Eight hundred and twenty-nine persons landed at the port of Melbourne during the week, consisting of 151 from the Australian colonies, 662 from the United Kingdom, H from Suez, 1 from Mauritius, and from the United States of America. The departures are computed at 200. The total addition to the population by the sea-board during the current year has been 18,439. Arrived. Departed.

Of this sum, how ever, £1,600 was obtained for a small allotment of 16 perches only, in the best position in the township. One town lot at BoverldgJ, on the Sydney-road, consisting of half an acre, was sold for £8- A country lot at Scoresby, on the Dandenong Creek, east of Nunawading, consisting of 129 acres, brought 15s. per acre; and a lot of similar decided tion at Ringwood, also east of Nunawading comprising 35 acres, sold at the rate of 6d,' per acre. The total amount of land alienated from the Crown at this sale was 192 acres 22 perches, and the sum realised £53,92312s. The last three weeks have been very dull ones as regards shipments. The export trade has been, in fact, almost stagnant, and there has been only ODO gold ship dispatched, The consequence is, that the values of exports and imports are nearly equalised, as will be seen from the following table, in which the declared values entered at the Customs, Melbourne are given weekly, of both imports and exports, up to the 7th instant, side by side with those of the same periods of the previous year : Week ending, " 80 Feb. 0 " IS " 26 s 27 March S " 13 " 26 s 27 April 3 " 10 " 17 " 21.

In wool there is nothing offering except fellmongers wool, and the uncertainty attends ing the result of the London May sales 1-4 checked all speculation. What the effect on prices of the advices received on Friday by the European will be cannot be ascertained If the present condition of the market. Tallow has not been affected, because the demand existing for local use is capable of absorbing all the parcels offering. The hide market has been depressed under the influence of the decline of from 1d. to 5d. per lb. in the home market. The import market continues in the same glutted condition that has existed throughout the year. Trade has been tolerably sound, but confidence has been upset to some extent by the results of speculation if one or two articles in which prices have fluctuated oats and flour, for instants. The great bulk of transactions has continued to be for consumption, and, as a consequence, the interior is not only not overstocked, but on the contrary, short of many leading articles. These are being supplied in the major ity of cases from the auction rooms, preference being given to cheapness over quality for the time being. The roads are lined with ladies drays on their way to the gold-fields depOM to an extent not usually seen' a this season of the year. The railway works have not yet given that stimulus to consumption which may be calculated on when steady employment at remunerative rates has become more general. The chronic grievance of excessive shipments is still as loudly proclaimed as ever, the markets being just in that state when buyers of known credit obtain the whip-hand, as mail after mail points to the possibility of shipments again exceeding the already too high average of the past 18 months. Great hopes are entertained by importers that the tenor of the advices despatched hence In April last, the first portion of which was in course of delivery in the 16th June, will do much to induce increased caution at the shipping ports, We subjoin tables, prepared from the official Customs returns, of the imports and exports at Melbourne for the months of July 1857-58, of the deliveries of dutiable goods for consumption, and of the stocks in bond now compared with those of the same period of 1857 : IMPORTS At the Fort of Melbourne during the month of July, 1868, compared with the corresponding period of 1856 and 1857 : VALUES IMPORTS.

By arrivals in the Bay, yesterday, we have later papers from Sydney, Adelaide, Hobart Town, Launceston, and the Cape of Good Hope, but are compelled to withhold extracts. We have received the following from the Station-master of the Electric Telegraph Office : TO inst EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-in reply to the extract which appeared in your paper of the 12th inst. from the bom Australian Register, accusing this office or ÎVT5lnB ?. Port and; certain messages wife from that Journal, I beg to remark to, a report in question was, car stated To ceived at this office at 8.80 a.m. ; also a message for the South Australian Advertiser, much about the same time. A report was also being received from Queenscliffe for the Register at the same time, and knowing their correspondent was not aware of it, I thought it advisable to wait a few minutes until it was completed, to ascertain which was of the most importance to send first; and in the mean- time the short message to the Advertiser was transmitted. Unfortunately about this time the communication was interrupted, so that the report could not be forwarded till the following morning. With reference to the messages from that journal, in consequence of the continual interruptions of the line, they were not received at this office until 8.45 p.m. on Tuesday. It may not be amiss to add, that the interruption was caused by altering the positions of some posts on the line, and that, consequently, no messages were received from Adelaide on that day. T. B. JAMES, Station-Master, Melbourne Central Office. Electric Telegraph Office, Hall of Commerce, Aug. li. MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRICES CURRENT. The Argus Office, Saturday Evening. The Import market has presented a continued and almost unexampled state of inactivity. The irregularity of the arrival of the mail steamer leaving the amount of coming supplies unknown has mainly deterred dealers from purchasing to any extent, andthosalos of the past month have, in all articles, been exclusively confined to small amounts for the supply of immediate wants. Prices, however, have been sustained, and generally speaking there is little or no change to report in the leading articles of importation. Stock] in second hands and in the country townships are admitted to be of very limited amount, but as the lately received advices show no indication of decrease in exports from the home markets, prices are not Arm. Business generally is healthy. Light stocks of some few articles of trifling importance may create an improved value for them, butBUppllos generally are far too large to admit a hope of any beneficial alteration. Liquors. The demand for both ale and porter has been generally light, even for this season of the year, and prices have slightly declined. When, as is the present case, the demand is comparatively trifling, the most preferred brands alone are inquired for, over reduced prices not inducing sales of less approval sorts. Sales of Bass's No. 3 Burton ale have within the last few days been made at from 3!. 10s. to 82\. 12s. 6d. ; Ind, Coope and Co. 's, at St. ; Gundry. Down, and Co.'s Dorset ale, at 72. 5s. to 1930's., and Sheffield are, at 62 16s. per head. In draught porter so little has been done as barely to call for remark, and prices are unchanged, and, Indeed, all but nominal. bottled beer have been in very little demand. Within the last few days, however, there has been more activity and the intelligence by the mail of a decline in amount of shipments for this market has tended to give a firmer tone to prices. Sales of Byass's (the most preferred brand), two-thirds porter and one of me, have, however, been effected to-day at 9s. 6d. per dozen. Harper's (ale only) has been placed at 10s., and porter of same bottling at 8s. 6d. per dozen, Both ale and porter In pints are still scarce, and, being much wanted, find ready sale at very full rates. We quote ale and beer (duty paid) Ale- Bass's, had., 81. 10s. to 82. 12s. 6d. ; Ind, Coope, and Co.'s, 82. ; Other Burton, do,, 62. 10s. to 72. 10s.

Wines have been in very light inquiry, and sales of insignificant amount. Good sound medium sorts 1 of ports and sherries are the most saleable sorts, and for those kinds prices are well sustained. In light wines little or nothing is doing, the present season precluding any extensive demand. Sales of Hunt's single diamond are reported at 632 and treble at 632. per pipe. By auction, Couson's sherry has been placed at from 662. to 602 and low class at 542. per butt. Quotations are Burgundy, 30s. to 40s. ; cham pagne, 25s. to 10s. ; claret, 22s, to 28s. ; port, 25s. to 45s. ; sherry, 21s. to 35s. per dozen. In wood Fort from £60 to £85 per pipe ; sherries, £10 to £100 per but, according to quality, ranging from ordinary to fine Spirits. - The demand, though of very limited! amount, has been steady, and prices, although InsufA olently changed to alter quotations, have an improved tendency. Martell's brandy has been placed at 11s. 6d. per gallon to day, Otard'd has brought 13s., 13s. 6d., and as high as 18s. 9d. at auction. United Vineyard Company's, 11s. and sales of Snzorao's are reported at 13s. per gallon. United Vineyard Company, in case, is scarce, and being la inquiry, holders are asking 10s. per dozen ; In other brands not much is doing. Sum has slightly improved 1 in inquiry, but prices are unaltered, sales having been effected within the last few days at Is. 6d. for low strength, and 4s. 6d. to 6s, par a gallon for high proof West India sorts. lia nova of best brands is in moderate demand, and, In parcels of limited extent, of ready sale at about l6s. 6d. per case. Old tom is not much in inquiry colorless pal cols are alone saleable, and those at nothing above quotations. Whiskey-There is at last some business, although of very trifling extent, doing in this article ; sales of pure white Scotch have been erected at from 1s. to 4s. 6d. per gallon and for good bottled Highland brands there is improved inquiry, although at unimproved rates. The following prices continue to be the ruling rates (in bond) :-Brandy --Martoll's, dark, 14s. 6d. to 3s. 9d. per gallon ; do. Hennessey's, 14s. to 14s. 8d. do. ; do. Otard's, 15s. to 15s.

Reported heavy shipments in the early part of the month from South Australia caused a depression in the flour market here, and induced a disposition to hold back from purchasing, as well as a trifling decline in prices, and to the present date the market has continued generally will give, no speculative demand exists, and the trade appear careless of purchasing to any extent beyond their actual requirements. Holders are, however, generally firm, and although no prospect of advance on present rates is apparent, stocks on hand being sufficient for all requirements, and small though continuous supplies constantly coming to hand from the Western Districts and Tasmania, no decline of any importance in value is anticipated. Boxall and Gallego sorts are light In stock, but in moderate demand only, holders asking from SSE. to 252. per ton. Adelaide sorts soil from 191 to 192 10s, for old, and 202 to 262 10s. for near; Tahara, via, 172. 10s, to 182 10s. per ton. Wheat is the only description of grain for which any real demand exists, and good grinding samples are of ready sale at from 8s. 6d. to 8s. 10d. A Ana parcel of South Australian growth has been placed during the weak at 9s. per bushel. (Stocks in the country districts are reported as being generally well supplied, with the exception of the northern townships, where supplies are somewhat short. Oats. The market for this kind of grain is very unsettled. Large quantities purchased at high rates on speculation are still held, heavy arrivals continue to come to hand from the United Kingdom, large and unlooked for parcels have been received from Callfor j ia, and with equally unexpected, although certainly not extensive arrivals from Calcutta, the condition of the markets anything but cheering; and, in the belle: iii at prices must recede still further, buyers ksor aloof,andlntho meantime all other descriptions of horse- feed, with the exception of bran, are utterly neglected and almost unsaleable. Renton and TrUth are not worth above 6s. to 6s. 8d. ; Californian, 6s 8d. ; Danish, 6s. ; Calcutta, 6s. 4d. to 6s. 6d.; colonial, 6s. 6d. to 6s. 3d. per bushel. Barley, except for prime lots of English suited for malting purposes, is in no demand what ever. Considerable importations have been received from California, which move off slowly at about 6s. 3d. per bushel. Colonial-grown Cape sorts sell In small lots at from 5s. to 6s. 3d. and English, fit for malting, at from 6s. to 6s. 6d. per bushel. Maize comes to hand freely from New South Wales, but to a dull market, at from 5s. 6d. to 5s. per bushel. Grain has been much influenced in value by the declined value of oats, and moves off heavily at from about 1226. to 122 10s. per ton. Bran is in brisk demand again, and although ample supply last week reduced prices to 3s. 10d., improved inquiry has caused a rally, and sales have to-day been readily effected at from 2s. 9d. to 2s. 2d. per bushel for good sweet sorts. Malt has been largely supplied, and in the absence of improved inquiry, is of dull sale at declining rates. Quotations are Wheat, colonial, 8s. 6d. to Og. ; oats, Scotch and Irish, 6s. to 5s. 8d., colonial, 6s. 9d. to 5s 3d.; Danish, 6s.; Calcutta, 5s. 3d. to 5s. 9d.;; Cape barley, 6s. to 6s. 3d. ; English, 6s. to 6s. 6d. ; maize, 5s. 6d. to 6s. per bushel ; grain, 122. to 122. 10d. per ton ; malt, 9s. 6d to 10s. per bushel. Groceries. Teas continue to maintain a firm position. The chief demand is for sound useful sorts of both black and green, and for these descriptions there is a steady, well-supported domino!, and, as the trade in this article is confined to few hands, existing rates are unlikely to be permitted to decline. CObo. Thore is no change whatever to report in the TOIUO of this article, and demand at this period of the year is usually the largest, and prices are consequently firm. Stocks, however, are by no means excessive, and being in few hands, no decline in present a Sugars Since the commencement of the month. several arrivals from Mauritius have occurred, and having been at once submitted to the trade by auction, have afforded a fair test of the market value. Stocks in second hands are acknowledged to be of no important extent, and the prices obtained at the auction sales of the past week may therefore be freely taken as the actual market value, and we therefore quote the prices obtained, viz., middling to Qm yellow, 122. to 192. 5s.; middling to fine brown, 812. to 402 10s. and good yellow crystals, 432. 2s. 6d. to 12, 5s. per ton, Cossipore sugar has been of course influenced by the decline in prices of Mauritius sorts, and for Mo. 1 white not above 602. per ton can be quoted, and this indeed is almost a nominal price, of, although demanded by holders, it is most unwillingly paid even for small lots. We therefore continue to quote Teas Congou, good to fine, 92. to 102 per chest ; do,, ordinary, 72. 7s. to 82. 8s. ; inferior, 6d. to 72\. per chest; do. 10 catty box, 12. is. to 12. 8s. loch; orange pekoe, do,, 1217. 6d. to 22. 2s. 6d. each; gunpowder, 2s. 9d. to 3s. per lb. ; hysonskin, 01\. to 14. 10s. per chest.

Oilmen's stores have been in a steady though not ex. tensive demand for the greater number of articles comprised under this head, and prices are fairly supported at the same time it must be remarked that entire invoices are by no means of ready solo, buyers preferring purchasing only such goods as they find of ready Sale. Bottled fruits, jams, and jellies, are In steady request. Sales of the latter articles have been to-day effected at from 16s. 9d. to 16s. per dozen. Starch is in good demand, and rather scarce ; sales have made at 6]d. holders are, however, generally asking 7d per lb. Oatmeal is also much inquired for, and holders of sound sweet parcels are asking from 392. to 400. per ton. Pearl barley is also in more inquiry, and sales are reported at from 282. to 802. per ton. Sardine!! have improved in demand, and although no alteration in values has occurred, there is considerably more inquiry, and sales of halves are reported at from Os. 6d. to 10s. per dozen. Lobster and salmon are dull, and in but light inquiry. American lobster, in 1 lb. tins, cannot be quoted above 9s. to 9s. 6d. Pre- served Oysters are also in but little demand, and may be quoted at 17s. to 18s. 6d. per dozen for 1 lb. tins, and 22s. to 24s. for 2 lb. tins. Soda crystals are very light in stock and holders firm, consequent on the advices of continued small amount of shipments. Buyers do not, however, seem disposed to purchase at high rates, and beyond 162. per ton is barely obtainable for any quantity. Quotations are Blue, 6d. to 9d. per lb. : fruits, bottled, 18s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. per doz. ; jams and j cities, 1-lb. jars, 16s. 6d. to 16s. per doz.; lobsters, 1-lb. tins, American, 9s. to 9s. 6d. do.; mustard, in bulk, 6d. to 63d. per lb.: do., in 1-lb. bottles, 15s. to 128. per doz. ; do., In 1-lb. bottles, 7s. 6d. to 8s. 6d. do.; oysters, preserved, 1-lb. tins, 16s. to 17s. 6d. do. ; do,, 2-lb. tins, 12. 2s, to 12. 5s. do. ; pickles, quarts, 10s. 6d. to 18s. do. do., pints, 6s. 6d. to 9s. do. salad oil, pints, 12s, to 18s. per doz. do., ball-pints, 6s. 6d. to 7s. do. ; salmon, preserved, this, 18s. to 19s. per doz. ; sardines, halves, 9s. 6d. to 10s do. ; do., quarters, 6s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. do. ; sauces, assorted, half- pints, 7s. 6d. to 10s. do. : starch (Col man's), 6d. to 7d. per lb.; vinegar, mown (Cham- pion's 24), 1s. 10d. to 3s. per gallon. Candies. The demand throughout the month has been light. The hitherto extensive use of this article has been superseded in the deep-sinking on the gold fields by the substitution of oil where practicable ; stocks in town have consequently largely accumulate!, and the demand having decreased, lower prices are necessarily submitted to nor is there probability of any speedy increase on present rates. Importers' prices may, however, be quoted a Adamantine, per lb., 1s. 2d to 1s. 3d. ; Fairfield sperm, do., Is. 10d. to 1s. 1d. ; Bale's, do., Is. lJd.tols.2d.; Neva stearine, do,, Is.

English cheese, of good quality and well-conditioned, is of ready sale, and about 16d. per lb. Is easily procurable for good lots, Irish mess pork Is inquired for, although not to any extent, but quotations are well supported. Butter Until the last few days there has been but little animation In this article, the chief demand being for small lots for the supply of country orders. The intelligence, however, that the May shipments barely exceed 1,100 firkins, has given a firmer tone to the market, and sales of prime lots of double rose Cork have been made at 2s. 2d. to 2s. 3d. per lb. Large quantities of Inferior and unsound provisions, of every description, also constantly offering by auction, but the prices procured afford no guidance whatever for the value of sound parcels. Coals.-Notwithstanding the demand consequent on the season, there is no improvement to record in prices. English household coals are not worth more than 22\. ft to 22. 10s per ton on the wharf, and Newcastle (colonial) can be purchased at a rather easier rates. Cordage Stocks on hand are exceedingly heavy of all descriptions, and no change whatever in value can be at present looked for. Earthenware and glass are still SO heavily over supplied, as to be not only difficult of sale, but to afford no quotations, and when of sorts unsuited for general use, are in fact unsaleable. Fish, Dried. Supplies continue in excess of demand, and prices are consequently wholly unchanged. cod-fish, in good condition, is moderately saleable at about quoted rates. Red herrings are still scarce, and any arrivals in good condition will command high rates. Elec.- Arrivals of this article have come somewhat heavily to hand, and having been immediately submitted by auction to the trade, have caused a decline in value of late rates, and beyond 242. per ton cannot be procured for best samples of Patna. Salt Coarse descriptions are again in demand, and may be quoted at from 82. to 82 12s. 6d., at which rate sales have been effected by auction. Fine sorts are, however, in less repute, and do not realise oven equivalent rates, stoved salt not being saleable at beyond 82, per ton. states-The trade having fully supplied themselves at the extensive sales duringthe previous month, there has been comparatively but little doing and although arrivals have been by no means extensive, the demand has been insufficient to improve prices, and we quote duchess size at 182 10s. to 142. 10s. ; countess, was. Ills, to 102. ; viscountess, 72. to 82. ; ladies, 82 10s. to 42 per 1,000. Paints, Oils, ice. There is no change of any importance to report in the value of these articles, nor is there improvement in demand. Chinese oil has declined to 4s. 6d. to 4s. 11d. and Colza can be purchased at from 1s. 1d. to 5s. per gallon. Haps. There is no improvement whatever either in demand or value for this article. Now Kent and Sussex pockets are alone saleable, and only in very small lots, while foreign and old samples are utterly -unsaleable. Ironmongery and Hardware Supplies of both English and American manufacture are still largely in excess of requirements or demand, and the ruling rates are such as must leave, for nearly all articles, heavy losses to the importers. Quotations may be considered as market prices for goods when inquired for by the trade, but forced sales would produce much lower rates. We quote :<-Axes- Hart's, Collins's, 22, 8s. to 22. 15s. per dozen ; do. handled, do., 6s. 10d. to 8s.

Sheet lead has improved in demand, and for selected weights Increased prices can be readily procured. Tin plates are in better inquiry, and may be quoted at from 20 to 80 per cent. advance on in Tolco prices for useful marks. All descriptions of Iron suited for rooting and building purposes are in steady and somewhat improved demand. Staffordshire rod and bar sorts are, owing to excessive Blocks, wholly unimproved in value and still dull of sale, 142. to 122. per ton being still highest ruling prices. Quicksilver is in better inquiry, and, being in few hands, prices are fully supported.

Harbor-The arrivals of Baltic timber have of late been of light amount, and the demand being brisk, prices have assumed a firmer position, although without any important increase. Considerable arrivals of American lumber have come to hand, and prices for this description of timber are easier. As present rates, however, barely repay cost and expenses, a decline in shipments and consequent improvement in prices may fairly be looked for. (quotations are Baltic deals, red, 918, figd. to 6d. 11 x 8,0. to 7d. ; 9 x 3,1, 2, 3, and 4 cuts, 5d. to 7d. ; white, 9s, 3d. to 6d. a 11s, (9d. to Old, flooring, cross- cut, drain, OxlJ inch, land. to land. ; do. do., 6 by a running, 10d. to 11d.; to, 2s. 6d. to 8s. per foot; cedar, inch boards, and. to find, per foot; or, per 100 ft. sup., 122. to 12. 6s.; laths V.O.

Tobacco. The late arrivals have tended to depress the market rates for this article. The return of stocks in bond, however, shows but 046,600 lbs., and as shipments from the United States are expected u be of light amount only, a continuance of present rates may be fairly reckoned on.

HAS MARKETS-The quantity at market during the week has not been large, 416 loads only having been brought in. The demand has, however, been very dull, and last week's rates have been with difficulty supported. We quote best hay, 72. 10s. to 82 10s. ; second class, 62. 6s. to 72. ; inferior and stained, Bl. to 62. ; straw, 32. 10s. to 12 per ton. WOOL, TALLOW, again wool there are no sales to report. At this season of the year the chief lots offering are of fellmongers' sorts, in the value of which there is no change. Tallow-The demand for local use keeps the prices of this article buoyant, as, although a few small shipping lots have been disposed of, there is not sufficient demand for export at presonttoinfluonce prices. Messrs. Clough and Co. report having effected sales at the following rates viz., 402. to 462. per ton for beef and mixed and 602. to 632. Cheaper ton for mutton. Hides are in no demand whatever for shipment, the lately received advices of rates in the home market holding out no inducement for shipments. Sheepskins have been pro- portionately affected by the reports of the home wool sales, and considerable decline in value has occurred, the ruling rates being from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 3d. each. LIVE STOCK. Fat Cattle The supply at market has shown considerable deficiency on that of the previous M eck, and as the condition of the greater portion of the stock offered did not exceed middling quality, and the demand being generally brisk, the prices of good and prime sorts rallied and resumed previous ruling rates, while inferior descriptions were all but unsaleable. Prime beef may be quoted at from 30s. to 34s per 100 lbs. ; or bullocks from 102\. to 132. ; cows, from 7!. to 102. 10s.; middling and inferior quality, from 18s. to 27s, per 100lbs., or bullocks from 62. 10s. to 92. ; cows, from 42, to 120s. per head. Messrs, Dalmahoy Campbell and Co advise having offeotodsales.of 260 head from Gipps Land, a mixed lot, at, for bullocks, from 62. 15s. to 102. ; heifers, ii. 10s. to 92. Es. ; and a lot of 79 head of inferior quality, at from 82. 10s. to 72. 15s. each. Mr. William Hurst also disposed of a lot at from 62 to 122\. 15s. each for bullocks, and 62. 15s. to 102 16s. for cows. Number at market about 1,200 head. Work- ing bullocks There has been a fair amount of In- quiry, but no teams having been offered, prices are unchanged. Store cattle are in lOsS inquiry, and for inferior lots there is no demand whatever. Prices of good mixed lots may be quoted at from 65s. to 72s. per head, according to quality, to. Messrs. D. Campbell and Co. report having sold 600 head of young cattle, mixed sexes, at 81. each, to be delivered in the western district. Calves are only moderately supplied, and for any of good quality fair prices were obtained at rates ruling from 40s. to 50s. each, according to quality, Mr William Hurst reports a sale of 30 head at an average rate of 13s, 8d. each; and Messrs. D. Campbell and Co. advise having made a sale of! 75 head of rough sorts at from 45s. to 50s. each. Fat sheep were short supplied at the commencement of the week, and anything like good quality brought extreme rates. Towards the close a fuller supply came forward, but being for the most part of inferior quality, the greater portion had to be sent out unsold. Good fair wethers were sold at the opening of the market at from 25s. to 20s. per head, but towards the close of 24s. had to be submitted to. Good owes brought from 14s. to 16s. per head ; middling and inferior wethers from 10s. to 19s. ; ewes from 10s. to 12s. Messrs. Power and Rutherford report having sold 1,000 good wethers at from 28s. 6d. to 21s. 6d. ; 800 middling wethers at from 20s. to 22s. and 1,009 ewes at from 10s. to 16s. 6d. per head. Store sheep continue to be much inquired for, and for clean lots on the run from 16s. to 16s. 6d. for wethers, and from 11s. to 18s, for ewes, could be readily procured. The near approach of the shearing season renders proprietors unwilling to sell, and several stationshlthorto for sale have consequently been withdrawn until after shearing. LABOR MARKETS-The aspect of this market still cheerless, and, with the exception of a trifling demand for rough labor, there has been no Inquiry during the week for country service of any description. The sea- son for ploughing and sowing being past, there is, of course, no requirement for farm servants. The sup- position as to the number of men likely to be required on the railway works appears to have been erroneous, as far more hands are offering than are required, and altogether we report the labor market as overstocked, without, unfortunately, any appearance of early improvement. For male domestics there is about the usual demand. tradesmen, mechanics, and skilled laborers, however, continue to complain of inability to procure employment at even reduced rates of wages, and there cannot be a doubt but that labor of every description is supplied far above any present possible requirements. Married couples with young families have great difficulty in procuring situations. Female domestics, thoroughly competent to the performance of household work, more especially with respectable reference, readily obtain engagements ; but numbers of young women unaccustomed to service are unemployed. Rates of wages are by no means firm. The following, however, continue to be the nominal rates, with variations to meet particular cases with rations, married couples, without families, 700. to 800. per annum ; ditto with families, (difficult to obtain employ), 652. to 702. ditto ; gar donors, 602. to 762. ditto; grooms, 20s. to 30s. per week ; shepherds, 852. to 102 per annum ; hut keepers, 202, to 262. ditto : general farm-servants, 20s. per week ; first-class ploughmen, 26s. per week ; bullock-drivers, on road, 25s. ditto; do. on stations,203. ditto; men cooks, 20s. to 25s. ditto and professed cooks, 32. ditto ; female ditto, from 852. to 462. per annum ; general servants, 25. to 802. ditto ; nurse maids, 182. to 252. ditto. SEAMEN'S WAGES There is no alteration to report in this branch of labor; the demand for seamen continues brisk, but hands come forward freely, and the following continue to be the rates at which hands can readily be procured. viz. For India or China 21 uuuK, 49. ; China, india, or west coast of America and England, 42. ; coasting voyages, 12. 10s. to 62., and England direct, 42. to 42. 10s. a month. ADELAIDE. (FROM OUR COMMERCIAL HaTCHER.) (BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAm.) Saturday, August 11, 2.30 p.m. Flour is coming forward more freely, and larger lots are on offer than for some time past, but holders will not accept lower rates. A decline is looked for, Pollard is in demand at 1s. 8d. per bushel.
