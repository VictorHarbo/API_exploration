Experienced moderate westerly winds to the night of the 12th, and moderate easterly winds the remainder of the passage. The Ceara was sailed through the Narrows on Monday morning. The Albceba, from London, is an old friend ef superior build, having been built at Moulmein, of teak, and put together about as strongly as wood and copper can be combined. Long ago she brought immigrants, and upon her arrival on Monday looked little the worse for wear. Nearly everything on board is teak, including the decks, bulwarks, cabin fittings, and probably the windlass. Recently, to economize, she has changed from a ship' to a barque, and the process has not improved her appearance; still she looks like one of the erood old ships that hut for a hundred years. The voyage has been of an ordinary character. The master reports leaving London on August 23, Gravesend 24th, and Torbay September 3. The wind after her final departure was favourable, but light, and on October 6 Bhe cressed the Lino in 18° 56'. The trades were moderate; fine weather, how ever, lasted tQl the craft reached 21° S., where a strong breeze set in. The Cape was passed on November 6 in 41° S., and on November 23 St. Paul's. On December 13 the vessel made Cape Borda, and spoke the steamer Kangaroo on :i the passage. On November 16 William £(-?« .-lEeld, an able seaman, went to bed at 4 gY\ -.k, and at 7 he was found dead in his bunk. KING GEORGE'S SOUND SHIPPING. Arrived.
