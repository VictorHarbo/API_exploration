They toured in Eutciand. Soot land, and Denmark, and alto visited Paris.. In Denmark .Mr. Stacy had the oppor tunity of conferring with the Foreign Office, and he was courteously received. He was impressed with the people and their delightful and prosperous count:1}'. At the invitation of the Hull and Barna Icy Railway Company, accompanied by the South Australian Trade Commissioner iu lxmdon, and Mr. Campbell, the Aus tralian representative on the Imperial Trade Commission, Mr. Stacy visited. Hul', and was shown the facilities provided by ample wharfs, docks, stores, &c;, for hand ling oversea produce. He was . njuch in terested as an underwriter to eee that frozen meat was slung from the steamers' right into the cold stores, with a mini mum delay in handling. '? ' The .extensive' ' docks under construction for' the two railway companies were also visited. These are nsaring completion, and.

' * .Mr.: Stacy iiriade enquiries ,i«egarding 'im- migration, botlijh .'J£bgland-and Denmark, and was -gratified to -find that Australia was looked iipph jas a ' coiintiy' difeiing gr.eat attractions to settlers. Sir-George Reid, he considers, is doing great work on behalf - pf V: the Commonwealth, never njifcsingfah ppportuni ty of ?' pushing its:. in- ' tiertstis as occasions occur. The return of Major Norton to his old position as Trade Commissioner bad given much satisfaction, and Mr. McCann left behind him an excel lent reputation on relinquishing the posi tion. The idea of exhibiting and lectur ing at. the shows .held in leading centres of the .United Kingdom gave this State a really good advertisement. This was de motiKfcrated at the London Grocers' Exhi bition, which Mr. Stacy visited, at the ? Agricultural Hall, with the Trade Com missioner on «3eptefnber 21. Both the -..V»nmonwetlth and this State had tfo playe of produce, and the South Austra lian exhibit wae certainly the more eredic ahle. being -larger, and the quality of tli-i exhibits .was better- Tlie Trade CommK tfioner's idea of issuing circulars showing where- South Australian produce can bv' purchased in London . was businesslike. Mr. 'Stacy was of opinion that if traders and;, producers here fully realised the pos ?^ihililies of trade and the markets exist ing -for produce they would assist in mak ing our exliibits at these, ehows even a greater suc-oess. There was a growing en - quirj' for Australian produce, am] Major Norton had certainly secured the good will ot the Efiffliuh newspapers, judging by their, full reports of the South Australian exhibits at the- shows.
