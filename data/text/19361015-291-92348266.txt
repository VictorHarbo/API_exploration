DANISH SETTLERS FOR W.A.? Suggested Taking Over Of Abandoned Settlements The possibility of abandoned and other holdings on group settlements in Western Australia being taken over by Danish immigrants is being closely con. sidered by the Consul-General- for Den mark (Mr. G L. Hoest), who has re turned to Perth from a visit to groups to assess possible openings for Danes. Danish diplomatic and consular re Dresentatives. he said, had been asked to study the migration position in the countries in which they resided and. in view of the tajk about migration, it was thought that Danish people might be allowed to settle in Australia. He had found that the farms on the settle, ments would be quitev good if worked properly, and would be satisfactory if conditions offered by the Government were such that they could profitably be' taken over for dairying by Danes. Mr. Hoest added that he would dis cuss the matter with the Agricultural Bank Commissioners.
