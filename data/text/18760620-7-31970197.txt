The Advertiser. TUESDAY, JUNE 20, 1876. AFTER an adjournment of over a fort-<*> night, the Parliament will meet on Wed- <*> nesday, when it is expected the new Go- <*> vernment will main a full declaration of their, policy.

If they, with the asti.t?nce of Mr, Oolton and the rest, Piare agreed ?n * policy which will meet the present ne- Msuonate demand for progress which has been put forward" during the IasV tw?lve .months, then we ?aa only say ihat< one of them must hare very^'con siderably modified his previously ex pressed views.
