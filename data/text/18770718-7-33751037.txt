There is & fine roomy deck house for officers and men, with compartmsnts set aside for cooking and engine purposes, and in every respect the vessel is a fitting type ot the many improvements in naval architecture. It was some time on Mouday bight before tie v cenol was discovered bysfae<baarding-boat,for she made a long tack off and anchored well to she northward, in a position where she was not seen until the a&lbhor; light was set. 'The master was here in active en .ploy ma£?<;saisago,~ and'htt at various times tad ?bar?? of MtA. Orient, the Qoaen Bae, and tbfi'lbmmopyla, ?md_hi? present ship was specially.builttoriinn. This is but her secoad trip, and the master speaks very highly in hsr favor. She left London on May 3, and on the morning of the 7th was off. the Lisard. On the liollowntg day fell in with a lot of wreokage eonsi?ttngof half a boat, casks, and other loose deck- gear. The weather continued very plea sant until the 45? north. 9? west, where the .ship was struck by a sudden squall from the ' westward. The foresail and topsails were split, and some of the head canvas shared the same fate. Finally a hard gale from *he westward set in, and continued till in 36? north, 14? west, when it moderated, and soon after the trades set in and continued from 34? {north to within seven degrees of the line, which was crossed on Sunday, June 3, in 26? S0r W. The south-east trades set in early, and on June 11 sh; paesed Trinidad. laght S.W. winds followed to the meridian of the Cape, which was crossed oa Saturday, June 33, in 43|? south. Then fol lowed a good run across the Southern Ocean, and on several occasions she stepped out over 300 miles cm successive days. The passage of .the Southern Ocean was marked by a very heavy gale, which happened in 42? south, 66? east, when several sails were split and others blown away. -On Tuesday, June 10, she reached the meridian-of the Leu win-in 86? south, and on Sunday morning sighted Cape' Borda, and tacked to the northward till sighting theNep tunes. She then made a lead through the Straits, and signalled the Glenelg Jetty on Monday night. The ship is of long draught, con sequently she will not go into harbor lor stfew days. The Johamt, brig, is under Danish colors, And when she was seen from the station on Hondaynignt a fruitless chase after her ensued. She tacked off shore and completely baffiei pursuit until next morning at daylight, when she was boarded near the bell buoy, and being ifr .JCT?wi into liKrfwj- feM-a{i?Jl?> E >._ ?t otira? mmA* signal tot steam and was towed to the wharfs.

She had some very bad weather on leaving, and the nor'-ea^t trades were far southetlyt so it wasaome time-before the tone was crossed. After rounding the Cape there followed a aeries of very heavy gales, during which ths vessel ran along under close reefed topsaOs, but on the 16m June, in te? 26' south 6? 20' east a heavy sea broke after the vessel and buried her in one moun tainous wave, which smashed the wheel, the skylights, and binnacle, and washing away forwards carried the carpenter over the raiL He was a steady fellow named John Bramner, and bis "loss was the most mdau choly event of the voyage. On Tuesday morning the anchor -was weighed, in order to shift the . ship to tine roads, and there was a bare prospect of her going into harbor, bat the wind fell light, and the vessel remained till next day. The Lady Kinoaird took advantage of a flow of west wind on Tuesday, and sailed info the river, but it became calm, and she was com pelled to anchor.
