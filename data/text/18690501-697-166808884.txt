The fhtp Caihaya, Captain Patcreon, arrived on 25th April from I.ocuon alter a passage of 104 days, and although a vefsel pos si seed of considerable speed, the very adverse wlads she baa had to contend azutoet in the earlier portion or her run out yrecl uded the possibility of making the ordinary passage. Captain Patcr son tiaUr that he left the Downs on the 8th January, and passed the Start t'oiut on the 10th January be had very heavy E.W. gales after leaving the Channel, nu.4 very bad trades on both sides the equator, which was crossed on the 13th February it longitude 27*10 W. The meridian of Greenwich was ciosecd on the 17th March, and be ran dowD bis longitude on a parallel of latitude 45* S., carrying good W.N.W. winds to the tioulb Cape of Tasmania, which wasrouudedoa the I7tb April. Eihcetbcn northerly winds have prevailed up to the 24tu, when he had 'a heavy gale from the W.6.W. The Catbaya is In beau t.ful order, anfl la to the consigument of 'Messrs. Young, Lark, and Co- ? REtc^KP FBpu Dbownikg— On Saturday night, during a violent f quail, the Post Office boat, with two of mc Government crew, named B. Connolly and B. Macuamarra, were returning ' from delivering a mail on board of an outward- bound vessel, and wfcer midv.&y; between Kirribili Point and the Cove they heard a cry of distress. Pulling at ouce in the direction of the sound, they fortunately succeeded in pick-ng up two men nearly ex hausted who bed been capsized in & boat. They proved to belong to the ship Planet, and had had the lifeboat out sailing, aua in a f quail sfcg had go&e; over end sunk from under tbem, briog bal* laetcd with iron. But for the timely presence of the post- office boat . the men would doubtless have been drowned. The abip Granite City, Captain Leslie, sailed from the Isle of Wight on the '9th January, and reportB that very heavy westerly gales were encountered in the entrance of the Cbauocl, the wind holding from thatquarter as far as latitude 26*N. The Eqa»tor was ci cased on 12th February in longitude 25 W„ and good S.E. trades wercmet with ,wblch carried the vessel into latitude 20*8. 'Tristan d'Acunba was sighted on 2nd March, but strange to say, . ca&U;'riv winds and thick rainy weather prevailed in the vicinity of the island. The meridian of the - Cape of Goad Hope w&£ passed on 12tb- - March, and her easting was made between the parallels of latitude 44* and 45 - 6., with variable winds end weather. Oathe 18th March a heavy gale from north-east set in, which lasted some days, attended with .much ruin, and & prevalence of easterly weather, which forced the vessel south of Van' Dlemcn'e Land, and will account for her somewhat long passage. The Granite City is consigned to Messrs. Gflchrffit. Watt, and Co. The bng Western Star, Captain Tarpie, exiled from Cheriban ,ori the 4 th March, experienced light variable winds and calms to Java Head, which was passed on the lltb ; sighted Christmas Island oh the 46th, acd got the S.E. trades the same date which were light ; lost them again o& the 22nd in latitude 22*60 8. and longitude 100 *00 E., from thence to Cape Leuwin, the meridian of. which was passed in 86 80 S.; on the 7th of April had light variable winds from the Leuwin to Kangaroo Island ; tue winds were mostly from south .and eastward when moderate westerly winds set in which can led lier to the passed ibe Promontory on the 20th, had then unsettled weather Otwsy -on the 19th April, where ship's number was fchewa ; with ccnlured era, till 2 p,tn ou the 24th, when a severe burster set in from 6.SAV.,with very heavy squalls, which lasted till midnight, when it moderated to ajiight southerly wiod. The French barque Yiile de! Bt-.fierran?, from Bourbon, has had very wild unsettled weather the greater part of the passage. She sailed on 6th March. No vessels ?connected with the colonies are reported. The Ch&a-Sze;, Captain Bowon. arrived in 'port on 26th April, after & tedious passage from London of 121 days, caused, as will be seen, by the very adverse weather encountered at the commencement of the voyege. '£hc sailed from the Downs on 25th December, but had to put into Portsmouth with contrary wind sphere she remained until 10th January, passing the Lizard on the 12th January ; she came down inside the Cape dc Verd .Island?, and crossed the Equator on the 14th February, in longi tude 24 W. 6he had moderate trades to Trinadad, off which island calms prevailed. The Cape of Good Hope was rounded on the 36th March; on the 27th March, she was off the Croziats, where she had seven days of thick dirty weather, but from thence an excellent run has been made to Cape Otwav, which was sighted on the 16th instant, end -she was off Cape Howe on. the 20th, but a succession of 'violent squalls with the wind shifting all round ike compass, hun detained her on this coast ; nnd off the Howe the wind was from the 8.E. flying round to N.E., with thick rainy weather. Two wattrspoutf were here seen cio6c to the tffiip. Co the 22nd and23rd it blew a hard northerly -guie, shifting euddenly on the 2-ith to N.tV. end W. in a toirific squall; compelling Captain Bowen to heaveh;' vrssi 1 to.

The . steamer Platypus reported that, on her passage from the Clarence River, she picked up a boat, with two men on board, who stated that they were fishermen from the Manning River, and were blown off the land on the night of the 24th instant. The Platypus picked her up on the morning of the 25tb, and towed lier into Tori Macquaric. The Ary 8cheffer, Dutch barque, which arrived tfl April 27 from Ilo Ilo, made her pasvago west about. In the China se&9 she had fine weather, hut had S.E. trades.. After rounding Cape L?euwin heaw gales trom 6 W. to 'S.E. were encountered, the same weather prevailing to Cape Howe, which peint was reached on the 23rd April. The wind then came in from W.N.VV^, shifting to Y7.8.W., blowing aheavy gale. The vessel brings a fall cargo of eager for .the Colonial Eugar Company, . The schooner L. L* Erriccson, From Mauritius 16th March, has been placed in quarantine, in conformity with the Government ' regulations. .No . cases of sickness are reported, aud tbe vessel ~ will only be detained the usual time. . The barque Arte, which left for Callao on tbe 26th, has returned to port,- in coneequcnoc of having sprung a leak : she sailed with a S.W. wind, but as the vessel was found to be making water, alter being 4 hours at sea, tbe master thought it prudent to return to portiorepalr. Wc rrc sorry to record the wreck of the fine schooner Golden Isle, Captain fil'Donald, -during the heavy south-west gale on Sunday ;iiighL Tbe vessel is a new one, and is part owned by Mr. Rooertson, Auckland, and by her captain. 6he arrived in harbour on Good Friday, and had completed her loading when tbe gale commenced. Between half-past 10 and XL on Sunday niefct the hawser parted. She held on with her anchor for a short time, but this came home, with 76 fathomsof chain, and ebb wept broadside on to the breastwork. A Uy? minutes in Sun day night's terrific gale sufficed to sick her. The captain and men had enly just time to get on shore, having lost everything. The vcfiEelJieE sunk just off the breastwork. We understand that the vessel is insured. The divers wore at work all yesterday after . noon, xnd they recovered the captain's chronometer, sextant, and gold watch, a quantity of clothing, aud tbo second suite of sails. Wc learn that the gr.iin with wbieh the schooner was loaded, by swelling, has hurst in tbe cabin bulk-head, aud will, it is feared, blow up the deck. As attempt will be made to float her to-day. She has sioce been abandoned and sold ?—Lj/tteltan Times, April -Cth. A gtAtmcAt Aotextpre.— ' While the steam- packet Le Calre was on its way from Marseilles to Algiers, lately, with four huudxcd'pacsengers on board, it encountered a strong gale frpm ihe soctb-wcst. In tbe night a tremendous sea struck the ship, sweptihe deck, pencttated into the cabins and engine-room, nod threw everything into tbe greatest confusion. In the general finnic, ' while the crew were making every exertion to rid the aterioj of the boat of its superfluous element, a terrific cry was heard Trom the -eecond cabin, 'Help, help! the shark is gnawing me 1 ' screamed, in a voioe half suffocated ' with terror, an unfortunate dramatic artist, who awaking in a cold bath, found in hlsarms a sheep, which had been precipitated into the cabin through an opening made to let' off the water, They hurried to the traveller, whom they found more dead than alive, immersed in water, in company with the placid quadruped. This accident has th&own; (he poor artist into such a state or ex citement and hallucination, that, in spite of All the consoling atten* tions that were lavished npou him, it has- been; impossible to counteract entirely ibe effect upon his Derves, aud he still fanples himself pursued by a marae monster.— Ctyfon Times, February 2G. ! , The West Hartley, schooner, left Sydney on ^Wednesday, 31st ultimo, and cleared the Heads with a strong 8.W. -breeze ; passed Cape Byron on .the 4th April, at 7 a in, ; then followed n succes sion of strong K.E '.and R, gdles, and very heavy cross seas, with a strongiff. cuDcnt, which Uriftocd the echooter hack tootfthe Giarcaqc River.

Marine Dcpatlment, Wellington, March 17th, 1869, THE LOSS OF TEE SHIP HURRICANE IN' HOBSON'S BAY*. {From the Argus, AprilTZ,) The list of marine casuuLiva which have occurred in Tor; Ptiliip received a cctablc trd fcomewhat unexpected addition vestfrdav. Lv the foundering of the ship Hurricane, which Arrived nil' Cape Otway od TurEdav* and entered, the He^ds ys»* tcrdav morning about 8 o'clock. The occurrence, although disastrous enough to id I concerned; has happily been unattended bv lci&e; cl life. Ihc fir?; i limntum received in town of the vessel being in peril wae by a telegram from Qacenscliff y«5 tf-rdar morning to iLo agtiits, and was^-to the .effect that the HunicfiLC was then under Arihurie Seat In difficulty, and to ail appu-arauce sinking. This notice was received about 10 o'clock, -and it. itss than balf-an-bmir afterwards a aeceud telegram con veyed the intelligence that her bows were under water, and thtt'iicr elern w&s; reeling on a bauk* This was almost imaie diatelv followed by another message, slating that the ship wa* altogether under water, &nd; wdf supposed to be grounded in between five and six fathoms of water, pn- learning what had happened, Mr. Dickson (of Dickson, WiUiams, and Co., agents pf the vessel), accompanied by Mr. Espinasee, port surveyor, and Captain Coffey, proceedeu withoutdelay, :o the steamer Herculus to Capel Sound, to take whatever steps might be requisite with regard to tbe vessel and all on beard. Tee steamer Myetery, with Captain Fullarton (of the finrhour department) on board, and the steamer Challenge, in which was Mr. Graham (of Messrs. NortOD, Graham, aDd Co.), also proceeded with all. haste to the focbc of the wreck. Tbe sinking condition of the ship was first observed from Qu&enscliff; hy -Mr. Pilot Singleton, who sug gested that Messrs, Norton, Graham, ? and Co*'fi eteimsr 'Titan, which was then at tbe Heads, should at once be dispatched to the vessel's assistance. Tbe Titan then steamed for the South Cnannel with pilots Singleton and Leighton on board, and with the Customs' boat, in charge of Mr. Keen, in tow,. Before the Titan had reached the' wreok, however, the Hurricane had settled down* and the passengers and crew, who ' had taken to the boats, were transferred to the steamer. After calling at Scbntippcr Point the Titan reached the railway pier. Sandridgc, about 8 o'clock last sight, end the passengers and crew were eonveyrd to Melbourne by rail, the former bsing accommodated at the Immigrants' Home,- and the latter at the Sailors7 Home. The Hurricane was &a; iron 6bip, of 1198 tons register, and was built on the Clyde in 1853. On her present* as well as on her previous voyage to this port, Rhp was commanded by Captain D. H. Johnston, K.N.R., formerly of the clipper ship Lightning. Captain Johnston is a well-known navigator to these waters. The Hurricane sailed from Liverpool on January 12, with over 2000 tons of general cargo, and tpreecabinand sixteeh eecond^cabinpaseeo gers, nnd a crew of twenty-eight* ell told. The cabin passeng'.-rs were Mrs. Johnston (the captain's wife) and'lheRev, Mr. Dunbar and Miss Dunbar* After having -Liverpool tbe .ship was expored for twenty-one day6, in fact until reaching Madeira, to a constant succeesionof heavy south-westerly, gales. The winds in the lati tude of the N.K trades were very light, aud lhe Equator was not crossed until tbe thirty-ninth day out. Light winds prevailed in the tropics and all through the 6. E. trades, and the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope was not passed until the seventy-second day out. In tunning down the longitnde, however, favourable wiuds wcrccxpaieijccd, and the ship made come very good rub Ding. Cape Otwny was made at noon on the 20th inst&Rt;, and lhe pilot, Mr* Charles Kennedy, was taken on bohrd ut G p.m. ou the 21st. Port Phillip Heads were entered at 6 a.m. yesterday, and Captain Johnston states that on passing Point Lonsdale it was felt that the ship twice grazed the bottom, . but so very . slightly that little or no notice was laken of the matter. As n necessary measure, b#.* ever, the pumps were sounded, but no water was found. Shortly after, on passing up the South Channel, it was noticed that the ship-was drooping by the head- The Torehold was again sounded, and six-feet water was found in it. Both Captain Johnston and the pilot thought that by shortening roil and anchoring the vessel the foretold might be freed of water,' as a great deal was coming in through tbe h&wseholes.; ? Sail war accordingly shortened and the rscuote let go, butrin a very few minutes 'the ship weat down by the head in about .fire fathoms and a half of water. | Previous to he settling there was but tcaot, time for the passcngr-rs and crew to get into the boats, the number of which was limited by rcason.of the Iqogboat bciog 6toT0 by the sea washing along', the decks. During tho trying emergency. Captain Johnston states, passengers, officers, 'and crew bfebaved admirably. 'Captain ' Johnston has only saved his chronometers and sextant; while. Mrs. Johnston— who was taken into the boat thoroughly drenched . — and. Cbc passengers and crew,, tiara fost everything; but .- what ther. stood np in. Captain. Fullarton was ordered by the Commissioner1 of* Customs' to pro ceed to the -cpse of the disaster, nnd take what- ? ever stepB he deemed necessary for the safety of life- and cargo. Captaifa Fuliarlon states that, on the vessel sinking,' the crew end passengers rushed to ? the bouts, -which were unable to contain jthem oil, and that several of '.tbo crew kept themselves afloat by -means of planks until picked up, -and (that & number of others were placed on the rigging of the ship by tbe boats. The wrack i6 at present in charge of the' chief bfflber,al6ng wijhthp Custom- ' house offlwr from Aluecnsclifl'. . Meeere. Jleid, Toole, and Co. 's steamer Mystery supplied the wreck with flags ana lanterns to fxbibit bj hoy nnd night until further nrraugemc-cts can be made. Before the Mystery left the wreck s portion of tbe cargo of tbe ►hip bad begun to float out of her hold. It may he mentioned that Mr. Gorectt, tide inspector, had a number of tents unda quantity of gear collected, together wllh s boai'fl cretr, to 1*9 ec&t; to the wreck if necessary* Mr. Pilot Kennedy, who was in charge of the ship, reports lb it he took charge of the Hurrlcano at half-past 5 p.m. on the 2let instant, the wind being from the northward. Remained outrile all night. At 6 a.m. commenced to work in. At half-past 7 a.m. was abreast of Point Lonsdale, standing In on tbe p-rt tack with the wind veering from N. to K.N.E , fresh* tbe tide being the last quarter flood, vVhen abreast of Point Lonidale, aud the bcacoi on Swan Island showing clear of the Bluff, and outside Point Lonsdale rock, the ship grazed against something, which at first was taken to be something floating. Tbe pumps were, however* sounded, end no increase of water found in the ship. Hove ship to for health officer, and after being cleared, proceeded up the South Channel under all plain Bail. When about five miles up the channel he observed that tbe vessel seemed to be drooping forward, and immediately called the captain's attention to it. The captffin then expressed hie opinion that this was caused solely by the water coming into tbe hawse-pipes, and that by shortening sell and coming to an anchor the ship could be easily pumped out. According to Captain Johnston's desire, Mr. Ken nedy ran the ship into Capel Sound, and came to anchor in a good position. It was then discovered that the ehip was settling down lorward. Seeing that there was no chance of slipping the cables, in consequence of being under water— the ship's tuwse-plpee and wicdl&S6; being on the main deck— all attention was immediately given to getting the pawengcr6 and crew in safety into the boats, which w&b; accomplished without loss of life. The Hurricane is OFned by Messrs. W. and J. Lockbsru but whether insured or otherwise has not transpired. Much M-mpatbr bee bpen expressed for Captain Johnston, and all who huivc suffered by this unfortunate event. The whaling barque Planter was spoken on the 18th instant, sixtv miles 6, S.W. of Cape Howe, by the schooner Look Oat. Tbc'Pl&ntar; had been five months out, nnd bad eighteen tuns of oil on board; and she stated her intention of going to tbo west ward, to cruise off Cape Northumberland.— Argus, April 23.
