SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. The commissioners the Government in- tend appointing to administer the Public Service Act, though not yet formally an- nounccd, are understood to be Mr. Edward S. Symonds, the under treasurer, Professor M. H. Irving, and Mr. J. M. Templeton, secretary of the National Mutual Life Insurance Company. The list from which the selection was made contained a number of names, in- cluding one of the County Court judges, the heads of several public departments, and gentlemen holding responsible positions outside the ser- vice. Mr. Symonds is certain of being appointed if the Government can satisfac- tory fill the place as under treasurer, which he has held since 1857. Mr. Irving was first professor of classics at the Melbourne University, but retired in 1871 to become head master of Wesley College, which he afterwards gave up to open on his own account the Hawthorn Grammer School, now a recognised public school. Mr. Templeton, who was not aware that the Government had his name under consideration until they asked him to accept office, is a member of the Edu- cation Commission, and he also holds the rank, of lieutenant-colonel in the new Defence Force. The proposed appoint- ments satisfy both the general public and the civil service. The railway com- missioners, in addition to Mr. Speight, of the Midland Railway, England, will probably be Mr. A. J. Agg (one of the present audit commissioners), who has accepted, and Mr. Richard Ford, secretary to the Melbourne Harbour Trust, if the latter can be induced to give up his present appointment to take office under the Government. The Cabinet will finally decide upon the ap- pointments to-morrow.
