SOUTH AUSTRALIA. Adelaide journals to the 19th instant are to hand. of ' j Bush fires are reported to have occurred in various districts. of The following paragraphs from the register > (are all we find worth extracting : ' of Domestic Servants correspondent draws attention to the fact that there is at present a a great scarcity of domestic servants-a circum , stance which causes great inconvenience in name rous households. He attributes the scarcity to the partial cessation of immigration, and ox ' ' presses a hope that the attention of the Commis- t sioner of Crown Lands has been directed to the state of things some time ago, in which case he 1 1 presumes that relief may be at hand. He states, i i upon what he considers good authority, that I 1,000 females would now find employment and li. good homes throughout the colony at wages v varying from 7s. to 10s. per week. we have no reason to question our correspondent's facto, bat j we think the scarcity to which he refers arises ! quite as much from the superior attractions offered by the adjoining colony as from the par- trial cessation of immigration. It is useless, as we have before urged to bring people here un- lies we can induce them to remain. Fire at Mount Pleasanter Wednesday, the 11th instant, a fearful fire ravaged the country by round At omit Pleasant, consuming feed and cornsacks in every direction. Great efforts were made to confine the fire within the narrowest possible bounds, but it desolated nevertheless a year but extent of country. We understand that Mr. Carey's feed is all burnt off, also Mr. Ci Couch's feed and corn stacks, and that Mr. Harding is a sufferer in the same degree. Melrose's rr n has been swept clean by the flames, also part of Mr. Edlin's property, known as Bender's Station. Parties were engaged all Wednesday night in extinguishing the fire or removing burning trees, so that their combustion might not spread still further the conflagration. Fortunately the prompt and active measures taken were success ful, and on Thursday, the 12th, all apprehension as to the further extension of the fire was at an end. Death loton Intemperance The City Coroner held an inquest yesterday at the Hawthorne Hotel, on view of the body of William Kingston Ross, who was found drowned in the Yarra on Saturday last at Hawthorne. Edward Murphy, a little boy, said that on Friday afternoon last he went with some other boys to fish in the Yarra. Whilst so engaged he saw a man staggering along on the opposite bank until he reached the water's edge, when, with on ex- clamation that he intended to have a dive, he plunged head foremost into the river, and for a few moments disappeared. in coming to the surface he struck out for the opposite side, and had swam about half way across when he called out for assistance, and sank. He rose again, and was seen struggling for a few. moments, when he once more disappeared. Iib sank three times. By the Coroner's had his clothes on. There was a boat on the opposite side near to where the man threw himself in, and one of his (witness's) companions crossed over on the bridge, and went out in the boat to the spot where the man sank, with a view to render him assistance, but could not see him. Andrew Reid, a draper in Melbourne, said he knew the deceased, who was a bank clerk, and resided in King-street. He went to Hawthorne on Friday to transact some business, and the deceased accompanied him. On returning, the deceased, who was very small intii-»!/.nf JJ ?'u -' -* assess- .- ' much intoxicated, fell out of the cab in which he and witness were riding. The cab went on without him, and witness last saw him get up and walk away in the direction of Hawthorne Bridge. The Coroner having briefly summed up, the. jury returned a verdict "That the deceased was accidentally drowned whilst in a state of intoxication." Our Foreign Trabert review was given in The Times it few days since of the progress of our colonial trade during the last five years, and it may be interesting to note a few particulars for the same period, as regards our commercial of assertions with foreign States. The totals stand thus : Year. Imports. Exports?. 1854 ... £118,239,554 ... £03,332,523 1855 ... 100,939,530 ... 69,135,210 1856 ... 129,517,508 ... 82,520,50 J 1857 ... 14l,GGl,245 ... 84,911,410 1808 ... 125,420,193 ... 70,389,33!' It thus appears that the imports have increased 6 percent., and the exports not far short of 21 percent, in the five years; but the increase, it will be observed, would be far greater but for the severe commercial panic of 1857, which seriously curtailed the operations of the following 12 months. The increase in the im worth has been most striking in the case of Russia, the totals having been £4,232,288 in 1854, and £11,710,008 in 1858; but as in the first-mentioned year we declared war against the Northern Colossus, the comparison does not go for much. Still it will be seen that the imports from Russia are now on a very considerable scale. In the case of France and her dependencies there was an increase of £3,443,709, as compared with 1854. The Two Sicilies also exhibited an increase of 209,009 francs ; Greece an increase of £547,274 ; Turkey, including the i Pi incipalities, Syria, and Palestine, an increase of £913,488; the Papal States, an increase of £1841; Egypt, an increase of £2,711,401: Morocco, an increase of £07,702 ; the United States and California, an increase of £4,485,953; Mexico, an increase of £55,225; Ecuador, an increase of £99,741 ; the Brazils, an increase of £200,890; Uruguay, an increase of £157,213; Chili, an increase of £551,050 ; Peru, an increase of £1,714,355 and the Western Coast of Africa, an increase of 23S, 720. On the other hand, there was a decrease in every other point, the falling-off in the case of Sweden and Norway being £1,379,030 ; Denmark, including Iceland and the Danish colonies, £034,817 ; Prussia. £4,99¿;.)J« ; Hanover, £210,288 J the Hanse Towns, £2,106 714 ; Holland, including Sumatra a ,d Java, £700,510: Belgium, £527,141; For signs, including the Azores and Madeira, £1,091,975 ; Spain, Cubit, and dependencies £1,075,018 : Sardinia, £3,890 ; Austria, £241,701; Tuscany. £21 l,Cu7; Central America, £2,313; Hayti, £54,203 Non- Grounds. £71,954 ; Venezuela, £9,095; China, including Hong Kong, £2,081,931 and other countries, £16,023. A. detailed examination of the variations of our de r cristo foreign States may form the subject of a, future- paragraph.
