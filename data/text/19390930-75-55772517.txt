Spirit of Toleration . Ask anyone who went to the last war. Only, this morning I asked an ex- British regular and he cordially agreed. 'Yes,' he said, 'that's a fact. We didn't hate the roipmv ?»») thov h»», it. we nad a job to do and we did it to the best of our ability; but no utter dislike and callousness ever seemed to get us.' This spirit of toleration and forgiveness is' a quality peculiar to the British race. ' How is it so? And how did our mixed race (for we are a mixed race) acquire it? . The English, or rather British, have always been a mixed race and we know that in modern ? times we have inter-married with refugees and immigrants from the Netherlands, France Poland, Russia, Italy, and other nations. We call ourselves Anglo- Saxon, but we are no more Anglo-Saxon than we are Hottentots or Red Indians. We are British, and our main stock, so Mr. Arthur Weigall states, 'is the irre pressible River Drift Briton who was here tens of thousands of years ago before Hengist and Horsa trod a corsair's deck.' How was it then that this mixed race acquired 'the habit of forbearance? If you read English history, you will find that the Anglo-Saxons had quite a lot to do with it The early Saxon invaders were terrible men and dour fighters. A«Roman poet (Ilis name escapes me) tells:— . 'They arc fierce beyond other foes and as cunning as they are fierce, the sea their school of war and the storm their friend.' Well, men of such ferocity may have been * aood haters, but there remains the fact that Alfred the Saxon King, after he had beaten the Oanes took the Danish King and some of his generals to his castle and feasted them right royally sending them off free on their promise -o be of good behaviour.
