N374:111 THE Cure of Tuberculosis has now been Suc- cessfully practised for a great number of years by Mr. Carl Olsen, at 12, Capper-street, Kent Town, S.A. It is the only cure known. Surgical operations never cure, because the disease Tuberculosis is a constitutional one. All forms of Tuberculosis have been absolutely cured by Mr. Olsen's Remedy. Pulmonary, Hip, Neck, Foot. Arm, Leg, and Spinal Tuberculosis have had to yield; Kidneys, Peritoneum, Bladder, Fis- tula in Arms, and also that most disfiguring and distressing phase of Tuberculosis, "Lupus," to- gether with Scalp Tuberculosis; in fact, all Tubercular Swellings or Ulcers, no matter what part of the body they occur, have been abso- lutely and permanently cured. I MRS. G. PETERSON, Orient-street, Corryton, Kensington Gardens, wish it to be known that some years ago I was cured of Consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis), which at the time I did not fail to announce through your columns. Since then I have had three children. The first born of these, however, lately showed signs of the complaint. Thanks to Mr. C. Olsen, 12, Cap- per-street, Kent Town, he cured my child as he formerly cured me.

He gives no "Guarantees" to his patients, genuine or otherwise, as his word has been quite sufficient for the past 30 years.
