MELBOURNE MARKET REPORTS. . Hay Market. —Mr James Fenton reports— Our business has been of the most unsettled character as regards either prices or sales. This day the market has been cleared of all sorts, at all prices, from £3 IDs to £9. Straw, from S3 to £3 10s. Wool, Tallow, and Hire Market. Messrs Qoldabrough and Cos. report: —Wool.—The usual auction sales have not been held this week, partially in consequence of the limited quantity coming forward, and also because there is a brisk •nquiry by private contract. The season being now nearly brought to a close, buyers are oper ating with spirit, whilst there is still an oppor tunity. We have therefore to report having sold privately 807 bales at, considering the quality of the lots, very satisfactory prices—43o bales greasy, realising 9td to 12d. : 5 bales greasy locks, Gd to G-d -, and 372 bales fleece at Is 4jd to Is 10Jd ; vheso rates fully sustaining previous quotations. :Vs there are still large orders in the hands of buyers unexecuted, any late clips coming forward will be sure to meet a good market Sheep skins.—We have sold a considerable quantity by private contract at from Gdto 9|d per lb. Hides.* | —We have sold wet salted heavy hides at from :9sto Us each ; dried at 5s each. This’market I for shipment is very depressed. Tallow. —There is a better inquiry for colonial use, and we have cleared out several parcels of station Jtallow at from £35 to £3B per ton. —Messrs Clough and Cos. report:—Wool.—There have been no auction sales this week ; inquiry for all descriptions has, how ever, kept pace with the supply, and we have dis posed of, by private contract about 390 bales, at rates fully equal to auction sales, viz,, 120 bales greasy at 10*d to I2d; 160 bales fleece at 17d t<» 22d; 110 bales scoured at 22d to 2s 4d per lb. Any really choice lots coming to hand will meet a ready sale, as buyers* orders are not yet all filled up. Tallow.—The demand for tallow is very slack, there being very little inquiry for local con sumption. Wc are now shipping on owners* ac count about SCO casks, and have sold 80 casks mixed at £42 to £43 per ton. Hides.—The prices demanded by producers here being still too high, little business is being done, prices in the home markets scarcely equalling the quotations here, and until such a decline takes place as will leave a margin of profit to the shipper, we do not look for any demand in this article. Sheepskins.— Any lots coming forward are readily disposed of at satisfactory prices. We have sola several parcels at from GAd to Bjd per lb. Horse aso Stock Market.— Messrs Row, Kirk and Cos. report:—Horses ; We have again to report an active week in this branch of our business. There was a full attendance of buyers at our yards, and the supply of stock, though not large, being of an improved description, competi tion was animated,-and last week’s rates were well maintained. In consequence of the heavy fall of rain on Thursday, there was very little done by auction ; a good number of sales, how ever, were made privately. There have been numerous inquiries for superior cart horses, but the advanced rates demanded by owners have limited transactions in that class. The increased demand for second class draught, noticed in our last report, still continues, with prices looking upwards. The supply is moderate, and current rates may be quoted at £35 to £4B, Sales of in ferior have been numerous at last quotations. First-class hacks still scarce, with a brisk inquiry —high figures can be obtained for good lots. Se cond-class hacks and light harness horses are much wanted, and meet a ready sale at prices ranging from £2O to £3O. Inferior have been sold at £5 to £lO. At our sales of unbroken stock, this week, we dis posed of a -small lot of superior stock, the property of Mr-G.Gorman; they were by Wil son's “ Clyde,’* and averaged £38 10s per hoed. We also quitted a small lot of Mr Kernan's ot on average of £28. Fat Cattle: 1398 head cattle camo to hand this week, a large proportion of which were second class and inferior ; prime quality were readily disposed of at fully last week's rates. We quote—best bullocks, £6 to £8 5s; do cows, £5 to £6 15s; other bullocks, £4 to £5 15s; cows, £3 1 Os to £1 15s; inferior at lees than store pripe. Calves : 119 were sold at from 28s to 50s each* Sheep: There has been on excessive supplvr-- 10,503. Prices have not unproved, and tlio to still exists a dulness in trade. Best wethers sold at from 11s 6d to 12s Gd, others, 9a to Its; best ewes, 8s to 9s 6d, others, 6s to 7s. A few picked wethers realised 15s Gd. 1605 sheep were turned out unsold. Lambs : 1044 have been disposed of at from 3s 6d to 11s 6d, according to quality. Stock axd Stations.— Messrs. Kaye and Butchart report;—Fat Cattle: 1398 were brought forward, the bulk of which were from middling to inferior. Prices for fair to good cattle advanced. The trade took 1023, country buyers 288, shippers ! We think that prices arc not likely to go back to the late ruinous ones, unless cattle arc ooured in in quantities which cannot bo absorbed. Best bullocks, from £7 10s to £8 5s; second qua lity do, £5 to £6 10s ; inferior do, £2 4s to £4 10a; best cows, £5 to £6 10s ; second quality, £3 10s to £4 10s, Calves: 119 wore yarded, and sold from 26s to 60s. We sold.29 very good at 34s 6d to 49s. Fat Sheep: The market completely glutted with stock of medium quality. Num bers were sold wholesale, and prices were easier. 10,503 were penned, of which 1505 went out unsold. For the last three weeks Messrs Griffiths and Greene's sheep have not been approached for weight and quality. Best wethers, 1 os 3d to 15s Gd ; good do., lls Gd to 12s 6d; inferior do, 9s to 10s Gd ; best ewes, 8s Gd to 9s ; inferior, Gs to 7s.

Trade 1023, country 288, shipping 87, total 1398. The supply of good quality has seen much within the limit, although the numbers in are about the average requirements of our market, prices have, in con sequence, been more satisfactory, and the bid dings brisk. Some of the lots to hand were of store'quality unfitted for the trade, and were sold at low figures. We have sold 131 head Calimo catilc, 100 of them cows, at £4 10s all round — these were of indifferent quality. 54 head prime paddock cattle at £6 10s ; and 201 head Mount Gambier cattle, Messrs Fisher and IlochfortV, a primellot of small cattle at £6 17s bullocks, and £5 7s cows. They would average about 20s the 100 lb. Beat bullocks have been selling at £6 to £8*6s‘; [second do £4 to £5; best cows, £5 to £G 10s; second do, £3 to £4. Calves: Number in, 119 head ; of these there has been a full supply.prices rangingTrom 28s to 50s, Fatsheep ; Number in, 10,503 head ; trade, 7451 ; country, 7G0 ; ship ping,|787 ; sent out, 1505; 10,503 total. Trade lias been dull, but prices for prime quality are still good ; those to hand were in no way remark able for suiting the trade requirements of this market. We have sold 1175 Kelly’s, from 11s to 12s, according to quality ; 946 Rochfort's, at 12s; 445 (ewes) Austin's, from 6s to 7s ; 221 Gibbs, at Us ; 643 Ulupna, at 10s Gd ; GOO (ewes) Downie's, from Ss to 8s 6d. There is little prospect of im provement in price unless in. those of prime qua lity, There is a fair demand for small lot? of first class, which meet with a ready sale at last quota tion for the same. Best wethers are, 12s to Ha ; second do, 9s to lls ; ewes, 8s to 10s, Lambs : Number in, 1044. There is little demand now for Iambs, and they arc wholly unsaleable in large numbers. Prices are 8s to 9s fid. Store Cattle: Very little business is being transacted,and not from paucityof buyers,but simply that the prices ruling for fat stock have, been fov some time so exceeding low that parties wishing to Invest will only do so at rates holders will not give way to, and hence the tew sales to report. Quotations All bullocks, £3 to £3 7s 6d; spayed cows, £2 12s 6d to £2 I7s 6d; cows, £2 10s to £3 12s 6d; inferior rough lots, mixed, £1 10s to £2 ss. Store Sheep: We have brisk inquiries for first-class wethers four and six tooths, and could dispose oi 10,000 to 20,000 readily, at fair prices. Full mouthed ewes are almost unsaleable, but any number of two, four, and six tooths could be placed at payable rates. The demand for New Zealand has slackened at present, and partly from the difficulty of getting lota not tupped. A steady trade will, however, continue. Wc have several transactions now pending at the following quotations :—Wethers, four and six tooth, 10s to 10s 6d ; ewes, 7s to 8s ; young ewes for breeding, 10s 12s. Stations : A better feeling is gaining ground, and for sheep runs especially we have a great many inquiries from bonajide purchasers. Labor Markkt. —Mi Elderton reports that the labor market is much iu the same state as reported last week. The demand for harvest men has en tirely ceased. There is a little demand for plough men and milkers, also for useful men for farms and stations. Married couples just now are not in much demand. Male domestic servants have been required for the country hotels, and waiters and cooks have been freely hired at good wages. Female servants of the upper class meet with ready engagements if they are fully qualified and possess good characters. For the country, also, the demand from hotels, families, and stations has been generally good. The immigrants by recent ship consisted of 29 married couples, 2 single men, 259 single women, and 29 children, all of ■whom, excepting the married couples, were speedily engaged or sent by the Government to Warmambool, Port Fairy, Geelong, and Gipps Land. The market may bo consi dered as well attended just now, and wages are firm: Married couples with families, £6O to £7O per annum; without children, £7O to £75 do; gardeners, £52 to £6O do; grooms, 20s to 25s per week ; shepherds, £35 to £lO per year ; hutkeepers, £2O to £25 do; general farm ser vants, 20s per week; ploughmen 25s do; bullock drivers on road, 25s do; do on farms and stations, los to 20s do ; reapers, 25s per acre, binders, 25s per week ; men cooks for farms and stations, 20s to 25s do ; cooks for hotels, £2 to £4 per week ; female cooks, £4O to £52 a year ; general servants, £25 to £3O per year ; nursemaids, £l6 to £25 do ; laundresses, £3O to £35 do ; housemaids, £26 to £3O do; parlormaids, £25 to £3O do ; carpenters, lls to 12s a day; masons, bricklayers, black smiths, J Is to 13s do ; pick and shovel men, 7s 6d do ; carters and store laborers, 40s to 50s a week; quarrymen, 10s to 12s per day; fencers, 2s 3d to 2s 6d a rod ; splitting posts and rails, 20s to 30s per 100. Flouu, Grain, &c.;—W. Lawrance reports:— The transactions of the latter part of past week were limited in the extreme, owing to the state of the weather- The present week has brought a considerable augmentation to our stocks of bread stuffs, while the imports of horse feed arc again light. On the night of 30th ultimo the weather became unsettled, and rain commenced to fall, which continued with short intervals until the morning of the 3rd inst., a period little short of 100 hours; heavy rains fell also in almost every quar ter of the colony, accompanied with cold southerly winds ; the consequence is that the crops of grain is said to have sustained considerable damage not only in the field, but parcels only partially secured have also suffered. Flour : The business of this week opened with a reaction in prices generally; a fair and steady business has been done, but tho pressure to sell has certainly been greater than for some time past. The country demand still com tinues good, and the town trade seems to absorb an increased quantity of imported sorts. Chilian und Californian flour is in good request. During the week there has been an active demand for United States barrel, for home consumption as well os export. Closing quotations are as follow; —Adelaide sorts, £l6 16s to £l7 10s ; Hart's and Magarcy’s superfine, £lB ; Tasmanian and Victo rian, £l6 16s to £l7 6s. Chilian and Californian, £l6 IDs to £l6 per ton; United States, 38s to 40s per barrel,—Wheat: Some parcels of Victorian are offering, but the quality and condition are elike inferior : prices range from 6s 6d to 6s Od, any prime parcels and Adelaide sorts find buyers at 7s to 7s 6d per bushel. Oats : The demand'for soundjand 'sweet feeding sorts is good, and a slightly speculative feeling in existence since the heavy rains ; some descrip tions are held for advanced rates. The demand for prime old colonial is good, but stocks are light, and imports short of the demand. Closing quotations arenas follows; —Irish and Scotch, 2s to 3s *, Dutch and Danish, 3s to 3s 3d; Russian and Calcutta, 2s 6d to 3s; Californian, 3s to 3s 4d; colonial, 4s to 4s 4d per bushel.
