Arts Danish taste shaped artist Sylvia Deutsch A RESIDENCY at the International Ceramics Centre in Skealskor, Denmark, earlier this year inspired Canberra ceramics artist Sarit Cohen in her latest exhibition. Hebrew script and Cohen’s Israeli heritage inform her work, usually in non- functional forms. Her latest exhibition shows the influence of the strong functionalist trend in Denmark. Her current exhibition, Hybrid Life opened last week at ACT’s Craft and Design Centre in Canberra. Large hand-built glazed plates evoke images of Cohen’s Jewish heritage, with a strong link between plates and food. Other pieces include slipcast raku in the shape of stylised shofars called Beginning and Ending, and a series of shofars in glazed slipcast paperclay earthenware with Hebrew lettering, called Letters Home. Born in Beersheva, in Israel’s Negev Desert, in 1967, Cohen grew up in Dimona before immigrating to Australia at the age of 14. She graduated in ceramics from the Australian National University’s Institute of the Arts in 1992, and her work has been exhibited at galleries in Canberra and Melbourne. Cohen found her Denmark Sarft Cohen with one of her works. residency, from January to April this year, a liberating experience: “It was different to be able to work with it every day, to be able to produce, to have time to think about who I am and my directions.”
