SOCIAL. THE 28th of February was Foundation Day at the Brisbane Grammar School, and tho 6econd anniversary of its establishment The Head Master, aa usual, delivered on address, giving an account of the progress of the school during the your, together with remarks and BUggcBtionB appropriate to tho occasion Sir Maurice O Connell then dis tributed the prizes, and in doing so gave euch boy u few kindly words of udvice and encouruge ment The proceedings finishod with a militar) review on a small seule The elder boya fo m an Infantry Volunteer Corps, and are armed with carbines lhoy were put through tho manual and platoon excrete by tho drill ecr geant, and acquitted themselves vorj creditablj The celebration was largely attendod by our public men and the porcnts of Hie scholars, und the great number of ludies prc»entgave the hull a gay and attroctive appearance that it docs not at other times afford These Grummur School anniversaries aro regarded with much in terest in Brisbane and Ipswich, which aro the only towns that possess suth institutions at present, although there is a movement to establish another ono at Mary- borough The nddresB of the Hcud Master, Mr Harlin, of course went into details that aro only of local interest , but his remarks included a pructical suggestion of value which we hope will not bo IobI Bight of We Queenslander aro rather proud of our system of pubho education. Primary educution ib afforded to all comers. Tho State pays two thirds of the cost of building I Grammar Schools, and tho Governor in Council 1 is authorised bv law to ranko an annual grant to i each of them of five hundred pounds Huberto very young bovB havo been admittod, who ] havo ecarcely acquired the first olements of an I Lnglisb education Mr Harhn'a suggestion is ] that Grammar Schoo s should not bo allowed to < bo made uso of as mere Primary Schools, but 11 that our whole plan of publio education should be leduced to a system, each branch distinot in itself, but thoPiimary School leudmg to the j Middle class School and tho latter, m I time, to the Umicrsttj Tho following por 1 tion of Mr Horlm s address refers to this mat tei -" I do think that the time is at hand w hen the educational question must bo reconsidored in Queensland, whon tho couu rj must bo di vulcd into educational, just as it is now divided into political, districts, each with its circle of Pimiary Schools surrounding its Bingle secondary or Grammar School-tho work of the former being, fust, to furnish boys who wish to leave Behool at a comparatively early ago with the plain and practical training sufficient for their wanta , and Bccondly, to preparo those who are I to bo schoolboys until the end of say their six tecnth year, for matriculating ot the centrol Grammar School, say nt the ngo of twelvo or thu teen, the work of tho latter to bo the woik of higher education, using the term in the most comprehensivo sense of which it is capable when applied to a public school, when the proper functions, as determined say by a com peteut commission of inquiry of tho Pri mury Schools on the one hand, and of the Grammar Schools on the other must be de fined by Act of Parliament,-when, instead of the Grammar Schools receiving boys in the most varied stages of progre««, their rulo ] shall be that so far as possible, new boys shall I be admitted to their first classes on passing the ] test of a matriculation examination ,-in shoit, when, a» regards the expenditure of the Queens land educational vote, each «chool supported wholly, or in part, from the puohc purse shall occupy a defined position, and shall discharge an allotted tack in a general educational system I grant that the idea of «ending every boy to commence hi« education at a Primary School in other word«, the idea of abolishing social dis tinrtions amongst schoolboys-is somewhat novel here But already the Eon3 of several of the leading citizens of Brisbane have been sent to commence their education at the Normal School, and oven «upposing that no stepa aro taken to mould the educational legi'lation of tho colony into one harmonious system, I believe their example will be followed, and that in pro cess of lime, tho portion of our present work which we discharge in common with the Pri mary Schools will fade away from our time tables, and our pre«ent difhculticB in the matter of classification will in gre t mensuro rectify themselves " We received on Ihursdiy last the following telegram from our agents in Sydnev -"The Government havo received a telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the effect that he has received information that a party of ' Filhbusters ' from America intend making a raid upon the Australian Colonies The Go vernment of ïiew South Walea intend placing the guns in position at Sydney Heads imme dmtely " We were also favored with the foi lowing copy of a telegram on the same subject, receivea by His 1 xcellency the Acting Governor of Queensland from the Governor of South Australia -' Adelaide, March 14 For Gover nor of Queensland From Secretary of State to the Colonies London, February 16 British I Government have received statement which ' they do not credit but think it right to send I That a filibustering expedition is to leave the United States this month for Melbourne, Syd ney, and Otago-Govebnob, Adelaide "-Our readers need not be surprised to leam that the natural effect of the publication of the above has been to throw all the ' elderly ladies of Queensland into a frightful state of trepidation The Yankee filhbusters are I coming here, and will play " Old Harry" with Brisbane' They will bum down the Town Hall, and the e is no knowing what other atro I eittoo they will commit ' But, notwithstanding that our voico may not bo listened to, we Bhall | still persist in assuring our fellow female colonists of mature agc, that although there is much fear, I there is no danger We aro old enough to re collect several filhbustering expeditions that have started from the United States during the last thirty years, and every one of them haB como to severe grief If the leaders were not hung, they were shot-and it came to much the same thing, we Buppose, in what manner their mort ii coil was shufllcd off when it was cut short in a summary manner In all of the large American cities there is a horde of rufhans i of whom the i espectable citizens arc unxious to I get rid and w ill subscribe uni reasonable sum ! to send them away filhbustering, or be freed from their preaenco in any other way Per haps an expedition of the kind may have lately been sent from New York under this principle, for ti e avowed purpose of plundering Mol bourne, Sydney, and Dunedin But President Grant is not the sort of man to be an accom phco in any scheme of rascality of the kind , and as the English Government has been able to give notice of the filhbustoring expedition, it must also bo ablo to prevent filibusters from committing depredations in Australia Thoro is something quite assuring in that part of our Sydney telegram which statos that gunB have been posted at the Heads of Port Jackson It ib well known that filhbusters follow Parha mentary UBugo, and give " notice of mo tion " before entering any port It would be dishonorable wore thev to sneak into Port Jackson m the night time It is therefore highly satisfactory to know that Sir James Martin 13 posted at tho Sydney Heads prepared to blow to smithereens any impudent Yankee pirate ship that raav at tempt to pollute the wutera of Port Jackson in broad daylight Wo are pretty safo in Brisbane, for no large man

of Mr Edmond stone, Dr O Doherty, und Mr Stephens, watted upon the Coloniul Secretary on March 14 with referenco to tho emigrant ships, to point out that three ships consecutively were sent to tbe Northern ports, and that two of them were to Maryborough done, whereas the Act pi ovidod »hat the immigrants should bo Bent, one half to Moreton Baj und one half to tho Northern Ports alternately, and that there was a doubt whether Man borough would ubsorb two shiploads of immigrante ut one tt-rio The Coloniul Secrctarv stated that the Goveinmcnt were not awuro what was Mr Douglas' reason for sending three ships conaccuttioly 111 that manner, that it wub contrary to the Act and to his instructions, and the Government entirely disapproved of it In order to remody tho matter, if possible, ho

The officers sent by the Collector of Customs to patrol the Southern border of the colony from Maryland westward have reached their various destinations, and the collection of Customs duties has begun. Numerous drays laden with goods from Maitland and other towns in New South Wales have been stopped on the border, and a fair addition to the Customs receipts has been made. A large district in the south-western interior of Queensland has hitherto been sup- plied with goods overland from New South Wales, and the latter colony has had the benefit of its contributions to the Customs, while we have had the expense of its government. The present arrangement will secure the Customs duties for us. It is also having another effect. In order to avoid the payment of duties to both colonies, several of the western settlers have already made arrangements to get supplies from here, to be forwarded by way of Dalby ; and probably the bulk of this trade will, in time, come into its natural channel. To effect this re- suit it will be necessary to improve the roads and make the communication as easy as possible. In the neighborhood of Warwick the case is different. None of our settlers get their goods from over the border, while many of the New South Wales settlers are supplied from here. A notice from the Colonial Treasurer says that on all goods taken out of bond here for exportation across the border the duty will be refunded, if the proper forms are attended to, and the re- quisite proof of exportation given.

receipts of this nature to the Rockhampton institution and the secretary, Mr Beddek, has just received from Mr Edmund Morey, the new Police Magistrate at Banana, the sum of thirty five shillings,
