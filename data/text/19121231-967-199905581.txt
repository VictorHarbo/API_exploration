IMMIGRANTS' CAPITAL. MELBOURNE, December 30. During this year 11,116 assisted immigrants have been secured by Victoria, and the excess of arrivals over departures is estimated at about 22,400. The total amount of capital set down as having been brought by assisted immigrants is £143,553, and the capital introduced by immigrants unassisted is estimated at £50 000 Commenting upon the results of the year's* ork, the Minister in charge of immi°Ta~tion (Mr. Higeithorn) stated that unfortunately the grounds for complaint about the inexperienced men, who had come forward as farm workers, were too frequent, and it was seen that a considerable proortion- of them had had no previous knowledge of farming^, operations. The few Danish and Scandinavian farm abourers Whom the Sta->> had succeeded in obtaining, stood out in striking contrast to those secured from Great Britain. The Minister's efforts would be specially directed during 1913 to securing a 'gorid sprinkling of Danes and Scandinavians.
