FOR EUROPE. INTRODUCTION. The Peninsular and Oriental Com- pany's vessel Salsette sails to-morrow for Suez, with the Australian mails of August. The Bombay, with the English mails of June, arrived here on the 8th inst., being three days behind her con- tract time. The news for Europe from these colonies is of rather more than the average interest. The time for the meeting of the new Parliament has at length been fixed, and the writs are out for the general election. A great many candidates have come forward in the interval since the last mail, to solicit or re- solicit the popular suffrages ; and the apathy which has so long prevailed in our political world seems likely at last to be dispelled. Three of the Ministers, Mr. O'Shanassy, Mr. Harker, and Dr. Evans, have come before the public to explain their past conduct, and declare their future policy ; but the present feeling is decidedly against the O'Shanassy Cabinet, and it is scarcely doubted that it will be forced to succumb to the public opinion on the opening of Parliament. Mr. O'Shanassy's speech at Kilmore, which was looked forward to with much anxiety, has greatly disappointed public expectation ; and it is scarcely thought Mr. Harker will be again returned for Collingwood. Dr. Evans's prospects at Richmond are not much more favour- able. The split between Mr. Duffy and the Cabinet is thorough and final. The feeling against Ministers has been much aggravated of late by their supine- ness in acting for the relief of the unfortunate sufferers by the wreck of the steamship Admella; and also by their conduct in regard to the scan- dalous case of Weller v. Kilgour. On the other hand, the policy of the Oppo- sition is as yet undefined and obscure, and there appears to be no unity of action or common purpose among its members. The volunteer movement has proved a failure, and the last news from Europe has tended to allay altogether all feeling of alarm as to our present defenceless position. The melancholy death of Lieutenant-Colonel Neill, the Deputy Adjutant-General, has cast a deep gloom upon society, and exercised a prejudicial influence in checking what little mili- tary preparation was being made. The commercial news of the month is not of unusual importance. Trade is steady and sound, and speculation quiet. The bank returns give evidence of the increase of general wealth. There has been some excitement in regard to mining joint-stock companies; but the undertakings already brought forward, although in too many cases promoted for gambling purposes, are, in the main, sound and remunerative. The yield of gold continues to be steadily maintained. For the rest of our commercial and general intelligence we refer to the detailed summaries under their several heads. POLITICAL. Parliament was dissolved on tho 10th inst., and we are now in the heet of a General Elec- tion, although the excitement is by no means ex- cessive, and the number of candidates presenting themselves is inconsiderable when compared with the seats which require occupants. These are 78 in number, and while a contest is threatened in some instances, there are several constituencies to which no overtures have yet been made by aspirants for legislative honours ; and there are others whose confidence is impor- tunately solicited by men of such dubious qualifi- cations and eccentric conduct as to throw an air of ridicule over their candidature, and invest the exercise of political privileges with extremely ludicrous associations. The first member of the Administration who broke ground as a candidate for the new Assem- bly was Mr. George Harker, the Treasurer, who defended his unpopular colleagues on the ground that they were no worse than their neighbours, and made a lame attempt to repel the charge of jobbery which has been fastened on the Govern- ment in connection with their negotiation with the railway loan with the six banks, in two of which Ministers are personally interested. The terms upon which that transaction was effected are now proved to be far less favourable to the country than the offers made by other agencies, and the Treasurer seeks by disin- genuous statements to conceal the consequences of a financial blunder, attributable, not so much to the ignorance of those who are implicated in its commission, as to the subordination of their duty as public men to their interests as bank directors and shareholders. Mr. Duffy, who seceded from the Cabinet a few months since, has just re- appeared before his constituents, and offered a flat contradiction to a statement made by Mr. Harker in reference to the circumstances which had led to Mr. Duffy's retirement from office. He had never had any misunderstanding with his colleagues upon matters of a private and personal character, and had differed from them solely with respect to questions of public policy. The next to present himself before a consti- tuency was Mr. O'Shanassy, the Chief Secretary, who represented the pocket borough of Kilmore in the late Assembly, and solicits re-election from his old supporters. Like Gratiano, "he speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all" Victoria. His egotism is audacious and his fluency oppressive. The exordium of his speech was a declaration of wounded self-love, and the peroration a feeble sarcasm at the expense of a former colleague, for whom he once possessed the most unbounded esteem, and a venerable joke involving a covert satire upon another mem- ber of his own Administration. The only por- tion of Mr. O'Shanassy's address which is likely to possess the slightest interest for English readers was the outline which he furnished of the Ministerial Land Bill, the leading features of which are as follow :—The country to be surveyed in areas called "hundreds," and these subdivided into farms, ranging from 40 to 320 acres in extent, open to selection at £1 per acre. As settlement proceeds, municipal government is to be extended to the settled dis- tricts, and one-fourth of the revenue accruing from the sale of the land to be applied to pur- poses of local improvement, conditionally upon a similar amount being raised by local assessment. Land alienated from the Crown, but unoccu- pied, to be heavily taxed, so as to dis- courage speculation ; and the district mu- nicipalities to be empowered to assess the stock depastured on the lands in their vicinity. Coupled with this measure, it was pro- posed to introduce a Bill for cheapening and sim- plifying the conveyance of land, framed in con- formity with Torrens's Act in South Australia ; and by the joint operation of such laws the Chief Secretary hoped to attract population to the colony, and to settle that population on its soil. WRECK OF THE ADMELLA. About 5 o'clock on the morning of Saturday, the 6th of August, the Admella, a Clyde-built steamer, plying between Adelaide and Melbourne, struck upon a sunken reef about 15 miles off Cape Northumberland, broke up, and became a total wreck. The scene of the disaster was identical with that of a similar calamity which occured in the winter of 1854, when the Nene Valley went to pieces with 300 immigrants on board, and all perished. On the present occasion it appears that the Admella, which had six valuable horses on board, was put before the wind in order to facilitate the shifting of one of the horse-boxes, and that the vessel made such rapid lee-way as to result in her de- struction before she could resume her course. Having been built in compartments, the moment she struck she broke into four pieces, the after part of the vessel resting at an acute angle on a fragment of the reef, and being preserved in its position by 50 tons of copper ore, which happened to have been stowed aft. There were eight cabin passengers on board (among whom were two ladies, and two sons of the President of the Legislative Council of South Australia), 34 steerage passengers, and the crew, about 30 in number. Many of these were dragged to the stern of the vessel by means of a rope, but several perished in their efforts to es- cape. The boats washed adrift, and the second mate was drowned in the surf while endeavouring to reach the shore by means of a life-buoy. The quarter-boat had been carelessly cast loose by a passenger, and one man was seen drifting out to sea upon it. All the provisions that were saved in the first instance consisted of a filter of water, a small bag of almonds, about 20 lbs. of cheese, half a ham, 10 lb. of beef, eight bot- tles of porter, and one of whiskey ; but what re- mained of this small store was swept away on Sunday night, and from that time until the fol- lowing Friday the poor sufferers were exposed to the pangs of hunger and thirst and the incle- mency of the weather, the sun beating fiercely upon them by day, and the piercing wind benumb- ing them by night. On Tuesday night, according to the statement of a survivor, about 20 perished by cold, and every day thinned the ranks of the sufferers. On Monday two men, who had con- structed a raft out of the lower boom, succeeded in reaching the shore, and immediately made for the Telegraphic Station at Mount Gambier, many miles from the coast, and the intelligence of the disaster was immediately flashed to all parts of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, everywhere occasioning the most intense excite- ment, and more especially at Adelaide, where the sittings of the Legislature were forthwith adjourned and a general suspension of business took place. The impression on the minds of the two mariners who had escaped was that they were the sole sur- vivors, and it was not until this impression had been corrected by later intelligence, which left no doubt that several persons were still clinging to the wreck, that steps were taken for the rescue of the sufferers. The Messrs. Henty tele- graphed to Portland and Belfast instruc- tions for the despatch of the Lady Bird steamer to the scene of the disaster, and the Chief Secretary was applied to to guarantee the insurance necessary to cover the extra risk ; but as he declined to assume this responsibility, the required sum was promptly subscribed by the merchants of this city. The Government of South Australia promptly despatched the steamer Corio to Cape Northumberland, and the tele- graphic messages received from day to day gave rise to alternate feelings of hope and despair in the public mind. Several attempts to reach the wreck by means of life and whale boats had been baffled, and the keenest sympathy was excited on behalf of the unhappy beings, who could be discerned, through a telescope, huddling on the stranded fragment of the wreck, and undergoing, as was surmised, the most exquisite anguish both of mind and body. It was not until Saturday, the 13th, that the cheering tidings were circu- lated throughout the colonies that the Lady Bird had been successful in her noble mission, and that upwards of 20 persons had been rescued from destruction. Leaving Portland late on Thursday evening, with 20 extra men as volun- teers, she reached the wreck at 9 next morning, standing off about a mile and a half. The life-boat was manned and the whale-boat launched. A terrific sea was running, and breaking about three miles in shore. Captain Fawthrop, harbour-master, commanded the life- boat. She got close to the wreck, and fired two rockets with lines attached, but from the surf washing into the boat they got foul and broke. Immediately after four heavy seas struck her, smashed eight oars, tiller, &c.;, filled her each time, and washed one man overboard, who was, however, picked up. For three minutes they all appeared to be lost. All they had now to depend upon for their own lives was the line attached to the anchor, which had been dropped outside the surf. They returned to the steamer quite worn out. About 5 p.m., the sea mo- derating, Captain Greig manned the whale- boat to reconnoitre, and see if another attempt could be made that night. He got within hail of the wretched survivors, whom he could hear uttering most piercing cries for water and help ; he, however, found it to be utterly impossible to cross the surf and make any further attempt that night. He shouted to them to cheer up, and told them he would be back in the morning. All the steamer could do that night was to fire rockets and burn blue lights, &c.;, at intervals, to cheer the poor creatures amidst the exposure of another night, benumbed, starved, and parched with thirst. Saturday morning came, and at dawn of day they prepared for another attempt. At 8.30 the life-boat left the ship, and let go her anchor near the wreck. They threw a line to the survivors, who made it fast, and by that means drew the life-boat along- side. Time was precious, and the survivors immediately threw themselves into the boat, with the exception of Miss Ledwick, who could scarcely be prevailed upon to let go. All arrived in safety alongside the steamer, and were imme- diately well cared for by Dr McDonald and other gentlemen who had accompanied the steamer. On their arrival at the steamer some three or four were in the last stage of existence. Captain McEwan, two passenger, and a seaman had, three minutes before, been hauled through the surf by the Admella's life-boat, and reached the shore in a most exhausted state. The survivors, having been conveyed on shore, received every attention that a considerate hos- pitality and medical skill could supply, and are regaining health and strength The following is a list of tho persons saved :—Passengers—Roch- ford, Miller, H. Fisher, Miss Ledwick, M For- rester, H McInnis, J. Webb, G. W. Richardson, P. Carrig, T O'Halloran. Crew— James Hut- chison, first mate ; McNair, purser, D. Peters, fireman ; R. Wright, trimmer ; C. Locke, sea- man ; George Hills fore cabin steward ; John McDermott, second cook ; J Duckering, lamp- trimmer, George Ward, cabin boy. Saved by Admella's life-boat from beach — Captain McEwan ; Davis, seaman ; Andrew, servant to Mr. Rochford, and a passenger. On Monday last a public meeting, originated by the Chamber of Commerce, was held at the Exchange rooms, when upwards of a thousand pounds was subscribed towards a fund for the reward of those who took part in rescuing the survivors, and a resolution was unanimously adopted for the erection of a marble tablet to commemorate the heroism displayed on the occa- sion, and to perpetuate the names of the brave men who participated in the gallant act. At noon on the following day the Lady Bird returned to this port, and several thousand persons assem- bled on the Queen's Wharf for the purpose of greeting her captain and crew with a hearty welcome, expressed partly by an address pre- pared for the occasion, and partly by a burst of applause from the congregated multitude. RAILWAYS. In our last Summary we gave, in the shape of a short digest, an account of the present condition and progress of the works on the Government Railways in process of construction. We were unable to give the traffic returns of the por- tions in operation. These have been before the public weekly, and we are enabled to compile the following items of information :— The length of the Government lines opened for traffic is 29½ miles. The total receipts for pas- sengers from the opening on the 17th of January to the 30th of June has been 21,258l. 4s. 2d., and for goods, 7,720l. 16s. 10d. ; gross total, 28,979l. 1s. The maximum receipts in one week have been 1,873l. 3s. 6d. ; and the minimum, 454l. 19s. 3d. The number of ships and lighters berthed at pier was 56, and the registered burthen of ditto, 19,431 tons. The ships' cargoes discharged for which payment was received amounted to 6,057 tons ; the railway plant, for construction, 3,444 tons ; the railway stores, 1,000 tons ; and the timber for pier, 2,300 tons. The total goods convoyed between Melbourne, Williamstown, Sunbury, Geelong, and inter- mediate places amounted to 14,783 tons. The number of passengers booked was 287,754 ; the number of sheep shipped at pier was 7,191. The Williamstown "Ships' Goods Traffic," com- mencing as it did on February 18, must neces- sarily be calculated as representing at June 30 the produce of say 20 weeks only. From the offers of ships made by shipping- houses in the city which could not be accepted for want of room to receive and deliver in the temporary shed, it would appear that a large amount of tonnage has been attracted to other spots. The next six months, with the use of the sheds now occupied, will in all probability show a tonnage which from its being the legitimate yield of what the pier berths at the service of the department should produce, will furnish a fair criterion of the prospects of the Victorian railways as far as regards the Williamstown line. The traffic to and from the stations on the line to Sunbury for the half- year ending June 30 must be taken as commencing on March 1. The business has been steadily on the increase, and will be much augmented when roomy sheds are erected at Keilor-road, Diggers' Rest, and Sun- bury. The locomotive power hitherto at the dis- posal of the department has been found inade- quate to the requirements. The traffic of the Geelong line is steadily on the increase, especially the conveyance of boilers, engines, and machinery for Ballaarat, &c.;, which latter the company must have lost altogether but that the necessary waggons were furnished by the Government Railway Department. The following is a statement of the returns of the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Com- pany. Total amount of revenue for the half- year, viz., from May 1st, to week ending August 11th, 1859 :— Passengers and parcels .. .. .. £14,090 14 6 Merchandise.. .. .. .. .. 9,514 4 10 Making a total of .. .. .. £23,604 19 4 Total amount of revenue for the corre- sponding period last year, viz.: from May 1st to August 12th, 1858 .. 21,609 12 8 Showing an increase of .. .. .. £1,995 6 8 The number of ships discharged at the Railway Pier during this period exclusive of colonial steamers was 55, and the tonnage of goods con- veyed over the Sandridge line was 46,373 tons 4 cwt. The following ships are at this date discharging their cargoes at the Pier :—Hotspur, from Lon- don ; Queen of the East, from London ; Zuleika, from London ; Vater Smidt, from Liverpool ; Lucknow, from London ; Lew Chew, from London ; Tudor from Liverpool, White Star Line ; Lawrence Brown, from London ; Sir William Eyre, from Liverpool, Black Ball Line. THE GEELONG AND MELBOURNE RAILWAY. The resolutiens by the English shareholders, a"'iccing to accept the offer by tho local Govern mont of cash for thoir shares at par, arrived by the lost mail, and the directors immediately com municatcd with tho Government on the subject In answer to a letter from Mr Ibbotson, tho chairman of directors, Mr Horne, tho Chief Commissioner of Works, intimated that the rcso lutions by tbo English shareholders, if adopted bj tlio colonial shareholders at a special ¡roncral meeting, " w ould bo complying with tho conditions passed by tho Legislative Assemblv, and bo deemed by the Government sufficient authority to empower tho directors of the company to tre it for tho transfer of tho undertaking ' A special genoral meeting of tho Bharcholdora w as accord ingly hold on tlio 2Gth ult , when tho question of tiansfei was fully debated, and the resolutions of tho English shareholders wero adopted by the following majority -For tho motion ulopting the resolutions, 1,332 shares, 112 votes , against tho motion, 190 shares, 32 votes, mojoiitj, 1,142 hliaros, 115 votes With refcrenco to the picciso terniB of the arrangement, which the Assembly s lcsolutions had left indefinito, the Chairman saiel that Mr Horne had given u verbal o\planation to a deputation fiom the Boaid on tho 15th March, ns follows - " Tho Government would pay twenty pounds (20/ ) cash for ov cry share, ono hundred pountls (100Î ) foi each debenture when duo, interest in tho mean timo, and nil the liabilities of tho com pony It vi ns not tho intention of tho Govern mont to pay for land granted by tho Chown, nias much as the conditions upon which tho grants had boon piotmsed had not boon fulfilled Tho mattoi of compensation foi loss of t-affic, with othei matters of detail, might bo fairly left to tho period vv hen tho directors vi ould bo ni a position to ti ..at with the Government for the transfer The Chairman fin thor said it was nntlcistood the Govornmont would pay nil arrears of gua íantced interest appropriated in paymont of ne terr-st on debentures This, to the English Hhorc lioldeis, must bo the most satisfactory part of the wholo proceeding, foi they aro now aw aro that the Aictoiian Government havo nlrcadj paul the guaranteed mtorest, and it is coitainlj a gi cat stretch of generosity that thoy should pty it ovei again Aftei all the di cadful outcry made by n small chquo of tho Victorian shareholders, and by English shareholders, and then determined efforts to min the credit of tho colony in England, it is somou hat curious to find that thoy hiivo almost unanimously and at onco accepted tho offer of tho Government whoso bad faith thoy wero do noum.ni' THE GOLD FIELDS Although tho escoits of tho last fotv weeks have I boen below what the nvcrngu might to bo nt this seitson of tho yent, thoro is no reason to foal til it | the yield of gold has fallen off, or that the re turns will continuo so low for any length of tinto li om nearly nil tho different fields tho accounts mo good No very extraordinary discovoncs liai o boen mado, but tho miners genoi ally ai o full} employed, and there aro no complaints of anything moro than tho usual and oxpected want of success in a pursuit which must partake moro or less of tho charac- ter of a lottery vvlion followed by detached pai tie» rushing hither and tlnthoi on tho chanco of getting a Bhnre of what is almost accidentally obtained, if not on ono occasion, why, probably on another Tlio present rago for companies, tliou0h it will not porhaps bo so advantageous in all othor respects, will at least havo tho effect of rendering molo settled a Ungo portion of our min ing population, nnd of providing theso men with mainmcrj of a kind which thoy w ottld otheiwiso not be likely to havo tho uso of for ii considerable tuno to como Water also will be supplied m abundance to many districts, which tho struggling and least fortunato of tlio minen havo now to leave m great numbers every summei, becauso without this element it is impossiblo for thom to obtain a hi nu.

Thero is a fine opening on the gold-lields for the display of a great amount of engineering" and mechanical skill, and thither it will be directed by the forma- tion of the many companies now springing into existence, and wo trust much to tho ultimate benefit of the miners as a ¡class, and to the in- crease of our weekly escorts; The discoveries of the past month have not been of a character to require particular notico. i LABOUR,. Sinco the date of our last repoli there has been I little or no alteration, and decidedly no improve- ment, in the stato of tho labour market. Tlio demand for tradesmen, mechanics, and skilled labour of all sorts is as dull' as it then was, nor aro ordinary labourers, adapted for farm or rond work, in greater request. Mfn of the latter class hang about town as long as thtir meanB last, seek- ing employment in vain in niuo out of ten in- stances, and when they do ¿o up tho country, at every station or farm-houso thoy find others on tho samo errand as themselves. Thus the old order of things is quite reversed, and instead of masters running after the, men, tho former havo only to stay at homo andselcct as many as thoy require from tho numbers offering. Cer- tainly, thoro aro always the public works on tho roads and railways for mon U actual necessity to fall back upon as a last resource, but it is only as such that these workq ato looked upon. Too man}' of the contractors aro inclined to take I iidvantago of tho present abundance of labour, and, by availing themselves of the oppor- tunities afforded by tho iniquitous truck system, or by delayed or partial pay- ments of wages, to obtain from men unable to lenvo their employment moro than a fair | equivalent of work for tho remuneration actually afforded. This chargo does not, of courso, apply to all contractors for public vvoiks, somo of whom I are known to bo good and considerate masters ¡ but working-men have been so ¡if ten victimised of | Into that employment of any kind is looked for in preference. Tho rates of wares aro nominally maintained, but in the caso of] skilled workman I especially very much less than what ia quoted as the standard is frequently aefcepted by a me- chanic or tradesman, glad to escape on any terms from a protracted attendance atthe labour marts. This is always about tho dullest season of tho year, and wo may shortly expect ainaijicd improvement j in tho demand for labour of ill sorts ; but tho present stato of tlio market is jsuch as wo de- scribo it, and no material chango is likely to bocomo apparent for a month or six weeks. Shearing, and other country operations, will havo then commenced, to tho benefit iff tho labouring classes, and the many new mining companies now I formed and in courso of formation will need tho services of a large number of mechanics and tradesmen. Female servants, with good characters and of proved efficiency, aro still, in constant re- quest, and obtain high wages ; but country girls, with their work to leam and habits of neattiebs and tidiness yet to bo formed, which is tho case with tho majority of female immigrants, find it difficult to obtain engagements^ in rcpectablo ; families on any terms.

Tho total for last week amounted to 38,940102. only, against 49,103oz. for tho cor- responding- week of last year. Tho weekly averago for 1837 was 47,070oz., and for 1838, 44,841oz. That for tho first quarter of the current year was 41,08-oz., and for the second quarter 44,417oz. , Comparing the separate quan- tities with those of the corresponding weeli of last year, we find a decroaso in the returns from Castle- maine, Maldon, Sandhurst, Maryborough, Bal- laarat, Fiery Crook, and Pleasant Creek. There is an increase in those from Blackwood, Avoca, and Amherst. In tho following return tho de fails of tho post week and the corresponding week of last year aro compared side by side : Namo of Gold-Hold. 1859. 1853. oz. dwt. oz. dwt.

Up to the corresponding dato of 1858, the ship- ments for the year amounted to l,528,330oz., or G3tons 13ewt. 2qr. 101b. lOoz., of tho value, at tho same rate, of £G,113,320. Tho exports of specie amounted to £32,500-£25,000 in the Marion for Colombo, and £7,500, for somo port not declared, in the Skerry voro. Prices have fluctuated very considerably on the goldfields, in consequence of tho unsettled stato of the exchanges. On the first receipt of tho intelligence of the breaking out of war in Ettropo tho banks held many meetings, and appeared to labour under thb apprehension that the London market would be moro or less closed to them, and the exaction of a war risk was spoken of. This feeling has, however, passed away. The following aro the current quotations for tho week :- For Livingstone and Goulburn River, G7s. to 72s. ; Omeo, G8s. to 71s.

In tho subjoined tablo will be found a detailed statement of tho yield of the gold-fields for a period of threo months ending on Saturday. Tlio total for tho current year exceeds that for the corresponding period of last year by 2,225oz., as will bo seen by reforenco to tho lost two columns, iu which tho weekly totals aro given for tho two years. This may bo taken as very satisfac- tory evidence of the buoyancy of our mining re- sources. At the present timo the attention of minors is distracted on all hands by tho almost daily launching of joint-stock companies, having for their object tho moro economical, and therefore moro profitable, working, of portions of tho auriferous country. Those companies have been to far too great an oxtont in tho banda of share-jobbers, whose object is attaincd'by securing an allotment, and selling at a profit. .Large sums have boen occasionally mado in this way ; and, as a consequence, many miners havor been induced .to slacken their operations, in order to watch the courso of ovents in tho share market. This kind of speculation has, however, boon toned down from the fever-heat it had at ono timo reached. Ballaa ratand Smythes Creek. Cres wlek's Creek and. Clunes. Fiery Creek. Sand hurst.

Tho average amount of business dono by tho several banks during the quarter is compared in the table, in another column, with that done dur- ing tho second quarter of tho year 1858. As compared with the first quartor of tho current year, the totals exhibit fow fluctuations. The amount of discounts has not apparently been in- creased or decreased to any appreciable extent. As regards the last bank on the list (tlio National Bank of Australasia), no comparison can bo drawn, tho bank not-having been in existence in the second quarter of 1858.

The stock and share market has been in an excited state. Messrs. Wray and Bryant report of the transactions for the month :— "Since our last the uncertainty with respect to the position of England in regard to her foreign relations caused a continued pressure in the money market, and induced on the part of the public a disposition to realize every description of securities. "About the time of the arrival of the mail this anxiety was materially heightened by the banks ask- ing exorbitant terms for drafts on England. The arrival of the mail with the intelligence of the easiness of the money market at home caused a revival of confidence, and has brought into the market purchasers for most descriptions of stock. "In our lost roport no roferrod to the Increasing; desire of capitalists for investment in tho various gold niining companies,' which wero only then becoming known o" tho Holbourne mnikot.

Tho balance of profits of the prev mus half-year, after payincnt of tho dividend, was £8,707, making Ü10 total sum available for n dividend £22,29<f.

Messrs. W. II. Tuckett, William Highett, and Joseph ' Sutherland, wore elected to tho seats of tho Board vacated by rotation. An animated dis auHsion arose on tho question of the establish- ment in London of a registry for the transfer of «b_rcs,_w_ich terminated, after a week's adjourn jncat, in the consideration of the subject being ^postponed for six months. Wo have to roport n steady and generally sound condition of trade. Our market for imports pre- nota to the arrival of the Bombay was somo K-atexcited, but the pacific news brought by that ghin allayed all speculation, and our mer -baals have resumed the oven tenor of their wny. Holders of flour have booti trying to es- tablish a rise, but boyond £30 their efforts Surre been, futile. Rice has been dealt in l>y a fuvr. but little has really changed hands. _S53 is tlio holding prico. Oats have boen duller,, if possiblo, than before, nad for ¡Scotch or Irish, 4s. to 4s. 3d. is the outside price. üBmbcr an article anticipated to riso lo a long figuro, has subsided into Gd. to O.W. for 9 x 3 red Jfidtie. " Logs aro dull of sale and flooring-boards moro than abundant. In tho wine and spirit trade operations havo been very meagre. Ports amd sherries of low quality have been moved to somo extent ; bat really very fine wines havo met with little inquiry. Rums aro not enhanced foy the last news from England, and tho same applies to- brandies. Martell'a has boon sold at paving prices. Otard's commands a largo ?¡trade, and is- woll supported. Ilennessy's and H.V.i'. aro bought only for order. Geneva.-Tho demand has been good, and 14s. Gd. is the ruling jprieo for JDK55 anchor. Old tom is not urantcd ; indeed, the trade for this article appears io have died out. Bass's bulk is the leading feature. Allsopp's maintains a good position, but Boost other brands havo to submit to reduced nates. Byass's porter is worth 10s. 3d. Ale not wa_tcd,.and unsaleable in bottle until the sum- mer season. For iron and metals the trado has been active. Corrugated galvanised has sold well at £10 for 26-gaugo. The largo quantity shipped, _s reported by the last export- list, will contribute to check higher rates. Bar and rod is becoming amply stocked; but the consumption is great, and fuir profits may bo anticipated. However, Iho quantity of goods reported tobo coming for- ward is^in. all reason, quito sufficient for our de anand, and we think shippers will do well to ex aráso caution in their »dvonturcs to this place. Die late losses on consignments, and the ad vrances to persons in England on such account, lias tended to much bad business, and the sooner H is abandoned the better it will be for the legi liraate trader. The monthly Insolvency Circular gives the ¡nsual details of the insolvency business for July. Twenty-six schedules aro filed. In three the lia îàlities wero between £5,000 and £7,000 ; in two, under £5,000 and above £4,000 ; in one, undor £3,000 and abovo £2,000; and in ten, under _2,00OJand! above £1,000.

The import markot during tho past month has under- gone but littio alteration. Supplies or nearly all descriptions of goods continue to como forward largoly in excess of tho demand, and thoro is scarcely any article that at prcsont holds out 'prospect of improved priée. Stocks in tho country townships aro, howovor, reported to bo light, and business gonerolly is lu a fair healthy condition ; but, as wo havo already remarked, stocks aro BO largely supplied as to prcvont any early prospect of amended prices. For speculation trans- actions are light, and business is consequently chiefly confined to small legitimate transactions. Butter.-On tho arrival of tho mall thoro was a strong fcolipg in favour of advanced prices, and higher prices wero looked for. The fooling has, however, declined, and prices havo again settled down to about Is. 10Ü. to Is. lid per lb., although by auction sales havo boen effected at lower rates. Caudles.-Demand Is dull, and pricos aro giving way. Nova stéarines aro to bo purchased at from Is. 4d. to Is. 4Jd. por ib., and best Belmont sperms will not realise abovo lo. SJd. por lb. Cement Is in less demand. Supplies have como for- ward moro'frcoly, and prices havo declined, 24s. to 25s. per barrel being about tho highest procurable price. Coals aro of ready salo. English household in tlio Bay aro worth 60s. ; and best sorts of N.S.W. coal aro Baleablo at 45o. on tho Wharf, although arrivals barn temporarily dcadoncd tho market. Dried Fish.-Inquiry is light, and but littio business is doing. In theso articles. Ling fish is of tolerably ready sale, but other sorts aro lu littio or no demand. By auction during the lost week Bales havo boon mado at following rates, viz. :-Californian salmon, at 4d. per lb. ; red herrings, at 26s, por dozen tins. Flour and Grain.-Tho market has continued very quiet. A few speculative inquirios have arisen, but havo again subsided, without producing any per- manent effect on prices. A steady loglthnato trndo has, howovor, been carried on, and prices aro vory steady, without any probability of declino. Adelaido flour of best brands brings from £2010s. to £30 per ton ; Tasmanian cannot bo purchased under £28 ; and Haxall and Gallego aro held for from Ois. t ) 02s. per bushel. Wheat, is in good inquiry, and readily pur- chased at from 12s. 3d. to 12s. Cd. per buBhol. Barloy lias been m less Jumana, and, nllliuugli quotations me unchanged, prices aro hardly so finn. Capo, of colonial growth, and Chilian aro worth from 4s. to 4s. 3d. ; English, 5s. to 5s. Od. por bushel. Malt is again dull of salo, owing to arrivals, and pricos vary from 7s. Od. to 10s. 0d. por bushel, according to quality and condition. Oats.-There lias boon a feeling for speculation in tills artlclo, dosplto oxecssivo stocks and continued impor- tations, and soveral sales of extent uro reported, lu tlio bellof that tho low pricos ruling hero will causo cessa- tion of shipments from tho homo market, and iuduco higher prices hero. The Balo of about 30,000 bushels of Californian, ex Mary Pica-ants, ÍB reported us having been effoctcd at 6s.-a figure which, the heavy stocks considered, could hardly havo boon cxpoetod to bo reallsed.as sales of otter Bort«, usually preforred, havo been mado at lower rates. Malzo is of tolerably ready salo, but at reduced prices, best samples not producing above 4s. 2d. to 4s. 4(1. per bushol. Gram Is Urmly hold, and tho prices demanded by importers, say £10 to £1010s. per ton, koop buyers out oftho market. Dried Fruits.-Pudding raisins and currants aro in fair demand, and parcels in good order and or fair quality aro readily Baleablo at quoted prices. Musca- tel raisins, fig», and other dried dessert fruits, aro not in much inquiry, and prices aro unaltered for theso descriptions. Nuts orallkinds aro lower in prico. Quotations aro :-Almonds, Jordan, le. Od, to Is. 9d. per lb. ; do., soft shell, 7d. to 8Jd. per lb. ; applos, Ainorican dried, 7jd. to 8d. per lb.; currants, Patios, 6d. to Sid. por lb. ; dates.

Drugs and Chemicals.-The stocks of sovoral articles under this heading having bocomo much reduced, havo causod Improved demand and better prices. Castor oil Is low in stock, and prices improving. Soda ash and flour ofBUlphur aro also scarce, and higher prlcos demandai by holdors. Soda crystalB aro in better supply, and sales havo been made at from £13 10s. to £14 per ton. Opium, although not In active request, has advanced lu price, £300 to £320 being asked for Patna per chest, and 80s. to 81s. per canister for Chlneso prepared. ... Eortiioiiwaro is rather improving In prices ; but, unless of vory good assortment, sales aro still difficult to effect to any extent Groceries.-Teas aro in good demand, and continuo firm in price. Stocks aro In few hands, and tho trade being but moderately supplied, good usoful sorts of both black and green teas find ready buyers at fully sustained prices. Coffees aro in request, both for con- sumption and shipment, and stocks being moderate, no decrcoBO in prices Is likely to onsuo. Sugars aro dull, but tho creator portion or tho parcels lately offered, not being of grocery sorts, havo boon either withdrawn or disposed of at prices which barely afford correct criterion of tho market value. Fine grocory yellows aro worth about £42 por ton, and crystallised whito brings from Mi to £40 per ton. Rico Is dull or salo, tho purchasers on speculation, who hold largely, oro indisposed to sell, uuloss at the prico thoy hold for, and buyers boing \- unwilling to pay the required ligures, but little has bcon dono, and prices aro almost nominal, I ' £21 per ton boing tho figure asked Tor Patna.

Bice-Patna, £21 per ton ; Java, £14 per ton. Ironmongery and Hardware.-Tho continued arri- vals of all descriptions of articles undor this heading, both of English and American moko, prevent any im- provement in prices, and although there is a fair trade doing, rates show no prospect or any material advance. Colliiis's axes, handled, are worth from 75s. to 60s., and light picks of same moko from 60s. to 00s. per dozen.

Gunpowder.-Considerable arrivals havo como lo hand, aud a further declluo lu prico has ensued ; and, as there is every appearance of tho market again be- coming overstocked, still further declino is looked for on presont rotes, which aro quoted at from Is. to Is. 2d. for blasting s. rts. Liquors.-But llttlo change has occurred in tho valuo of any articles undor tills head. Draught'alcs ore "slighter demand, and Basa'a No. 3 Burton, tho prico of which reculâtes tho valuo of all other sorts, cannot ho quoted at moro than £8 10a. to £812s. Od. por hhd. Draught stout, as Is always tho ouse at this season of tho year, is dull of salo, tend in hut llttlo request, and no reduction In prico would increase extent of sales. Bottled beera, porter more especially, aro in tolerably good domand, but tho greater portion of tho lato arrivals having como to market in bael con- dition, has tended to injuro tlio markot value Byass'» now brand, as well as others, havo lately been landed quito out of condition. Prices or best sorts, however, may ho quoted ot from 10s. to 10s. Od. per dozon, ot I which prices there is a fair demand for sound beers. Spirits.-Brandies of most preferred brands, particu- larly if aged, fully sustain prices. Tho domand is, howovor, limited. Tho low descriptions, with which tho markot is largely overstocked, aro still low lu prico nnd dull of solo. Rum has been in rather Improved inquiry, but whiskey, old tom, and gonova continuo neglected, and iinsaloablo beyond small lots for ¡inmediato uso.
