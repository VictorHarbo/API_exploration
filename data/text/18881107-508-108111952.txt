And an ESTATE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AC2ES XX SOUTH PERTH, Subdivided into about 830 Blocks, almost adjoining the City. : CAPITAL £3003 IN 8303 SHARES OF £1 EACH, Es on application, 2s on allotment, and balance not to exceed Is per Share per month.

Sydney. \- -Directors Trill be elected at First Meeting, whien will be held In about o, month .These two valuable properties are placed undir offer for the extremely low sum of £6750, on easy terms. The extra capital is being raised to prepare for contingencies, improvements to estates, or other expenses which may arise. It is estimated that not more than 8s or 10s Trill need to be called up. The 22 acres of City Land will subdivide into over 5000 selling1 feet, with, valuable water irontages, and should readily realise £(5000. ?*if — The Suburban Land is already subdivided into about EOD 1 Qnarter-acre blocks, and shonld realise, at a low figure, £8003. This estimate of £14,003 is based on present selling price of the land, and if the property be held for a couple of years, it is estimated double that price could be realised in subdivision. These properties have been, inspected and selected as the most eligible in and around Perth, and investors may rely on it that no more genuine venture has ever been placed before the pnblic or if ew South Wales or adjoining: colonies. ? No Promoters' Shares are to be issued, every share ranking alike as to calls, &c.; The properties are placed under offer to Sir. G. Dyson, who has inspected, them on behalf of the proposed Company, for the earn of £6750, and are being sold under circumstances highly favorable to the proposed Company. The expenses of the Company nee d be very small, as -Mr. G. Dyson, who lias hr.d considerable experience in disposing of land in subdivision and economical! j- managing estates, will, if the Company feel dispo-ed tx- accept his offer, place his services end offices at their disposal for a nominal sum, and a commis sion on profits. To show his faith in the concern he is prepared to take from 500 to 1000 shares should thp* number be available. - ' 'The Company will be a terminating one. and no other pro perties can be purchased without express sanction of the Shareholders. The twenty-two acres are in a good position rijrht in the City, and have about fifteen chams frontage to the Swan River; they ere adjoining Government reserve, and close to another reserve for public gardens. It is about ten minutes' walk from the Town Hall, and can be approached either by macadamised road or water. Every block of land between this and the centre of the . city, with the exception of Government reserves, which almost ' Surround this estate, is laid out in town lots, and not an acre can be purchased at the price this is bens offered at. As will be Eeen b.v the official plans, very few blocks of land available for subdivision can be purchased in the city of Perth, and already ,encll blocks are being readily bought up by Melbourne and other speculators, and it may safely be eaid that in a few months blocks of land situated as this is, and of such an area, will be eagerly sought after, but unobtainable, except at a very much, higher figure. What will twenty acres of city land be worth in a few years ? This Company will do well to secure it, and obtain a gift while there is a chance. The 830 quarter-acrs blocks of land are almost in the city, being but a iew chains from the boundary. It has been care fully inspected, and is without doubt a valuable estate, being nearly all elevated, and overlooking the city and the beautiful waters which separate it from the city. It has frontages to two main roads, and thc-ef ore is very accessible. It is very advan tageously subdivided into quarter-acre blocks, pegged out and cleared. The Company will not therefore lose an acre of land for streets, or be put to expense in regard to subdivision. Esti mating each block, which is 65 feet frontage b.v 165 feet deep, at £ltl (which is a low estimate), this estate alone would realise £8000, being more than the cost of the two properties now under offer. . That the progress of 'Western Australia has been slow np to the present period is not to be wondered at when the circum Etances are looked into. That such a fine colony has remained bo long, as it were, a blank, is a lasting disgrace to ths British nation, or these who have had the controlling power of its destiny. Languishing1 for want of capital and population to develop it. the wonder is that the population has not decreased. Hampered and restrained from borrowing the necessary capital to cany on any public works, it is somewhat a miracle that its handful of people hare not before now openly rebelled, and claimed the right to manage their own afiairs. Almost worn out by waiting for the turn of the tide, the people of that colony have not yet fully realised what is within their grasp — Responsible Government, or a constitution similar to our own. Will anyone who lias w&tchert; the progress of our own colony since we were , granted a right to manage our own affairs deny -what will be the result of that boon to Western Australia'- What will be the result of the first Joan after Responsible Government is sr&nted;? Will it not have the effect oJ rapidly increasing the population, and stimnlate numbers of slumbering industries? It will cause such a rise in the value of property that no such field as Western Australia will present itself for the capitalist. The day Responsible Government is granted to Western Aus tralia will be the most joyful one ever witnessed there. That Responsible Government is within its grasp is a certainty. It is confidently expscced there that within the next few weeks, or months at most, everything will be s ettled. The railway from Perth to Albany is almost completed. The Midland Railway is again commenced, and German immigrants are to Fettle on land eminently suitable for vineyards, orchards and agriculture. The GoldSelds are no myth, but an encour aging and promising reality. The latest Goldfields are only a few days by good road from Perth, and machinery is now being erected on the field.- Numbers of people are wending their way daily to tliem, and it is anticipated that in a few months a great rush wiil take place. 1 All these developments will assuredly cause a marvellous rise to take place in the value of land, and those who secure the picked blocks now will have chances which no others can have. Early application for shares is necessary, as a number are already applied for. Shares wiil be allotted in order of application, and all money returned within one month from date of Prospectus, ll required number of shares are not applied for. * The only expenses the Company, if formed, will be put to are those attending the formation, which wiil be very light. Plans showing position of both blocks will accompany Pros pectus, and any other information will readily be given at the office of the Brokers, j£es*rs. G. DYSON and CO.. Phcemx-chambers, j . 153.

The great desire shown by Australians to improve their finan cial position has been referred to by many noted visitors to our scores ; and, beyond a doubt, the energy displayed has, in very many cases, met with its reward. It cannot be denied hundreds of comparatively poor, but thrifty men occupy first financial positions in our city Dy making judicious investments in land in suitable localities ; others, no doubt, have failed, simply because they went about the business the wrong way. In order to be successful as a laud buyer, a man 'of moderate means must see how much he can spare -weekly out of his savings. Having ascertained that, he then must be care ful where he puts it. In every locality, cloBe to or in large centres of population, the people settle near the one. This is clearly demonstrated ou our Railway Lines— the people settle close to the Stations because it is haajiest to means ofcommunication. But then, again, a Railway at times passes through settled centres of population, and in this case it matters little whether the Department put a Station half a mile from a settled town. It never improves to a very great extent simply because, not only are the interests of those who reside 2n the older settled town pushing it alons, but the residents in the whole snrrounuine district throw in their weight and in fluence, so that all times the little half-mile platforms always remain simply a platform hanging on to the coat tails of the larger centre. For instance, one would never imagine that Harris Park Platform will pver be a greater Parramatta, nor Lewisham a greater Petersham. But on the other hand, if one buys in an entirely new place, sufficiently removed from large centres to create a centifefor itself, then it goes on its own responsibility, and relies onThe natural features or other circumstances to make it worth touching. KOGABAH, on the Ulawarra Line, had the advantage o? prior settlement, and it went off with a fair start that ione of the other centres on the Ulawarra Line can touch it. It had the first start by an energetic Land Compaay quitting it on the one side of the line at ai fair figure, and allowing purchasers to get a good profit on their investments, as evidenced by the fact that there has been more lots unsold than elsewhere; but on the opposite side of the line at Kogarah the -greater, portion of the good land was held by a conservative few -who held out for their Tiaund of fiesh. until they were ultimately induced to -sell the ?whole' line at a very low figure to the City and County Investment,- Land, and Building Company, Limited, of 327, Pitt-street, so that now they are placing on the market for quick sale, being satisfied to take small profits, and givef*the public a chance to bny really cheap. It is needless to state that it is to be sold cheap, but here we have the fact that at their- sale, a little further from the station, they Bold a very large quantity at reiy low prices to the fewwho faced the ponr -ingraia. Now; next. Saturday, the ioth. November, they are £Oin£ to sell cheap; and remember that, no. matter how much , the land brings,, one need not pay mon^-than £2 deposit and ,5s per ?sreefci' for ievery,. block- purchased* or they may take shorter but very advantageous terms. The Blocks (with die exception of a few) are 66$ frontage by Ifi5*n-i 200ft deep, and right at the station, beingttj&tclearea; land jut,1 beyond that below the level of the Railway^Station. We admit that ire have -various character of land, but it being such large Blocks every Block is -p-ell adapted for building' jjorposeo. Queen Victoria-street is the -main road to Kogar*i Station, and is the outlet for the whole of the district lying toward^ Bexley, Alphington, WoBongong-road, Selmore Hurstville, and other adjacent districts. There is more traffic on tnis road than anyfiirect road to other Ulawarra line stations. It rims right.thruugiithe ?Estate, and has been -well-made at a cost of nearly £3000, including stone bridges. Now you can buy a i acre, pay 5s a vnek, build a lonse. and live cheaper than paying: Tent, as £be Vendors will lend jou the greater portion-o! the cost of building.
