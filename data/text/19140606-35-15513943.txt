"A Pianist who can at least hold his own with the giants in the land PADEREWSKI, D'ALBERT, and so forth stands In little need of mere praise. A GREAT MUSICIAN, A GENUINE ARTIST, and AN AMAZING PIANIST-that Is Mr. HAROLD BAUER." SATURDAY, JUNE 27. TOWN HALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 27, MONDAY, JUNE 20. WEDNESDAY, JULY' 1. THURSDAY, JULY 2. Messrs. T. and N. TAIT have the honour to announce the FIRST APPEARANCE in AUSTRALIA of one of the GREATEST MUSICIANS of the CENTURY, Mr. HAROLD BAUER, HAROLD BAKER, MASTER PIANIST. In presenting Mr. Bauer as their IMPORTANT MUSICAL ATTRACTION for 1914, Messrs. J. and N. TAIT have been guided in their selection of this famous artist by the following facts: HAROLD BAUER. In the judgment of the WORLD'S CRITICS HAROLD BAUER has gained the foremost place in his art, at a time when the standard seems to have reached the limit of physical and intellectual possibilities. HAROLD BAKER. . He has a reputation which is not confined to English-speaking countries, but a reputation which ranks with such music-makers as Liszt, Rubinstein, Paderewski D'Albert, etc., in Germany, France, Switzerland, Russia, Denmark, Spain, Austria, Hungary, where reputations are won only by sterling merit and exceptional talent. HAROLD BAKER. His fame is worldwide, and his talent without limit, to quote the London "Daily Telegraph": "A GREAT MUSICIAN, A GENUINE ARTIST, and AN AMAZING PIANIST-that is Mr. HAROLD BAUER." F HAROLD BAUER. It is, therefore, with every confidence that Messrs. J. and N. TAIT present Mr. BAUER as a successor to the MANY VISITING STARS it has been their honour to bring before the notice of their patrons, and as a continuance of the policy, which the)' feel safe in claiming has met with unqualified success, of presenting only ARTISTS of the VERY FRONT RANK and UNDOUBTED MERIT.
