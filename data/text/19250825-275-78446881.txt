DANISH IMMIGRANTS ADVOCATED FOR AUS- TRALIA An interesting personality who returned to Australia to-day on the R.M.S. Orsova after a visit to his native land, Denmark, was Mr. F. Jensen, of Northern Queens- land. Mr. Jensen is now 58 years of age, and arrived in Australia 50 years ago, when he went to the Cooktown district of Northern Queensland as one of a communi- ty of gold diggers, which included 20,000 Chinamen and 4,000 whites. After work- ing in the various goldfields of Northern Queensland, Mr. Jensen settled on the land and engaged in tropical agriculture. He has reared a family of 10 children, When he left Australia it was with the intention of spending an extended holiday in the land of his birth, but he had become too acclimatised to the tropics of Queens- land to appreciate other condtions, and had had to curtail his vacation. While in Denmark he travelled throughout the coun- try advocating the advantages of migra- tion to Australia, and he found that farm workers of the best type could be secured from Denmark provided assistance in the matter of passage money could be arrang- ed. At present it cost a Danish migrant £24 for his passage to Australia as against £12 to the British migrant. On the last night of his stay in Denmark he address- ed a meeting of interested Danes, whose knowledge of Australia was so small that he had to draw a map to show our location in the world. Quite a number of his hear- ers intimated that they would be ready to migrate to Australia if means could be found to advance all or portion of their fares. Mv. Jensen added that the Can- adian Government was doing its best to obtain Danish farmers as migrants to Can- ada; indeed, the Canadian Government was giving Danish migrants a preference.
