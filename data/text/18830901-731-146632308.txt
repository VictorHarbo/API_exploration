(To the Editor of the Chronicle .) Sib, — If Dawson, or 22. Dawson, to give him tbe benefit of his significantly- fitting initial, is so 11 heartily in favor of Danes and Germans being brought direct from their own country; also immigration from those parts' (fft'c), why does he prate so loudy and lustily to his pals on the iniquity of the present Government in plao ing greater facilities in tbe way of Danish and German, than of British immigration, and why is the ' favoritism', shown to 'them furrin crawlers,' by the party in power one of the chief counts in'tbc indictment brought againBt them by Dawson ? When Griffith holds tho reins, this will doubtless, as Dawson assures us, be altered, a consummation desirablo from Dawson's point of view, but scarcely from the standpoint of my countrymen, who are not anxious to form a regiment or corps in that ragged army 40,000 strong, which Griffith and Bailey promise ub shall invade us annually at a wage of from 15s, to 2s. 6d. a week. A word of advice to Dawson and I have done with him : — Talk clap-trap aB much as you like ; don't write it. You can deny your talk, or explain it away, or if driven into a corner, ' call for proofs.' What is written remains. Yours, -fcc. L. Thompson's Flat, August 29,
