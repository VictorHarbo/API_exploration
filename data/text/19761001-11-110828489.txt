The kidnapping of the ambassador, from a top people brothel (a typical Chabrol joke has the ambassador, glimpsed previously with his wife ot a ballet which ends with two cymbals clashing ominously over the lead dancer, breathing an ecstatic 'Salome!' as his whore does a dance of tho one veil), entails the killing of two policemen, one finished off with that familiar weapon from police-demonstrator clashes, a catapult. Their manifesto to the press not only proclaims their goal of ridding France of its 'representatives of order', stating that if their demands are not met theambassador will be murdered, but also appeals to the public to join in choosing their own statesman, cop, priest or artist for elimination "Nada is a tough film, all the more so in that it refuses to pledge its heart unequivocally to -the Left . . ." \- Tom Milne, Sight and Sound "Nada sustains a cracking pace throughout and reminds us all the time that it is after all only an imaginary thing, unlike Costa Gavras' treatments of similar themes in which all is deadly serious and there is some basis of fact . . \- Dougal Macdonald, Canberra Times, June 10, 1975.

'Nashville' is simply 'the ultimate Allman movie' we've been waiting for . . . M 'Nashville' isn't organised according to patterns that you're familiar with, yet you don't question 1he logic. You get it from the rhythms of the scenes. The picture is at once a "Grand Hotel' - style narrative, with twenty-four linked characters; a country-and-Western musical; a documentary essay on Nashville and American life; a meditation on the love affair, between performers and audiences; and an Altman party " 'Nashville' is about tho insanity of a fundamentalist culture in which practically the whole population has been turned into groupies. The story spans the five days during which a political manager, played by Michael Murphy, lines up the talent for a Nashville rally to be used as a TV show promoting. Ihe Presidential candidacy of Hal Phillip Walker. Walker's" slogan is 'New Roots for the Nation' - a great slogan lor the South, since country music is about a longing for roots that don't exist . . . . . For the viewer, 'Nashville' is a constant discovery of overlapping connections. The picture says, This is what America is, and I'm part of it. 'Nashville' arrives at a time when America is congratulating itself for having got rid of the bad guys who were pulling the wool over people's eyes. The movie says that it isn't only the politicians who live the big lie - the big lie is something we're all capable of trying for. The candidate, Hal Phillip Walker, never appears on the screen; he doesn't need to - the screen is full of candidates. The name of Walker's party doesn't have to stand for anything; that's why it's the Replacement Party. 'Nashville' isn't full of resolutions, because Altman doesn't set up conflicts; the conflicts are barely visible 'Nashville' is the funniest epic vision ever to reach the screen". \- Pauline Kael, The New Yorker, March 3, 1975. "Highly recommended" \- Dougal MacDonald, Canberra Times, August 17, 1976. Plus I. F. STONE'S WEEKLY (G) Jerry Bruck's brilliant documentary on the crusading and honest journalism of I. F. Slone in Washington as the ferret of truth in times of lies, duplicity ond corruption upholding the motto that "every government is run by liars and nothing they say should be believed". THURSDAY, OCTOBER 21 NIGHTLY AT 7.30 FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE FOX COMES A FILM YOU'LL IOVE EVEN AtORE THAN HAROLD AND MAUDE FEAR EATS "THE SOUL. A F3LM BY RAtlUEH WEHWER FASSBJNDEft . '< (M) . , Its plot is an extraordinary mesh of low-key melodrama and social criticism. Emmi meets AM when she takes shelter in a bar frequented by Moroccans, Germany's most despised immigrants. To her surprise, her friendly overtures lead to a seduction and, soon after, to marriage; to her dismay, she is immediately ostracised by her neighbours, her three grown-up children, local tradesmen and her fellow-charwomen at work. "She averts a breakdown only by taking Ali for a holiday abroad. By the time they return to A\unich, the social system has come to 'accommodate' the upset they caused (Emmi is needed: as a helping hond, a babysitter or a customer) ond Emmi suddenly finds that she can command an 'audience' for her prize husband. Without noticing, she adopts a matriarchal role, and Ali drifts back to a voracious woman barkeeper who enjoys his virility at first hand . . . . » Much, of course, hinges on sex. Ali is a terrific stud (Fassbinder twice shows ffim 'magnificently' naked) who provokes mole envy and female fust, responses that the movie discovers behind nearly all the social facades. Throughout, the themes covert in the Jane Wyman-Rock Hudson relationship in All That Heaven Allows are made explicit, and ferociously convincing. "Fassbinder circumscribes the movie's area of interest by fading out on anything irrelevant to his direct concerns (the first night that the couple share; their turning-point holiday), . . . The overall approach invites comparison with other European critiques of America genres (Melville's gangster movies, Leone's Westerns); bur Fassbinder is clearly as interested in vindicating Sirk as he is in using a rhetorical style to make his unequivocal statements on film. This 'politicised weepie' realises both aims with an assurance of o kind almost vanished from narrative cinema". \- Tony Rayns, Sight and Sound Plus RE: LONE (R) Franz Ernst's Danish film of escape from piohl'pv, of life by lone who runs from her footer parent*. from th.? bey who gives her the love she needs a»»d finally fror" the child -.h'» is expecting, ending in harrowing scene of v:!t !v;lp abortion \- . with Pcrnille Klovedul, Steo Kaalo. fcrik l ivd- vn.
