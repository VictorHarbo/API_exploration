Copenhagen is following tho lead of Belgium, and a measure is in contemplation by which it is proposed to levy a tax of from 12s to 24s, according to their value, on all bicycles used in the Danish Metropolis. The authorities expect to raise £17,000 a year in this way in Copenhagen alone.

A Moscow correspondent declares tbat, as a result of the persecution of the Jews, 18,000 of them have embraced the orthodox faith daring the past two years, AH those who are converted live in the village of Teberkesovo, situate about five mites from Moscow, There they remain for three years under the supervision of the orthodox priests, who allow them to return to Moscow provided they are convinced of the sincerity of their converts. During the past nine years the London Post-office department has delivered 824,000,000 parcels, representing an aggre gate weight of 380,000 tons.

A Danish musical critic, Mr Angul Ham* mcrich, claims to have made an interesting archaologieal discovery. He has hwn trrincr some experiments with some ancient 41 Iutb' or horns which were deposited at the begin ning of this century in the Royal Museum at Copenhagen. These lure belong to the Bronze Age of Denmark, and are believed to be 8000 years old. Some of them have been restored, under Mr Hammerich's directions, and at a lecture given by him these ancient instruments served for the playing of modern music by modern per formers. The ^ instruments are in cast bronze, and are in the form of bulls' horns. In construction they are very scientific, and they prove, acoording -to the lecturer, that those who made them were acquainted with the theory of harmony. Even the pitch, strange to say, accords with the Continental 'diapason normal' of to-day.
