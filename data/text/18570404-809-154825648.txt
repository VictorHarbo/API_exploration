Gentlemen, — I beg to tender my thanks to my friends, for their support at tho late election, and to ex press my regret, that urgent public duties arising from a recent catastrophe, prevented my doing this at the hustings. I have also to express my gratification at the very general expression of kindly feeling towards me, by those who did not profess to vote for mo. In assisting to form tho Ministry my sole object was to prevent our new Parliament from becoming a more court to register tho decrees of the Government ; and I was anxious that it should not for tho second time be said that V ictoria was not ripe for freo institutions. I have no doubt that when tho country has had tho opportunity of considering our measures, it will not ho long of appreciating the advantages oftho change. And if apprehensions arising from religious influences havo been entertained by some, I greatly err if it bo not dis covered beforo long, that such fears should rather have been applied to the system which wo havo abolished. My best wishes will always be for the prosperity of your district, with which I have been so intimately con nected, and I shall always have a lively rcmembranco of your many kindnesses.
