COmiERCML. Arte Office, Satmxfav Evouinsr; The only export-entry passed to-da-y for gpid at the Customs was for J oz per SufEbllc : for London. Tho extraordinary-bleak and wintry weather wo have for so long been favored with .still- continues, without Hie slightest- appearance of- an y change. The spring of tho year thus goes oat,, an d summer is ushered in, in tho inidst of as boistoroa -s weather as has been experienced in the very depth of winter; proving, a serious drawback upon busiu ess, more especially at so advanced a period, of tlio year. Despite of all this, however, .the current week has been noted for considerable activity in tb e import market, for, though few spoculativ-i tra.usnctions have been entered into, and the dear :and has principally boon limited to supplyii ig trade wants, yet that bears evidence of in creased trade. Ale and stout evince no improve ment ; bottled stout, if anything, being, weaker. Corn sacks maintain tho recent advance, and ore mostly hold for much higher rates. Woolpacks are scarce, and wanted. Currants are firmer again. Flour has become more settled, and it is -now gene rally believed cannot go lower. Adelaide wheat has beon dealt in at a reduction. Feeding grains are all declining. Malt lias attracted more notice. Butter is rather casior. Hams, and bacon have ad vanced. Conrso salt is creeping up. New, season teas have been placed on the market thin -week. Tim ber is still heavy. Fine brandies nre falling. Tho British and Foreign arrivals comprise sis vessels from England, one from New York, and one from Mauritius. Ale and Stout. — Bulk ale remains.in. a state of almost stagnation ; no sales of any consequence can bo mado, business being entirely confined to execut ing small orders. Bass's No. 3 is held for £7. There is littlo No, 4 in tho market, the price ro quired for any ofioring being £7 10s. Allsopp's rules nt £6 15s for No. 3, to £7 for No. 4.

Scotch is valued nt £5 10a to £6, but there is littlo inquiry in tho meantime. 50 lihds English, at auction, sold Tilth all faults, brought £3 10s to £3 12s Cd. For bulk stout, tho demand is languid ; prices, however, Bhow littlo alteration. Taylor, Walker and Co.'s have been disposed of at £6 17s Cd. Whitbread's wo quote at £0 15s ; and Allsopp's £C 10s. A sale of GOO lihds ale and 100 hlids stout, Allsopp's, wus held yesterday, but wo understand nothing could ho sold.
