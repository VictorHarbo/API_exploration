The total of the corresponding week of last year amounted to 37,494 oonoes* The average during the first quarter of the current year was 41,925'ounceB; during the year 1857 it was 47,670 ounces.

The imports amounted to the declared value of £192,426, and the exports to £460,728. The chief item of the latter was gold, of which 107,802 ounces were exported. The other articles of colonial produce were—Black sand, 8f tons; bark, 10i tens; bones, 20 tons; flour, 20 tons; gum, tons; hides, 10,260 No. and 48casks; horns, , 15,6C0; skins, 600 No. and 188 bales; wool 00 74,481 lbs. There has been some little movement in the import market to-day. Importers have shown an indisposition to force goods on the market in the absence of buyers, and have assumed some degree of indifference as to effecting sides. This has naturally led to a temporary reaction. Buyers, however, not' withstanding stocks in second hands-are generally believed to be small, evince no disposition to purchase to any extent at present xates, and no amount of business consequently lias been done. Flour continues in steady demand for small lots, for direct use, at unchanged rates, sales of best Adelaide brands having been effected in small parcels at from £20 10s. to£21 5s. per ton, according t brands. Messrs. Basey and Co. held a sale of an extensive assortment of timber, &c.;, on the Wharf to-day, at which the following prices Were realised, viz.: 9 by 8 deals, 1 to 3 cut, 4$d. to 6*d.; 7 by 2£, 2 cut, 4|d. 49-16d.; spruce, 7 by 2, 2|d.; 8 by 2,3£d.; 9 by 2, 8fd.; 11 by 8-2, 8, and 4 cuts-8d.; 7 by 8 battens, 6$d.; Scotch flooring-boa 18-liSd.; . sawn laths, 27s. to 27d. 6d per 1,000; red pine logs, 8s. 6d. per cubic foot. doors, 8s. 6d. to 24s. 6d.; sashes, 6s. 9di to 16s.' 6d.; fire bricks, £i 10s. per 1,000; hoop iron, £6 16s.

A second meeting of the Chamber of Commerce on the brokerage question hid taken piace, but nothing was done. The Empire reports of recent arrivals— We have had several important arrivals during Saturday and yesterday, comprising the Carrington, from New Tork, with lumbar and sundries; the Beatrice, Aurora, and Johannis Hendrikus Ferdinand, all from Hong EohgL and bringing 1,298Chinese immigrate, Th^ Escort has also arrived from New Tork, with a general cargo, the principal items of whioh are 10 tierces 181 half-tierces, and 20 quarter-tierces of tobacco, 660 casks dried apples, 3,953 barrels of flour, and 961 pieces of imber. By the Castilim, from Liverpool, we have had an addition to our English population of 417 immigrants. The Lady Head, from the same port, also with immigrants, may be hourly expected. The Abbey, from Hobart Town, brings .; 80,000 shingles, 25,030 feet , battens, and 100 bales of hay. The Meggie, Bride, Lizzie Oakford, Princess Royal, Macduff, and Herald of the Morning, all sailed from England in the latter part of February or early in March, and may therefore be fairly considered due, consequently an increase to our stocks may be shortly anticipated. The Sydney Morning Herald makes the following remarks on the Parliamentary documents on the postal service brought out by the Australasian :— The Directors of the Boyal Mail Company, who only wanted the extension of thecontract, and did not care on what professed unds was granted, readily assented to s proposition, and offered to accelerate the Brazilian service so that the homeward strainer should reach England three days fcefore the outward mail left—an acceleratio *Wch couldbe effected by dropping Madeira and Teneriffe out of the list of pSces called 0^uF at. Having agreed to the bargain, it then a^to^the Lords of the Admiralty to ask what the Company mean to do for the money to the way of the ".'general improvement of tteir vessels?" to which the Sectary replies that they intend to build three new Iron steamers of 8,000 tons burden and 800-horse power, to run tothe West Indies, and to put a new steamer of 1,000 tons burden to run between Rio Janeiro and the Biver Plate-an J* hic £ ^miralty expresses itself satisfied, and orders are given to prepare JaEy^siS. exteuding the «erm Though no correspondence appears to have S? 7 4 J ? o P 0^ mentioned in 8 the joint s at v letter t h e of the t h e r two chairmen (at fcS « ^ Published), there must have for ^+ft™? p some sort carried on, 8 f November following, a M S r ^ ' was i n enteredintowith whichtwo of the points specified in that letter are nrorided iaocmjmnity with the desireeSSset fl?" % JP^oata ®re made quarterly, fiaea ^Jderfucted from the subsequentqJkrter's ^of^ce. and an agreement is m^ie that voyages commenced, or in course of beiaa ^ ^ o u t at the time of th?temiSItion of rate.

But havina been subsequently taken up by the Best India Company for the conveyance of troops to India, it was permitted to charter her temmrarily for the mail service, to replace the Emeu. in the reportof the annual meeting of the Australian Royal Mail Company, to which the Victoria belongs, we observe that the Chairman states that she is chartered for twelve months to the Royal Mail Company, with the option of purchase. - .wf^vK 000 thing in the letter quoted £ W W ifc quires Mke(i explanation. t It will be l »at the Royal Mall Company a contract might be made contermi- »ous with that of the Australian 8 Company, nd tothat end it might be extended to January, 1864\. But it so happens that they were conterminous as it was. The Australian contract commenced in January, 1857, and as it was fixed for five yean, it would of course terminate in January. 186% exactly the same month as that in which the Royal Mall Company's contract expired. The probability is, that as an application for an extension of the Australian contract, by two years, had been made to the Imperial Government, and acquiesced in contingents on the consent of th colonies being obtained, the two chairmen assumed that concession as practically granted, and acted accordingly. But it cannot have been actually granted, or during the twelve months whioh nave since elapsed the colonial Governments would have been advised of the foot. Moreover, the supplemental contract entered into in the November following makes no mention of it, and it would require a second contract to legalise the concession. It was on the 25th of May, 1857, that Mr. E wing's first application for the extension was maae. On the 8th of June Mr. Wilson aooeded to the proposal, conditionally on its receiving colonial approval. On the 15th of June Mr. Labouchere despatched the enclosure to the various colonial oyernors. It te impossible, therefore, that fy the 29th of July, long before these documents could have reached the colonies, much less could have been answered, that the extended contract could have been actually confirmed. Whether the Bill that has been passed through Parliament, providing for the amalgamation of the two companies, oontains any reference to this matter, we cannot say, not having received a copy of that document. Mr. Wentworth, in his letter, states that the Boyal Mail Company made the extension of the Australian contract a condition of their entering on the undertaking, and he advised a compliance with the request accordingly. But as the colonial Governments have alreaoy unanimously declined to agree toit. the Company must either abandon their sme qud noa or abandon their enterprise.
