Summer will soon be here,' and it is in the hot "weather tha t"the woman with a hairry face- looks her wdrst. The great de stroyer of Superfluous Hairs. is Dannebrog, the- celebrated Danish remedy;.a whici bhas triumphantly withstood the severest. tests required of it in ten years i .Australasia. For years Dannebrog stood upon its "rial, and. then a grand jury composed .of the women' of Australia hailed Danbrog as the conqueror. " a ' Madame Frokjar, whose headquarters were at '165 :Collins-street, Melbourne; hsad' roevd that' Dannebrog used so succesfully in Northern Europe could withstand` the' Aus tralian climate, and that it was~isuperior to the electrical and other methods. Danno brog is popular everywhere, and medical men recommended :t. But it. has achieved its remarkable popularity by its own pecu liar virtues, and because by removing lines of worry along with annoying and unsightly hairs it 'ives the. face a more youthful and .beantiful' appearance. A BLESSING TO WOMANKIND.
