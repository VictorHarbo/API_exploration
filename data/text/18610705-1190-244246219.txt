Lawranoe furnishes tho subjoined roport of the flour and grain market for tho week ending tho 4th July: — Flour. — Imports nro very light, and a quiet and steady business is being done, whioh, how ever, docs not appear to meet tho views of a portion of the Press reporting upon it. If it . does not fluctuate, and risoend full, to produce a crisis or a panic, , it is not from tho want of sufllcient torture being applied to it ; if other commodities and articles of consumption are quiet, why should not tho flour market havo a rest? Were tho same agency used to correct abuses whioh are now beginning to eroop into it, good sorrieo would bo done. Largo parcels of flour, mado from sprouted and damaged wheat, are now going into consumption as colonial flour, without brand — an .evil rcquir- ng a check ; while an old system, equally notorious, has again come to a height, — that jf re-bagging Hour of inferior sorts into sacks bearing tho brands of first-class millers, . thereby foisting an indifferent article upon tho public, and sciiously injuring tho miller, who may havo the cha racter of his manufacture thus traduced byjmost unfair means. Tho existence of such abuses tiro bad hero, but if flour, so handled, finds its way into tho Mauritius, Indian, and China markets, where wo will in a few years have to iook for a trade, llie consequences wili be most injurious. Speculators watch the market, and havo made oilers in tho course of the week, but not such us importers choose to accept ; the actual state of our resources, and the certainty that no foreign fiour ean bo im ported to compete with our own, will tend to give more firmness to I lie market, and a turn may not be far distant.
