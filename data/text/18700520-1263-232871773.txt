IMMIGRATION. We have been courteously infotmed that by the Mail just arrived the Board of Immigration have received information from Mr F. Buck that the ship Victoria was expected to sail from Hamburgh on the 20th April for Hobart Town with Immigrants. Mr Buck forwards a list of the passengers whose berths were secured at the date of his letter, the 24th March, amounting to thirty live males, thirtyseven females, and sixty-nine children. The Emigrants are for the mo-t pare of the agricultural class and have all been very carefully selected. Mr Buck anticipated that the Victoria would shortly be followed by other vessels, as the facilities afforded for emigrating to this colony were made known throughout the length and breadth of Germany, and a considerable interest had been already excited on the subject, Mr Buck states that the enquiries for his hand book among the hardworking and industrious islanders and Zealanders has inc'ucedhim to undertake a translation intoDanish, aud he is now having impressions of two thousand printed in Copenhagen for distribution among the small farmers in those provinces. The head of the Geographical Institute at Gotha has expressed hi~ wdiingness to pubiish a series of Maps of Tasmania showing the geological features of the Island, the lands sold or leased, lines of internal communication, the Electoral, Municipal, an < Police districts, with the distribution of the populati-m and other matters of interest, and the Board of Immigration, at Mr Buck's request, have directed the preparation of copies of Sprent's Maps, containing all the information the Government can supply, in order to enable Dr Peterman to carry out his design. The Board have also received the outline of Mr Sevin's propososal respecting the immigration of as* sociated bodies of Germans and their settlement in communities it Tasmania. There are many features in the scheme which deserve careful consideration; but it require" that careful consideration before the system can either be accepted or rejected.
