PIANO THE HARMONIOUS HAAKE PIANO THE HARMONIOUS HAAKE PIANO THE HARMONIOUS HAAKE PIANO Is the Piano But still holds the World's Record. Built throughout of the Finest Materials that can be obtained, and by the most highly skilled labour that money can command, it is only natural that Its particularly PLEASING and RICH APPEARANCE should be equalled by its BRILLIANT MELICAN TONE, and Its EXCEPTIONAL DURABILITY under any and every climatic condition. THE HARMONIOUS UAAKE PIANO Is truly in a class by itself. It is the recognised standard by which all other Pianos are judged. Built specially for the Australian climate, and intended primarily" for the Country Home, the principle of construction is such that THE HARMONIOUS HAAKE PIANO boards its tone longer than any other Instrument made; and, as a result, no other Piano gives'such LASTING satisfaction to out-of-town dwellers as HAIRE," and certainly there is no Piano to-day that is more universally popular among musicians than it THE HARMONIOUS HAAKE PIANO.
