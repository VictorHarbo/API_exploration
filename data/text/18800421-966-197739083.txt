Gentlemen—Having to-day been requested byseveral influential Electors to become a Candidate for your District, I have much pleasure in complying with their wishes to stand, although rather late in the field. As the nomination is fixed for Monday, the 19th inst., I shall not be able to attend public meetings prior to the Election, or I should have been glad to have had the opportunity to explain my views personally, feeling certain that they would generally be satisfactory to you. I will say briefly that during my long residence in South Australia I have studied and done my best to promote the interests of all classes. I have been placed in positions which enabled me to form opinions on all the public questions affecting the wellbeing of the country, and have not hesitated to express them on fitting occasions. Probably,' therefore, you may know something of them; but if honoured with your support I will endeavour to justify your confidence in taking me to some extent npon trust. I am in favour of economy in government, combined with a judicious expenditure of pablie money. I should oppose any addition -to taxation unless it is proved to be absolutely necessary for maintaining.the public credit. I conclude by asking for your hearty support on the day of election. I remain, your faithful Servant, SAMUEL TOMKINSON. Mount Lofty, April 16,1880. HOzo JgLECTION FOR GUMERACHA.
