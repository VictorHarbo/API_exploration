On the 8lh of October last, tbs asst new steamer "Laurel" left Liverpool, with » good compliment of eabin passengers on board, ** likely- looking young asen," as tba pilot pronoenced them. Frida v, the 14th of October, found the " Laurel" »afc!j moored in Funchal Bay, Madeira. People there «sid »he was a bloctade-ratiDer. So »be waa, but she had other work to perform in this instance. People wondered too, that the passengers did not go on shore t bot they were satisfied with an explanation that abey were "Polish immigrants," without money; some Poles, on their way to Bichmona, naring stopped there a few week* previously, and having left wirti professions of -total inability to pay the debts they incurred. On Monday, the 17th of October, a ship-rigged vessel came into the harbour and steamed out again. This natu- rally excited suspicion. "Next morning the vessel came in eight again. Captain Waddell, it is* facetiously said, had an idea that she might be tor sale, and therefore he steamed out alter ber with tb» " Laurel," Both vessels anchored in smooth water, on the east aide of the island, both under the English flag. Here the strange ship wa* purchased-£45,000 i* the price named-and here tba ** Laurel " tran- shipped ker caigo into ber. Tko ship then stood oat to sea, and when far beyond the tte-itral marine teague Captain Waddell sum- moned the crew aft, and read his commission as commander of the Confederate sloop-of-war " Shenandoah," ordered to cruise and destroy the enemy** oom meroe. Until thia, and in order to preserve thenentral regulation*, »ot one of the package* received from the " Laurel " wa» broken. Captain Waddell had only twenty three maa, au told, with him ¡ »slumber wbi~b, after deducting officers, firemen, tte, left bim only fire men in each watch ; while the »hip was unarmed, and the package* baring been faswrisdlv put on board, wrerything «ra» tn the »Testest ronfasion lhere «nu only one way to manage. Bunning under topsail, the fore vail, and the jib» by day-all the canvas the crew could work-and steaming by night, the "Shenandoah " «ra« taken a« quickly as possible to one of the "calm »pot«,'* which exist in mid-ocean in the trades. Here it was felt that the ship was socare, at na vessel hot a steamer could come to the place, and it was not likely that cruirers would be looked for tn latitude* io unproductive of prey. The officers took off their jacket*, and all hands setting to with a wfll, the ddp waa apeeddy got in trim, and commenced ber operations, lite crutxing ground selected «ms in the track of vessels boand for tba South American potts. On the 29th of October work was really com- menced. In tba morning, royals and stanaaus were set in chase of a barque. At ene o'clock the chase waa two miles distant, Knghsh colour* were «bown, and the .barcas rrp'ied with the l'an kee nag. Confederate colours were then hoisted, and the barque was bore-to and examined. tine was tbs barque "Afina," Staples, master, owned in Maine, bound from Akyab to Buenos Ayres, with a cargo of rail- way aron. After removing the crew and stores, scuttled ber. The crew numbered ten men, eight of «rimm joined the " Shenandoah." The cargo vras valued st 88,000 dollar* ; the barque, which waa only «ix month* old, at 50,000 dollar*. Ow tb» S th November steam «nu got up in chase of a forge schooner. At half-past «eren «.m. fired a gun at ber, when she bore-to. She «bowed the «tar and «tripes. Proved to bethe " Charles Oak," Otllmaa, master, bound from Boston to San Fnmntoo, with an assorted cargo. Sup- plied the «Mp with «torea from ber, including 2000 lbs. waight of preserved tomatoes. The alaster's wife wa« on board, and also ber sister, the widow of a Northern corporal, foiled at Harper's Ferry. The captain gare a stern cabin up to the ladies. Private property was respected, bat 200 douses found on the master were confiscated. Captain Waddell gave the Boney, in the name of the Confederacy, to the waster's «rife, on ber promising that she would ant restore it to ber husband. The woman promised eagerly. Burnt the vessel, which was a »ew one. On the 7th November, chased »nd captured the baratte **!>.

Two days afterwards spoke a Danish brig, boand for Bio. The brig took off two austen, four mates, and two sian, in consideration of receiving » chro aeancter, a barrel of beef, and a barrel of pork -all prise artioW At darlieht on November 10, «tgbted tU clipper brig -Susan," bound to the Ki ver Plate, with a can» af eos!*.
