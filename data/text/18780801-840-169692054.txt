TODD'S- SPECIALITIES? NO. 17: npODD'S mind has of late been: a. bit. over* JL . burdened, and it is time his- confessions should be given to the world. Todd's position, has become ^responsible one. Hia utterauceo are held in reverence and esteem, by his numer ous readers,, and he has to be otiroful of what he expounds. In all that ho says he carefully avoids personalities. Ho ha3- no desire to wound any. one's sensibilities. .This is why he ia bo popular-; and as his populurity.incvoaBes,.eo do his responsibilities. His- anxieties con cerning a Bussian invasion were quito uulliaed by his successful salo of tho Sylvan Grove Estate. Tho intelligonca received of the proslamation of universal peaco was fitly celebrated by the Toowong con cert. 1'Odd wub there, and. was proud of its well merited success. Tho music has been running in Todd's head over/Bince. It did him good. 'JBhat ' March Romania' was something to be romombered ; but this is a digression. Todd,has to unbosom, and it must be done. That three million voto is worthy of the new opposi tion leader. Todd's eyes have opened wido on several occasions, first in the notices of motion, agaia in reading the spceoh, and ' the third and lasfctdme.' I Bhall knoek. it down. No, steady, on. reading tho Premier's knowing reply. Mind you wo shall, get the money, because both sides of, the house- aro agreed about it. Tho Opposition would like to turn oat the Government on it. But ' our Sam' saw tho point, and of course advised thus : ' Say we mean to do it, but had not quito hatched the scheme.' Todd believes in it bo ; cause it will improve trade, cseato confidonce, ; stir up immigration,, increase- the number of Todd's coustituen'asg.and do good to all classes, : but the money must bo judiciously spent. Any one can borrow, but it takes a. man like Todd to lay it out to thVbcst advantage. Luslly, let Todd advise once more the immediiito investment of surplus funds iu Toowoug Lands. It is tho besttbini; in tho market. If you wait until the loan, is floated they will all be snatched up. If you by now, you can then soil at an enormous profit. Todd has got another plum. The Toowong Estate, situate at the corner of Church- Bisect, Sherwood Koad, and opposito Todd's House, within a stone's throw of the. Railway and the Parish Church. This is now being pegged out aud surveyed, and will well repay, inspction. Todd's bills are stuck up all over the estato, and thoro is no deception. 'JSho Bale will shortly be announced, aud Todflj will reside at the hammer. FOR SALE.— Township of Waterlord.— SMALL FARM, of 4 Acres, two. sepa rate Blocks, 2 acres each. Splondid position.
