The large number of. students who hare drawn inspiration and knowledge from the two first parts of the Rev. G. Vale Owens epoch-making work: "The Life Beyond the Veil," will be interested to hear. that. p.rt No. 3 has just come from the press. it bears the significant title, "The Ministry of Heaven," anid is of even greater import tuan its celebrated forerunners, '"The Iow lands of Heaven". and he :Highlands of Heaven." Fired by the importance and" sun cess of. his unique task, the gifted authr has given final proof in this latest volume of much that was hitherto doubtful.or ob; scure. The genuine message from departed friends and other persons beyond the veil are carried on, and the revelations they' contain shed a new light over the intiinate connection between that what is and was. T''he Messages here printed deal' in':a great part with a mission to the Spheres of Darkness. conducted by & .band of spirit Beings, under the chargeof a- Leader, who is the communicator with Mr. Vale Owen, while a description is also given of the City of Blasphemy. In the course of the me= sage much light is thrown on the methods of communication, and the means. deopted by the communicators in order to get a i touch with Mr. Vale Owen. Every reader of the two previous volumes will be anxious to peruse this latest adds tion. A limited number only can be promptly supplied by the Perth agents, AL. BERT and SON, L'D.
