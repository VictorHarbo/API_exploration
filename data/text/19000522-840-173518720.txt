' ; . ; Ifcttdrnt illl. ; Seoures to the sender of that S . preliminary subscription a _» place in the distribution of " The Tillies" Reprint of the ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNIA. Further monthly payments of one guinea each until the subscriber' has paid 'seventeen guineas in all, completes tho purchase. ThiB is tho present price of the 25 splendid volumes of tho " Treasury of Knowledge," as the " Encyclopaedia Britannioa " was happily described by tho " Athenseum." The process by whioh prompt applicants may obtain the national work at this extremely low price is a simple one. ONE. The order form which appears at tho foot of this column should be cut out, or ai similar- form obtained, by applying to The Tiniia (London) in a written request, addressed to Bris bane, Queensland. , ' ' TWO. - ' ' The order form should he legibly signed in the spnoo indicated for the subscriber's signa ture; the subscriber's address sbonld be written in tho - space provided for that purpose. If the books arc to be delivered elsewhere than in Brisbane, the purchaser should add the namo of the carrier'in Brisbane to whom delivery is to bo inudc. The form thus completed should be sent to the Queensland office of The Timet (London),, as under, accompanied by a remittance of one guinea. THREE. Upon receipt of the order form and ono guinea, the publishers of The Times will send to the subscriber a receipt for the preliminary subscription. This receipt will bear a distinctive number, showing the position on the list at which tho subscriber's name has been in its turn inscribed. FOUR. Aa fast as orders are received the books will bo delivered to the subscribers, in tho order in which the subscriptions wore received. (A supply of stock for tho filling of immediate orders is now carried in Brisbane, and from wliieh point all shipments will bo mode.) The entire 25 volumes will he delivered all at ono time, carefully sealed in a tin-lined case. No ohorge for packing. . FIVE. On receipt of the Tolnmes farther payment of one guinea is to be made. SIX. On tho corresponding day of eaoh month tberonfter a further payment of ono guinea should be made to the Bank of New South Wales, Brisbane, or at any of its branches in Queensland, until the transaction is closed. Tho process may be simplified by enclosing with the_ original application a cheque for. tho full amount, less tho discount of One Shilling in tho Gninea, making tho price far the cloth binding seventcon poundsinstcad of seventeen guineas, with the same proportionate reductions for the better bindings. A FEW OF THE 2HSTI2TCTOXSHED CONTRIBUTORS TO THE "ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA." Among the cloven hundred writers whoso articles appear in the Ninth Edition of the " Encyclopedia Britannica " aro these ropresentativo men of our tima : — Right Hon. James Bryco Prof. Max Mnflcr Dean Farrar Lord Kelvin Lord Eayleigli Lord Grimtliorpe Alg. Chas. Swinburne Sir William Crookes i ' Principal Tulloch Alex. Bain Right Hon. John Morley 1'i-ul'. Skoas Bishop of London Mra. Humphry Ward Prof. Rav Lankcster "Cavendish" Sir Arch. Goikio Sir Fredk.

Abel Mrs. M. G. Faweett Prof. Dewar Gen. Maiu-ice Austin Dobson Bev. H. R. Haweis Grant Allen Canon Rawlinsou Geo. W. Cablo , St. Georgo Mivart Prof. Huxley' Matthew Arnold R. Louis Stevenson W. M. Morris John Addington Symonds : Prof. Romanes To select in this fashion the name of hilt ono contributor out of every score who collaborated upon the " Encyclopaedia Britannica " is not an' altogether satisfactory process. Yetinreuding over these names, one is, . at any rate, impressed by the fact that the contri butors to tho " Encyclopaedia Britannica" uro not merely specialists with great information, but original thinkers. They are the men who have themselves influenced our thoughts and belieia, have directed, even created, contemporary taste and learning. Each one of tho eleven hundred authors was invited to write for tho "Britannica," because he possessed a special knowledge wliieh did not lie within the competence of any among his coUca"uos. Such dissimilarity among the writers is an essential merit in a work of general reference? and thoro arises an'almost grotesque incongruity when an attempt is mado to think of such divergent capacities in tlio block. One common quality, however, binds tho names just cited. The Encyclopedia gave no hospitality to tho sort of " harmless drudges" who used to compile works of reference when tho world was youuger. To tua student of any special art or science other names iu the full raster might appeal with greater force, hut to evcrv general reader this list of acknowledged celebrities will convey somo sense of tho distinction which characterises the conteuts of tho volumes. The " Encyclopedia. Britannica" consists of 24 massive volumes of about S50 pages caoli and u twenty-fifth volumo containing an elaborate index to the whole. In addition to the 30,000,000 words which fills its 22,000 pages of letterpress.it contains 338 full -pagn plates aud 671 maps and pilaus. There are over 9,000 other illustrations. Over 1,100 writers con tributed to the work, and a sum of more thau £60,000 was paid . for the manuscript alone. Its exquisite printing, aud the caro with which it is bound, combine with the editorial out lay to mako it the most costly work ever offered to the public. Every copy of the new impression offered by The Times is in evory respect as desirable as any of the copies previously offered by Messrs. A. and C. Blaok," tlio publishers of the " Encyolopicdiit Britannica," at the higher prices. Tlio volumes are of tho same size and shape, the sumo coloured plates and steel . engravings, the same high quality of paper, printing, nnd binding. . The same book, but, for the moment,' it may be scoured by prompt applicants, at a very different price.
