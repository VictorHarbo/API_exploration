SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1885, Changes in the political world of the first importance are indicated in our news columns to day. From time to to time we have foreshadowed that events were likely to happen in con nexion with the Ministry, but the ex. tent of the alterations will be apt to take the public by surprise. As yet no official announcement can bo made, but of course such intelligence as we give to day would not appear in our columns unless it were authentic. In so many words, the disippeiranco of the Coali tion Ministry is chronicled Although astonishment is nitural, and although politicians Mill shaie in the feeling, yet the obsenint amongst members of Parl liament mil non remember many ur cumstanccs leading up to tho event, and man\ allusions to its possibiht> Mr SrRlicr, who've retirement is about to take phce, lias fairlj crowned his public career he has led with un precedented success for a whole l'uilm ment Ho has seen his political pio gi ammo placed upon the "tatutc book It may be assumed that ns a ion aid foi his laboms, and in defcrenco to his position, he mil be unanimously called upon to i reside at the first Tedeial Council ot Austialia 'Hie colonies havo no moro honours to bestow, while on tho othoi hand Mi fbiRiici piobably saw that Me aie onteung upon a mew political eia, in which new men must come to the front and new issues Ai separation liom some of lus fellow workers was inevitable Anotliei such peaceful Parliament as the picsont is scarcely to bo expected and it may well be tnat ut his age, and in his piesent stato ot health, Mr &ERI; ICI should feel entitled to at least a penod of repose His lahoma

in the Cabi net nor speak in the House the diilci euee was soon seen JNo Cabinet Ins e\ei hid a moio leal head than the present Premiei has been If difieiing opinions baie not clashed mthm the Go\

question as to who shall essay tho task of forming a C abinet is soon answered, inasmuch, as íecent deaths, and these withdrawals,, have narrowed tho list of qualified and possible leaders greatly So fir as tho Got eminent aro concerned, the following membeis aie left m tho Assembly -Messrs LAM,IIDCI, LIVIFN, 'luckin, DrvKiN, and GILT II- S JMost of these genllomen are beginners in politics lim

eNpeuence, if not a s/«t ¡na nun. foi a Premier, is at least a gi eat advan taso and Ali CiLiirs is a piactical politician a veteran admimstiiitor, and the best debatei left in the Hou^e Occa sional addresses this last session have shown that he is in the primo of his powers Indeed oneof hisdangusisthat common to all orators, of allowing him self to bo carried further and to hit harder than his judgment intended when he set out Should Ali GiLTirs undertake the pait allotted to him, he will bo boaet with difficulties fiom tho outset ile may shipwreck his fortunes in the first instance by au unfoi túnate choice of colleagues Piobably his desire wall bp to continue on the Service Berry lines, and to prolong the coalition of parties as fni as possible, but it will not bo easj to pick a politician who had his party so completely with lum as Ali BFRI \ had, and he may associate himself with men who will not win lum any radical support, while they may hopelessly alienate constitutional sympathy When a particular politician looms laigely in the public e)o, it may matter little whom ho calla about lum 'Iho power of his name is suflicient for his purposes But this is not the caso to day With good colleagues, there may be no reason why Mr GUT ID s should not pull tluough, but, given bad colleagues, and there would be nothing to prevent a collapse ¡So open is the situation, that the veij grounds on which a new Ministry should bo formed will necessauly be the subject of debate A coalition was a necessity of the case in 1S81, when Mi SLRV ICD formed his Ministry, but n, justification foi a coalition hasalwajs to bo put forwaid, and if Mi GILLILS resolves to repeat the ccpenment, he will requiio to be as eNplicit as was his leader in stating his reasons, and he will need to make out as good a case A choice of new colleagues can scaicely bo deferred long aftei tho Christmas hohdav s, and tfie public will await tho dtnonment with some anxietj, Piesummg that the new Mimsteis, when selected, aio held to bo ontitlod to a tiwi, theie will still remain the question of then measures After íecent unexpected espades, it will bo VC13 impoi taut indeed to know 111 which
