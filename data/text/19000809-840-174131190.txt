We herewith beg to stato to all concerned that we, tho undersigned, alone havo Power to Purchase Horses in Australasia for the IMPERIAL GERMAN GOVERNMENT, and that nobody but suoh Agents ns may bo appointed by us for the purpose of buying Horses have tho right to uot for us on behalf of the Imperiul German Government. . So fur only the following Agents 'have been appointed by us : — MESSRS. PITT. SON, & BADGERY, of Sydney, for Now South Wales MESSRS. CAMPBELL & SON, of Mel- bourne, for Victoria MR. A. J. COTTON, of Bowon, for Queensland, and their Authorised Sab-agents. We are forced to bring this matter under .the notico of horseownere, as wo uro informed that' a false roport is current, that a special buying commission was to come out. Wo also hear of unauthorised agents purohnsing horses on tho pretext of buying for tho Imperiul Greman Government. As thus owners do not get tho full value for their horses, it is dearly to their advantage to only doal with tho ubovementioned authorised agents. . Tho total quantity of first- class sound Military Horses wanted 'is only 2,000 — not 9,000 as stated iu the papers — of which 600 have already boon shipped, or arc on the point of being shipped.
