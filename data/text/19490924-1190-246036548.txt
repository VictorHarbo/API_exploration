Vast MIgipafi®!! 'Fatafasfl® Herald Special Service LONDON, Friday. — "Fantastic nonsense" 'is the description Mr John Hughes applies to Mr Calwell's . statements that Britain must encourage the exodus of 10 or 15 millions of her people. Mr. Hughes, an Australian living in London, was joining in a controversy in the Man chester Guardian which be gan with a letter from another Australian, Mr M. E. Bards- ley. Mr Bardsley wrote saying that if the Australian immi gration policy were unchecked it would rival in misery any thing since the enclosure sys tem drove people into English slums. Mr Hughes writes: "The Australian Minister for Immi gration Is piling up a lot of trouble for his country by his policy of racial discrimination which' Australia could never enforce and without American assistance could \ not enforce now. "I- should have thought that If the recent war taught Aus- tralia one' thing, it was that her White Australia policy rests on very insecure founda tions indeed." Mr Hughes then recalls the treatment given by the Vic torian Government in the middle twenties to English ex- servicemen and ' their wives and families who were attract ed to Victoria by an intensive publicity campaign only to find that the land on which they had settled was worthless. Mr Martin Glanner, Danish playwright, producer and radio producer; will speak on "The Dramatist at Work" in a public lecture in the Public Lecture Theatre, Melbourne University, at 8.15 p.m. on Monday. Pro- fessor Ian Maxwell will preside.
