Nearly the whole of the bnl waritB on both eid«6 were stow in, xtjtiantity of main ntL ^rfifHi &w;«yt the main batcfe stove in, the port pump disabled, and tbe top mast sprung. She bore np for Uaoxitana, arriving on 34th August.' AteJesramintfeeCoiErierdatedTownmBe. %. October IG states the A.S.N. Company^ ^ steamer Elamang, bound from Brisbane to Cooktown, arrived here to-night. She struck on the Salamander Reef eo heavily that Captain Stuart ordered the boats ont, (earing that the steamer would sink. She arrived safely at the anchorage, however, without making any water. Tbe passengers sUte tint the shock when the steamer struck was tre mendous. The captain, who was oo the bridge at the time, supposed that one of tbe screws were damaged. The barqne Italy, Bailed from Southport, Tasmania, on the 27th ultimo with, light southerly wind, which continued nntil abreast of Twofold Bay on the 1st instant ; thenes had five days northerly winds, three days it was blowing hard wittt thick rainy wea&ier;, followed by light southerly and easterly winds with fine weather ; passed Sandy Cape on tie 13th : Cape Capricorn on the 14th ; and anchored off Sea ffill same evening. The Italy towed ap the river on Wednesday 17tfa instant ; bat owing to insufficiency of wharf accommodation, has to wait a week before she can get a discharging berth. The Co im-r says the German barqne Ariadne from Bockhampton to Falmoath, was surveyed in the graving dock, by Captain W. B. Brown, Lloyd's surveyor, and Captain Wood. It warn ascertained that the vessel bad been strained through labouring. In the amidships section of the ship several of the fastenings in the 'tween decks were found to be loose, and there was a leakage in the garboard streak. It ~wa* also ascertained that 14ft. of copper had beem stripped off tie keel, and that the portion so exposed was wormed. It will be necessary to recanlk and recopper the garboatrd Bteeak ott both sides. This was probably accomplished on Saturday, and the vessel floated oat of dock. The fastenings will then be tightened and the top sides recaoiked. and the ressel will receive a general overhauling. Nothing is. yet known of her future movements. ACCTOEKT TO THE EtAitANG. — Oar Towns vflle exchanges state that about half- past six o'clock, when off Cape Cleveland, oo her op ward trip the Elamang was going at her osaal speed and struck twice heavily in quick suc cession. The passengers were at tea at the time, but all were on the instant roused to * sense of danger, No estimate of the damage sustained by the vessel could be possibly made ; but as everyone was apprehensive af the worst, boats were promptly lowered, and everything got in readiness to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. Rockets wti« also fired, but failed to attract attention. After Buffering suspense for some moments, the passengers were informed that the ship was not Tnat-i^g any water, and the alarm which had been created commenced to rab side. Careful f^wm i nation p were made, as far as circumstance* would permit, and after a short delay the boats were haoled op, and the vessel proceeded cautiously on her coarse. Nothing seemed to be amiss, and eventually she steamed to the anchorage at her osnal speed. Captain Stoart reports that he was steering the usual course, perhaps a little fnrther out The sea was calm, and no reef or rock visible. It is surmised she struck on an extended coral bed outside the Salamander Beef, in the same place where tbe Monetoa touched. Subsequent examination showed DO injury vas sustained, and the vessel proceeded on her nsual voyage. She will probably be docked in Sydney.
