The patient— a Miss Southon—arrived in Melbourne on Good Friday from Adelaide, and went to live with some relatives in Swanston-street m the heart of the metropolis. When the nature of her disease was known she was conveyed to the quarantine station and the house at which she had been staying was isolated by the authorities. She is improving in health, and on the 1st inst. the premises in Swanston- street and the inmates thereof were released from quarantine, no further traces of the disease having been then found. On the following day, however, Mrs Nimbs—Miss Southon's sister—who had been one of the persons quarantined in Swanston-street showed symptoms of indisposition, which induced the authorities to order the premises and inmates to be again isolated, although the nature of the illness was not clearly as- certained. It was, however, believed that it might be small-pox. The Government and the health authorities are blamed for having failed, despite the recent small-pox visitation, to construct a contagious diseases hospital or to rnake other suitable preparations for the isolation of patients. 1 he recent poll tax of £10 levied upon eac Chinese coming into the colony haa occt Bioned numerous complicationa 'the lates development ia the dilhculty occasioned i recognising thoao Chinese who land froi outward bound ahipa from other coloniea o the understanding that their £10 tai. vv ill b refunded when they leave the port in tb vessel on board of which they are passenger!

recommended by thia confercnoe for adoption ut this port " 'Hie committee took action with a view to secure the entrance of the Auatralasian colonies into the Universal Postal Union, but had ascertained that some of the colonies were unwilling to become parties to the ar- rangement, which, in view of exiating con- tracts for the conveyance of their maila, would entail a loss on their revenues Com- munications had been received from some Italian Chambers of Commerce, requesting information as to the colony with a view to pnt them in a position to decide what advice they should tender to their Government on the Bubject of the promotion of direct trade between Italy and Australia A sub committee bad reported in favour of the adoption here of the York-Antwerp rules of general average The report of the committee was adopted In conBequence of the abBenca of Mr H Henty, the president for the paat year, it devolved on Mr. F S Grimwade, who was vice president laat year, and who waa elected preeident for the current year, to deliver the usual address In the course of thiB address Mr Grimwade congratulated the chamber on the highly prosperous condi non of the production and trade of the colony during the pasi 12 months There had been abnndance of cheap money, and the produc tion of tho chief staples showed au increase, ns also did trade generally and the revenue He referred to the growing importance of Melbourne as the wool market of Australia, declared it to be the chief wool depot of thia hemisphere, and pointed out that last season, nearly one third of the entire Auatralasian yield of this commodity had been disposed of m the local markets With regard to gold, he expressed the opinion that this years yield would be greater than that of laat year, and he ulao spoke hopefully of the wine growing and frozen meat industries AB to the abundance of cheap money lately ex- perienced, be uttered a few words of caution, observing that seasons of prosperity were apt to give rise to undue speculation, and that it behoved the banka and other financial institutions to watch their advances. He re- tened to the great success of the Melbourne International Exhibition, and spoke grate- fully of the way in which Professor Reuleaux, the representative of Germany at tbo Exhi- bition, had reported about the colonies in Germany In connexion with the Tariff Com- mission, he took the opportunity of declaring hiB adherence to free-trade viewa The ad- dress, was attentively listened to, and well received. The desirableness of simplifying judicial proceedings, and of providing special facilities for the prompt and inexpen- sive settlement of disputes arising oat of the transactions of trade and com- merce, was considered at the meeting. Re* solutions were passed in favour of such re- form, and declaring that an important step towards the settlement of that desideratum would be to constitute the County Couria courtB of first instance for all commercial diBputea, without a limit to their amounts, subject, of course, to all proper regulations for removal and appeal, and to enact that the judge might be aBBisted by competent mercantile assessors It was mentioned by Mr Cowderoy, secretary of the chamber, who has for many yeare taken a great interest m this subject-, that aimliar resolutions have been adopted by the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom The question waa submitted to the meeting at the instance of the committee of the chamber, which desired an expression of opinion from the members, and now that that haa been obtained, the committee will urge the Govern- ment to introduce a bill into Parliament to effect the reform sought THE TARirF COMMISSION Tbo Tariff CommlBBion met in Melbourne on the 2nd mat, and heard further evidence in reference to the operation of the import duties on hardware. Mr. John Danks, brass founder, of Melbourne, gave the opinton that they worked very satisfactorily all round as for aa he could judge, and that it would be an advantage to him if the duties on tools were retained Mr J M Robison, of the firm of Robison Bros, engineers, boiler makers, and brassfounders, in dealing with the same subject, said that the present tariff very probably was benefiting the workmen, bnt he believed he could do better as an em plorer without any duties at all He would not employ so many men, but would save himself the trouble of looking after tbem The firm did a large intercolonial trade, though in some respects it was harassed by the tariff Again he remarked that his busi- ness increaBed in magnitude year by year 'lhere had been no particular time of ad- vance If a free trade policy were to be adopted by the Legislature, he would still be noie to employ na many workmen as at present 'Hie pernicious effects of the tariff, however, were never more clearly demonstrated than in the evidence of Mr J G. Foster, repre- sentative of MeBBrs Robey and Co , of Eng land, who stated that eight horse power portable engines, which were more generally used in the colonies, cost JC2C0 in New South \\\ ales, but m this colony, on account of the duty, cost £310 For an entire threahing plant an extra impost of £30 had to be paid Notwithstanding these duties butfour engines were manufactured in the colony last year, of which a considerable portion of the com poncnt parts were imported from England An unexpecteddiBclosurewaamadeat the meeting of thecom_i88iononthe3rdinat Mr William M Lean (of the firm of M Lean Brothers and Rigg), who previously gave important evi dence from a protectionist standpoint, mci dentally mentioned that although a free trader, ho understood from tho chairman (Mr Mirnms) that it would be necessary for him to recognise the settled policy of the country 'iho chairman did not deny thu assertion, and the commission re examined Mr M'Lean de noio His testimony showed that the imposition of protective duties had had the effect of restricting the operations of the firm with which he waB connected to a very great extent, while there waa nothing to prove that they had perceptibly encouraged the growth of colonial induatries In connexion with this episode, Mr AndrevT, ono of the protectionist membera of the commiasion has given notice of his in tendon to move the following resolution - " That tho chairman bo Instructed to Intimate to partita sunmiored to attend our sittings that the uctlon of this commission l8 limited, and that we aro prevented from entertaining any BUggestiona nhich may bal o the effect of destroying or UDBOttllng the picscutpiotcctlvo policy of tho colony EDUCATION COMMISSION. 1 he Education Commission held a private sitting on the 27th ult, and adopted their first progress report (which haa since been presented to His Excellency the Governor), recommending that the architects' branch of tho Education department should be amal- gamated with tho Public WorkB department The Government havo agreed to give effect to this suggestion The commission ap proved of the draft of the Becond pro- gress report recommending that if, on inquiry, teacherB uccuBed of immoral conduct towards female pupils were found not to bo guilty they should not be transferred to another Behool, but if ad- judged guilty, they should ho inBtantly día miBeed Further evidence waa taken on the 1th inBt, Mr G Wilson Brown, secretary of the department, being examined in referonce to the promotion of cerlnin teachers He gave instances of tho method adopted by Mojor Smith when Minister in advancing some teachers whoBo progress waa described IIB " considerable, ' nnd mentioned other cnseB in which promotions were mado on the recommendation of tho officers of the depart ment He aUo dealt with the question of training teachers The present cost of the institute was' £7,081 per annum, and there were 40 soung men and women being trained there. But, ho added, if a pro- fessorial chair for the art of teaching was eatubhshed in connexion with the Umvorait) the ealary of the superintendent of the in stitute would meet the expenditure Persona might then bo induced to leam the art of teuchmg nt their own expenae It would be desirable to have a class of highly trained teachers trained at their own expense, from w horn uiBpectora might be chosen Mr John Main, senior inspector, and at present assis tant inspector general, gave evidence in re- ference to the duties of inspectors, and further, with regard to the method of select- ing teachers Schools with an average of IS coat ST or £8 per bead, but those with tn attcndance of 700 only coat about £3 per bead He considered that the teaching now given to the children was better than what was imparted under the old system, and that the moral tone of the state schools had im- proved THE POLICE COMMISSION The Police Commission have entered apon the general inquiry into the organisation of the force, but have decided to sit in private. They have already examined Mr H M. Chomley, chief commissioner, in reforonce to his report suggesting certain improvement! in the aystem, and evidence concerning the administration and routine of the department has also been heard from Mr Moors, chief clerk, and Mr Roberteon, accountant The bnrrncliB m Russell street and the detectiva offices have been inspected, and the com- mission intend examining officers of each grade in the force and also representatives of the petty constables SHOPS COMMISSION The Lmplot/es m Shops Commission held a meeting at Sandhurst on the 23th ult The evidence given by the tradespeople of that city was to the effect that the system of employment there was not a cause of com- plaint , on the contrary they appeared to be eatiefled that the hours bad been equitably fixed, and that they were properly observed in all the eatabliBhmenta The commission sat in Melbourne ou the 4th inste, and several metropolitan and suburban shopkeepers were examined The opinions expressed on the wisdom of passing legislation to compel the closing of shops at certain hourn differed con- siderably There was a strong view indicated that such a step would be a moat arbitrary measure and that it would be much better if the tradesmen were permitted to arrange among themselves to close their establish- ments at such hours as would benefit their employés, while their own interests were not unduly sacrificed THE FORD BOARD The board appointed to inquire into the charges preferred against Mr R G Tord, engineer of construction in the Railway department, have concluded the hearing of ovidence, and are now deliberating upon their report The investigation into the charge that Mr Tord had improperly favoured Meesre Bain and Son by giving them work without calling for tenders waa resumed. '«_e evidence of Mr R Wataon, the preaent engineer in chief, was a justification of Mr. Tord a conduct, and the latter officer also contended that he had not acted improperly in giving the work to the firm under the emergent circumstances which then existed. Charge No 5 -That he had unduly favoured Messrs Humble and Nicholson, of Geelong, byl paying high prices for their work broke down, OB there waa no proof given that Mr. 1 ord bad ordered the work other than the fact (which was considered insufficient) that he had initialled the account for payment. On the loBt day of sitting (the 27th nit ) the board inquired into various other charges, notably that of neglect on the part of Mr. li ord and his unjust treatment of Mr. Rennick, his accuser Mr l Ford's defence wes virtually a denial of each charge. TRAMWAYS CONFERENCE During the paBt month meetings of dele- gates from the City Connell and the suburban municipal bodies have been held to consider the tramway question A. bill proposed to be laid before Parliament by the Melbourne Tram» way and Omnibus Company was placed before the members, and after various defects had been pointed out by the town clerk of the city of Melbourne in an exhaustive report, the bill was remitted to a committee elected from the conference to take the whole sub- ject into consideration, and to prepare such a niea.ure as would meet with the approval of the local bodies The committee held several meetings and made numerous alterations in the clause. The principal one was that re- ferring to the purchase of the tramways at the end of a stated time. The original clause provided that the consent of the whole of the local bodies through whose territory the lines ran woula have to be ob- tained, but this was altered to allow the councils jointly, or so many of them aa thought it desirable or failing those jointly, then the City of Melbourne , and failing that council, any other local authority could, after the expiration of 21 years, require the com- pany to sell their plant, rolling stock, ka A 'tramway Board ia to be elected as follows - One representativo to be elected by the Governor in Council, two by the Melbourne City Council, the Omnibus Company one, one each by the local bodies, and the Mayor of Melbourne to be a member ex officw Soma other unimportant alterations were made, and the committee reported the bill to the conference on the 27th ult It waa then agreed that the Mayors of Melbourne and Richmond-Alderman Ham and Councillor Vi inter, Councillor M'Mahon, Fitzroy; Councillor Jennings, St Kilda , and Coun- cillor Turner, Collingwood, Bhould be a committee to watch the progress of the bill through Parliament, and to employ counsel if necessary, to protect the interests of tbe local authorities An endeavour was made to introduce a clauae to reduce the hours of labour of the employés, but it met with such strong opposition that the proposal was with- drawn A statement was made by the sec retar) of the company that concessions to the drivera were under consideration The amendments made in the bill have been punted, andaré now under the consideration of the uiuncipal bodies, who reaerve the right to make further alterations These are to be further considered by the conference on the ISth inst PRESBYTERIAN ASSEMBLY COM MISSION Tbennnualsittingsof theComraisaionof the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria began last Tuesday at the Aa eembly Hall, Collins street 1 he moderator s chair was filled by the Rev A Adam, of Benufort The Rev D Shearer, from WeBtetn Australia, who was invited to address the commission, reviewed the history of Preabytenaniam m that colony For ri0 years the church had quite neglected Western Australia, and the great body of Presbyterians who arrived after ita settlement had left their children to be brought up in other churches, or to relapse into an entire neglect of reliRioua ordinances Tivo and ft half yeaiB ago he wos sent by the Established Church of Scotland, and the Tree Church of bcotlnnd, to try und form a church at Perth, bat be was disappointed m not getting a grant of a church site, and had to pur- chase one, at a coat of £ firBt few weeks the temporary church named a Btendy increase of attendants, and had gone on prospering ever since A Sunday Behool had also been formed with the moat encouraging results lhenew church, ground, and a Sunday school hall had cost £2 200 and for that sum cheap and comfortable build- ings had been obtained The opening of the church would take place in about three weeks time He had met with great kindness on the visit to New South W ales and Victoria, and had been enabled to collect £1C0, the total sum collected towarda the extinction of the debt being £000 If the means were forthcoming, there would be work for three ministers in Western Australia, and ho hoped that before loDg they would be sent A resolution waa unanimously paBBCil ex- pressing sympathy with Mr Shearer and the hope that at no distant date the church m WeBtern Australia Bhall be incorporated m the General Assembly of Victoria The ornnnisation of the sustentation fund not having proved OB successful as had been ex peded owing to many congregations exhi- biting a want of sympathy with the move- ment measures were resolved upon to etimulate presbyteries ond bring the claims of the fund before churchea not yet connectfd with it lbe cenBua re- turns having shown that only about 00 000, or nearly one half of the Presbyterians in the colony, are under the pastoral caro o£ the church it was overtured to the General Assembly to direct the diviaion of the colony into ministerial parishes in order that ev ery Preeby terian should be within some Presby- terian parish The Victorian delegates to the intercolonial conference held in Sydney in April last reported that the proposal to federate the Presbyterian Churches of Victoria and New South Wales had been warmly received, and it was probable it would be earned out within the next 13 months Queenaland, South Australia, and perhaps tasmania might bo ready to join the movement at a later period The churches would join without in any way sacrificing their autonomy Tho general assembly would bo a representative body, Bitting alter- nately in Sydney and Melbourne, the repre- sentation to be on the basis of one third of the membera of the various preabytenes.

The losses of Btock have been v crj considerable, but less complaint is now heard of them. In somo of the high and coot distnctB, more stock is likely to be lost, but even thero such reBiilts may be averted by the occurrence of weather of au unseasonably mild type, auch as noiv prevails generally in the colony Farmers every whoro aro pushing forwnrd the work of ploughing and sowing which had got much in nrrear in consequence of the protracted drought. Draught stock on many farms had become weak through Bhortnesa of food, and tho daily recurring labour of hnulmg water from a distance to supply necessities at the homestead. Cheaper, but less efficient moana than ploughing are being extensively employed in working the land, m order to overtake the season Scarifying and rotary harrowing aro being resorted to over large areas of country, and though the soil may not be stirred us deeply as a regard for possibilities would render desirable, tho risk of failure will in moat caaes be only slightly increased, plough ing having also its special disadvantages Iho wheats sown early m the season do not appear to have suffered through lying in tho ground, the soil having been thoroughly dry. Since the rains most of the early sowings havo come away Btrongly and it ia behoved that v ery little land will require to be re sown Strenuous efforts nre being made m the droughty districts to construct worka for the conservation of water in sufficient quantity to preclude tho occurrence of Buch disasters aa those they have just passed through Should the contemplated works be equal only to supply- ing water for domestic use and for the live stock of the districts, they will greatly enhanoe the value of property, and place farming on a safe footing The vintage over the Murray has given a rather short crop of muBt, but of superior strength : the rains came too late to effect the reBult either in qunlity or quantity. The depression ia vine yard properties in that part of New South Wales noticed four or live years ago has passed away, old vineyards are being re stored, and new ones are in course of forma tion It would be more correct, porhnps, to Bay that farmerB aro again beginning to grow grapes, na they were formerly doing, for silo to the wine making establishments, of which there nre several m the district.
