The Bangalore has been 105 days on her passage from London, which has been occasioned by light winds and calms the greater part of the voyage. She brings to this port 267 emigrants, 28 of whom are assisted by Messrs. Hall Brothers, the agents; 73 policemen with their families, who have volunteered for service in this country, aud the remainder are tree emigrants. Five births and tour deaths have occurred during the pas- sage. The emigrants who are nearly all English, ap- pear to be a superior class of persons to those who generally emigrate to this country. The policemen are fine able bodied fellows, who, we have no doubt, will do us good service. There has been no sickness on board, and the emigrants are nil in a healthy state. The steamer Wonga Wonga left Port Phillip Heads at 9 p.m. on the 10th instant, and arrived here on Satur- day at 1-30, p.m. The Madras had not made her ap- pearance at Melbourne up to the time of the Wonga Wonga's leaving.-Jan. 15.

The Pacific steam vessel, launched on the 25th ult. at Millwall, and guaranteed by the constructors to attain a speed of sixteen statute miles an hour, has been tried both in the open sea and at the measured mile. She has exceeded the contract speed, and is consequently the fastest ocean steamer now afloat.-.European Times, Oct. 24. The Herculean, from Wide Bay, has had nothing but a continuation of light head winds during the whole passage. The steamer William Miskin got off the sandspit and sailed for Port Curtis the day before the Herculean left. The Rajastan has had rather a long passage of 110 days from Plymouth. She brings to this port 286 government immigrants, classed as follows :-33 mar- ried couples, 96 single women, 52 single men, and 10 children, the whole of whom, with one exception, are in good health.

The Lydia, from London, which arrived yesterday, has not spoken any vessels connected with the colonies. A boy named A. Ross, was unfortunately lost overboard on the 30th November during a heavy gale. He fell from the topsail yard, but all efforts to save him by throwing life-buoys overboard, &c.;, proved unavailing. The, Tar, from Glasgow, has had a long passage of 137 days. Jan. 13. The Helene brings out 65 German emigrants under the direction of the Emigration Society, of which, Messrs. Haege and Prell are the Sydney agents. 3 men, 3 women, and a child 16 years old, died during the pas- sage from bowel complaints. The ship is quite healthy now.
