COMMERCIAL. Aoe Office, Saturday Evening. Thero were not any export entries passed for gold at tho Customs to-day. As we anticipated in the early part of the week, j a largely-increased business has been done. Tho sugar market, especially, has boon vory exoited, and operations, on an extensive salo, havo been carried out. The Silontium, and Otto's cargoes, amounting to about 12,000 bags, changed hands privately in ono lino, and several thousand hags havo likewise boen sold amongst -the trade ;; whilo at auction, eouio 4000 bags sound, and about 1800 bags of damaged, tho balances of several other cargoes, wero disposed of. . Corn Backs havo scarcely sustained previous value. In tho absence of sales of damaged, sound candles havo been in moro request. Manilla rope is improving. Flour, though stocks nro getting into small compass, is not alterod in price, but is rather stiffcr. Now South Australian wheat has realised 6s to 6s 3d. Fooiling grains are drooping. Malt is not so firm. New hops hare boen placed on the market. Metals, oils, oilmon's stores, provisions, salt, tea, call for no special remark. Rico commands full rates. Tobaccoes have had considerable notice. Wines coutinuo in an unsatis factory position, presenting no indication of an oarly i'liproyement. . The British and foreign arrivals comprise four vessels from England, two from Mauritius, two from China, one from Java, and ono from Manilla. Ale and Stout.— Though the holders of bulk ale evince every desiro to quit storks at anything at all reasonable, to be prepared for arrivals of now, which may now ha expected within a poriod of six weeks at least, tlioy have not met with any en couragement, sales during tho week having beon limited to supplying trado wants. Bass's No. 3 has been sold at £6 5s, and for . No. 4, £7 has been obtained. Allsopp's lias been rather quiet, quota tions ruling at £5 10s. Marrian's lias not received much attention ; prices, however, are firm at £7 for 50 hhd, to £7 10a for smaller lots. Of tho Car lisle Company's, sovoral purcols have changed hands at £7 for 20 hhd lots; larger quantities having been placed at a lijniro supporting this quotation. Joule's wo believe has not not been offored undor £7 10s, the busiuess done has, however, boon trifling. Of tho Colonial Company's no sales havo been reported and our quotation of £6 must Ihereforo be con sidered nominal. Thoir light ale continues to find buyers at £G 17s Gd. Several parcels of alo sold ut auction realised only £4 5a. Little progress can bo made in tlio disposal of Scotch alos at £5 10s, purchasers not fooling inclined to invest largely at this figure. Bulk stout has during the greater part of tho soason dr:ijgod heavily, tho past- wook proving no exception. Taylor, Walker and Company's can bu bought at £6 to £6 Gs. Whit bread's is offered at £5 16s to . £G : 'All sopp's buing nominal at £5 5s to £5 10s. Bottled alohas moved off steadily at full, rutos ; Muir's and Prestonpans at 10s Gd not being allowed to remain a dav on the market unannronriated. Aitken's is equally saleable at 10s 3d. For Jeffrey's and Berwick's there aro also cagor purchasers at 103 — for a con3idorablo parcol of th'e latter sold this wook lliore was quite a Bcramblo among tho trade. Blood's and Arrol's aro pickod up readily as con signments como forward at 103. Bass's and Allsopp's avo valued at 9s 9d. Joule's sells at 9j Gd, and the Colonial Company's at 9s 3d. A decidedly better fediug exists towards bottled stout, u strong improasiou prevailing that shipments ad vised by tho mail now duo will bo light. Wo cannot, however, as yet report any riso in pricas ganorally. For Honry Whito and Co.'s, 10s to 10s 3d id not refused by buyers who will have nothing else. Edmonds's pig brand brings 10s Gd. As the quantity of Guinneis's in the market is not heavy, 0s Gd is freely enough paid. Arrol's is largely consumed nt 9s 9d. For Blood's 9s 9d is also required. Machen'a has been purchased so extensively at 9s as to induce tho importers to raise the rate to 9s 3d, below which we understand none can now be bought. Byass's has been sold on many occasions at 8s 9d, and wo hear of none offering below this figure. The Colo nial Company's single stout brings 8s Gd, and double 9s. On Hibbert'.f there is no change, 8s 3d being the figure at which it can be bonght. Bagging. — Corn sacks liavo not been in quite so much favor, and the extreme rate of 19s realised lost week lias not been obtained. Several small lots have been placed at 183 Gd, ono parcel of 20 bales having been quitted at 18s 4Jd, but oven at thoso reduced figures buyers have not gone beyond supplying present requirements. Candles. — Tho quantity of damaged offered at auction has not boon so large, and tho inquiry for sound is in consequenco improved. Brandon's have been sold at 10Jd, Halo's and Ogilvie's being valued at lOd to 10£-1. A parcel of Tery fine foreign was placed at lOd. Behnonts aro worth lO.Jd, and the Neva Stearine Company's sell at lid. Sound light woights are hold for 8d to 8£d. Damaged were disposed of, slightly at 7$d, and badly at G|d. Confectionery meets with a steady trade demand at lOJd to lid for Kielor's and Wotherspoon's. Ju jubos aro worth Is. Candied peel realises 13£d. Orange peel sold at auction for lld Cement. — We hear of no change in this market. Portland brings 15s to los Gd, and American plaster is disposed *f at 20s. Cordage. — Manilla rope continues to show an upward tendency, sales having been made at £50 for assortod 1 to 5 inch. On common tarred, Eu rope, there ia no alteration, our quotations being £10. Patent three-strand commands £55, and bolt ropo 57s Gd. Seaming twine, best quality, has boen quitted at 14Jd ; faulty lots have been disposed of at lOd to llgd. . Bengal lines are difficult to move at £12. Ciiejiicals. — Soda crystals readily bring £9 103. Caustic soda, for Muspratt's £18 10s is wanted, other brands being procurable at £18 and a shade uudor. Soda ash lias beon asked for, but at such a figure as could lead to 110 business. Carbonate is in very slow salo. Flower of sulphur remains neg lected at £18. Turned opium realises 333 to 33s Gd. Of Patna we know of none offering. Coffee. — Tho principal holders of stock show no disposition to submit to a reduction, and the result, is that only trade sales of plantation are effected at 13d ; ? there are, however, ono or two small parcels outsido of these that can be bought at a less figuro. For Java, lid to lljd is required. Chicory. — Best brands aro held firmly at 3Jd, at which sales to a fair extent aro being made. Fisn.— -Ling is maintained at 5d for best sorts. Whito herrings havo not varied lately ; half-barrels sell at 24s to 25s aud firkins at 9s, the traffic being only very moderate. Bed, in tins, command 31s per dozon. Fruits. — Currants'are far from active, 4Jd to 4Jd is the utmost Btretch of the market ; tho latter figuro has been got at auction. Cape and Eleme raisins are dull, at 7-jd. Muscatel layers are held for 8d to 8Jd. Saltanaa are without much inquiry, at 8£-1. Dried apples are firmer, and sell for G}d to 7d. Newly arrived samples of figs are being disposed of at 6Jd. Flour and Grain. — Though a scarcity of ilouris beginning, to be felt, the near approach of our own harvest; as well as' expected supplies from South Australia neutralise its effect upon prices, on which no improvement can be reported. On the contrary, an outside parcel of Hart's' has been quittod at £13 5s. Of Magarey's and White's Valley's sales havo been made at'£13 10s, and irom that to £14 for bakers' parcels, is the full figure obtainable. Moyno Mills has been sold jit £13 5b, but is now held for £13 10. For Californian, £13 is wanted, in small lots, and parcels have changed hands at a slight reduction on this price. New Adelaide wheat: has reached here by tho Aldinga, and boon largely bought up at 6s to 6s 3d. Vic torian! old is in short supply, and Ga is. freely paid for, any parcels offering. Adelaido advices to the' 4th instant state that contracts for halfa million bushels for delivery up to tho end of March, at 4s 3d at the port, have been entered into. Every description of feeding grain is at present in a' most unsatisfactory position ; dealers look (forward to much lower rates, and no inducement can be offered which 'is likely to load to moro extensive transactions. Colonial oats ore difficult, to quit at 5s to 5s 6d for best descriptions, inferior ranging t& below 4s. Danish and Scotch aro quite neglected at 4s 9d and 4b 3d. Of the former, however, we hear of 1200 bags being sent to another market. At auction, damaged Dutch oats sold at 2s Id to 2s 2d ; Colo nial do, at 2s 3d to 2s I'd. Maize is drooping at 4s 4Jd, being a top figure, and sales difficult to effect ; the price in Sydney has also fallen to 3s Gd to 3s 7d, which checks any immediate improvement here. Barley sells slowly, though offering at 4s. Bran is scarce, and readily realises Is 8d, several lots having been disposed of at that figure. Gram has been placed at £11 10s. Colonial oatmeal and pearl barley aro without change on £30. Scotch moves sluggishly at £23 to £25. Gunpowder. — Best brands of blasting aro main tained at 9d, and, though the demand is not large, holders will not accept, of less. Hops. — Now season or 'G3, have this week been placed on tho market, and for one sliipmont an average of 2s 3d per lb' has been got in small lots ; for parcels, much lower rates have been accepted ; in one instance, 50 pockets sold for Is 8d, and from that to Is lid to 2s has likowise beon realised. 'G2 range from Is 2d to Is Gd. Malt.- — Tiiis article has beon very slack, and though brewers' parcels havo boon placed at 10s, 9s 9d must be considerod a moro general qnotation. Buyers of bins do not feel disposed to invest at 9s Gd, the price asked ; 9s was accepted at auction. Metals. — Pig iron, in several instances, has beon placed nt £4 ; an offer of £4 has also been been refused by one holder— £1 5s being wanted. ,.„,1 e.nllVa nf £32 10s to £33 10s ; a shipment, all 28 gauge, is held for £35. Gospel Oak realises £35. Tho fol fowing prices wero realised for an invoice of Scotoh : — 101 cases galvanised corrugated iron, ex Krimpen van der Le!:, 6 feet x 28 gaugo, £29 10 per ton ; 7 x 28 do, £30 10s do ; G x 26 do., £28 5s do ; 7 x 26 do, £98 12s Gd to £28 15s do ; 8 x 2G do, £29 15s do ; G x 24 do, £23 do ; 7 and 8 x 24 do, £21 2s Gd do. Sheet lead comes forward moro freely, aud can bo bought at £2G 103. Zinc is inquired tor at £29 10s — £30 is wanted. Black wire i3 worth £15, and galvanised, £20. Oils. — Linseed is firmer, but no alteration in price has yet taken place ; we quote 5s 6d in drums. In kerosene there has been no movement, and prices remain stationary at 3s 4Jd to 3s 6d for Couzzens's and Downer's, and 3s 2d to 3s 3d for Oriental. Castor oil in trade lots brings 5s 6d. A parcel of about 5000 gallons changed bauds at 5s Id. Chinese has been readily quittod at 5s Gd. Colza has been sold at 5s Gd. Oilmen's Stores have had very little notice during tho week. Joyco's bottled fruits realise 12s Gd to 13s. Pickles range from Gs Gd to 9s. lib jams are not over plentiful, and bring 10a 9d to lis. Half-pints salad oil have been placed at 6s 9d. Column's mustard is valued at 7 jd, and blue at 9 Ad. Halves sardines have boon quittod at 9s ; quarters at Gs ; lobstors aro quoted at 8s. Black pepper, has realised 4Jd, and Bago sells at 34d. _ Provisions. — Butter attracts little attention, quotations of lOd being nominal. Thero havo been inquiries, which havo not as yet lod to milch busi ness. Hams and bacon aro also quiet, sales being confiuod entirely to trade purposes, at 14Jd to lljd for Sinclair's, 13d to 13id for Cooy's, 12Jd to 13d for Moffat's, 13d for Cumpboll's and lid to llAd for Yorks. Cheeso goes off in fair quantities at 12»d to 13d for best descriptions. Quicksilver meets with an ordinary domand for consumption at 2s for Spanish and Californian. Rice. — A good inquiry is experienced for this staple, and a considerable quantity, both in small aud,largo parcels, has boon disposed of. Eifty and twenty-fivo ton lots have brought £25 to £25 10s. Wo notico speculative purchases in Sydney, tho holding price thero being uniform with that iu thi3 market. Salt. — Thero is no movemont in this articlo. Coarse, remains stationary at £3 10s to £3 15s. Small lots of lino have beon sold at £5. A11 improvement will entirely depend on tho naturo of tho advicos by tho mail hourly expected. Sugar. — This market has been exceedingly active throughout the week, and largo quantities have changed hands privately at extreme l'atcs. Tho Sileutium and Otto's cargoes, amounting to 700 tons, in ono sale, besides several thousand bags, at from £37 to £38 for fiuo counters, and £39 to £41 for v allow crvstals. At auction thero were also sold tho damaged portions of tho cargoes of tho Formosa, Adriatic, Nil Desporandnin aud Amazon, all from Mauritius, consisting of about 1800 bags Mauritius sugars, at very full prices, tho conditions regarded, for net cash. There was likewise placod, on usual terms, tho residue of tho sound portion of the cargoes of tho Formosa and the Adriatic, consisting of 3778 bags Mauritius sugars, at from £42 10s to £13 15a for good white crystals, and £33 10s to £10 for counters. Our present quotations are: Brown to good rations, £.H2 to £34 ; dark to bright yellow counters, £37 10s to £40 ; finest yellow to very light couuters, £41 to 43 ; yellow crystals, £41 to £13 ; grey to first white, £14 to £49. Tea. — A moderate demand for the supply of town aud country bin'crs has been experienced ; good tojtiue medium congons, ranging from Is lid to 2s 4d, having been chiefly wanted ; orange pekoes have also been disposed of at 2s 4d. Tijwer. — Large auction sales of lumber, &c.;, have been advertisod this week, but the result of these has not reached us tlirough the usual channel. Deals continue very depressed, and except at a great sacrifice no progress can bo made in sales. Tobacco. — Heavy transactions aro roported in this market ; some 850 packages, consisting of 250 cases halves and the baliuico tens, all Northern, lim-inrr nfioT.rr.^1 lmr,/].. nt '''''a '''' 'Ujv.o satisfactory rates. 45 half-tierces Barrett's twist were also disposed of at a full figure, and some 250 quartor-tierces, it is rumored, have been placed to arrive. In none of these instances have the prices realised transpired. 206 cases Chinese sold at 2s 3d to 2s 9Jd, duty paid. Wo quoto Northern tens Is Gd to 2s Gd t Southern, 2j Gjl to 2s 9d ; halves, Northern, ? 2s 9d to 3s 3d ; aromatic, 4s to 4s 3d ; Northerli twist, 4s to 4s Gd ; and Barrett's, 5s 3d to 5s Gd. ,rSwiss cigars sell at 31s to 35s. / Wines and Spirits. — The demand for sherries and ports' continues moderate, the former selling at from £15- to £80 por butt, aud the latter ranging from £40- to-£90-per pipe, duty paid. All spirits remain depressed ; inquiries for fine brandies aro in significant. Stocks of polo have becomo much re duced, aud this description is if anything firmer. Quotations on the wholo, however, not having been tested by sales to any extent, are in a measure ?ho'minal, as few holders we opino would refuse under the circumstances to accept of a good deal lower to insure a readier sale for moderate sized parcels. Dark Martell'3 we qnote 8s Gd to 8s 9d ; pale, 93 3d ; for Hennessy's alike figure is required ; Otard's bring* 8s Gd; Reiuault's and U.V.P.7 8s 3d to 8s Gd; C. V.P.
