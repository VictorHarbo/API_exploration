I MARCHING BACKWARD!" -? TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-In connection with your excellent article under the above heading, wherein the forlorn position of affairs in the Northern Territory is clearly defined and fairly faced, may I quote the following passage from the London "Times" newspaper of the 13th ult" in the hope that some similar course may be adopted by the Federal Government? Such action, of course, must not interfere with the schemes referred to by you, but to be supplementary thereto. I am, etc., WM. FORBES. 72 Brown-street, Paddington, Dec. 26. The matter quoted from the "Times" is in the form of a message from Copenhagen, dated November 12. It reads as follows: "The Liberal newspaper, 'Politiken,' publishes an offer made by the French Government to the Danish Government to admit a large number of Danish immigrants into Madagascar. The French Government will put large areas at the disposal of the immigrants free, farmers will get land and forest engineers and other technical experts will be given positions. The Immigrants will be allowed to take with them their own priests and teachers, and to establish their own colony. Several prominent Danish doctors have promised to accompany the immigrants and help them with advice In the first years."
