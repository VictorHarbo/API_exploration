PASSING OF SAIL. FURLING THE WHITE WINGS. (By "Junius.") The following are a few more ships, the end of which has been traced:— RAMSAY: A London barque bound from Brisbane to London in 1852. She piled up on Middleton Reef with a loss of 11 lives. RATHDOWN: A 2145-ton steel ship built in 1891 by Workman Clark and Co. for Sir. R. Martin.

The later ships of this line were ?used with sluggish heels and were more often on the overdue list that not. the Red Rock was on fire at Towns- ville on 29th October, 18898, and the round hoses of other ships saved her from very extensive damage. Hers were found rotten and otherwise useless. She was lost sometime in 1906. RE?NT MURRAY; A 849-ton Glas- gow barque. She piled up on the Oyster Bank, Newcastle, on 4th April, 1869?

ROODEE: A 1050-ton iron ship built in 1864 for James Beazley. She was burnt and scuttled in Manila Bay in 1876, and lay with 12 fathoms of water over her until 1880, when an earthquake lifted the bottom of the harbour and she lay exposed. An enterprising salvage got her for 70 dollars and didl well out of £60,000 worth of cargo that was little damaged. ROSS-SHIRE: A 2257-ton steel 4- mast barque built in 1891.

None of Fernie's later ships were flyers and it generally was recognised that the graeatest need for vigilance lay in looking out astern for the ship that might run over them, rather thau ahead for anything moorable that an "omene" was likely to come in contact with. She was torpedoed in July of 1915. SCHIEHALLION : An iron barque of 600 tons built in 1869.
