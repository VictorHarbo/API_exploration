S U M M A E Y FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. The reveuue returns for the quarter ending the 31st December, which are given in full elsewhere, follow an improve- ment, not only as compared with the corresponding quarter of last year, but as compared with the first or September quarter of the current financial year. For the quarter just closed the receipts amounted to £1,474,916, or £22,870 in excess of the receipts for the De- cember quarter of 1882. The decrease of £12,875 which had to be reported in the September quarter has been made up, and for the six months ending yesterday there has been an increase of £9,995. On the transactions of the 12 months there has been a decrease of £85,833, which is to be partly accounted for by the loss of the excise duty on beer, which yielded £62,000 in 1882, but nothing in 1883. It has to be borne in mind that the financial year dates from July 1, and the returns for the past six months are alone of immediate concern. They, as already stated, show an increase over the corresponding period of 1882 of £9,995. For the September quarter the receipts amounted to £1,309,765, and for the quarter just closed to £1,474,916, or £2,784,681 for the six months. The Railway receipts for the six months were £974,446. In political affairs there has been little doing during the last fortnight. Members of Parliament, like the rest of the com- munity, are taking their holidays, and the Premier since the Intercolonial Con- vention has suffered considerably from rheumatism. The attack came on during the warm moist weather which prevailed whilst the convention was sitting in Sydney. Mr. Service is now at the seaside taking rest from his official duties. Prior to the Christmas week Mr. Deakin, the Minister of Public Works, Mr. Tucker, the Minister of Lands, and Mr. Derham, M.L.A., had a six days' trip through the North-eastern district under the guidance of Mr. P. B. Wallace, the member for Benambra. They travelled by coach and on horseback from the Gipps Land Lakes over the mountains to Omeo and thence by way of the Upper Murray to Beechworth. Banquets were given to them at Omeo, Corryong, and Yackandandah. The object of the ex- cursion was to bring under the notice of Ministers the requirements of the district in the form of railways, roads, and bridges. Both gentlemen were much impressed with all they saw, and promised that Be- nambra should not be forgotten the next time a loan was floated for railway con- struction. General politics were lightly touched on Mr. Tucker said the land question would be dealt with next session on the basis of giving security of tenure to those who took up areas which were suitable for glazing blocks. He hoped that if such a measure was passed it would be the means of bringing hundreds of selectors to join those who were already on the soil. Mr. Deakm inti- mated that the three principal features of the Government policy next session would be a Railway Bill, a Loan Bill, and an Amending Local Government Bill. A million of money was coming from London for the making of new lines, for which rolling stock had already been provided, but where those new lines would be made had yet to be determined. He was not in any way committing him- self when he expressed his belief that Benambra would not be entirely passed over. As long as the credit of the colony remained as good as it was now in the London market, money would be avail- able for railway construction, which was an excellent investment for the capital of the old world. Mr. Langridge, the Commissioner of Trade and Customs, accompanied by officers of his department, had a coasting trip on board the steamer Despatch, leaving Hobson's Bay on the 17th December, and returning on the 21st. The principal visited was Western Port, where a short stay was made to examine the Kilcunda coal mine. The Despatch afterwards went on to Cliffy Island and Wilson's Promontory, where the lighthouses were inspected. The Government have not yet ap- pointed the members of the Public Service Board, or the commissioners who will act with Mr. Speight, now on his way from England to preside over the management of the Victorian railways. They have had the names of a large number of gentlemen under consideration, but quail- fied candidates are few in number. The appointments will probably be made in the course of a week. Mr. J. B. Patterson, M.L.A., Minister of Railways in the Berry Government of 1880, is to leave for England on a visit by the next mail. He will be entertained at Castlemaine by his constituents on the 8th inst. A presentation will be made to him at the Protestant-hall, Melbourne, on the 7th., by representatives of the Orange lodges and other semi-political bodies. SOCIAL AND GENERAL. The Marquis of Normanby returned to Melbourne on the 19th ult., H.M.S.S. Nelson, by which he made the passage from Adelaide, anchored off Queenscliff in the forenoon, and waited the arrival at the pier of the heads of the military service, who comprised—Mr. Sargood, Minister of Defence , Colonel Dis- ney, Colonel Hutton, Lieutenant-colonel Brownrigg, Lieutenant-colonel Walker, Major Fellowes, Surgeon-major Fulton, Captain Ind, Captain Gordon (South Australian Per- manent Artillery) and Lord Hervey Phipps, aide-de-camp. His Excellency accompanied by the officers then proceeded to the bat- teries which were inspected, after which he started for town where he was received and saluted by 50 of the Permanent Artillery, drawn up on the platform under Lieutenant Hamilton, and was then driven to Govern- ment house. Lord Rosebery, who is paying a short visit to the colony, left Melbourne for Sydney on the 23rd ult., to attend the A.J.C. Summer Race Meeting at Randwick. He subsequently proceeded to Riverina, to visit some of the large sheep stations in that district. Returning to Melbourne on the 31st ult., he visited Sandhurst en route, and in- spected one of the principal gold mines, as well as several institutions of the city. Lord and Lady Rosebery who are guests at Govern- ment house were present at the V.R.C. New Year's Day Race Meeting. A paragraph which appeared in The Argus with respect to the arrival of a further batch of 373 convicts at New Caledonia came under the notice of the Premier and he considered the intelligence of such an important nature that he wrote a letter on the subject at once, and forwarded it to the agent-general. In the letter Mr. Service draws the attention of the agent-general to the serious evil conse- quences that will arise to these colonies if the French transportation system is persisted in, and requests him to bring the subject under the notice of the Secretary of State for the Colonies not only with reference to the protest already sent from the conference against the extension of the system but also with reference to the evils of the system as it already exists. The letters from our special correspondent Captain Armit, which we published on the 22nd. and 29th ult., contained full and im- portant particulars with regard to the recent alleged purchase of land by an Australian syndicate in the Kabadi distroct of New Guinea. lhe enrolment of men for hi new militia is procicdni uatisfnrtoril) and about thru lourths ot tin number re luired have already joined lhe dilllculty which the Minister lor Detenu has to face is the procunnt ot g ntlemen to accept ofliccrs commissions.
