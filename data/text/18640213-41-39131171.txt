Pile and Co.'s shipyard. In Keneral appearance she reflects credit upon them, and her performances during the passage would warrant the belief that she is a fast sailer. The Helena, from Hamburg, via the Cape of Good Hope, arrived at the anchorage last evening. She brings about 50 passengers and a full cargo of general merchandise. The report of the arrival of the Ass axd Maria was inadvertently omitted from Thursday's paper. The Alexandra cleared late on Friday and will sail early this morning should the tides permit.
