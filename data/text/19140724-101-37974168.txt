MIGRATION. In hie annual report on tue population and vila] statistics of Western Australia for the year ended December 31, 1913, the Gov- ernment Statistician (Mr. Malcolm A. C. Fraser) deals with migration in an interest- ing manner. Inter alia, he indicates in his introductory remarks that au "unsatisfac- tory feature of the State statistics in recent years'' was revealed by an analysis of thu nature of the figures. "For the year 1913,'' thc Government Sta- tistician rpports, "it will be seen that of U¡e total of 8,577, which the State gained by thc excess of immigrants over emigrants, un less than 7,703 were introduced under Government auspices, and consequently at som« expense to thc State, whilst thc small balance of 869 remaining is found to be made up as follows, namely, 312 British and 557 of other nationalities. Appended, is a short table showing the position with regard to previous years, which discuses the fact that, .îurine th<\- five years 1909-13, with the exci- tion of these paid for and assisted, we have only gained slightly over 1,000 per tannum Tota", gain Immigrant« Bnlanr? ot "hy introducid by migration niipi-.'.. io«.

Tbc gain by migration is 8,577 persons as compared with 6,289 "during 1912. The im- migrants introduced under Government aus- pices numbered 7,708. consisting of 2,626 adult males, 2,809 females, and 1,169 male and 1,104 female children, being an increase from the previous year of 711 persons. The birth record also show« au increase both in number and in the rate per 1,000 persons, wholst the deaths show a decrease both in the number and in the. rate per 1,000 per sons. The marriages, though greater in num her. show a slight falling off in the rate per ! 1.00Û person:.. The decrease, in tho death i rate is of a very satisfactory ««ture, being j less than for any year for the pact ll years, j "The arrivals' 37,525 (58,450) exceeded the | departures, 28,948 (52,161) hy 8,577 (6,289), ¡ the balance in favour of the Slate being com- posed of 4.236 (3,683) males and 4,341 (2,606* females. «.The figures in parentheses relate to the year 1912.) "This net gain was mainly composed of 8,468 K'..rcp«;ans, of whom 7,935 were of British birth, the remainder being chiefly made up of Austrians 25. Danish 21, Italians 133, Russians 72, Greek's 17, Swedish 38. Nor- wegian 86, Germans 92, Maltese 7. and French 21. "The total Asiatic population of tho State was increased by 95, the Chinese and Manila men losing 37 and 33 respectively. There was a fairly large influx cf Japanese, 450, 432 male6, 18 females, as against 392, 371 males, 21 females, who left the State; whilst 252 Malays arrived and 188 departed. These two latter nationalities however, are principally non- resident, being for the greater part employed on the North-West pearling fleet. "During the period under review the Gov- ernment introduced 7,708 immigrants, viz.. 2,626 adult males, 2,809 adult females, 1,169 male children, and 1.104 female children."
