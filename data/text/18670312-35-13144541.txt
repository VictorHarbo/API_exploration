G-JtT-EM-N,-I feel greatly indebted to you for the requi- sition you have this day presented to me, signed aa it ia by so mssv nameB distinguished for meritorious public service, and embracing signatures representing so much influence in every interest of the community. I regard no principio of such moment at the present lime a« the public adhesion to the important rule of yn.BE TBAVE-though I am aware that for a time, particular interests may be benefited by the adoption of high import duties. Still, the experience and wisdom of the mother country and ether enlightened nations coincide in declaring' freedom of commerce and trade, and modes of taxation not calculated to interfere with those great interests to be the surest means of personal and national wealth. Any one in the least acquainted with the extent of our mercantile' marine, and the vnluo and multitude of our intercolonial transactions, will feel most anxious for the removal of any unnecessary Cstoms. trammels on these important pur- suit«. I think it will aleo be admitted that the experience of last cession baa shown the desirability of strengthening'' the present Parliamentary Opposition, to ensure in a con- stitutional manner effective resistance to any unwarrantable action on the y art of the Administration. The proceedings of the last session and of the recess sufficiently prove how unsatisfactory, in many regards, is the conduct of a Govern- ment that feel« it may place its reliance more on the' strength of ita Parliamentary majority than on the sound tiet» of its measures and the justice ot its actions. I ftel the certainty that the next session will have for its mott important consideration the question, whether or not the principle of protection is to obtain in the future ; and also that the member to be elected should be aotive and vigorous in protesting against any interference with the great constitutional rule which demands that Parliamentary government should le conducted on the principles of free and full debate and open voting, and not by secret arrange- ment and private iiifiuence. The constituency also demands, I am assured, that in the general conduct of its member, the principles known as progietsive should have his advocacy. I feel a deep interest in the success of the policy I have indicated. It is, therefore, my duty to you to state that my health st present renders me unequal to the task of dis- charging that active part in the conduct ef an election which 1 know a candidate is expected to perform, and in failure of which the cause sought to be promoted may be weakened. The great honour you ha\o done ma requires at my hands the above explicit statement of my views and position. I now beg to thank you again for the honour yon desire to confer on me, which is one that I shall esteem a great privilege to possess. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful servant, _MARSHALL BURDEKIN. MARSHALL BURDEKIN for EA8T 8YDNEY. A MEETING of the General Committee to secure Mr. Burdekin's return for East Sydney will be held at Kearney's Colonnade Hotel, King-street East, at i o'clock, THIS AFTERNOON. By order, _JAMES OATLEY, Chairman. . AST SYDNEY ELECTORS.-Gentlemen,-It is a matter of regret to me that the carne« of Messrs. Sadler, G. B. Kelly, and the four other gentlemen advertis- ing in this morning's paper, sheuld have been placed on the Hat of my committee (a fact of which I waa ignorant until I saw it in print) without their sanction or knowledge. During my meeting at Mr. Hsurigan's on Friday night, and while there were about 250 electors present, these names were handed in by some person to the secretary, who was a stranger, and who received them in good faith. I have since been informed that it wa« done as an elec- tioneering dodge ; but my own conviction is that the party had ulterior ends in view, and that it was neither more nor less than an attempt to damage my cause in the election. To prove that the half-dozen names, influential though they may be, were not indispensable to my Buccess, I may mention that I had to that time the pledges of upwards of seven hundred of yourselves, I feel it incumbent on me to give yon this plain state- ment of facts, leaving you and the rest of my friends to deduce their own conclusions. I have the honour to bo, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, _ THOMAS PATTERSON. XJ^LF^tjTORS OF EAST SYDNEY.-Who served the üi ' citizens faithfully as an alderman aad member of Parliament ?-THURLOW.
