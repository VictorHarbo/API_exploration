HER MAJESTY’S GUNBOAT, NETLEY. Wick, North- east Ceast of Scotland, Dear Sir, 7th September, 1863. Having bad a most distressing and severe cough, which caused me many sleepless nights and restless days, I was re commended by his LORDSHIP tho EARL of CAITHNESS to try your most invaluable Balsam of Aniseed, and I can assure you, with the first dose I found immediate relief, even without having to suspend my various duties; and the first small bottle completely cured me, therefore I have the greatest confidence in fully recommending it to the million. Most re spectfully yours, W. LINZELL, H.M.G.B. NETLEY. To Mr POWELL. THIS EXTRAORDINARY COUGH MEDICINE Has been established for nearly half a century, and its large and increasing sale throughout the United Kingdom and the colonies, proves it to be not only a favorite medicine with the pubUc, but an article of necessity to those suffering from bronchial ailments. Sold by all the wholesale medicine houses in Melbourne and Sydney; and retail by all respectable chemists and storekeepers throughout Australia and Now Zealand. Prepared by THOMAS POWELL, 16 Blackfriars road, London. ASK FOE “POWELL’S BALSAM OF ANISEED." IMPORTANT CAUTION. Observe that the words “ THOMAS POWELL, Blackfriars road, London,” are engraved on the Government Stamp affixed over the top of each bottle, without which none can bo genuine; and to IMITATE WHICH IS FELONY. Its low price brings it within tho reach of all classes. Mercury is a Failure. PHYSICIANS admit this fact at last; but their materia medlca offers no efficient substitute for the discarded mineral No single root or plant comprises all the properties required to cure the malignant disorders for which mercury at one time was universally prescribed. It would bo still neces sary to resort to it as the least of two evils, if BRISTOL’S SARSAPARILLA were not in existence. This combination of vegetable extracts acts upon the liver and the blood much more favorably than calomel or blue mass, and is free from all their drawbacks. The necessity for using mineral medicines has been entirely removed by this pure and genial specific for all diseases of an ulcerons, scabious, or bilious type.

TESTIMONIAL from Mr T. D. M. MANAWAY, Wellington, New Zealand “1 have been the first here to test the efficacy of your Dip ping Powder for the core of Scab in Sheep, and I am happy to inform you that it Cured 700 Sheep of mine by one dipping, and that in the middle of winter.

It PREVENTS as well as CURES the Scab, destroys all the Ticks and other ver min, and improves the quality and increases the weight of the fleece; and its price and ease of application adapt it to the requirements of all owners of Sheep.
