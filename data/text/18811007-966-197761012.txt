OPINIONS OF THE MBLBO- CBKB PRESS :— The Argus says:—"The piece is so full of sensational incidents, and these follow each other in such rapid succession, as to excite and sustain the attention of the audience from beginning to end. Moreover, the scenery is excellent, and the rapidity with which all the changes were effected was almost phenomenal, especially on a first night. . . . The first performance must be pronounced to have been a marked success. . . . The applause of the audience during the progress of the piece was at times tumultuous." The Age says:—"The play is undoubtedly attractive to the generality of theatre-goers, being of absorbing interest throughout, replete with highly sensational and dramatic situations, altogether possessing most of the essentials to secure a long run. Elaborate care has been evinctd by the stage manager to make the performance lack nothing from a pictorial point ofview, ell the scenery being new and beautiful. . . . Every scene in the drama was received with the utmost favour." REAPPEARANCE OF MISS LENA EDWIN. Business Manager for Bland Holt, MONTAGU BROWNE.
