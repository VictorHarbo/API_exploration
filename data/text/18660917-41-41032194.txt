Miscellaneous. The KADIXA, from Newcastle, arrived in the bay yesterday morning, bringing 900 tons coaL Capt. Blanche reports:—' Left Newcastle on the evening of August 25. Experienced moderate weather to Cape Otway, which was passed on September 4 Since then had a cont bunion of heavy gales from the westward. On the 'Jth inst, in lat. 41* 40' N., and long. 140° 40' £., it blew with tremendous vio lence, and the ship wes laid-to for 14 hours under the lee clew of the maintop3ail. The foretopmast staysail blew away in the' early part of the gale. Both bobstays and martingale stays were carried aaray during the violent gales.' The Wallaroo made a quick passage hence to Newcastle, having been only seven days. The KoHlXOOtt, from Newcastle, arrived yester day after a passage of 25 days, during which she encountered very severe weather. The FBOWXDfG Beaott sailed from Newcastle for this place three days before the Kohinoor, and may consequently be hourly looked for. MISCELLANEOUS. The St. Vixcent.— During the gale on Friday night this fine ship anchored off the Semaphore Stations, but, iu consequence of the state of the ?weather, the boats from the Jetty made no start until it moderated on Saturday morning. Captain Louttit has still the same passion for experiments. Since the ship left here the double topgaUantyards have been abolished, mizen topsail treated the same way. and it is a matter for serious considera tion whether or not the main and fore will not noon be doomed. The passage from England has been very rapid— 76 days from the docks, 75 from the Downs, in from the Start, or 69 from Plymouth —the latter being precisely the same number occupied by the Sea Star in ISCi The St Vincent had been absent from the Port but six months and 25 days when she anchored at the Lightship, and duriDg that time very many opportunities have off;rc.l of testing her rate of Bailing and seaworthy qnnliti«s. Not that the Knars aloft are brought tnort into ordinary shape she presents a very fin e appearance, although perhaps there is still a little room for reduction ana, at any rue, ample scope for bit. Kiug^toQ (the chief officer) to indulge in 'getting harbour tacks on board.' The near aloft bears evidence of the heavy weather expe rienced from the Cape, the parrels of the topsail yards have at various periods been carried away, and bien temporarily repaired. The iibboom was lost in a gale on August 3rd, but a few days' work will restore the vessel to first ass condition. Captain Louttit reports leaving . le Downs on July 1st with a strong westerly wind, which obliged him to. beat down Channel tack for tack in company with the Orient hner Goolwa, but his being a more powerful vessel outsailed her. Landed the Pilot at the Start, and took final departure from off Plymouth on the ollowine day. Favourable winds then set in, aud continued till reaching 14' N^ when it veered to le southward, and remained from that quarter till the 30th July, when the line was crossed in 25* W From. 15* S. the weather was fine to the meridian of Greenwich, which was reached on August 16, in lat. :fl' S., but at thii stage of the voyage bad weather set in, and continued with little intermission for the remainder of the voyage, the sea occasionally being very heavy, breaking on board, washing away part of the bulwarks and doing other damage. After passing the Iajuwji N.K. winds prevailed to such an extent that she entered the Gulf through Backstairs Passage, laying made Kangaroo Island in 69 days from Start Point On reaching the anchorage she came to iu chaigeof Mr. Woolnough, buttheweatherremained so tempestuous daring the night that it was out of the question boarding her from the jetty, or she would have been reported on Saturday. During the voyage Captain Louttit has devoted his leasure to constructing a barometric chart, which may urnibh a most useful example to the Marine Board; every day's range of the barometer, ther mometer, wet and dry bulb force, and direction of wind with latitude and longitude, being fully recorded in such a manner as would deliaht even Lieut. Maury. In his selection of scientific instru ments from Hughes, of London, he has displayed great judgment, hygrometer, aneroid, and the most recent meteorological improvements having been included. Another matter worthy of notice is Adkiu's compass corrector, a most valuable assis tance to the navigator, especially in iron ships, where the local attraction of the magnet renders it indispensable to find the true course by the sun's shadow rather than by the magnetic poles. Last, but not least, he provided a magic lantern for the especial delectation of his passengers, win presented to him a flattering testimonial, which will be found in another column. The HuCGOUMONT, from Liverpool and Plymouth, is commanded by Captain Cosens, whose friends in the colony will remember with pleasure his previous visits to Port Adelaide in the Lady Ann and Salamanca. It is at all times gratifying to welcome back old faces, and more so when they— the owners— are known to possess the qualities requisite to the good government of an immigrant 8hip. It was unfortunate the vessel had been visited with measles, as the boarding officers were, in consequence, unable to board, although a strong gale was blowing when she anchored ; but Captain Cosens furnished to our reporter the following particulars of the voyage:— On leaving Plymouth strong westerly winds prevailed, which continued until inside Porto Santo, and through the channel between the Canary Islands. Soon after the north east trades set in. even before reaching the i 'ape de Vcnl Islauds, taking her into a position 11° N. IaL, 25' 30' W. long., and from there she was but 14 days to the line, which was crossed in 29' W. on July 15, or 36 days from Plymouth. St. Kayne was weathered without difficulty, although crossing 60 far west; but she made her southing down the coast of South America so close to the land that she was occasionally in soundings at seven fathoms water, and was actually in sight of the lighthouse. After getting clear of the coast it was Captain Cosens's intention to get well to the southward, but the winds would not permit his reaching further than 44i*. On 19th August passed the Cape of Uood Hope when 71 days out, and the run across the Southern Ocean was made in 27 days. The KaDINa (Black Diamond liner) has made capital work -of her last trip, being but six weeks fro-n Wallaroo to Newcastle and back. The Kohinook and Frowning Beautt have also arrived, consequently the Wallaroo coal heap has been so far replenished as to allay any anxiety relative to stopping the furnaces. Captain Walsh, of the St. Magnus, has so suc cessfully exerted himself on Mrs. MePherson's behalf in collecting subscriptions as to be able to leave £42 in the hands of trustee?, and he thus d-sires to acknowledge the sympathy felt for the unfortunate widow. The Coorosg arrived from Melbourne and Warrnambool at daylight on Sunday ; but Captain McLean having a knowledge of the diriiculty attending boarding in the Gulf in bad weather proceeded at once into harbour. He reports eaving Hobson's Bay on Thursday, at 4, and on the following day called at Warrnambool to take in 70 tons potatoes. Again started at 2 with a strong breeze ahead, which increased to a gale, and continued till within 30 miles of Cape Wil loughby, when it became calm, but on clearing the passage it commenced at N.W., and blew violently. The engines were slowed so as to reach the bar at daybreak, and she moored at the wharf shortly after 7.

H.M.S. corvette Challenger, 18 guns, which left Portsmouth on May 30, passed Cape Otway on Sunday, at half-past 3 p.m.. en mute for Sydney. The Challenger carries the flag of C- miuodore KochfordMaguire, and will replace H. MS. Cunifoa on the Australian station.— Argus, Sept. 11. The E. K. Batesojt.-A Syduey telegram in the Araus of Thursday, September 13, says:— 'The E. K. Bateson, for Adelaide, has returned to port, the cargo having shifted.' The Weatheu.— saxby's predictions relative to the lt;th were certainly correct: but the 15th might also have been included in the category, for to wards nLhtfall on Friday the heavens were hung round the horizon with a dark bank of clouds. 'lhe barometer commenced a steady fall from 30 :J5 and finally remained stedfast at is 40. After sun down the wind came down from W. and W.S. \V\, blowing in heavy squalls throughout the ki-:ht, onlymoderatingaftersunri.se on Saturday morning, when the mercury made a slow rise of a tenth. During greater part of Saturday it remained calm : but on the evening's flood it looked angry ;md wild. As soon us the moon set, the ga'.e increased in fuiy, causing a heavy sea to rise, and precluding any chanceof getting away from the jetty; conse quently, when the Coorong was sighted at day light, she proceeded to the harbour without being boarded outside. The intervals between the squalls were very short, and each squall seemed to outvie the other in fury. The Late Fatal Boat Accident.— The Marine Board will commence an enquiry into the circum stances of the case this morning, it having been postponed till the return of the Coorong from Melbourne.
