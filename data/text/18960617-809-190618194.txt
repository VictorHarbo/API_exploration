REPORT On Tho PROPERTY of the SOUTH MOUNT LYELL CONSOLS COMPANY NO LIABILITY By GEO. D. GIBSON, M.A.J.M.E. Gormnnston, SR. Lycll, 3rd June, 1896. J. 8. DANE. Esq., Manager, Tlio South Mt. Lyell Consols M.C. Co., Melbourne, Sir,- In accordance with instructions I have made a thorough inspection of your company's property here. It consists of Section No. 488/93m, comprising au area of fifty-five (55) acres held under lease iu the names of J. Robertsou, A. Fcwcofaki and F. A. Hiscox, situated in tho Southern portion of tho .Mount Lyell mineral field, west and ad joining portion of tho South Mount Lyell Company's property, aud within fifty (50) chains (1100 yards) of tho inniti outcrop and principal workings ou the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company's territory. The newly formed township of tuccnstown, at tlio terminus of the Mount Lyell Company' standard gauge railway, lies quo mile and a half to tho westward, and the town of Gor- munston, the chief miuiug centre, ono quarter mile to tho eastward. On careful examination I F ND THE SECTION TO BE IRA VERSED BY FOUR SEPARATE MINERAL FORMATIONS, wiucil 1 propose to describe in ucIju. NO. 1 LODE. Iu approaching yottr company's ground by the main road leading front Queenstuwn to Gormanston tncro has becu exposed in the cutting along tho nlllsiile A VERY LARGE PYRITIO FORMATION, WHICH IS CROSSED DIAGONALLY FOR A DISTANCE OF FROM EIGHTY (80) TO ONE HUNDRED (100) FEET, although its precise width is somewhat difficult to deter mine. Tho inniu matter consists of scnist mainly and quurtzita veins, impregnated to a considerable extent with iron aud some copper pyrites, but also contain several veins of solid pyrites, varying from six (o) to cighti-ru (18) Inches in thiduica), the trend of the forma tion townrds your company's property being as nearly as can be determined smith 50 deg. cuat. On tho contra side of the convex bend which the rond makes it is again piused through within a very short distance of the wes tern bouudnry of tht- section, the road cutting having un covered A BODY OF NEARLY SOLID PYKlTlC UltE FROM TWELVE 112) TO FOURTEEN (14) FEET IN WIDfIL On the iKiunduiy Hue it is also exposed iu a small opening made by the prospectors between 173 and 160 ynrds south from thoN.w. corner peg of thosectiou. FROM ITS S41U1K.E THIS LODE WILL TRAVERSE THE PROPERTY FROM NORTH-WEST TO SOUTH EAST FOR FULLY ELEVEN HUNDRED (1100) YARDS, and is tho most westerly one on the sectiou. no. 2 lode. This is a mineral formation that had been unnoticed by the prospectors, but which I observed, being attracted by it iron staiued capping, outcroppiug prominently on the hillside a little within the western boundary, aud about sixty t60) yards north of tho opening made on No. 1 lode above referred to. Its strike appear to be north hy 30 deg. to 35 deg. west, and should this treod be contfuned it Will junction with No. I somo dis tance southward. In the absence of auy trenching or opening whatever, its width cannot be correctly deter mined, but IT IS EVIDENTLY OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT. It is chiefly remarkable for the numerous veins of hematite iron traversiogtbe surface, MATE HI a Ij WHICH GENERALLY CONSISTS OF VERY FAVORABLE SOFT SCIHST CONGENIAL FOlt THE FORMATION OF ORE BODIES, WHICH WILL NO DOUBT BE FOUND AT A DEPTH BENEATH THE INFLUENCE OF THE OXIDISING AGENCIES THAT HAVE-DEPRIVED THE UPPER PORTION of its more valuable mineral con- tents. NO. 3 LODE. This formation is seen OUTCROPPING BOLDLY just above tho roadway and about, midway between the west and cast boundaries, fiom 150 to 160 yardH south of the north boundary. Its strike is parallel with No. 1, viz., north 50 west. THERE BEING A BREADTH OF EIGHT 18) TO TWELVE (12) FEET OF MINERAL- BEARING MATERIAL DETERMINABLE. AL THOUGH WHETHER THIS CONSTITUTES THE FULL WIDTH OF TilKLODE IS VERY DOUBTFUL. THE MATRIX CONSISTS of a remarkably FAVOR ABLE CLASS OF SCHIST, ACCOMPANIED WITH IRON GOSSAN and generally much iron stained, BEING ALSO WELL IMPREGNATED WITH BOTH IRON AND COPPER PYRITES, THE PROPORTION OF COPPER BEING NOTICEABLY GREATER THAN IN ANY of tho other lodes. At the foot of the hiil to the eastward the capping of the loau has also been discovered ubuut two hundred (200) feet lower, thus admitting of au udit being advantageously driven ou Its course, aud ultimately obiuining a depth of three hun dred (300) to three hundred aud fifty (350) feet below the crown of the ridge. NO. 4 LODE. This formation outcrops on the top of tho ridgo on the northern boundary of tho section, and can be readily traced upwards to that poiut from the roadway about 150 ft. below, und ruuoiug parallel with and about 25 yards distant tram No. 3. Several opening have been umdo on its course, IN EVERY INSTANCE THE SCHISTOSE MATRIX BEING VERY CONSIDER- ABLY CHARGED WITH IRON AND COPf'KR SULPHIDES, accompanied by iron gossan aud some hematite, a good deal of quartz also occurring on the sur face. ON THE SUMMIT IT HAS BEEN PROVED AS ORE BEARING ON THE SURFACE FOR A WIDTH OF OVER THIRTY (30) FEET, BUT BETWEEN TWO OUTSTANDING CRAGS OF ltOCK WHICH APPEAR TO FORM THE WALLS THE MEASURED WIDTH IS FIFTY (50) FEET. Its course corresponds with No. 1 und 5, being ubout north 50 west, aud in every case the dip of tho lodes is co the south-west. From a deep gorge to the south-west splendid facilities are afforded fur Intersecting and workiug ull the four lodes by inenns of a LOW LEVEL ADIT, in which a DEPTH OK AT LEAT SEVEN HUN- DKKD AND FIFTY (7501 FEET WOULD ULTI MATELY BE ATTAINED BELOW THE OUTCROP OF NO. 4 ON THE TOP OF THE RIDGE. THE OTHER LODES BEING PENETRATED AT DEPTHS OF x FROM FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY (450) FEET UPWARDS. Without makiug a regular survey it is impossible for me to determine the distance at which uuch lode uiight bo met with, but from observation No. 1 lode would probably be reached iu from 350 ft. to 400 ft. driving. This would be a very important and permanent work, as, SHOULD THE DEVELOPMENTS PROVE EQUAL TO EXPECTA TIONS, which I urn decidedly of opinion WILL BE THE CASE, it will constitute tho main outlet from the mine for all time, and by constructing a tramway follow ing the valley downward EASY COMMUNICATION WITH THE MOUNT LYELL COMPANY'S KAIL- WAY AND SMELTING WORKS CAN BE EFFEC TED. While this heavy work is in progress it would, however, nlso bo well that an auxiliary udil ut the lesser depth bo at the same time driven for lite purpose of proving and developing tho two more eastern lodes, i-or this purpose a very good site offers higher up in the snmo gorge, where No 3 lode could be picrcuu at a depth of 100 feet or mora below the point at which it outcrops so strongly by the side of the road. Ou tapping the lode it would be udvts- able to continue the drive along its course until well under the higher part of the ridge, and then crosscut eas terly to intersect No. 4 lode at a depth of about XX) feet. Iu the case of both adits an air shaft would, of course, be necessary, but ventilation can at ail times be provided without difficulty by means of water jets, which I havo always fouud to be very effectual. YOUR COMPANY, Sir, in u»7 opinion, POSSESSES A PROPERTY OF GREAT PROSPECTIVE VALUE AND ONE PRESENTING PRACTICALLY UN LIMITED POSSIBILITIES. It is therefore well deserv ing of careful prospecting and judicious and systematic development. As regards prospecting, some trenching and other preliminary surface work might advisably be carried out to determine more accurately tho striko and dip of tho lodes before tho heavier work above recom mended is undertaken. A regular survey of the surfaco of the block should also be made to guard against errors which might otherwise be made iu laying out tbo deeper work, I am, Sir, Yours obediently, geo. d. gibson, m.a.i.m.e. ing lyell gold and coppe r company no liability.
