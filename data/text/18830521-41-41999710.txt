LATER ENGLISH NEWS. From the letter of our Plymouth correspon dent and English tiles per John Elder and Natal to April IS we extract the following items of news :— ?Xneloux prisoners lately arrested tor having dynamite and other explosives in their possession were brought up at the Bow etreet Police Court yesterday, and their names, ages, &c;, were given as follows:— William Joseph Norman, aged 22, coack builder; Thomas Gallagher (33), physician Henry Wilson (22), clerk, and Heary Dalton, alias John O'Connor (3/), com positor. _ The# first three were charged with having in their possession an explosive sub stance with intent to commit a felony, and the fourth prisoner with being aa accomplice. After sufficient evidence for the purpose had been adduced the prisoners were remanded for a week. _As to their connection with each other and with Whitehead, it may be men tioned that a letter addressed to Wilson was found at Whitehead's Iodging3, and that upon Norman was an envelope addressed ta Gallagher. Norman also had a telegram from Fletcher asking him to call at the Charing Cross Hotel, and the shop-boy in Whitenead's employ states that a Mr. Fletcher visited his master la^st week, and had a private interview with him. At the present moment highly alarming rumours are in circulation — one to the effect that a large consignment of explosives is now in transit from Liverpool to London. Great precautions are being taken to ensure the safety of the Queen (who is at Windsor), Ministers, and public officials, as well as the political clubs in London and public buildings throughout the country. At Birmingham the principal detectives are each attended and followed by a policeman armed with a revolver. Similar charges to those made against Whitehead and the men arrested in London have been preferred at Liverpool against Patrick Flanagan and Denis Deasy, who were apprehended in connection with the discovery of infernal machines brought over from Ireland by Flanagan. It is felt, how ever, that the law on the subject is tar from satisfactory, only comparatively light penalties being attached to breaches of it, and with a view to making the punishment commensurate with the offence the Home Secretary will introduce a Bill in reference to it on Monday. In announcing his attention last evening, Sir William Harcourt said that lie should propose the suspension of the Standing Orders of the House, and the ap plication of the urgency rules, so as to expedite the passage of the measure, and in order that it might pags into law imme diately. The infernal machines brought over from Ireland by Flanagan were about sixteen inches in length, by from six to eight inches square at top and bottom, and were filled with a substance of terrible potency. In experimenting upon itDr, Brown, the offioial analyst for Liverpool, struck a small quantity, about the size of a pea, with a hammer, when an explosion followed, which for the time almost deafened all around. In another case about as much as could be placed on a halfpenny was put into a small hole in a flagstone and covered with a mass of iron weighing a hundredweight. The concussion shivered tne stone, and forced the^ iron block a distance of several yards. It is stated that the police are of opinion that an explosion had been arranged to take place in Liverpool or Manchester the night after the arrest of Flanagan, with the machines in his possession ; and there is good reason for the belief that some important arrests made in Cork are connected with the Liver pool seizure. As regards Ireland, there is some ground for hope of a better state of things in the fact that, the Parnellites have sustained serious defeats at poor-law elections throughout the country. Gentlemen who last year were expelled from their positions of Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen have this year been elected over their Parnellite opponents by large majorities. A novel form of persecution is alleged to have been adopted by Penian emissaries, that of sending packets of infected linen, obtained from smallpox and fever patients, to ladies whose husbands have made themselves obnoxious to the National party. Lady Harcourt, the wife of the Home Secretary, received a packet of material which a note stated came from the bedding of a small pox patient. A similar missive was sent to Lady Hayter, the wife of the Financial Secre tary at the War Office, and it is believed that other ladies have been treated in like manner. Some doubt is felt as to whether such a dia bolical means of revenge is really being adopted, or whether the whole affair is a hoax. Should it be a hoax it is cowardly and cruel in the extreme, for the shock caused by the receipt of such packages and announce ments are calculated to have serious effects. On Tuesday, in the House of Commons, a motion was brought forward by Sir J. Pease, cqpdemnatory oi the Treaty with China regulating the opium traffic. The Govern ment, sympathizing with the motion of the hon. gentleman, were unwilling to meet his proposal with a direct negative, and there fore 'the previous question' was moved. It ?was pointed out that there was not sufficient ground for the assumption that the people and Government of China were united in de manding from the English Government the power toprohibit the importation and sale of opium. Even if we consented to abrogate the Treaties of Tientsin and Chefoo, it was doubt ful if there was any prospect of the Chinese Government putting an end to the traffic, so that all we should do would be to seriously embarrass the finances of India without accomplishing the objects the motion had in view. The ' previous question' was carried by 126 votes to 66. The Daily Chronicle of April 13, says :— Revel, a town situated on the shores of the Gulf of Finland, has been the scene of an appalling disaster, the precise extent of which has not yet been ascertained. It appears that there is, or perhaps we should say was, a theatre there. That the house was capable of accommodating a large number of people is made clear by the fact that more than 2,000 spectators were within it, when an explosion took place that instantly pluneed the theatre in darkness and left a considerable part of the interior in ruins. In such a case it is hardly surprising that a scene of wild terror and confusion followed the crash of falling beams and Btonework. But it was not the panic alone which caused the fearful loss of life which is reported to have taken place. Many of the audience were crushed beneath masses of stone, and not a few appear to have been dashed senseless and bleeding — in some cases mortally injured— against the walls of the building. If the reports which have reached us as to the effects of this explosion are not greatly exaggerated, thb explanation given as to the cause of the catastrophe can hardly be accepted. It is supposed that an escape of gas from ' guttapercna bags' used in lighting the theatre brought about the ex plosion. Such a mode ot illuminating so large a place of entertainment as this seems to have been is a novel one, to say the least. It is to be hoped that further investigations may not lead to the discovery that this dreadful mishap was the result of malice on the part of some one with a grievance— real or imaginary— against the manager ot the theatre. It is stated that aid was promptly afforded to the sufferers, and that they were without delay conveyed to a neighbouring hospital. The assistance thus immediately afforded to those still alive within the build ing forma a striking contrast to the course pursued when a much greater disaster oc curred at a place of amusement in Vienna some time ago. The billiard tournament at Chicago has resulted in Shaefer being declared the victor. He defeated Vingaux, the French champion, by 600 to 509. It is stated that the King of the Belgians has commuted the capital sentence on the brothers Peltzer into penal servitude for life. M, Gochery, the French Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, is about to visit Liverpool, in order to study the English mail packet system. An Englishman has been arrested at Pitts burg, charged on his own confession -with being one of the murderers of Lord Leitrim ia 1878. He ia believed to be insane. The Parliamentary Oath Bill has been passed by the Spanish House of Deputies by a large majority. Henceforth the members may take the oath of allegiance to the king, or make a simple declaration. A Pesth telegram states that three persons nave been arrested for the murder of Count Majlath, but the efforts of the police tc find the actual assassin have not yet been suc -ceasful. M., Jules Simon has engaged to present 'during his life to the Soeiete des Gers de Lettres, Paris, an annual sum of 500 francs, to be bestowed by the committee on some distressed member. Mr. Jay Gould's new steam yacht Atalanta baa been launched at Philadelphia. She is to be fitted out at a cost of §250,000 for Mr. ^Gould and his family, and will start in June on a two years'trip round the world. Madame Christine Nilsson has nearly closed her American concert tour. She has given fifty-five concerts, the gross receipts of which amount to §254,753. Washington telegrams report a growing sentiment at the State Department in favour of retaliatory legislation against France. Germany, and other countries interdicting the importation of American hog products. In Protestant circles in Germany busy pre parations are going pn to render the 400tr anniversarv of Martin Luther's birthday % November '10 this year, a festival worthy ^r the great reformer. Every town and hamle will have its festival in honour of &e; Wit tenbjrgmonk. A Rightful tragedy is repouted from Brescia Lombardy. A madman under observation in the hospital managed to release himsel trom the stiait-waistcoat in which he was i confined, and before he could bt- secured killed two patients, and morUlly woualsd four others. At the New York Police C :-urt Ia3t week Mr. Sheridan appeared as complainant against Mr. Hoag, publisher of the Iriih World, on a charge* of opening Sheridan's private letters. Sheridan's counsel asked Hoag whether he was in the pay of ths British Government. Hoag denied that h-3 vras, and explained that the letters wero opened among those sent to the World. H-; asserted that he had recently discharged Sheridan, but the latter declines to recognise the discharge, asserting that he is employed by Mr. Patrick Ford. The dynamite discoveries in London and Birmkignam have caused considerable sensa tion in Paris. It is true for the moment the Anarchical party appear to be cowed by the energetic action oi the Government, but fears nevertheless prevail in many rich quarters that the Fenian example may be followed by the French revolutionists. Hence the owners of large mansions continue to stop up their cellar openings to prevent infernal machines being thrown down them. A strict watch is also kept on the Elysee Palace and other public buildings. Copenhagen papers state that the recent debates in the Socialist Congress have borne a very animated character. Hot only the ideas and plans of the Germans and Danes were discussed, but the Nihilist proclamation con cerning the Russian Emperor's coronation and the recent action of the Irish agitators formed topics of debate. By a minority a resolution was introduced expressing ap proval of the Nihilist and Fenian proceed ings, but this was negatived, after long speeches, by a large majority. It was this incident which induced some of the leaders to condemn in their banquet speeches Fenian and Nihilist atrocities, and exhort the German and Danish Socialists to pursue their objects strictly within legal limits and by Parliamentary action. Thfi notorious manufacturer of explosive machines in Philadelphia, George Holgate, has been interviewed concerning his business by a reporter on the staff of the Philadelphia Record. He remarked that;, from the descrip tion of the effect of the explosion of the in fernal machine outside the Government Office in London, it must have been caused by a power much greater and more destruc tive than dynamite. Holgate made no secret of the business in which he is engaged, and it is stated that he has probably made mere infernal machines than any other man in the United States. Quite recently he has spld four explosive machines to persons in Phila delphia. Each of these contrivances can be placed in a cigar box, and possesses an ex plosive force equal to 900 lb. of gunpowder. He has also constructed and sold two burning machines, which can be set for any number of hours, and when sprung create a flame equal to 100 gas-jets, and an intensity of; heat equal to 1,000 such gas jets. 'I know nothing,' he said to the reporter, ' of the uses to which my machines are pit. I no more ask a man when he buys one, whether he proposes to blow up a Czar or set fire to a palace, than a gunsmith asks his customers whether they are about to commit murder, or a match mer chant as! s if his purchaser is about to become an incendiary. I make the machines for those who want them. I do not believe in killing kings with bombs, nor do I think it proper to assassinate statesmen with knive3 ; but I would not have the cutlery business stopped because bad men make improper use of the dagger. If the Nihilists are in earne3t, if they possess half the courage they are cre dited with, they will be supreme in a few years. 1 do not believe that the Czar will be crowned.' It must be perfectly obvious that the machines above described can be used for no legitimate purpose, though thi3 fact does not appear to have struck Mr. George Holgate. Nor can they be compared with knives and guns, which are articles of necessitv. Lord Wolseley will go to Moscow with the Duke of Edinburgh to represent the British Army at the Czar's coronation, and Lord Clanwilliam to represent the Navy. We hear that the Egyptian heroes are not at all pleased with the bronze star which has been issued to them. The general opinion seems to be that it is an exceedingly ugly decoration, and that the blue ribbon is too suggestive. The circuit of London underground rail will soon be complete. The last bit of tunnelling to connect the Mansion House Station with Aldgate is now being finished, and then trams will be able to run from Aldgate, in White chapel, the entire circuit of London to Ham mersmith and Richmond, and back again, without change of rail. The German Government, notwithstanding the failure of the negotiations for an amicable arrangement with the Vatican, contemplates bringing in a Bill to remove laws which bear too severely upon Roman Catholics, and to leave them more unfettered in the exercise of their religious duties. Great military precautions have been taken at Odessa, where the trial of twenty-six Nihilists has just commenced. It'is reported that previous to proceeding to Moscow the Czar will undertake a journey through the provinces. The enquiry instituted by command of the Czar to examine into the accounts of the dif ferent Ministerial departments during the last ten years has led to the discovery of serious frauds. Several persons of distinction are implicated in the affair, and it is ex pected that the results will be hushed up to avoid great scandals. M. Nelidoff, the Russian representative, has delivered a new note to the Porte de manding the settlement of the claims of Russian subjects. The Minister of Marine has approved the plans for the immediate construction, at Leg horn, of a colossal war transport of the same kind as the Hecla. It will be 6,000horse power, and its velocity fifteen miles an hour. It wil be fitted up to accommodate com fortably 500 horses and eight torpedo boats, as well as the mechanism required for mount ing and dismounting cannon. This new colossal transport wilfbe armed with power ful cannon and mitrailleuse. A movement has been initiated in the metropolis for procuring a cheaper system of telephony, and it is urged that this might be conceded without seriously affecting postal telegrams. In London the United Telephone Company are not allowed a greater length of line than five miles ; but within this limited radius no less than 40,000 messages are daily transmitted. The promoters of the move ment contend that the establishment of a penny telephonic message in large towns, or one at twopence in places where from 700 to 800 subscribers could be obtained, would be perfectly practicable. What is wanted, they urge, is that the several Companies should be allowed to extend their wires to any length, paying, if so thought desirable, 10 per cent, to the Post-Office on their gross receipts, and charging this to the public. It is proposed to hold an International Forestry Exhibition at Edinburgh in 1SS4. The Exhibition is in furtherance of a move ment for the establishment of a national school of forestry. At a meeting at Edin burgh of noblemen and gentlemen it was agreed to open a guarantee fund. It is now considered very probable that Mr. Trevelyan, M.P., will be nominated by the Liberal students of Edinburgh University as Lord Rector, in succession to Lord Rose bery. A certain section desired to put up the Duke of Albany as a non-political candi date, but the opposition to this proposal was so strong that the idea has been abandoned. The probable retirement of Lord Ripon from the Viceroyalty of India is now stated to be due to domestic reasons. An application was made to Lord Penzance on October 12 by Dr. Deane, on behalf of the Church Association, for the absolute depriva tion of Mr. Mackonochie, and after con siderable argument the Dean of_ Arches decided to reserve his judgment until he had carefully looked into the authorities which had been submitted to his consideration. It is reported in Berlin that China ?will re-people the Kuldja territory by the trans port ot emigrants from Kashgar. The Wilts Friendly Society have decided to consider the advisability of offering special benefits to teetotallers over other members. The Rev. W. Acraman, Vicar of Cricb, was fined at Belper Petty Sessions Is. and costs for having assaulted his curate, the Rev. Andrew Blair, at a meeting of school managers. The Journal du Loiret affirms that the Comte de Chambord is pow under medisal treatment, symptoms of incipient disease^ of the heart having declared themselves during the past few months. Sir J. A. Macdonald, the Canadian Premier, has informed a deputation that no measures will be taken to restrict Chinese immigration into British Columbia until the Canadian and Pacific Railway is completed.

Troops are in pur suit of the marauders, and it is expected that they will speedily suppress the movement. The Lord Mayor baa opened a fund at the Mansion House for the relief of the distress caused by the terrific gale in the North Sea on March 6, when 3S2 men and boys were drowned, leaving entirely 146 widows, about 400 orphan children, and many aged parents and other relatives. An officer was secured at Inverness, aftei considerable difficulty, to serve the ejectment ?warrants on the Glendale crofters, but, as he was about to start for Skye, his orders wen countermanded, the hostile attitude of thf people having rendered it impossible t( serve the write within the time required bj the Statute without the presence of an artnec force.
