AUSTRALIAN PRODUCE IN ENGLAND. A contributor to "Country Life" (Eng Iniîd) gives Australian butter n good advertisement. Ho reviews the sy.-rein of co-operation in Australia and New .Jiealand, by xvhich all butter is manufac- tured under expert management, and ex- ported under btrict (lovcmment super- vision, and concludes by saying:-"Here, in a few -words, is the explanation of the «xcollcnce of the New Zealand and Aus- tralian butters. The experience in my household is that wo can always depend upon them. Retailers in some parts of .tile country put them in tub?, and sell '.ia Danish, pocketing the 3d. or 4d. per "lb. extra. Of course, ppoplo bave their own remedy. By asking for the Imperial butter they can effect substantial econo- mics." This prompts a statement from the "Sydney Morning Herald" that it is lonsidered in many quarters of the trade . there that the wisest thing for Australin . to do would be to concentrate her efforts on thoj export of choicest qualities and choicest alone. But surely the English- man's experience also suggests that what is really required in England is a more thorough supervision of tile distribution of Australian products, so that their iden- tity would not be loät, but avon id act as a good advertisement for Australia as the country of origin. This point was strong- ly emphasised by Mr. A. C. Elphinstone, in the_ Queensland Parliament, on ¡iib re- turn from his recent trip to tim Old Country. "The whole tiouble in England io-day," he said, "and it to a very large extent affects immigration, is that Queens- land is not getting n fair deal in ' the marketing of her products. I say that most emphatically. The whole identity of our products is lost in London." 'Die remedy suggested by Mr. Elphinstone Was that producers should lo'ok_ after their own business ,on the other side, not on political lines, but ¡>s an enter- prising business organisation.
