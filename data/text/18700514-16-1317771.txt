LAUNCH AT CLEVELAND -On Saturday, April 16, the largest vessel ever built in this colony was launched at Cleveland. She is named tho Monarch, and is intended to trhde between Moreton Bay and Ipswich Her keel was laid some time ago by Mr. A Peters, who drafted her, for Messrs R and J. Forter Those gen- tlemen, finding that they would bo unable to employ her profitably, sold her to Messrs Clarke, Hodgson, and Co, who were in want of such a vessel for their river and bay trade The contract for the completion of the vessel was undertaken by MesBrs Robinson, Barron, and White, and by them the work was success- fully hi ought to a close on the day montioned Ihe Monaroh is a flat bottomed vessel, with fine onds, calculated to carry from 350 to 400 tons of general cargo Her dimensions aro as follow -Length over all, 106 feet, beam, 26 and 8 feet depth of hold The deep load water draft will be 6 feet For the present the vessel is to be rigged as a two masted lugger, but it is in- tended to fit her up as a stern wheel steamer as soon as arrangements can be made for im- porting the machinery from England. The launch toole place at 10 o'clock, in the presonce of n number of ladies and gentlemen, the vessel being gaily decorated with flags for the occa- sion When all was ready the shore which held the vessel was knocked away, and she started immediately As she commenced to move Mrs J.P Bell broke a bottle of wino on the bow, and named her the Monarch. The launch was a remarkably effective one, as, from the shallowness of the water about Clevoland, the ways were of great length, and the vesao] glided smoothly along until BIIO took tho water, whioh she did very eiiBily The whole affair was most satisfactory and without the slightest accident or hitch After tho launch the ladies and gentlemen presont partook of a luncheon, whioh had been laid out in a tent close at hand, and the toaBts usual on suoh occasions wero drunk and responded to A RELIC OP A MASSACBED CHKW -Some few years ago a Danish sailor, named Vgesk, was employed at Newcastle, and while thero was the means of saving some lives during one of the heavy Eales that occasionally prevail at that port The Sydney public, in recognition of his gallant conduct entered into a subscription, and presented him with a gold watch worth thirty guineas His merit being also repre scnted by Captain HixBon, our superintendent of pilots «Le , to the British »oyal Humane Society, that institution awarded him a medal Vgesk subsequently carno to Sydney, and shipped on board the schooner Marion Benny, whioh was bound to tho South Sea Islands, in the tortoueshell trade Tbo fate of Captain Delany and crew of tho Marion Benny will still bo fresh in tho minds of people here, tho whole crew having been murdered by tho natives of Roubiana, one of the Solomon Islands After the lapse of several years, Cap- tain Macfarland, of the ketch Boso and Thistle, fitted out his craft for trading in the same locality On the 28th of January last he WOB in the harbor of Boubiann, proceeding with his trafilo for BIIOII, when ono of tho chiefs sent lum tho watch and medul intact By means of trade he obtained the two articles, and brought them to Sydney He has shown them to Captain Hixon, who is anxious that thoy Bhould be given up to Vgesk's friends, if any can bo found It is somewhat extraordinary that BO delicate an article as a watch should for soveral years have remained uninjured in the hands of savnges BO ignorant ns not to know ita value and use -

The Planet, from London to Brisbane, with emigrants, cast anchor in More- ton Bay on the night of the 28th April, after a passage of 93 days from pilot to pilot. The voyage was an exceedingly prosperous one ; there were no deaths or epidemic diseases, and the weather was favorable throughout. The amusement of the passengers was well provided for. The Planet Mercury appeared weekly, and its twelfth and final number was issued off Cape Byron. At intervals, entertainments styled " Planet readings," consisting of readings interspersed with songs and instrumental music, were given by a portion of the passengers. These " read- ings" were very popular, and no less than eleven were given during the passage. Three lectures were also delivered-two of them on " Queens- land," by W. Beaufort, Esq., a saloon passenger, and the third by Dr. Wigg, F. R. C. S. , the sur- geon- superintendent, on " The preservation of health in hot climates " On March 4, the Planet spoke the Nevada, of Sunderland, bound to Neringapatam, all well, and on April 14 the ship Montana, from King George's Sound to Callao,in lat. 46 23 S. and long. 136 38 E. The passage throughout was a re- markably pleasant one,, there having been less than the usual amount of bad weather. The Island of Madeira was sighted on February 2, and Palma on the 4th, and on February 19 the Line was crossed. She passed Tristan d'Acunha on March 11, and tho Crozcta on March 28, and Tasmania on April 19 The average rato of sailing throughout the passage (ex- cluding calms) was 7½ knots pel hour Tho best day's work accomplished was 278 miles in 24 hours The passengers seemed well and contented, and before leaving tho ship numer- ously-signed laudatory addiresses were presented both to the surgeon and the master The Planet adds 199 souls to our population, including 138 English, 15 Scotch, and 16 Irish Of the entire number 39 paid thoir passages in full, 84 have been assisted, by the Government paying part of the passage money, 53 are free passengers, and 23 havo been brought out by remittances from their friends in tho colony The occupations of the free and assisted are thus described - Female domestic servants, 33, farm laborers, 45, painter, 1, butcher, 1 , gardenor, 1, engineers, 1, shoemaker, 1 ; groom, 1, blacksmiths, 2 , bricklayers, 2, mason, 1, fitter, 1 ; carpentcrs, 6 , wire drawer, 1, schoolmaster, 1. The passengers comprise 26 married couples, 78 single men, 40 single women, 12 boys and 10 girls under 12, 5 male and 2 female infants, making in all 121 males, and 78 females Dr. W C Wigg is the surgeon superintendent of the passengers, and Miss Gillies matron in charge of the single girls WBEOK os THB PBKSBVEBANCE, s -From Captain Griffin, of the Sarah and June, we have been enabled to gather some further particulars respecting the wreck of the paddlo steamer Per- severance Tho steamer went to the Tweed river to load log cedar for Brisbane, and was intended to trade between this port and the Tweed She took in her cargo, and for somo days was bar bound On Thursday, the 14th April, the bar presented an apparently favorablo aspect, i and her captain (Crosby) determined to mako the attempt He accordingly got underweigh about 8 a m , it then being the top of high water On the outer break there wore long intervals of smooth water, with a heavy sea at times All went well with the steamer until she got into the outer break, when a sea struck her and stoppod the engine Before it could bo started again a second struck her, throw her hoad round to the N, and brought her broadside to the sea. In this position she was un manageable, and as the engino could not be started ahead an effort was mado to go astern, and thus take her into smoother water During this timo the vcs«el drifted to the margin of the inner break, and Captain Crosby let go first one and thon a second anchor They failed to hold her, and sho was driven by the sea on to tho beach bolow tho north head, where the vessol went ashore. Tho beach is strewn with largo boulders and the heavy surf soon beat her bottom into holes on these Had Captain Crosby been able to get the vessel further in ho could have bcacbod on pure Band where the vessel would havo takon no hurt, as she was very Btrongly and faithfully built Thi8, however, was impossible, for thoro was so wind to work the vessel uftei the engine becamo unmanogeab'o in tho heavy sea, Tho surf carried her upon the beach nearly to high water mark, and at low water a person can walk out to her dry shod.

At the outset many of the children suffered from colds and bronohitis, but as the vossol got into warmer latitudes these complaints disappeared, nnd with thoexception of tho'dis orders incidental toa long sea voyage there was no largo amount of sickness. Tho only death was that of William M'Grcgor, a married man, who died on January 26, of consumption. Two of the crow lost thoirlives while attending to thoirduties. One occurred shortly aftor tho VOBSCI left the Chnnuel. A seaman, while stowing the jib, got knocked overboard by tho jib-Bheet, and WBB drowned, and another seaman lost his balanco while drawing wator and fell over- board. Tn both instancoB it unfortunatoly happened that no assistance eould be rendered thom without ondangering tho ship, as she was scudding before a brisk palo at tho rato of 12 or 13 knots per hour. On soveral occasions during tho passage the condensing engine got out of order by tho refrigerating tubes leaking and allowing an admixture of salt wator in the re- ceiving tank. From this causo largo quantities of water and fuel wero necessarily wastod, and latterly it was deomed oxpedient to place the passengers on short allowance for a short timo. As this occurred in cool latitudos vory littlo real inconvcnicnco was experienced as would have beon tho caso had tho water run short within tho tropics. After rounding Tas- mania the ship fell in with head winds, and it wos found nccossary to put into Sydnoy, wero ample supplies woro obtained.
