ARRIVAL OF THE S.S. NORTHUMBER. LAND. The well known and favourite passenger steamship Northumberland arrived in Hobson's Bay early yesterday morning, after having made another splendid passage of 50 days, and thus maintained her character as one of the best vessels which ever came to this port from England. The exact time of the passage from Plymouth was 60 days and 10 hours, or only two hours more than her last trip here, which was the quickest, she has made. Her commander, Captain SKInner, appears now to be so well aware of her capabilities and of the best mode of handling her, that he predicts the time to a day in which he will sight land and require a berth at the railway pier. On the last trip in a private letter, he did so, and on this occasion he sent [word on that he was to be looked for on the 14th Hay, and would require a berth at the pier on the 15th, both of which predictions came literally true, and the vessel anchored in Hobson's say exactly six months from the date of her lost arrival in the same place. The regularity with which the ship has made her trips, and the good accommodation afforded on board her, have rendered her so great a favourite that she has been patronised on this occasion by a larger number of first-class passengers than almost any vessel has obtained of late years. She brings 100 first-class passengers, and lot to the second son third cabins, and all of them speak in the best possible terms of Captain SKInner and his officers, whose conduct, combined with generally fine weather, have made the voyage really a pleasure trip. There are many returned colonists of Victoria as well as of the other colonies In her on this trip, amongst them being Lady Smith and family, Mr. and Mrs Richard Jack and family, Mr. and Mrs. Peppin and family, and Mr. and Mrs. Charles Parbury. Mr. Talbot, the tragedian, and Mrs. Talbot have also come by her. Besides having so large a passenger list, the Northumberland brings a heavy cargo of merchandise, and was so fully occupied that every available inch of space was closely Oiled up. She was telegraphed being off Cape Otway on Sunday evening at half-past 6 o'clock, and as usual on receipt of the news one of Messrs. Deane and Co.'s steamers was chartered by the agents to go down the bar to meet her. Mr. A. R. Rose, senior Immigration officer, and Dr. M'Lean, health officer, went off in the steamer to door the Northumberland as she came up, and so allow her to get at once to Sandridge railway pier and land such other passengers as chose to go j shore immediately on arrival. She was met by the Hercules about eight miles down the bay at 5 o'clock yesterday morning, having steamed slowly all the way tip Uro bay, and was cleared and oil ready for discharging passengers when the anchor was cost along side the Sandridge railway pier soon after 7 o'clock. Just before arrival here the passengers, to show their appreciation of Captain Shinner, presented him with an address, in which they placed on record the high opinion they had formed of him During the voyage, stating that they had found him at all times most watchful and anxious, and well qualified to manage the fine vessel under his command. They also stated that they had found him kind and attentive to all passengers alike, and that he had been eminently successful In making the trip enjoyable Captain Shinner reports as follows respecting the voyage The Northumberland left London on the 22nd March, and Plymouth on the 24th March, at 8 p.m., with fine weather, which prevailed, generally speaking, throughout the passage. The equator was crossed, on the 7th April in 25deg. W. The S.E. trades were moderate, and the Cape of Good Hope was rounded on the 22nd April In 42deg. S. The casting was run down between 48deg. and 44deg. S , with moderate S.W. winds varied occasionally by fresh a W. gales. The health of Ã¼iopoBscngers was remarkably good, no sickness of any consequence occurring, and neither deaths or births. The longest run made on any day was 305 miles, and the running generally was very even, between 200 and 300 miles being made on all the days excepting the ODO Just mentioned. The vessel was 85 days under steam, and the whole distance travelled over was 12,087 miles, or one mile lots than the last trip. Dr. Warren is the surgeon of the vessel, and all the other officers are the same as on the last voyage, with the exception of the chief engineer. The latter gentleman is Mr. Bruce, who was formerly second engineer, and has now succeeded Mr. Johnston, formerly the chief! engineer. The Northumberland will discharge her cargo at the Sandridge railway pier as quickly as possible, her date of sailing for London being advertised as the 10th of next month li.
