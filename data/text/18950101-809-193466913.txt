Who hasn't hoard of the good old Deacon In America, and his idea of how a chaiso should be built so as to run for ever without repairs? i dare say we all have, yst ho hasn't quite gone stale yet. He said, you remember, that the reason chaises broke down ond didn't wear out was that there was always a weakest spot somewhere about thum. Now, said the Deacon, the way to fix it is to make that spot ao strong as tho rest. Then the vehlele might wear out, bur- couldn't break down. He built a chaise on that prin ciple; it never broke down; It ran a hundred years exactly, and then ono day it weat to pieces all at onco; all at onco nnd nothing first, just as hubbies do when they burst. Its time was come ; for, as the man says who onco told the story in rhyme, "Little of all we value here, Wakes on the mom of its hundredth year, Without both feeling and looking queer." Yes, and long before that time moat of us begin tolook and feelqucer. And it's all on account of that weak spot, too. If it wasn't for that we should ho liko tho Doacou't chaise— we should run till we wear out. Aa it is we break down on tho road, often beyond repair. But not always. Otherwiso a certain man could never havo used these words: " i feel as smart to-day as i did thirty years ago." His story, in bjs own words, runs this way "From my youth i wa never properly well. i had a bad tasto in the mouth and pain after eating. Often i couldn't touch food when it was set before mo, i felt a gnawing at the stomach ond a tightness at the chest and sides. Sometimes my bowels were so swollen i had to loose my clothes. 1 had violent pains in my head for days together. This continued for years and years. About thirty years ago i began to have rheumatic pains all |ovor me, especially in tho back and legs. i gotaobad i couldn't walk without a stick, and on my way to and from my work 1 had to sit down and rest "i got no proper sleep at night owing to the pain. Day nor night, 1 never know what it was to bo freo from pain. As time went by i became quite crippled. Doctor after doctor game roe medicines ond rubbing bottles, but nono of the things i tried did any good. Tho doctors said my ailment was rheumatism and lumbago, and made light of it, but it was serious enough to me. For thirty years 1 Buffered dreadfully. My wife usod to rub me before tho fire night after night and apply flannels, relieving uie only for tho time. 1 gavo up all hope of ever being wellngaiu, when in November, 1887, i read of tho good Mother Boigel's Syrup had done in so many cases. i began to use it, and after taking a few bottles all my aches and pains scorns to havo driven all tho poisonvontof my system, and i feel as smart to-day as i did thirty years ago, for which i thank God and Selgol's Syrup. Had i used it sooner i should have been' saved years of ettfferiug. (Signed) William Btoddaiit, Douglas, near Cork, Ireland, 7th January, 1892. Mr. Stoddart Is gnrdeuer at Mrs. Edwards's, the Island, Rochcatown, and has a shop at Douglas. He is a very respectable man, and has beon in servleo at Mrs, Edwards's twenty years. ' In his letter he further states that from boyhood he was a victim to indigestion and dyspepsia. This fact explains the rheumatism, as it was tho cause of It. The bile acids from the torpid stomach and liver tilled the blood, lodged in tho joints and muscles, and gave rise to all tho consequences he describes. Tho effect of the Syrup was to expel the acids from the body, and set the digestive machinery healthily at work, tor the first time in this man's life. tliis woe tho way tho human vehicle broke down in Mr. Stoddart's case, but fortunately for him he came across nomothing that bad power to repair it.
