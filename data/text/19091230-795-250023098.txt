Victoria and Denmark. Victoria has much land; and few people. You will understand this, if you will follow some comparisons we will make with other countries. Victoria has 56,245,700 acres. Belgium has 7,277,000 acres. Denmark has 9,500,160 acres. Victoria (87,884 square miles) is nearly as large as England, Wales, and Scotland (88,266 square miles). Denmark has a .population of 2,449,540 persons, or about twice the population of Victoria., 1,231,733. Victoria has 14 persons to the square mile, U.S. America 22, England and Wales 586, Scotland 157, Ireland 135, Belgium 589, Holland 406, Italy 293, Germany 290, France 191, Denmark 165, Isle of Man and Channel Isles 519, Switzerland 214. To realise the great possibilities of Victoria, if the people could get the land, and cultivate it, particular reference may be made to Denmark. Denmark has 94S,997 persons engaged in agriculture. Victoria has only 126,840 persons so engaged, of whom 95,920 ax*e engaged in agriculture, and 30,920 in pastoral and dairying. You can judge of the social condition of the Danes by the testimony of the Norwegian poet Bjornson, that the Danish agriculturalists are the best enlightened peasantry in the world. The Danes, with climate uncertain, obliged to shut out the sea with dykes as the Dutch have done, with a soil of shifting quicksands, liable to be blown away, with in Jutland a sandy soil, cultivate four-fifths or SO per cent, of the whole area of Denmark. Victoria cultivate about onefourteenth of "the area of the State. Our children are losing the sciences that should become our country. Denmark maintains her population, and increases it. Victoria does not maintain her population, but loses it. Denmark attracts immigrants from the surrounding countries. The Denmark of to-day started in the early sixties, after two disastrous wars |in which she lost her principal provinces. Victoria started fresh and unburdened in the early fifties. Let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. The land of Denmark is amongst the most troublesome to cultivate, and with the greatest natural difficulties to contend with. The land of Victoria is amongst the richest in the world, the climate unequalled. Denmark has to import coal, and has no minerals whatever. Victoria has coal at her door, and mineral wealth enormous. Of the gold raised in Australasia from 1851 to 1905, out of 138 million ozs., no less than 68 have been raised in Victoria. Victoria has State Forests and Timber Reserves to the extent of 4,658,821 acres, or equal to half of all the land in Denmark, whereas Denmark has only 500,090 acres of Forests. But Denmark produces £300,000 a year from her forests, which is more than double the value of the forest products of Victoria (£142,905, not including firewood).
