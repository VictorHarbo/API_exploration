Mloscow Allegations1 Denie by Mr. Calwefl CANBERRA, Oct. 25.-The Minister-for Immi gration (Mr. Calwell) to-day denied Moscow Radio allegations that displaced person refugees had been sent by force from Denmark to Australia. He said the story was a concoction. Denmark, being a small country, had been under pressure from Russia to re patriate the displaced per sons who had sought refuge there. Denmark reported the matter to the International Befugee Organisatlon, which asked Australia to take the refugees to help Denmark?, and Australia agreed. Moscow radio, quoting a Tass Newsagency dispatch from Copenhagen, alleging that dis placed persons were being sent from Denmark to Australia by force, said that recently Danish authorities, together with re presentatives of the so-called International Refugee Organ isation, sent to Australia a group of citizens of the Soviet nion and the new democ acies, who had been living in enmark as refugees. Some of those who had been recruited did not turn up at the place of embarkation, and efforts to find them were unsuccessful. Tass added that this once again confirmed the fact that displaced persons were being sent to Australia, not voluntarily, but by force. The Tass dispatch added that while various shady indi viduals had access to refugee camps, Soviet representatives were forbidden to visit Rus sians in..the camps, especially while the so- called Australian Emigration Commission was at work. It quoted the Danish news paper, "Loebenhavn," as hay Ing said, "Certain refugees were brought before the Aus tralian Emigration Commission with the assistance of camp police-that is to say by com pulsion. Refugees who failed to appear before the Commis sion were threatened with transference to a punishment camp."
