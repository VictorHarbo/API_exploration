[?] STENSBY COMING BACK Mishap to Propeller Shaft The Danish motor ship Stensby (3593 tons), which left on Saturday for the Pacific Coast, is returning to Svdney owing to a mishap to her propeller shaft. Comyn, Smith, and Co., LtdT", agents for the vessel, received a wireless message from Capt. Lund stating that she was coming back under her own puwer. She passed Port Ste phens at 5 p.m. yesterday. The agents stated that the Stensby should reach Sydney at 7 a.m. to day. She will go alongside Mort's Dock, and on Wednesday will be docked. It is expected that she will leave Sydney within several days. "We have.no reason to believe that there is anything serious the matter with the Stensby," said the agents. "She has not asked for assistance."

The tonnage of vessels driven by motors has increased since June, 1928, by 1,196.000 tons. Turbine- driven ships have increased by' 1ST, 000 tons, while ships driven by reciprocating engines have decreased by 135,000 tons.

King, from Scotland. He will marry shortly and make his - home in Australia. Mr. G. C. Melson, Queensland far mer, after a holiday in England. Two lads arrived in the care of the purser, Mr. T. Hesketh. They had a most enjoyable voyage, and are olf the type that should make good In Australia. One was R. G. Scott, an orphan bound to his uncle in -Rock hampton. and the other, Alexander Raine. who was met by his sister yesterday. They are aged 13. The Welfare Officer, Mr. Edward Ham, also had : in his care several young lads travelling without rela tives, including William M IntosH, aged 14, Edmund Perry, and Cyril Mally, aged 14. He said that the voy age had been a happy one. The liner brought 180 immigrants to Australia, including 24 Little Bro thers, 12 of whom were for Sydney. By the Laperouse:— Mr. Theodore Ptachnik," who has spent the past five years in travel. He said that he was appointed Con sul for Russia in Buenos Aires in 1913, arid that actually he is still Consul there, because the Argentine refuses to recognise the Soviet. Th.ia big drawback with his position, how- ever. is that he has received no pay since the Soviet came into power. He said he found that he could not continue on at Buenos Aires, so great were the calls on his pocket as Con sul. He despairs of ever visiting Russia, his native country, and he re gards Buenos Aires as his home. The 'manager of Messageries Mar itimes (Mr. Chandeze), after a holi day tour of the South Sea.
