MEDICAL. T WING , AlADE EASY. ?LJ, Títere is a tendency in many depart- ments of life towards greater simplicity. Xn« aim of tile most enlightened civilisation is really to make life less complex, less strenucus, and less unsatisfactory. Beecham's Pill.3 are thoroughly medern in this respect, for their unfailing effect is to cure those disorders of the Stomach, Liver, and Bowels which so greatly in- crease tim measure of our troubles anti difficulties. Existence, which under the evil spell of ill-health may appear lard and gloomy, will become bright and pleasant BY TAKING Beecliam's Pills. However much human ingenuity may do to make life less of a struggle the man -»-ho is suffering from any derangement of the digestive organs will always find living a heavier bui-dan than ho would otherwise do. To him life will always be more of a painful duty "an a delight. It is, indeed, a mystery why lie should continue to Allow dyspepsia, biliousness, disordered liver, sluggish kidneys, and the accompanying loss of nerve-power 'to overshadow lis happiness, when a certain remedy for all his troubles is to be found in \- BBEOIIAM'S PILLS.
