Mason, S children and servant, who arc from tbe wreck of the Trincc of Wales ; likewise 5 horses, which swam ashore at Camden Haven. Her cargo from Manning Kivcr consists of 1117 bags maize, 24 bags bacon, 76 coses eggs, 17 coops poultry, 24 pigs, and sundries. Tbe Urara (s.) left Grafton at daylight on the 22nd, and crossed the bar at 11 a.m, ; passed the steamer Yarra Yarra, with the Premier in tow, twelve miles south of the Clarcnco, some day ; 9 a.m., on the 23rd, passed Port Stephens; 11a.m., passed the Gralton leaving Newcastle; arrived at tbe Company's wharf, Sydney, at 5 p.m., some day.

She is last from Norfolk Island, ana has made the passage from thence in eight days, against south-west winds, until making Cape Uawke, on the 22nd. Captain M'Farland bas politely furnished us with the following items of Intelligence. The schooner Cheetah, Captain Sus tenance, Emma, Captain Carmichael, and Mary, Captain Trood, at Tonga, on the 1st instant ; all welL On the 13th instant, sighted a schooner off Norfolk Island, with flag half-mast, and union down. Boarded her, end found she was the Lola Montez, Captain Lusher, of Bydney, with only the captain and cook 011 board. The mate end two men had gone on shore tbe day before in the boat, for a spar for the jibboom, which wae sprung, and had not re turned. Captain L. requested Captain M'Farland to communicate vith the shore, as he feared the boat was stove, and if so, to bring off his crew. Went ashore myself, and left orders with my mate to keep by him till my return ; on pulling in to tbc landing I met tho schooner's boat going oft'; the surf had been very high, which had detained the boat. On dote I found Captain Crarkncll aad two men of the schuuuer Britain's Queen, which vessel had been run away with by the mate, and I gave them a passage on to Sydney. Captain Cracknel) and his boat's crew nad been landed at Norfolk Island by tbc wbaicship Mermaid, and his vessel had been run away with while on board the Marion whaler, off Wreck Reef. The John Williams, mission barque, had arrived at the Island a fortnight before, from Sydney, and Boiled again for the Islands. ArciurjiT to ins CiNcnwCTTA.— The following particulars in reference to the accident occurring to Mr. Conn's ship the Ciucin nrtta have been received :— Two days after the Cincinnetta left Newcastle, c be fell in with a very heavy gale, which continued without intermission for the space of three days, raging with great fun* all that time. Her bulwarks were etovc in, the boats were washed overboard, and subsequently the vessel sprung a leak. The men then betook thcmsclvcB to the pumps, and by working incessantly, night and day, managed to keep the vessel afloat until she reached the heads at Otaeo. There the pilot went on board, and she was afterwords taken in tow, with the new of taking her up the harbour ; but before she had proceeded far she grounded on the bar. She remained there all night, and on the following morning she was found to have six feot of water la her hold. Blic was then got off, but subsequently went ashore on some beach in tho neighbourhood of the bar. She was still there at the lime Mr. Conn's letter is dated, waiting to be unloaded. Tbc amount of injury she haB sustained is Bot known, nor can it be until she is unloaded. The Cincinnctta left Newcastle about a month ago. The Carlotta is originally from New York to Otago, at which port she discharged the greater part of her cargo. There 1b no report by tbe Yarra, from Warrnambool. TriE Victouia (s).— A letter received by the late mail from Hongkong states that the steamer Victoria had been eold at that port for 30,000 dollars. The Eorata, barque, bas been sold by Messrs. MoUeon and Black to Mr. Humphry far the sum of £9500, VANDEHDECKlN'S LOG: No. J.-OPENING TEtP OF THE AUSTRALIAN YACHT SQUADRON. Emulating the example or my namesake, of fiell'i Life in I/m dim, 1 pioposc, Mr. Editor, with your kind assistinoe, to furnish tbe public, from lime to time, with a few notes on yachting matters. 1 am the more induced to do so, that I well know, from pan experience, your great readiness at all times to assist, by every means in your power, the advancement and encourage ment of all our manly and healthful fiports, and I am sure, Sir, you will agree with mo in placing yachting in tbc fore front of tbc list, conducing, as it undoubtedly does, to vigour of constitution and decision and energy or character. Yachting of late years haB been making rapid strides in the ' old cnunlty,' and a claFS of vessels bus been recently launched v, hicu is as war perfection as con be imagined ; whilst the com bined yacht clubB of Great Britain give employment to upwards or 10,000 seamen, acknowledged on all hands to be the finest and smartest body or men in the world. It is, therefore, n pleasing and satisfactory sign or the times that this, our colony, bos taken up the matter in right csrncst The Australian Yacht Squadron, which has just started so satisfactorily, already numbers over sixty members, and many others arc about to follow so laudable an example, and 1 look forward at no very distant day to wtincsB and chronicle the doings of such a squadron as shall do honour to this noble harbour, and be fitting tho position of the city of Sydney, undoubtedly the Queen or the South. On Saturday last, the 18th uiBtant, tbc Australian Yacht Squadron resolved to commemorate their inauguration by an opening trip, due notice of which was forwarded to the members Tbc morning was stormy and lowering, with driving showers of rain; but a wet jacket Wo6 a thing to laugh to Boom, and at the appointed hour the Vicc- Commodorc, with broad pennant flying on board the Era, took up position abreast of Farm Core, tho appointed rendezvous. One by one the rest of the Bquadron dropped anchor in line to the eastward, waiting the arrival of the Commo dore. It soon transpired that the Chance would bo unable to make her number, owing to an accident the previous dar, having carried away her jib- boom, end with It some of tho iron-work, thereby preventing her being ready in time for tho start. The command, therefore, devolved on Vico-Commodore Milsom, end at the appointed hour (noon) the signal ' weigh anchor' was made from tbe Era. In rapid succession, and in tho following older, the veraels of the aqundron stood up the harbour towards Goat Island. 1\. Ere— Vice-Commodore, J. Milsom, 2\. Perl— Treasurer, IL C. Dangar. 3\. Mischief, McBsrs. M'Lean and Roxburgh. 4\. Why-not, Charles Parbury. 5\. Ida, J. Josephson, C. Scud, 6. C Hurt, 7\. Old Tom, B. S. Rusecll. 8\. Gitona, E. 1'. Jackson. Tho Btart was a good one; wind, steady from S. B.W., and some considerable manoeuvring was rendered ncoessary to keep each yacht in her appointed place. Off Goat Island Era tacked to eastward, and as she came to the wind, elicited universal op miration by her clipper and yacht-like appearance — hor EngliBh made canvoe (by Lopthorn) Betting like a ' board,' and white as the driven snow. Quick as lightning the Peri (beautifully can vassed by Craig of this city, and a native of the colony), spun round like a top, proving herself worthy or breaking a lance with bcr gallant leader, and although well held in hand she was like a racer champing the bit, and eager for the Tray ; MiBcWof, Scud, Why-not, and the remainder of the fleet tacking in succession. OffMUsom's Point Era hauled her foresail sheet to windward, Peri, and tho rest coming up in line ; at this point some smart (oamanshlp was displayed, whilst tbe little mettlesome Gitana, champion of the light weights, fairly bolted from her line, her crew unable any longer to hold her in. Proceeding abreast in this order to Bradlcy'B Head, signal was made to ' fall into line ' in rear of Vice- Cumniodorc, whilst tho Rendezvous flag. No. ? , underneath, showed Manly Beach to be tho spot decided upon as the anchorage. The line from this point of view was beautifully kept, the crews of each vessel vieing with each other in their endeavours to keep and maintain their assigned position. Pass ing the Light Bfaip, a rresh signal from Era proved that a change of programme had taken place-' Watson's Bay' being signalled as the rendezvous— a mOBt judicious arrangement, for with the wind at S., tnd railing light, too much time would otherwise hove been taken up in getting to an anchorage, whilst most un mistakable signs of a desire to 'splice the main brace' were evident throughout the fleet. As tbe Era luffed to the wind, sharply followed in her wako by Peri— the rest close upon her heels like a pack of well-trained fox- boundB, a table-cloth might have covered them, and the coup d* ail was perfect. ' Anchor,' was now the order of the day, as one by one they fell into line, BaskctB and hampers were unpacked whilst you might have said knife. For my own part, having the good rortune to rorm part of the ship's company of the Pen, and well knowing from past experience the profuse hospitality of her worthy owner, I was prepared, in a mcoBare, for the encounter. Decks were not clcaied on this occasion for action, but were loaded, literally loaded, for tbc engagement, which opened with a sharp fusiladc of champagne, whilst our gallant captain ' in 2-roj-rta persona ' led on the onslaught to Turkey a la Dcttman — goose, fowl, ham, £c, &-c. too numerous to particularise, the proceedings enlivened the meanwhile by some choice solo singing by the ' trst lieutenant,' with chorus obligato ! Nor were the vest of tbc squadron behind hand in the fray judging by the Eounds of revelry proceeding from the Era, where no doubt the health of the owner and success to tbe squadron, with three times three, were most enthusiastically responded to. At this happy juncture Chance made her number round Bradley's, with commodore's pennant fluttering in the breeze, and took up her place to westward of Era, ready to tako the lead on the return. At 3.30 'up anchor' from commodore set the fleet once more in motion, and a very pretty line, stretching from Watson's Bay to Bradley's Bead, was formed. Abreast or Form Cove Chance took in gaff topsail and hove to, to allow the Equadron to pass to leeward in order to respond in proper style to his signal ' Prepare to salute Commodore,' which was smartly performed by each vessel in cuccession. ' Part company,' the last signal from tbc Commodore (for the shades of evening were fast approaching) produced three hearty cheers for 'the Com modore,' followed by one cheer more for ?' the Vice,' and each vessel shaped her homeward course, thus bringing to a close one of the pleasantcst days it haB fallen to my happy lot to have enjoyed. In conclusion, I am informed on good authority that these gatherings arc to take place periodically, with the view to the imcicncy of the fleet and tnc social enjoyment of the members of the club. At this next meeting I can truly say, Mr. Editor, may I be there to fee.

We learn that the Thomas Brown, sbip, from and belonging to this port, Captain William Brown, whilst on her voyage from Adelaide to the Cape of Good Hope, with a cargo of wheat, flour, and bran, encountered in August two hurricanes when off the Agullas Bank, During the continuance of these terrific storms one man was washed overboard and lost. The man was not from tbis port, but hiB name has not reached us. Three other hands were also washed overboard, one of whom was a son of Mr. Browne, City Surveyor, but these three were most providentially saved by being again placed on deck by the back draught. The ship bore up for Port Louis, where she arrived about the 15th August, having saved all masts and spars.

Tbc Queen of the Seas, it is also re ported, was making fearful weather, had lost her bulwarks, and appeared very much distressed, and if the vessclB lost sight of by the Thomas Brown during the hurricanes have not made Port Louis, fears ere entertained that they must be lost, but it is just possible that they might have reached some other port in surety.— Uuhatt ybtra Mercury, October 8.

Thomas Vcrnon und Sons, of Liverpool ; constructed on the most approved principles, is 215 feet in lergth over all, 55 feet broad, of 1214tons register, and is capable of carrying about 2000 tons. The cabin accommodation for passengers is admirably fitted up and arranged ; there is an absence of any trumpery ornamenta tion, and the only decorations are of highly polished English oak and bird'e-cye maple. The caWn win accouuuuiltttc tircnty-four pcr6onB, and the arrangements made for tbe comfort of tbc passengers are such as can only be found in ships of the very highest class. The 'tween decks are exceedingly lofty, and theugh we understand it is not contemplated to fit them up with cabinB for intermediate pas sengers on the present voyage, they arc capable of being so fitted as to carry 500 troops in the greatest comfort. Tbc ship's rig ap pears Eomcwhat light, hut tbis arises from the faet that the main, mizen, and fore masts are comnosed of iron, the top and top gallant masts being or wood ; the main, mizen, and fore yards are ulso of iron. A peculiar feature in the ship is that she carries double topsail yards, one of which is fitted with Cunningham's patent ; by this means a great saving is likely to be effected In tbe wear cf canvas ; some improvements have also been introduced with a view to carry off tbe sweating which always takes place in the lower decks of a ship when loaded, and often inflicts the most serious injury upon the cargo. The completion of this most beautiful specimen of naval architecture was celebrated in the London Docks, by a dejeuner on board, to which about 300 perBonE sat down.— English paper, DESTnrcnoN of the Gbeat Steamship Iiwtan Ehpiek bt Fiee,— On the 24th of July the whole of the metropolis was illu minated by the buring of the fine steamship Indian Empire, the property of Messrs. Pearson, of Nicholas-lane, City, and Hull, classed. Al at Lloyd's, 200 feet long. For some time past the vessel had been undergoing repairs in tbc shipyard of Messrs. Linglcr, of the Lower Dockyard, or water-gate wharf, at Dept ford, and only on the previous day she was taken into the middle of the river, and moored opposite Messrs. Marc's. About mid night some of the Thames police officers, whilst rowing their galley along the Thames, overheard one of the men left in charge of the ship tell some one to be sure and coll him at five o'clock in the morning. The officers then rowed along the stream, but before they had reached Limchouse they saw unmistakeablc signs of the outbreak ; and on rowing back again they found that the lamp.room, which was situated on the deck, was on fire. Every attempt was at once made to extinguish the flames but not the least impression could be made upon them. Thou sands of ions weight of water were thrown by the engines into the burning vessel, in spite of which the fire continued to spread until it had destroved the bulwarks and the paddle-wheels. After a lapse of eight hours the flamed began to 6uccumb, but the once noble vessel is almost destroyed. The owners are believed to be insured at Lloyd's, but for what amount is unknown. TnKNiw SniELU Sini'.— The Royal Sovereign, at Portsmouth, has only at present Eome thirty hands, mechanics and labourers, employed upon her in her conversion to a shield Ehip, and tho majority of those are engaged in completing her new stern. All other woi k, with one exception, is in a state of suspension. This st.itc or things clearly indicates that the authorities have as yet arrived at r.e decision as to tbc exact course to be adopted to give tbe sbip the efficiency she will be supposed and ought to possess as a shield ship, and which she will doubtless have hod, had it been possible for the Admiralty and Capiain Coles, from the first, to have worked harmoniouBly together. In tbc conversion of one of the largest of our ships, constructed to carry broadside guns, to a vessel on un entirely novel principle, and carrying guns only amidships, it certainly seems but reasonable to suppose that the position of the guns and their line of flic rrom the shields of the converted Ehip should have been fully taken into consideration before tbc drawings for the snip's conversion were issued. This, however, is juet what bos not been done. Tbc Admiralty, in their very pardonable eagerness to give Captain Coles a fitting ship for bis first essay, unfortunately kept the details or her con vcrsien in their own hands. They restricted Captain Coles to pre paring tbc necessary drawings for her towers and shields, and, selecting one of the latest constructed and finest of our three deckers, placed her in the hands of the master shipwright's de partment lit Portsmouth, to razee OB quickly as possible, accord lug to furnished drawings. The work was done in a wonder fully sLtrt lime, and the progress or conversion was cairicd so far tbat the Ehip had received her armour plates on bcr sides and tbc towers on her deck when tbe awkward discovery was made that, in lieu of a vessel that should possets extraordinary offensive end defensive powers, we have something in the shape or a huge mooring lighter, the offen sive and defensive powers of which, if completed as aBhieldehip in its present form, would be very limited indeed, To remedy tbis error as far as possible, it is now proposed to raise the deck at the crown of the tower over the engine-room to tbe height or S reerc inches above the present dock, Eloping tbc beams to the ship's side to 18 inches above tho ends of the present beams, and ?hus giving the gunB about 4 degrees of depression amidships. Drawing a line from the muzzle of the guns, when at their great est possible depression, to the point at which their shot would suite the hull of a ship's launch or gunboat on the water, It is evident that there must always be a considerable space round the Royal Sovereign where a large number of such craft could lie out of all danger from the gunB of tbe shield Bhip, At tho same time they could pound her sides with sold GS-nound shot, throw men on her deckB, wedge up her towers, and drop shells or other explosive substances into them, and thus force her to a speedy surrender. These scriouB objections to the Royal Sovereign as a shield-ship arise entirely from her inability to depress hor guns, owing to the manner in which she had been razeed, together v itb her width, one or the great requirements of the shield princi ple being that the sbip, to carry plates, must be long, of narrow beam, end yet with sufficient flatness or floor to enable hor to carry the great weight or the towcro and their shields In addition to her guns. To say that such chips as the Royal Sovereign, low as they will be in the water, require no armour covering for the upper deck (when, like the Royal Sovereign, they arc to carry only guns of the same calibre as an ordinary fiigatc having five times her number), is simply absurd. Such a frigate as tho Mersey ranging up alongside the Sovereign would send a broadEidc down upon the lattcr's unprotected deck, which would go right through her and sink her et once. Give the shield ship guns of e-uch calibre as no other description of ship could carry, which was the Intention of the inventor, and then the Mersey would be careful how Bho attempted to range along side such an antagonist. With respect to the number of shields to be carried by tbo converted ship, it bus been decided, wo think, very un wisely, to give the ship five, rescinding a previous order to fit hor for four of larger diameter. As tbc five shieldB will only carry rs*poundcrs or 110-poundcr Armstrongs, the Bhicld Bblpwill, in fact, have but ton guns of the same calibre as tho fifty guns of the ordinary frigate, end her offensive powers will thus bo reduced to a minimum. When in bco ti im the estimated draught of water of tbc Royal Sovereign will bo 20 fecu Bho will carry her upper deck at tbe sides, seven feet above the water line, and tuo muzzle* Cf her gune V feet 0 inches.— JVtiirs, LATEST DATES.
