TRADE AND FINANCE. Immigration: to Australia from the United Kingdom contfinues to decline. In 1892 only 16,164 persons! loft British ports for theso colonics against 19,957 in the previous year. me inning o tt is dYSto, or more than lo per cent. As, under present arrangements, nearly all Australian immigrants pay their own passages, and are likely, therefore, to bo sclf-supportittg and self-reliant, the diminu tion possesses considerable significance. Tho experience off Canada has been precisely tho reverse. L&st; year 41,888 emigrants left Great Britain for British North America against 33,752 in the previous year, an in crease of 8136, or about 25 per cent. Every self-supporting immigrant adds to the volume of trade, both as a consumer and producer- It is not, 'therefore, n good sign to find that the attractions o£ Australia for this class aro becoming smaller uiul smaller. Prom the report of the Indian savings I bunks for the last official year it apjjears that there aro now in the country 6642 | Government savings bunks, which at tho close of the official year held balances amounting to -over 8831 lakhs of rupees (nearly £6, 000, (MO sterling), yielding interest amounting to over 30 lakhs. This is cxclu sive of tho Government promissory noted held on behaKf of depositors. Compared with the previous year the number of de positors increased by more than 55,000, and the total deposits by over 82 lakhs of rupees. Investors mil be interested to learn tliat tihe number of joint stock companies in existence, and the total amount of their paid-up capital, have just doubled since April, 1884. At that date, the Jjullioiiist remarks, there were 8692 companies known, | to work wluicli the public hacl handed over £475,000,000 to a great army of direc tors and officials ; whilst in April of 1892 the number of companies had increased to 16,173, and the total amount of paid-up capital to £989,000,000- Our con temporary wonders if the next eight years will show such a striking comparison. We are requested to state that Mr. Henry Burrows has reigned his position as director of the Australia Hotel Company, Limited. Some interesting comments on the re moval of the Adelaide assets of tho Federal Bank to Melbourne appeal I in Monday's Aj'fjus. Our contemporary wrAca : — With regard to the transference of the South Australian assets of the Federal Bank to the head office in Melbourne, it is ex plained that the step has beetti taken in con sequence of the mistaken notion held by some of the South Australian creditors that they eujoy a preferential cffaiin over the assets which were in South Australia at the time of the stoppage. No suieh. preferential claim exists, and all ercditoin, excepting the Crown and noteholders, who must be paid first, runk pari jicwa in the? distribution of the assets. Tho South Australian creditors, there! ore, are interested in t he assets to the same extent, and no tinore, as the rest of the creditors, and they are in no whit prejudiced by tho removal of the South Australiiun assets to Melbourne. To have left tihem in Adelaide, where the mistaken notion to which wc have referred to is prevalent, would have been a temptation to litigation, ami this would only have increased tho cost of iiciuidation. The directors of the Federal Bank have, no doubt, been well advised in tho stop which they have taken. The policy of that step cannot, under the circumstances, be ques tioned, for il would serve no good purpose to have an active Adelaide liquidation, which might be out of harmony with the principal liquidation at Melbourne. Doubtless botli the Adelaide and Sydney Courts will be dis posed to endorse whatever arrangements be made at the meeting to be held, here ou Wed nesday next. A London liquidation cannot be avoided, but there is r»o reason why it should not bo under the practical control of the Melbourne liquidation. Of the London market for Australian butter, Coey and Co., Limdled, write on January 12 : — Butter: Danish quotation unaltered (120s to 124s), but market easier. The competition of the large bulk of colonial arrivals is severely felt. Condition of butters «x Vic toria, Oroya and Runpchu salisfiictory. Deliveries from Victoria and Ruapehu have not been satisfactory, and have called forth our strong protest. Oceana expected to dock on lith inst., bringing about 3C0 tons. Rangitira on 18th inst., quantity unknown. Frosty and very favorablo weather bnoke up on 8th inst. The largo arrivals luuvo hau effect upon market, and prices havo had to give way somewhat. Buyers are very diffi cult to deal with. Tho break in tho weather, combined with reports in most of our leading newspapers of cablegrams received from Mel bourne of the largo quantities of butter being dispatched, have created a very disturbed impression. Cheese : A better Irada, prices firmer, and a good inquiry, especially for qualities under finest. Chuoao ex Fluapchu, the first of tho new season's make, i:cot yet to hand.
