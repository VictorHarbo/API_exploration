ART DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTRALIA * Australia is on the eve of a great artistic development, which might re- sult in the country becoming the Mecca of all cultured people," the Minister for Immigration and Tour- ist Activities, Mr. Clive Evatt, said yesterday at the opening of an ex- hibition presented and produced by the directors of Burghley Art, Mrs. Joan Duley and Mr. Desmond Worthington, at Anthony Horderns' yesterday. The exhibition is of a number of pictures and fire screens which may be adapted to plaques, pelmets, panel- ling, or bed-ends. The formula for making the body of the designs is one evolved by Mrs. Duley's mother, Mrs. Mae Henman, who is now in Capetown, South Africa, continuing her work. Members of the Danish community in Sydney will hold their Christmas party at the Fellowship Hall, Bible House, on Tuesday. There will also be guests from the other Scan- dinavian countries, Norway and Sweden. The party has been organised by the Rev. C. C. Ligaard.
