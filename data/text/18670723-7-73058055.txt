Gentlemen— I have much pleasure in acced ing to your request that I should allow myself to be nominated for the Legislative Council, and if returned will do my best to forward the interests of the colony at large. As my political views may not be widely known, I feel it my duty to glance at the most important political matters of the day. I consider that immediate action should be taken in reference to the Immigration Act and the large surplus fund now lying almost idle which I should endeavor to expend in public reproductive works, which would give employ ment and relief to hundreds of starving families now in the colony. I think the time has arrived for the revision of the Tariff, as the duties now fall heavily on the laboring and fanning classes. I am in favor of free distillation by erecting good public stills (under efficient management) in the centres of winegrowing localities, so that any gardener could take his produce and have it converted into a marketable article that would be saleable in any part of the world. This could be done at about one-fifth the ex pense of working by the present Distillation Act, which seems to me ''n«r to proposing that every farmer should have his own mill, to waste his time and spoil his grain, as many winegrowers now do their time and produce. I would advocate the development of the country by a system of cheap tramways, where trade and the natural resources of the colony warrant such outlay. I would also support a reconstruction of the land regulations, so as to enable the legitimate farmer to Becure the land he requires for culti vation direct from the Government on reason able terms. I am of opinion that the Parliament can, with advantage to the colony, adopt such measures as will alleviate the squatters, who have so greatly Buffered by the drought, and am in favor of an assessment on the stock depastured rather than a fixed rental. These seem to me the most prominent matters now before the public, but I should be prepared to give every matter due considera tion and earnest thought for the welfare of the colony. lam, Gentleman, Yours faithfully, ? WILLIAM ROUNSEVELL. To Hon. Thos. English, M.L.C., Hon. C. G. Everard, M.L.O., W, Everard, Bfcq., M.P,, J. B, Neales.

Gentlemen— I have much pleasure in acced ing to your request that I should allow myself to be nominated for one of the vacant seats in the Legislative Council. In accepting this invi tation I desire to express my sense of &e; re. ?ponsibjlity that devolves on members of the Upper House to conserve its constitutional privileges. As members of the Legislative Council are elected for a lengthened period, more depends on their geimral «4mrfl^frn- tnan j»n Bn ^yppMrapn of opinion on the igaJmg topics of die day, especially considering the rapid changes in colonial life.

I deeply regret the temporary distress which prevails amongst the working classes at the present time, hut I trust that the dark cloud which for some months has hung over the colony will speedily pass away and better times will dawn for all classes in the community.

Gentlemen— I feel highly honored by com plying with your requisition, said, if elected, shall be perfectly willing to devote my best services to the business of legislation. I am, Gentlemen, Yours, obediently, ? JOHN CROZIER. To George Green, Esq., John Hodg kiss, Esq., and the other Gentle men signing the Requisition. TO THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen— Having been requested to come forward and offer myself as a Candidate for one of the vacancies of the Legislative Council at the - forthcoming ¥H'^-amM, it is necessary, as lam not known to many of the Electors, for me to introduce myself, and to place before you my opinions, and the measures I -would support which are likely to come before the LegiMfttive Council. I have been in the colonies for twenty-eight years. Although residing in New South Wales and Victoria as a, squatter, I have for the last seventeen years done business here, and have now oome to reside in thiscolony for the purpose of remaining and educating my family, and am in no way connected with trade or business to influence me from giving my support to any measure that would be for the benefit of aU classes and the advancement of the country. Land Systems.— Desirous of encouraging bona fide settlement I would carefully consider any plan that could be devised to render agri cultnie more remunerative, and to enable this colony to compete -with the liberal land systems of New South Wales and Victoria. Mining— T consider that to encourage the de velopment of our mineral resources more liberal regulations are necessary. That measures should be devised to protect the actual dis coverer in flie enjoyment of his rights, and that a small royalty might be preferable to rent Squatting. — I am in favor of s- classification of runs, and liberal terms in the dry coun try. In favor of the principle of an assessment at per head actually depastured, the rate vary ing according to the value of the ron. Railways.— The great want of the country is improved 'means of intercommunication, and cheaper cBxriageforitsproduce. Whilstsapport ing liberal outlay on ordinary roads I would sup port railway extension on a cheap scale ; also a system of tramways for horse traction. Am in favor of guaranteeing private capitelistsin the execution of reproductive works. The Tariff.— I believe that taxes should inter fere as little as possible with trade; I am opposed to the imposition of protective duties, as these increase the cost of growing, and enhance the charges upon ™»j«fag produce, thereby Jj— Ming our miners, and farmers, and others from competing in the markets of the world; but I should not object to admit free of duty, such raw nut'*'* as can be worked up into manufactured articles in the colony, and would favor a bonuB to any positively new industry beneficial to the colony. Insolvent and other Laws.— I consider they need amendment so as more effectually to pro tect the public against reckless extravagance and fraud, and at the same time better to secure the honest but really unfortunate debtor. I also consider that a revision and simplifica tion of many of the laws would be beneficial, as from their intricate and complex forms they as often create a crime as prevent it Education.— I am in favor of Government aid to Education, if wholly unsectarian; would sup port the extension of Education to the out lying districts, and generally to assist the estab lishing of schools in thinly- peopled localities. Constitution Act — I am in favor of amending it in several particulars, such as making the office of Attorney-General not necessarily political; preventing Government contractors getting into Parliament ; giving the Government power, as in Victoria, to remove a Judge on the address of both Houses. Immigration. — At present none is needed, but I should favor introducing suitable labor when wanted. PublicExpenditure. — I am opposed to the mul tiplication of offices, and would advocate strict economy in the Government departments ; sup porting the appropriation of a larger share of the public revenue to opening up the country dis tricts, and for tiie convenience of country set tlers generally. Intercolonial Affairs.— I am in favor of fede ration, or mutual agreement for certain definite objects, such as the free interchange of colonial produce, co-operation in schemes of coast de fences, postal and telegraph arrangements. On all the various questions that may from tone to tame arise, and which I have not touched upon, my best endeavors will be put forth to advance tike interests of my fellow-colonists, without respect to class or party, should I be returned.

Election notices, rpo THE ELECTORS OF THE -L LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. ' Gentlemen— Acting on the advice of several tnenda, I deem it expedient to ,giye you my views upon a few of the leading questions that most liktly wfll require the consideration of the Legislative CounciL . I am of -opinion Chat public works should be pushed forward with as little delay as possible. That immigration for the present *hould be suspended, as many of the working classes now here cannot obtain sufficient employment but am in favor of introducing suitable labor when required.- . .... I am opposed to protection, as' being restric tive to commercial progress, and auTor opinion that although a few artisans might re*p * small benefit in their rate of 'wage, they nevertheless with the remainder of the comtrfunity would suffer to afar greater extent. in the increased price of the necesBaries of life. ? lam in favor of ad valorem duties, and -be- lieve it to be the most equitable meams of raising a revenue, and am of opinion its discon tinuance would not benefit the greater portion of the community, aa they would still nave to pay the same price for their tea, sugar, and in fact all their daily requirements. I deem it advisable that the Mnrray traSe should be secured to South Australia, and any measure that will tend to obtain this object shall receive my support lam in favor of opening tip -the country by means of tramways, and wOl support any scheme that wDl guarantee W'£^i«^ capitalists S per eent as an inducement to invest their capital in reproductive works in this colony. I would support any liberal alteration in mineral leases that would tend to develop the mineral resources of this colony, and ~ am of opinion that the Government should receive no rental from any mine save a payable one, and then only 5 per cent out of the net profits. I am in favor of the proposed connection by means of tramway of Clare with Wallaroo, and. should support the measure when brought forward. I am opposed to the oppression by means of taxation of any one class of the community, and believe this evil has had much to do with the gloomy times and great distress we have been subjected to. In conclusion I will say that if elected I will use my best endeavors to promote the interest and welfare of the colony at large. I am, gentleman, Your obedient servant, tthgxo ? E.
