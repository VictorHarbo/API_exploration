Trade has boon gottlng dullor and duller, and with ovcry natural dcslro on tho part of holdors to push Bales, Importers And it impOESiblo to movo stocks, and aro consequently com-i" peiled to storo tho heavy arrivals coming to hand in olrcndy over-crowded warehouses, and patlontly await tlio hopo of their disposal from tbo miserably small orders which may dribblo in. This ia no overdrawn tintement of tho condition of markets, as witness tho auction sales, where, oven at the wretched prices at which goods aro frequently all but thrown away, our hitborto largest doalors will only purclmso in the i mallost parcols-quantities which, a short timo since, they would almost havo boon ashamed to hld for; ; and »ven those small lots aro, by arrangement, often divided amongst sovoral dealers. On tho arrival pf the English mall on tho 12th inst, it was scarcely credited that any inoreaso oí shipments from tbo home markot could havo taken placo. Adrices un- fortunately proved tho contrary, and furthor dopros. sion in markets consequently onaued. On closer ex- amination, howovor, it appeared from Stables' tables that tho chiof. Increase consisted of soft goods, of whioh tbcro is au excoss of sbipmonts In _ay over those of April of upwards of £200,000 value. Credit in trading circles is becoming gradually drawn in, moro cspe. dally as regards country transactions, and largo discounts for cash payment» aro being allowed, in proferonco to taking tho risk of acccptoncoi. Tho adoption of this system, wbllo it has doubt- less been tho moans of tbo stoppago ot many dealers trading without means, muet tend towaids a healthier state of trade, and ultimately esta- blish business on a sounder footing, and root out tlio unround system which has grownup (Hiring tho last two years. Business is at proeout sullcrlug tho effects of tho chango of system which trade is under- going, and to this, in somo mensuro, added to the enormous accumulation of stocks, and tho consequent ruiscrablo prices procurable, may bo attributed tho existing depression and checrloss prospects of mar- kets. Such is tho present condition of trade, ami ao lug OB excorslvo imports, fostered by tbo ov.aj gemtcd ideas of our powers of consumption, cinl!nu9, « o cortalnly cannot look for, or reasonably oipticï, my improvement. Tho repented cautionB which ha/o month after month bcon given to shippers nppeir enly to havo stimulated thom to farther exertions, nnel which on this sido can only ho viewed as au In- fatuation, and on the othor as a doeiro to get rid of a j lclhora of cash. Shippers, indo;d, appear wilfully blinded ; but until thero is a considerable cossatlon ol shipments, extending over eoveral months', to ino Australian colonies generally, no prospect of arnond ixent can bo reasonably hold out. llcductlon lu ir.ces docB not induco purchases. Consumption Is evidently declining. Country storekeepers state th it their cUBtomora cannot now afford lo spend monw cn other than absoluto requisitos, and aro ccono n iring tho nocossaries of llfo to tho narrowost limit, ii ho conflicting reports from tho Snowy BivcrDij Lliigs tend much to unsottlo tho country trade. Accounts the most favourable, and others oqually ad verso, aro constantly being recoivod; thora is, how ever, indisputably a large exodus of our mining popu- lation to those diggings, notwithstanding the oxclio rccnt has In some degroe calmed down. With these remarks wo proceed to give detailed particulars of tho state of the markets for the leading articles of con- sumption. Bulk Beor -Bass' ale has somewhat rallied, and sales reported at £7. Othor blands most difficult to move. Bulk stout In bettor Inquiry, and prleo firmer. Quo- tations :-Bass's als, £7 to £7 6s. ; Allsopp's, £7 ; other brands, £0to£010s. ; stout, Taylor's or Tru- man's, £7. Bottled Beer-Demand very Inactivo, anil stocks continue largo ; price has somewhat declined. Quota- tions:- Bj ass's alo, Os. ; stout, 103 ; other brands, 8s Cd. to 8s Od, and 9s. to 0s Cd. Bags and Bagging.-Thero has not been so much in- quiry for sacks during tho month, and prleo has still further declined. Sales aro reported at 0s Cd. Wool- packs havo been In better demand, and an advanco of Sd. bnsbeen established. Boots and Shoes continue lo ba forced ofT at auc tii n at most ruinous prices ; shipments aro still in a Host extravagant stylo, and prospects most gljonvr. No regular qu stations can bo given. Breadstuff*, Crain, &0.-Fair demand for Hunthy mid Palmer's biscuits. In small lots Flour easier in price ; sales of Adelaida havo been mado at auction at £1510s Oats appear hopeless of any Improvement ; demand ia very light, and quotations almost nominal, as it 1B impossible to sell in any quantity. Danish have been placed to-day at Ss. Od. per bushel on terms. Colonial grown aro quoted at 4s. ; Californian at tha same prleo, and other sort« from 8B Cd to 3s. 10,1. por bushel.

Californian wheat olforlng nt Cs. 9d. per bushel, w ithout buyers Building Materials, Timber, S.e - Flro bricks havo come forward more freely, and, with tho goncral dul ness in building, demand has slackoned. Timber has again declined, In tho absence of all doimind : largo quantities aro being stored ; but It 1B doubtful whether any improvement can toko placo, as timber merchants nro all holders of heavy Block, and complain greatly of the dulncss lu tho trado, and do not expect anygrcater activity unless building operations aro again actively resumed. Canvas.-Thero ia a fair demand for best navy can. va?, but medium and low qualities ara dull and in ovcratock. Duck, well supplied, and very llttlo de- mand. Condies.-Tho heavy arrivals lately havo somewhat lowered pi lees, and supplied immediate wants ; hut as stocks aro light, any short bupply will bo suro to cause a reaction. Belmonte realizo lOJd. ; light weights, 15d. ; and Nova stéarine, 17èd. per lb Coffee.--Tho markot (or j cars post lias not hoon so hare as at the present timo ; but as three cargoes are now duo from Cejlon, tbo present extreme r.ites can- not bo expected to continue.
