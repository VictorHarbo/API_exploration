" I had suffered with a complaint in my body which „ eventually reached my legs, and having been treated for 3 years by several duetors during that time, I derived no benefit, but gradually got worse, until f was told by them y ' 1 would never get better,' and that ' they could do ne 1 more for me, This they could have told me years before . and saved me many pounds. Uowcver, this information was a great blow'to me. To think that 1 had to Ho In bed a cripple and die for the want of proper treatment wa< \- worse than death itself. But I have lo tlmnk God that one day I wnr, handed 4 The Ape ' newspaper and started ' to read it, but finding my sight was failing me I asked inj J son to read it to me. On locking down (he Medica Column one advertisement in particular which tooK mj attention was about some very successful cures effected b W. Mcntiplay, of Bourko-ntreot. After henringmy son read >, the advertisement 1 decided to give him a trial, and tool _ the first opportunity of doing so, and 1 solemnly dccluri |, that in twenty-four (24) hours' time I pot morerelief than J ever got in tunny yuurs' treatment by ull tho doctors tha treated me, and continued to regain my health am d strength, aud in eight (8) weeks I was ns well an ever I trs \- in my life. But for tho sake of suffering humanity ! 0 would advise all who suffer not to waste their meam \- foolishly, and then go to a persou who can cure them but to go at once nnd save their money, for I am per fectly justified iu saying that W. Mcntiplay, of Bourke ;0 street, Melbourne, saTcd my lifo when others had givei tne up, and what he did for mo be could do for other who have suffered likewise." This honest confession of Mr. Sbulz must be beneflcia 1, to public sufferers, and if many others whom I hat _ saved frotn an early grave would boldty njieak put th i- truth, the public would benefit largely from their experl ; eoce of my treatment.
