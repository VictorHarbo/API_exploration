SANE MAN 20 YiAftS r IN MENTAL HOME I New York, September '6-A Danish immigrant has been kept "by mistake" in a Kansas mental in- stitution for almost 20 years, it was disclosed on Tuesday. Officiais of the Topeka State Hospital, where the immigrant, John Crabb, now 59, was kept, said that one of the reasons they thought he was insane was that he tried so hard to prove he was sane. At one time, they listed him as incurable. The hospital superintendent said Crabb was "the victim of circum- stance." rle laid Crabb's long confine- ment to his lack of knowledge .of the United States, his inability to speak English clearly, his hot tem- per, and his determination to prove he was sane. Crabb was originally confined because he threatened a man who made advances toward his girl friend. Crabb's case was brought to the attention of a' group of Danish insurance men, who took the matter up with -the authorities. Last November he was given a final test and declared sane. Then it took almost 10 months to ar- range his release. The superintendent said there was every indication that he was never out of his mind. "I'm am not resentful," Crabb said as he left the hospital. "I'm just glad to get away. I've waited a long time for this."
