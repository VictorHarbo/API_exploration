Even the previous high standard was eclipsed by Walter George's Sunshine Play- ers with the new programme introduced last evening. The Theatre Royal was crowded to the limit of its accommodation, and the audience showed itself to be keenly apprecia- tive of the enterprise and earnest efforts of the management to furnish only the best class of entertainment. The new programme is excellent, both in the quality and variety of its numbers. An exceedingly cordial re- ception was accorded Jock Mills, the cele- brated Scotch raconteur and comedian, whose services were secured by arrangement with Fullers, Ltd. Mr. Mills is an artist to his finger tips, embracing many of those essentials which have brought fame to Sir Harry Lauder. His delivery is excellent, his staging clear and tuneful, and his humour is of that infectious type which kept the audi- ence in a constant simmer ot merriment. It was with a feeling of extreme regret that the audience saw him leave the stage. A generous burst of applause greeted the sing- ing of "Annie Laurie" by Lexe Burns, a talented contralto, and the cheering ballad "I'm Going Back to Georgia," when sung by Robert Raymond and the Sunshiners, was much appreciated. 'The Pvpes of Pan,' an extremely popular song, was charmingly rendered by Linda Dale, while Eily Dagleish and Gus Dawson achieve* no little success with a singing, and dancing contribution. With the artists in appropriate costume, and, in a pretty scenic setting typical of that romantic island, the song scena 'Dreamy Hawaii' was one of the most picturesque items of the bill. The singing numbers and efforts of the Ballet were a material factor in the success of the piece. The comedy ele ment, or the greater portion of it, was en trusted to the 'safe hands of the midget en tertainer, 'Tubby' Stevens, who is the favourite of patrons. His witty sayings, unique mannerisms, and general all-round, ability were in great demand last evening. 'A Play in 'One Act' was a cleverly conceived ? production, and one which was ably interpreted by Ira Bissett, Cyril Xorthcote. and Doris Dods. The second half, of the bill was devoted to the presentation of an elaborate production, entitled 'Made- moiselle Modiste,' which has been described as 'a sketch of new ideas and' sensations. '? It certainly is a departure from custom, and, with practically the full company engaged, the piece was splendidly carried out. There is a Mender plot, but the pro duction is more striking by virtue of the magnificent display of fashion creations, and the lavish manner in which it is staged. Messrs. 'Tubby' 'Stevens and Yorke Gray and Misses Ira Bissett and Linda Dale ap pear to advantage. The piece is freely inter spersed with enjoyable musical numbers. The Sunshiners' orchestra -performs well through out. ' - A fair and unbiassed criticism — 'Daily News,' May 10, 1924— and yet another. - A SUMPTUOUS SHOW. ELABORATE DRESSING AT THE ROYAL. ? 'The Mirror' has. no hesitation in, ac claiming 'Mademoiselle Modiste.': the big revue at the Theatre Royal this week,' as one of the most elaborately dressed produc tions we've ever seen in Perth; and at times it almost comes up to legitimate musical comedy standard as far as sumptuous staging' is concerned. ''.Mademoiselle Modiste' is a show in itself, but the Sunshine Players have lots more to offer. Jock Mills, a Fuller artist, who hag stopped over for a week en route to the East, made, his first appearance last' night; and even after 25 minutes on. the stage... the audience didn't want to let the Scotch^ funny man go. ' His boast .of being the next best. Scotch comedian to- Lauder.isn't an exaggeration, and he' gives us new songs — which Lapder never did. The individual members of 'the* company are all in good. form, and the Tubby Steven isms are as refreshing as ever. It's in. every sense, a super- programme '?* '?' : WALTER GEORGE'S SUNSHINE PLAYERS At the THEATRE ROYAL NIGHTLY at 8. S:H E' R -- I '-.'D.' ! A -N'-;S SALON DE DANSE and CABARET.
