'?'.IMMIGRATION TO CANADA. A Rising Tide, AGEICTCTLTUBISTS LEAD THE WAY. A new era in Canadian immigration is indicated by the figures for the first half o£ last y^ar, we are told, and yet inspiring as they are, we must consider them, it is said, merely as the first, swell of a rising tide coming to benefit the shores of the Dominion. . The influence of many fac tors previously introduced into the immi gration situation are just beginning to be felt, we read in 'Agricultural and Indus trial Progress in Canada' (Montreal) , while . others have sprung into existence. The most forcible of these is said to be the operation of the new immigration law of the United States, and this monthly goes on to say: 'The first six months of 1924 have al ready seen a marked stimulation in immi gration to Canada._By months the increases over 1923 have been, respectively, 66, 85, 99, 103, 9 and 5 per cent. Taking the period a-3 a whole, there has been an increase of more than 43 per cent, in the movement. Total immigration for the six months has been 77,125, as against 53,592 in the pre vious similar period, an increase of 23,533. British immigration from January to June, ,37,191, records an increase of 30 per cent, that from the United States, 8671; a de crease of 17 per cent.; and from other coun tries an increase of 98 per cent. An Analysis. 'An analysis of the 'other countries' sec- tion makes interesting reading, and is es pecially significant in view of the United States law whicn has reduced the quotas of European people who can secure entry into the Republic, and-'which came N into effect' just at the termination of this Canadian Immigration period. The list is headed by Finns, who came to Canada to the number of 4682. The next most voluminous class is the Norwegian, with 268-7. Italians and Ozecho-Slovaks are both over the 2000 mark, with 2133 and 2160 immigrants, respective ly. Other important national contributions are: Eoumanian, 1913; Jugo-Slav, 1664; German, 1655; Swedish, 1632; Danish, 1487; Dutch, 1375; Newfoundland, 1290; Polish, 1198; Belgium, 1069; Hungarian, 746; Rus sian, 722; and Swiss, 503.' Canadian immigrants are divided into six main classes, it is remarked, and of these the agricultural leads with a total of 33,592 persons, or nearly 50 per cent, of the immi gration total. Next in order came the la bouring class, with a total vof 9854, followed by mechanics with a total of 8540. We read then : 'There were 7338 in the list of female domestic servants; 4183 listed as being of the trading class, and 1201 of the mining class. 'Ontario was the province to benefit to the greatest extent from the immigration tide, according to the declaration of the en trants as to their destination, a total of 34,062 going to this province. The next highest number went to Quebec, o.r 11,178 persons. All the four provinces of Western Canada followed after, Manitoba receiving a total of 9812; Saskatchewan, 0384; Al berta, 6384; and British Columbia, 5772. A total of 2185 persons declared their inten tion of settling in Nova Scotia; 1007 in New Brunswick; 22 in Prince '.Edward Island; and 19 in the Yukon territory. Immigrants From the United; States. 'Though the volume of immigration from the United States to Canada has declined, it is interesting to note that every State of the Union is listed among those making contributions in the six months to Canadian population. The State of Michigan led, with 1522 entrants, followed by New York, with 874, and Washington, with 784. Fol lowing in order came Minnesota, 619; Mas sachusetts, 424: North Dakota, 409; Cali fornia, 367; Itlinois, 341; Montana, 316;' Pennsylvania, 251; Oregon, 253; Iowa, 202; Wisconsin, 196; Ohio, 189; Maine, 179; Idaho, 146; New Jersey, 131; and Indiana, 103.' Although American statistics, as reported in the Montreal 'Star,' indicate that Can adians are coming into the United States at the rate of 200,000 per month, it is con tended by 'Agricultural and Industrial Pro gress in Canada' that from the middle of March until the end of June, according to th« figures of the Canadian Immigration De partment, the total number of Canadians returning to Canada from the United States was 13,874, or, roughly, 4000 per month. This organ of the Department of Colonisa tion and Development of the Canadian Pa cific Railway tells us further: 'These figures take cognisance only of resident Canadians who had gone to the United States with the intention of living there and securing their livelihood, and who had been absent from the Dominion for more than six months. Of the number noted, 11,869 were born in Canada, 1251 were British T subjects who had acquired Canadian domicile, and 763 were neutralised Canadians. Canada's Lost Sons Returning. 'There would appear to be a decided movement back to Canada, especially to the Province of Quebec, where the seepage has been most serious. The exodus from the eastern townships of Quebec, and from the Province at large, which reached serious proportions a year ago,- seems to have ceas ed, according to all reports, the tide show ing a perceptible movement in the other ? 1 ? _w_— — ^j— «— - — ?

'Qpmm^tttt^ never rolaxed: it* ef-'! forts to indtice^back thes$ lost sons/ ana it is materially aided in this work by the tra dimmable love of the French-Canadian for his native land, and the unasBimilable qual ity of the French character. ' 'Many who a year ago left. .Quebec; are now returing hoinefVtogetVex;''yrith,'''tho.8!av-hpBe;.' absence haa been a. matter, of years. A report from Boston states that 150 French-Canadian families are returning to Canada per rtveek from the New England States, ond the ma jority settling in the Province of. Quebec. 'This is a most pleasing trend, and one which has probably only commenced with Canada's emergence from post-war depres sion. Canada, has never ceased to mourn over her lost sons and hope for the return of many of them under brighter conditions. The new movement gratifying supplements the. stimulation effected to emigration from - Europe to Canada by the new United States quota law and the check it imposes upon the flow of partially assimilated immigrants across the border. . . . 'It has always been realised that prob ably the greatest hindrance to a more rapid national development in Canada has been the proximity of a great and developed neighbour to the south exerting a powerful lure upon Canadians at times of temporary depression through her greater* prosperity and more advanced and varied progress, and her ability to offer the intellectuals and technically trained of the Dominion posi tions the number of which were strictly limited in Canada. This trek, varying in , volume, has been in progress throughout Canadian history, and since it «has always , been of a consistently high constituent, the United States has never restricted it. Ac cording to the last United States census, there were 1,117,878 American citizens of Canadian birth, of whom 307,786 were French, which gives some indication of how Canada has suffered by her later start in economic development.'
