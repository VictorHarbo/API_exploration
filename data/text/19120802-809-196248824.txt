NORTHERN TERRITORY RAILWAYS. | In the House of Representatives yester- | day the Prime Minister (Mr. Fisher) made his budget statement for the.current finan cial-year, 1012-13. ... The Prime Minister said: It has become a J. very difficult task for. the Treasury officials to get the whole of the accounts from the whole of Australia and Papua, in order to enable nie to make the budget statement so early in the financial year. I wish to express my appreciation of the efforts they | have made. (Hear, hear.) In presenting the last budget to Parliament, on 20th ! October, 1911, the surplus of revenue over ! expenditure for the year ended 30tli .Tunc, i lhll, was stated at £1,829,524. When the Treasury books . were fiaajly balanced this amount appeared as £1,837,175. It was transferred for future expenditure to the construction of fleet fund and the invalid and old age pensions fund in equal amounts of £018,587. In framing the budget of 1911-12, it was estimated that £1,712,079 of this amoiuit would be expended during' the financial year. 1' am happy to say that, /Owing : principally to the large re-. ccipts'fioin customs; it was nofnqccssary to expend, this amount, as' the -revenue ex-; eeodccl the expenditure by £424,300, of winch amount £278,242 was transferred to the construction of fleet fund, and £140,124 to .the invalid and old age pensions fund. On the 30th June, 1912, there was in all at the credit of the construction of fleet fund and the invalid and old age pensions fund the amount of £2,201,541. This amount may be considered as the surplus balance brought forward from preceding yearn, and is available for expenditure in' the pvesent financial year: A GREAT REVENUE. The revenue for the year ended 30th June last amounted to £20,548,361. ' Customs and cxcisc> reached the large amount of £14,710,199, being £1,729,755 in excess of the collections of . the previous year, and £910,109 above the esti mate. I attribute the . present large receipts principally to the great prosperity which Australia is now enjoy ing, and which I hope will long continue. (Ministerial cheers.) The post office yielded £3,910,509, being £46,599 over the estimate, and £10,58-4 in excess of the re- . ceipts of ifjie preceding year. This was in ' spite of the fact that we had penny, post- ' i ago throughout ' the Commonwealth and 1 < liritish Dominions during the . whole of I 1911-12; while it was in operation for only j two months in the previous year. It is I estimated by the Postal department that ' the loss on penny postage for the year , was £470,000. The land , tax yielded ' £1,360, 454, being £63,546 under the csti- ! mate, and £3891 less than the receipts of I 1910-11. | ( THE AUSTRALIAN COINAGE, i gross profits from coinage amounted to I. £156,489, being £53,511 less than the esti mate, 'and £42,404 less than those of the ' ' Previous year. Some difficulty has been ' found in obtaining sufficient qunnti- ties of silver coin from London; in eonse- : fluence of pressure, of business in the Royal Mint. I am hoping to make suclr av- i mngements .that we shall: he able in future to regularly export £100,009 per annum in i face value of British silver. Included in S last year's - revenue was an amount of 4113,340, being the balance of Defence Ir.Inist Fund 'Accounts' on the 30th June. \- The Defence department desired that this , ' amount should remain in the respective \- ,trust. -funds, created for the convenient ; working of the various factories established ! y .the department, I take the view that, although trust funds may be used with advantage during the year iii eonnei? Hon with the working of the factories, the .department should not be allowed to uecu- mulu'jc funds which could be UBcd in future years without review by_ Parliament, "i '- HEAVY .EXPENDITURE.

' LARGER PERMANENT STAFF. Provision has been made for a large increase in the permanent staff of the post office, it has been represented by the department that economy would hnally result from such new appointments, the present system of employing a large number of temporary hands being very unsatisfactory. Provision has i accordingly been made for an additional staff of 173o officers. (Cheers.) The total number of permanent officers provided for ip .the estimates is 1S..5S7. In 1996-1907 only 10,961 were provided for. Mr., Webster (N.S.W.): For all depart ments: 1 The Prime Minister: Yes. In 1902-1003 the revenue was £2,494,730, being 12/5 per head. In 101213 the revenue is csti- ?mt,eri.1& £4;2tH,000, or 17/10jf per head. Jn 1902-1993 the expenditure, not including lie v.- works, was £2,433,147, or 13/3 per head. In 1912-13 the expenditure, not . including -now works, is esti mated . at £4,674,715, or 19/11 per head, i 1 revision has been made' for the erection ' of ten wireless telegraph stations during the year. It is estimated that there wiu be an increase of £19,000 over the cxpendi- ' ture of the previous year for conveyance of mails, due to the extension of, existing : facilities and to increased cost of existing services. (Hear, hear.) An increase of £14,000 hag been provided to meet addi tional rate of payment io the State Rail way departments from 1st January last under the agreement providing for a re- weighing of the mails during November, 1911\. A sum of £45,500 has been provided to allow of remuneration being- given to i ion- official post masters on 'an increased scale. .(Loud cheers.)' Mr. Fuller (N.S.W.): Does that include contract offices? The Prime Minister: That depends. HUGE DEFENCE VOTE. ' Tin-expenditure for defence has largely in creased during the last three years. The total expenditure, including new works &c;" fJ.'nISj8ntni,ul&,1901' t0 30th J»ne, 1910, was £9,o7S,09i. The expenditure in 1910-11, i'l"! . 1912-13 is estimated at £12,524,429, of which £5,438,364 is included in the estimates for' the current iinuneial year. '' ib'. Riley (N.S.W.): That is a stag gerer. FEDERAL FACTORIES.. v. Tiie Prime Minister: There was no rea son to doubt that the cordite produced at the cordite factory will be suitable for' ammunition.. The plant. of the small arms factory luts passed satisfactory tests. - It is anticipated that the assembling of the rifles, and the output of completed small arms will shortly commence; The clothing factory, which at present employs 309 ban"8' ""ring the period January to June. »i.'-L"rnc " garments to the value of £2b, <9o. It is anticipated that .the cost of production will be considerably lowered during this year. The present capacity of the factory is not sufficient for require- nicnts, and provision has been made for the duplication of the plant. The harness and saddlery factory litis manufactured high class military equipment to the satisfaction ol the Defence and Postmaster-General's departments. At present 115 hands are employed. It is intcuded to enlarge the premises during this year, and probublv in crease the number of hands.-. The purchase of the muclmiery and power plant for the woollen cloth factory at Geelong and the erection of buildings are now being' pro ceeded with. V . NAVAt ESTIMATES. The. estimates of expenditure for the naval branch of tiie Defence department shoff an increase of £370,407, the princi pal items being for maintenance of ships qnd vessels £i86,000, and for permanent seagoing naval forces £114,800. As regards the permanent seagoing naval forces, full complements for the' vessels of the fleet, totalling 2539 officers and men, are pro vided in estimates. Provision is made for taking over H.M. naval establishments at Sydney during 1012-13, and also for the necessary personnel for the naval depot and .dockyard at XVilliamstown,' "also gun nery, torpedo and wireless schools. Re garding naval reserves, provision is made for the boys wlio passed from the senior cadets' into the adult forces on lBt July to the nuniher of 3225. There is an in crease of £30,000 for the maintenance of ships and '.vessels consequent- upon the necessary provision for twelve' months for H.M.A. sliipi actually in .commission', in cluding H.M. A.S. Encounter, and, for., por-, tion- of'.- tiie- year, for the three cruisers building id Great Britain;- ' For reserves of stores there is an increase of £150,000, neceiwry for purchase of reserves of Morns to be stocked by -the Admiralty at vsydney before 30th June, 1913, for use' of fleet unit. An increase of £6800 is neces sary to provido for increased personnel of ships and establishments. , MILITARY. VOTE INCREASED. The estimates of expenditure in connection with the military forces for 1912-13 show an increase of (approximately) £369,000, in comparison with last year's figures. This increase/ is partly caused by the necessity to provide for the Jnrgeiy increased staffs required foj- administration and instruction in connection with the universal training movement. .Increased rates of piijr for all ranks of -the Royal Australian Engineers have also been provided for. It is intended to obtain the- services of -an officer of the' British Army Ordnnnce department -for tiie purpose of advising as to the reorganisa tion,, of the ordnance department in the Commonwealth. Under, instructional staff provision lyis beeii made for the promotion of 18 warrant and non-commissioned officers to the commissioned rank of -quarter-mas: ter; also for increased .rates of pay to war rant and. non- cqmmissloncd officers. An increased number of instructor, has also been provided to meet the requirements of universal training. MILITIA REORGANISATION. Consequent upon the first quota of univer sal trainees being drafted into the citizen forces this year, a reorganisation of the militia became necessary. . The number of militia provided for this .'year is therefore (approximately) 20,000 in : excess of the number provided for Inst year. -It is pro posed to increase the facilities for touchers in the State Education .departments to be come qualified to impart instruction in physical training to the junior cadets,, and provision, has been made accordingly. An amount of £388,600 lias been' provided for the purchase', of military material. . A sum of £12.600 has also been pi oyided to wards establishing li reserve of cordite for small ami ammunition. Under special defence provision has been made for the duplication of the nitro-glycerinc section of the cordite factory) also to meet 'the cost of machinery and plant for the, woollen fac tory, and for the. duplication of itlie plant, of the clothing factory. A large sum lias also been, provided .to .purchase arma ment,. . and stores for fixed de fences. Under. Additions, New Works, &c.;, there is an increase of £278,05(1, made up, us follows:— Naval works, £180,009; fleet unit,. £110,000; naval col lege, £7150;' wireless equipment, £900, being a' total of £298,059. Tills Sum is Ires amount provided iii estimates 1911-12, for rearmament of H.MtA.S. Protector, Pal- unm arid Gayundah, £20,000, leaving £278,050, . FLINDERS NAVAL BASE. . The amount' provided for naval works is to meet expenditure on naval bases at Flin ders, Port Stephens and Cockbtirn Sound, and includes u sum of £69,000 'towards es timated' cost- of two dredgers, to be built in Australia, and to be completed in the next- financial', year.- The sum of £110,000 for fleet unit is towards cost of u submarine depot ship/an oil tank steamer, and three oil fuel storage floating tanks. These are in. addition to the vcsbcIh provided for under, Sneeial Appronriation Act No. 18 of 1910\. .. The amount of £H50 for naval col lege tjs for machinery and plant for the college at Jervis Bay. It has been -de cided- to. duplicate the wireless telegraph Stations at Port'' Moresby and Thursday Island, at a cost of £900. the duplication being solely for naval defence purposes. Mr. Mathews (V.): Plenty of money for blood and thunder. The Prinie Minister: Defence is a matter which should be done thoroughly well or not touched at all. (Cheers) NAVAL SUBSIDY'. 1?1C!„5,aL8,',bsid>' ma<,c to Great Britain of £200,000 per annum has been reduced this year to £175,000. the' Admiralty hav ing agreed, in consideration of the Com monwealth Government taking over H.M.S. Encounter as one of the ships' of the Aus tralian squndron from 1st July, 1012, to accept a reduction -of £25,000 in 'the umount of the contribution from that date. -MEAT INSPECTION. I pass now to trade, and cus toms, which tells a different tale. During tiie past twelve months special care lias been, exercised in administering tho provisions of the Coriimerce Act so as to maintain a high standard in the quality of the, goods, exported from the Common wealth. The goods . specially examined, such us. meat, butter, leather, rabbits, fruit, SC.. amounted in value to £S, 059, 057. In regard to meat, steps have been; taken to bring into effect uniform methods, in. all the States to govern the examination prior to export, and the action taken ensures that no meat leaves the Commonwealth that is not in every way suitable for human consumption. The system adopted so fully meets the requirements' of the United States .authorities that they Imve mow registered the names of tho Common wealth inspectors, and grant facilities to the admission of AuAtraTiun meat bouring the certification of these inspectors. In regard to butter, , it is satisfactory to note that during this period there have been ho complaints in . Great Britain on account of Australian butter containing 'an excess of moisture or any .adulterant. During the year compulsory grading of butter was initiated, and it is interesting' to note that during the first year it has been tried there has been a great levelling up in the Bri tish markets in the. price, of Australian butters compared with those of 'Denmark and New Zealand. In 1907 the difference between Danish and Australian was 17/0 per cwt./ for tho five years previous to compulsory grading 11/2,. while during the recent season the average difference has been only 4/, while on several occasions Australian and Danish prices were practi cally equal. Special care lias been taken to safeguard' the people of the Common wealth by preventing the importation of quack, medicines, children's foods, &c.;, which bear extravagant or misleading claims. Qvcr two thousand preparations have been examined and deatt with, pro clamations against importation being issued where necessary. The total cost to the Commonwealth of the strict and effective supervision over' exports and imports is' not great, the cost amounting to some £10,000, while the sum of £12,000 is col: iected in the. shape of fees, &c.;, on goods examined. . FISHING. INDUSTRY. In last year's statement it was mentioned that the board of inauiry nominated to investigate the nature and result of the Endeavour's work expressed a, very high opinion as to her performances and the usefulness of that work. They also sug gested that an experimental trip -shoiild be made on commercial lines. , This was done, with the result that 5 tons of market able fish was taken during 19J hours -. of actual fishing, or at the rate, of 590 lb. per hour of fishing. Another noteworthy result is the .discovery.; of extensive uiid rich fishing grounds ' in .the Great Austra lian Bight, and within localities previously altogether unknown. The Endeavour - lias also ascertained the position of the "hun dred fatnom ' line" .all through the Aus tralian, Bight. Several local proposals to float fishing companies are under considera tion, but owing, to a general want of know ledge of such matters progress has 'been slow: : Inquiries, made by firms in . tho United Kingdom show,, that the Endea vour's work is being closely watched, and tlmt modern trawlers may oe .sent 1 out to' take advantage of the exploration work already done.- There are still vast areas uiicxploiited. but sufficient has been at tained to show that trawling, if carried opt on proper lines, must be a commercial success in- Australia, even if the iisli is sold at popular prices and forwarded con siderable distance inland. ' QUARANTINE EXPANSION. The .Government sent '.'Dr.. Norris, the Director of Quarantine, abroad to report upon quarantine methods and equipment in other countries. ' The Dirootor, who was absent six ' months; has now submitted a report, and the Government is satisfied that large arid' careful expenditure is abso lutely necessary for the due protection of the Commonwealth (the cleanest country in the world as regards disease) 'from the pes tilences which are found in. every other con tinent, and- wliich threaten us more every #lay owing to our increasing intercourse and trade. Mr. Mathews: immigrants!, The' Treasurer: It mat bo mentioned that quarantinuble disease lias been brought to Australia with greater frequency during tho past twelve months than ever before. LIGHTING Tin: COAST. Tho coasts of South' Australia and Western Australia: have been visited/ arid reports are now being completed. The coast of Now South Wales and the western coast of Vic toria,. a total of about one thousand miles' remain to' be inspected. . ' . ' CUSTOMS AND EXCISE REVENUE The following- statement shows the cost of collection per ceut/l of the -Customs anil Excise- revenue of- the Commonwealth for 1909-1910/ 1910-11, 1911-12, and estimate for 1012-13:— 1909-1910, £2 6/5; 1010-11, £2 ->/7- 1911-12. £1 18/; 1912-13, £1 19/11. The cost of working . .the department is less ' now ' than ;«t any other time since, federation. Member will be glad to know that the Minister of Customs is making provisions for agencies for oui produce, and the time is hot far. distant when the conflict between the representatives of- the States will cease. - ,' ' , ... V " NORTHERN TERRITORY INCREASES The principal positions ' on the admiaii'- trative staff of the Northern Territory have been filled, unci. ah examination is being made of areas which it is proposed to make available for settlers. A separate provision has. been in.'ule for .the office of judge, as it is considered that the posi- tions of . judge- and Government resident should lie separated.. Schools and agricul tural stations are being provided for the natives, wlio number about '20/(00. Pro gress is being made' with demonstration farms, and. it .is proposed -to appoint Van entomologist, in order 'to dcal- with insect Eests, A director of mines and geologist as been appointed. Provision is made for the erection . of - houses for Government' employes. It is' proposed to purchase two steamers, one to maintain communication' along 4>he coast and . the other to act as auxiliary vessel for fiver work; '£2500 is provided towards cost. -The vote for ad vancement of the study o< \- tropical diseases has been increased from £1350 to £4000. PAPUAN GRANT INCREASED. . The vote for administration of Papua has been increased from £25.000 - to £30,000, as it is intended to establish a number of additional stations. The sum of £10,000' is provided towards the cost of a new Go vernment steamer, ' estimated at £25,000, tho present vessel having been purchased twenty-four years ago and being prac tically, worn out. Tiie- wireless station at Port .Moresby will probably bo finished within the next six weeks. .NEW WORKS EXPENDITURE. Now I come 'to the expenditure on new works, buildings;.. &c..; The total, expendi ture. , to tnc : 30th June was £14,100,754, and tile Commonwealth is to be congratulated; on having expended this money from re-: veftuc instead of having raised a public debt for the purpose. , 'Tiie Minister, for Home Affairs: That is financing. .-The Prime Minister: It will.be observed that the value of the property taken over from the States amounted to £9,591,588, so that the Commonwealth lias since ex pended one and a half times as much. It will also be noticed thut during the three years 1910-11, 1011-12 - nnd 1912-13 it is estimated -that £10,004,379 will be1 expend ed, whilst during the nine years ended 30th Jtiue, 1909, only £4,096,375 was spent. The total expenditure to date on new works, &c.;, including value of transferred' properties, is £23,692.342. , Sir John Forrest (AV.A.): You have not paid for them yet. The Prime Minister: The lioni member for Swan is quite right; but during the last three years we nave paid out of re venue over £10,000,000. The Minister for Home Affairs: And we have saved £400,000 on interest. ' . FEDERAL CAPITAL OUTLAY. Liist year £08,245 was expended on works connected with the Federal, capital. , This year £110,000 lias been provided for the construction of a railway from Queanbeyan to tho city site and for other preliminary works incidental to the building of the city. , COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED STOCK. In nccorduncc with, Hie Commonwealth In scribed Stock Act 1911, trust funds under the control of the Treasurer were invested' in stock on the 1st Aprii last, the neces sary authority having been granted by the Loan Act 1911. Funds were thus made available as follow:— . For construction of : nil way from .Kal- goorlie to Port Augusta .. .. .. .. £89,5-24 For purcliusc pt laud in London .. .. 400,0181 To redeem Treasury bills issued by tlic . Government of South' Australia- on he- count of flic Northern Territory .. 220,003 To |iny to the State of South Australia amount expended from , revenue to- . wards construction of railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. . .. .. 84,470 £700,000 ' THE PUBLIC DEBT. Tho public debt, of the Commonwealth amounted on 30th June to £0,371,847. -It consisted of the stock to which I have just referred, amounting, to £700,000; 'of. .the balance of loans raised in respect of the Northern Territory, taken over from the State aif South Australia, £3,431,836; and of the balance of loans raised in respect of the Port Augusta railway, taken over from tiie State of South Australia, £2,240,01 Of course, lion, members know that that money has not been expended by the Commonwealth. As regards the Commonwealth stock, pro-' vision has been made in the. estimates for! contribution to a sinking fund, .at the .rate! of 10/ per cent, jicr annum.. Provision hira also been made for similar contributions! to i sinking fund in connection with thoj loans taken oyer from South ' Australia 'In; terms of the Northern Territory Accept-' aneo Act. The rate payable in respect, oft these louns is the same as tiiat which the' State -had promised to pay. v I Mr. Harper (V.): How is the sinking fund to be invested? The Prinie Minister: As we have done in the past, the best way we can, (Hear hear.) ' ' ' TRANSFERRED PROPERTIES. Last year £673,600' was voted by Parlia- mcnt for interest at 3 per cent, anil sinking fund at j per cent, on the value of pro: perties transferred from the States to the Commonwealth, the interest being calcu- Iti&od; from the 1st July, 11)10. The amount of £570,005, being interest at 3 per cent; from that date, was paid to the States. No payment was made, however,, to sink ing, fund, as I propose, subject to the ap proval of Parliament/to pay the States the full amount of 3J per cent, interest. (Hear, hear.) Provision lias been made in the pre- sent estimates accordingly. VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT PRINTER An inquiry into the methods pcrsued by the State dopartriicnt of tho Government Printer linving been instituted by the Pre' micr of Victoria, I imve made the sugges tion that, considering the interest which the Commonwealth Government lias in the working of. the office, an expert appointed by it should he associated with the gentle- man appointed to conduct -the inquiry on behalf of the State. (Hear, hear,). I think that generally speaking the arrange ment made with the Government of Vic toria was a good one, hut there is no doubt that it is very difficult to work such nii establishment, in which part of the ma chinery and type is owned'- by the Com- mbnwealth nnd part by the State, in such a manner as to be fair to both. COMMONWEALTH BANK PROGRESS. The Commonwealth Bank was opened for business on 15th July, the act commencing on that date by proclamation. I am happy to say that the bank has made a satisfac tory- commencement. (Hear, hear.) Ac counts to -the number of 2760 have been opened in. the Savings branch, the amount of deposits being £09,697. There have been 117 withdrawals, amounting to £808. The Minister for Home . Affairs: The figures, are for one State only. LAND TAX.. Tiie Prinie Minister: The land tax, .whilst making a substantial contribution to revenue,, has operated beneficially in induc ing some owners to subdivide tlieir large estates— (Hear, hear)— providing homes for more settlers, and adding to the pro ductiveness of the land. (Hear, hear ) . OLD AGE PENSIONS. On 30th June, 1912, there were 79,071 old age pensioners, being an increase of 3569 in the twelve months. This increase can not be considered large, because the num ber of persons wlio are qualified by age to receive old age pensions, but who do not draw old age pensions, iH greut. There are at. present about 195,000 men in the Com monwealth over the age of 65 years, and about 140,000 women over the age of 60 years. .Men and women together who are qualified by ago number 245,000. Of theie, 79.000 are pensioners, and 166.000 are not pensioners. A ' considerable number would lie debarred .from obtaining pensions through their having property or income in excess of ' tlmt allowed liy the act, or 'through being aliens', ic., but it is certain that the number wlio, from independence of spirit or from sentiment, refrain from claiming old age pensions is large. . From these persons a regular, increase in the pen sion list may be expected,; because reluct ance to decent old age pensions is gradually becoming- less. (Hear, hour.) This is-in-' evitablc in a system which recognises that pensions are a right and not a charity. (Ministerial flieers.) , Oil the whole, it 'is thought that the' increase of 3569 old age pensioners in the year is only a noiriial one. INVALID PENSIONS. ... On 39th .Tune lust the number of invalid pensioners was 10,703, being an increase ol '3312 on the figures for the previous year.; It may be antieipatd that the increase in futuvp'years will not .be. so great, because at. the 30th June, 1911, invalid pensions had bqen. payable by the Commonwealth for d period of six months only, and the first rush of pensioners to take advantage of the act had net ceased on that- date; The ex penditure on old age. and invalid pensions m the yenr just closed : amounted to £2,1-18,034, compared with £1,868,648 in the previous year. These figures. : however, do not represent' the true position, because the pension list wiis- being added to con siderably during each year. The proper comparison is on .the annual rate pavuble "li the last day of each financial year. On oOtli. June, 10,11.' the rinmtal 'rate of par moist was .(.'2,054.361, ; Oh 30th June, 1912, ;t . was £2.224.060 approximately,- being- an 'increase Of '/£I69,702 in the - year. -- - : u WJ DEN ING. ' THE : .SYSTEM. Tlso amount actually, 'payablii' to old'agn and invalid pensioners in 1912-13 is esti mated at £2,405,000. This includes pro vision for increased .payments which will result if Parliament passes a bill (to be shortly- submitted) for - the purpose of granting pensions to persons who are at. present disqualified ' by the ownership of, homes. (Glieers.) - The cost of adminis tration of invalid and old age nensions dur ing mn-12 was £41,794, . hoing at the rate of £1 18/10 for every £100 of pensions paid. The cost' of administration in 1912-13 is estimated at £45,715, or £1 18/ for every £100 of pensions paid. .The low cost of Commonwealth administration as compared with that of New South Wales in the last year of the. State systrim, viz., £4 3/6 per £160 pensions paid, is largely- accounted for by the fact -that pensions in Now South Wales were paid by the bank, which received £2 for every £100 of pen-: Bions paid. Under the Commonwealth an' improved method of payment and account ing lias been established, and the work; of puym'cnt costs 12/0 for every.' £100 of pensions paid. (Hear, hear.) MATERNITY ALLOWANCE COST. A sum of £4(10,000 has been included in the estimates for maternity allowances. (Cheers.) A bill will shbrtly be introduced for the purpose of making these grants. I feel confident that a wise step is. being taken in' initiating this policy. The pre tention of the mother nnd the safety of the eliild arc so' important to the community and' so humanitarian that I feel sure that, although tho administration will not he free from difficulties/suffering will be re lieved, health promoted and valuable lives saved to tho Commonwealth. (Loud cheers.) Mr.- Deakin (V.): Is the payment to be mndc in a lump sum iit one time, as has been suggested? ' The I'rimc Minister: No bill lias vet been prepared, but tlicGovcrnmont's policy is to make the fnotlicr the recipient of the payment, and provision will be made that the expense of administration lie 'practi cally nil. There is to be no waste of money in the transmission ,of the allowance to the people whom wo desiro to aid. (ITcar, hear.) , AUSTRALIAN . NOTES SYSTEM. The Amending Notes Act of 1911 took . effect on 1st July. 1912, and until that date the Treasurer was required to keep in . gold coin one- fourth of the amount up to £7,000,000, and pound for -pound above £7,000,000. At 30th June the circulation' stood at £9,485,943, and the gold in tho Treasury amounted to £4,279,007,. being £43,004 above the amount then legally required. In all the . Treasury, .has invested out of the notes fund the amount of £5,685,000, and the annual umoiint- of interest at present being .earned is £190,300. The interest earned by .the notes investments is credited t.i the Australian Notes Account, so that the notes fiind is accumulating by com pound interest. (Hear, hear.) Up to 29th July the Treasury, had received in terest amounting to' £188,594, and the ex penses amounted to £31,714, leaving £156,880 as the net addition to the notes account. On -Monday last the circulation was £9,389,599, and the gold held . in the Treasury against that circulation wus £3, 842,663, being 40.92 per cent, of -the circulation, and 15.02 per cent, more than tiie legal reserve. An expert steel plate note printer has been appointed, and will leave London for Australia in, a day or two. COMMONWEALTH INVESTMENTS. At present the Treasury is earning interest on £7,40S,577, being £5,685,000 on account of the notes fund and £1,723,577 on ac count of general trrist funds. The total annual rate of interest is £252,124. .(Hear, near.) The Minister for Home Affairs: They never had that before Labor was in power. (Hear, hear.) : Mr. Harper: Where is the £1,723,577 in vested? The l'rimo Minister: Some in Australia and some in London. Whenever we have a balance in London we ask the High Com missioner to invest on short date. Mr. Harper: You have not over a million invested in London? The Prime Minister: No! No! Mr. Cook (N.SAV.): You have gone into the money lending business, eh? (Laughter.) t . . .. The Prime Minister: This is the only Government which. 1ms had a little money to lend. (Loud, Labor cheers.) In passing I would like to say that- the lion, member '(Mr. Harper) in it .speech said I should not hnvo qilenty of money to lend, or lend it to tiie States, as I was strengthening the Hatter's position with: regard to State debts. "Ttekc'a- different view. (Hear,- hear.) ' Sir John Forrest:' The £5,000,000 you linve lent you owe'. , ' ' The Prime Minister: Yes, we owe it: but lit was brought voluntarily to us. (Hear, hear.) The repayment of the loans in Lon don is guaranteed by the Bank of .England, which receives a commission on the interest earned. The Commonwealth revenue bene fited last year, by £18,251 of interest .earned in London. .. RAILWAY MILEAGE.

Commonwealth Government has agreed with South Australia and Western Australia as to the Crown lands to be granted for the purpose ' of .-the railway, although a formal agreement, litis i\ot yet been signed. A deviation lis proceeding which will have the effect of shortening the line at the Kalgoorlic end,, nnd. if successful, will have the effect of bring ing the depot- for materials closer into Kal- goorlie than .jf situated .at Kurramia. It is expected that this matter, will be deter mined in. the course of 'a few days. In South Australia, at the Port Augusta end, stcp3 arc being taken to secure the private land required within the township of Port Augusta, "and from SO to 100 men will shortly bo employed on the earth works. Arrangements are being made for rails and sleepers for temporary purposes at each end- of the line, and tenders have been received for rails and sleepers for the main line. As soon as a sufficient nuan- tity has been delivered; a start will be made to push on with tho earth works and permanent way. The money required for the present financial year is estimated to be £1,000,000. The 'Government, in co.. operation with the Government of South Australia, has already agreed to have the first sod of -the railway at Port. Augusta turned bv the Governor-General on Satur day. 14th September. Mr. Greene (N.S.W.): Will that date not clash with the agricultural show? The Prime Minister: I can only say .that the State Government has entirely con curred in - the date. In order to finan cially assist Tasmania, it is my intention to ask for a grant of £500,000, spread over ten years, and tiie first instalment of £05,000 is provided for in these estimates. (Hear, hear.) BRITISH SCIENTISTS' VISIT.. A matter .in which both parties concur is the projected visit to Australia in 1914 of the British Association for the Advance ment of Science. Since our invitation was accepted by' that body many more mem bers than we expected have intimated their, desiye to visit Australia. This will mean an -.increase in the amount of money, that we propose to give towards the expenses of the visit. No grentor compliment could be paid to Australia than that the invitation should he so largely taken up. It is the usual custom for any country tiiat the asso ciation is visiting to send a representative scientist to Britain to get into communica tion wth the. members about a year before! tin! meeting takes place. Wc propose to/ .follow the usual practice in this miittcr. FEDERATION AND PROSPERITY; i Members have been interested in the finan cial,. Industrial and commercial' progress of. the Commonwealth since federation: In my opinion all the evidence before us indi cates a continuance of progress and 'pros-, poritly equal to anything that has preceded j t. ( H ear, hear. ) Federation, : bv break ing down the barriers between the ..States,' and 1 between the mainland and Tasmania, lias helped greatly towards- that increased prosperity. There arc still barriers to be wiped away. (Applause.) In my opinion the- constitution is not carried out literally in trade . and commercial ' intercourse be tween" all the peoples of the . Comihoh- 'wcttlth. Laws are applied by one Parlia ment and not by another. The difference in railway gauges is a- barrier tlmt ought not to prevail.- ' . INTER-STATE COMMISSION. Tim ,H(>.nie remark applies to the trouble over the navigable rivet.. There, is, onlv . one authority in Australia, that can dciil properly with ' that, question— the. Common. wOnlth.v/; (Applause. 1 Tn: that' connection it. wi 1 be well for its to seriously consider whether the' time has hot arrived - -'and. it! opportune— when the Inter-State Contfni siou provided for in the constitution ought nor ro be grafted in rue system; that is to say, a body with powers of direction' and advice. Such a change would/ 1 think, be very, beneficial. The matter, was con sidered in the first Parliament, and many of my colleagues took the same view that.' I did. I shall have sometlring . to say" later regarding the maternity allowance. Mr. Archihald (K.A.) : Have yoh any figures showing tlic proportion«.of wealth In Australia? The Prime Minister: Unfortunately n#, but I. believe that we „re better off in that; respect than was the case a few years ago. AUSTRALIAN SHIPS AND SOUTH AFRICA. Members' will lie pleased that, on lichalf of. the Government, I communicated with the Prime Minister of South Africa and inti mated: that as thrf Australian war ships would 'probably he sailing for Australia , early next year lie . might think' it wise to receive - them and give ail entertainment. He bus replied that his Government will be. de lighted to receive tlic ships , nnd extend cordial. Hospitality to the men. We are, therefore, in the happy position thut the ships will receive their first welcome in these seas from our kinsmen in South Africa-. . When t visited South Africa at the opening of the Union Parliament,'! offered a hearty invitation to the Prime Minister and his colleagues to visit the Commonwealth. The. Prime Minister pro mised to visit the Commonwealth, but 'lib health intervened. I am liopclul .that be fore long he . will be able to accept tliut invitation. RECIPROCITY WITH NEW ZEALAND. I. come now to the important question of reciprocity between Australia and her nearest Dominion, Ncjv Zealand. . For some time I have -been in communication; pri vately and informally, with the leading men in New Zealand, and have made cer tain suggestions regarding reciprocal rela tions between these Dominions.' I am hope-' fill' -that in a short time there will be reciprocity in the, matter of old age pen sions/ -I am . hopeful tlmt much broader reciprocity will be established in trade lines. My opinion is known to all the people of the country. ' There is 110. limit to the reciprocity I believe in as between Australia and New Zealand. The Cunadian Minister (Mr. Borden) pro mised that he would, if opportunity offered; come to Australia to discuss the matter of pension reciprocity with the Australian Minister of Trade and Customs. (Hear, hear.): . THE TIE WITH GREAT BRITAIN. I bring my remarks to a close by remind ing htm.' members that recently we had amongst us a very distinguished, statesman, Mr. Bryca. (Hear, Hear.) One of the remarks lie made at one of tlic public functions lie ondm'ed— (Laughter)— perhaps I may put it that way— (Laughter) — was that . the mother coiintry and the Domi nions had always been in this relation, that she took the hand- of the Dominions, and led and protected them until such time as they were strong enough to walk alone, and attend to their own' affairs. That simile was a delightful one, and true in effect, (Hear) hear). As hon. members know, 'a new situation has arisen in recent years. A time came when the mother country parted from the Dominions to the extent of saying, "Go and manage your af fairs in your own way." _ Five years ago, at the Conference in London, there was the suggestion that the Dominions should form nn association witli the mother coun try as equals 011c with one another, the mother country meeting the smallest Domi nion as an equal part of the Empire, and giving it the same rights as' she claimed herself. That principle is embodied in the constitution of Imperial Conferences now. (Hear, hear.) It is unknown in any other -system of Imperial government in the world. (Cheers.) The breadth ol that proposal and of that action knew 110 bounds whatever. (Hear, hear.) Where it would end 110 one could say. It was one of the wonders of the world that perfect confidence shown by the motherland lias' begot perfect confidence- ill the Dominions. (Loud' cheers.) I. believe the attachment is .closer and stronger because of thut freedom and equality than it otherwise could have, been. Therefore, while avc live apart and work apart in managing our own local af fairs, we are prepared to be associated to gether in protecting our respective places in the world. '.(Cheers.) Whatever' may be said, there is 110 country in the world that has greater freedom than our own iii managing our own affairs, unhampered by any Suggestion of coercion of' any' kind. We are glad as a Government' to liavo been associated with the establishment of nri Australian navy— (Hear, hear)— owned, managed and controlled by the Australian people; qiul at the same time glad to be associated with the mother country in ali that concerns her welfare, and in protect ing her against aggression from foreign parts. (Cheers.) ' Sir John Forres't: Hear, hear ! 1 think you had -better come over to this side ! (Laughter.) Mr. Deakin asked for the adjournment of the debate. He complimented the Trca- surer 011 the fulness of the information given, and also on the fact that he now. recognised the possible advantages of an Inter- State Commission. As recently as. last year Mr. Fisher had remarked, in repiy to him (Mr. Deakin):. — "The appointment of an Inter-State Commission is not a question of sufficient urgency to call for serious comment." Tiie lion, gentleman had realised apparently that in this Inter- State Commission a Government possessed, ' several invaluable keys to locks that it was desirable to open. The important nature of tiie budget proposals neeositatcd the adjournment of the debate. The Prime Minister. Until Wednesday ? Mr, Deakin: Wednesday, if you like. The debate was adjourned accordingly.
