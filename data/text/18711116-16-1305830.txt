mu PUBLISHED DAILY. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1871. The debate on the Address was concluded on Tuesday night, according to promise, and, judging from the speeches delivered, the way ought to be now clear for real business The Opposition had most of the talking, but the members on both sides who took an active part in the discussion seemed to have come to the resolution of " making a clean breast of it and did so It has been a long time since so many personal gi new areas have had to be brought for all ii and discussed in the House, to say nothing of the long arrears of public ones that had also to be balanced When at length Mt Pu Min was compelled to do penance for his conduct at Rockhampton, it seemed to be the general opinion of hon. members that the list was complete To be sure the member for Warwick had a small account to settle with the member for Eastern Downs, but it was somersault and so purely personal to the two gentle men and nobody else-that everybody grew restless before it was ended "With the exception of wiping off old scores and affording hon. members the opportunity of putting themselves light with the House and the public outside, the debate might as well have ended the first night. Two Ministers (for Mr Kamsu may fairly be counted one have since made long speeches , but have thrown no new light on the course the Government intend to pursue and the members of the Opposition who have since spoken on the subject of the "Nice legal Speech have only amplified portions of the speeches of Mr Lu 11 \ and Mr King No new ground has been taken up, and very little, if any new light his been thrown upon the general questions at issue But if the debate has really been, as the public outside sincerely hope it his, a dealing off of old scores and preparing the way) for actual business, then the time occupied by it has not been wasted The Opposition have so far fulfilled the pledges, and made it as clear as possible to the Ministry and their supporters under what conditions they are prepared to proceed with the business of the country. The conditions appear moderate and reasonable enough, such as a minority, under the circumstances, mo justified in asking, and such as a Ministry like the present one might accede to without the sacrifice of any political principles they have openly professed or any loss of dignity or prestige they may possess the questions at issue, for this session of an) i Uc, have been narrowed down to a "single point namely), the passing of an Additional "Members Bill, which will give mucked lqicbintation to the districts that lupins it most, approved by the census just taken in this is done. the opposition will not be justified in obstructing ne it lie l do we believe they will attempt to obstruct -the ] itblie 1 usines-, li it is n I dont, and the Ministry by virtue of their union!), attain) t to a trip) every thing with a high is mil may compel the O] p sition to utieoiiilition illy accept any me out of the land that may be brought forward (us from the present temper is, the Ministry and their supporters seem intend to do then the deadlock will most assuredly be resumed, Mr. Palmer will have ample opportunity of carrying out his threat of another long adjournment, and the Opposi- tion will have the sympathy and support of a large majority of the people of the colony, although the present Electoral Act does not admit of their making their influence felt inside the Legislative Assembly. Nor will a long adjournment mend matters. On the contrary, it will be much more likely to em- bitter the strife. The Premier is scarcely likely to obtain a third dissolution, and if he did, the matter would in no respect be mended, as the same Opposition members would be returned for the large constituencies, and the Ministry have already secured all the small ones. The Hon. Minister for Works does sometimes give sensible advice to others. His concluding words to the Opposition on Tuesday night were particularly good, but just at the present time the Ministry and their supporters seem to stand in need of that advice rather more than the Opposition even. It is quite true that the minority ought to be conciliatory towards the majority, providing the latter do not insist upon having too much conceded to them ; but it is also true that the majority, under present circumstances, should not be imperious, overbearing, and determined to show their strength too much. No honest politician will concede an important principle, no real representative of the people will allow a class, even though it possess political power and a majority, to use such power for its own interests, when they are opposed to every other interest in the colony. If he is asked to do so, opposition to the very utmost extent that the forms of the House permit is then not only justifiable but it becomes his duty. It is for the majority to concede the reasonable requests of the minority, otherwise representative Government is a mere mockery. The question remaining to be solved is, Are the majority in the Assembly willing to admit this, and act upon it in the matter of the proposed Additional Members Bill ? It would be manifestly unfair to say they are not until the Bill is before the House ; but at the same time the probability of their doing so is fair subject for comment. " Straws show which way the wind blows," and from incidental remarks of Ministers and their supporters, and the plainer statements of newspapers that are most devoted to the Ministry, there is little hope of their making or permitting the promised Bill to be made acceptable to the Opposition and the country. Unless the Bill gives additional members where the census shows they are most required in other words unless it is framed upon a population basis it clearly will not be acceptable. The colony has quite enough and more than enough of Mitchell and Warrego electorates, where, for lack of men, sheep and cattle are represented. This kind of property, like all other kinds, is sufficiently represented where there are people. It is the people themselves who require to be represented and legislated for in Parliament, otherwise there would be no necessity for a Parliament at all. Yet we have one member after another on he Ministerial side of the House expressing J disapproval of a population basis, from one alleged reason or other The latest and most 'xtraouhnaiy reason was that given by Mr. Ramsay on Tuesday night namely), that the population was not a) s changing as though persons who moved for one put of the colony to another ought therefore to b jepiactically if not actually disfranchised. d Buchan argument would be a valued one in proof of the necessity, in a young and growing colony like this, for frequent in- t adjustment of the representation, but it 1 proves nothing at all against taking popula a lion as the basis of representation But this gentleman weakens his argument still further by saying he is in favor of taking the adult miles merely as a basis of representation This would of course include shepherds, stockmen, shearers, and ยก other station hands the most high story of all the population in the colony, and that portion which really has least interest in its good government While those men ought not to be debarred from exercising their political rights, the men settled on the land and having wives and children to support, are much more worthy of consultation But the most rabid) Ministeualoigans are much more outspoken, whether from in spiration received from head quarters but we cannot say) The last line of the Rock hampton Bulletin to hand contains a leading article on the subject, and the writer stakes out in the following style - The Liberal members have sensibly determined not to the on the foot of the House in t at present An sure that the Government mo invincible for the time being, and that they are fully prepared to introduce an Additional Representation Bill, the Opposition have concluded that discretion is the better part of valor.

has the following sensible re- marks -"The Police Magistrate, yesterday, adjudicating in company with Mr Southerner, upon a case of absconding from hired service, made a somewhat singular assertion that no person had a legal right to hire a servant without a proper discharge from his former employer If this be the law, and Mr Faircloth is in a position which ought to imply a knowledge of the law on his part, it is not at all generally known, nor would it be easy to enforce We think, however, taking all things into consideration, that a digest of the laws of Queensland, edited by our much respected Police Magistrate would be useful to this community, and would afford some instructive, at all ei cuts some novel reading While on this subject, we would wish to suggest that if copies of the Masters and Servants Act in the English, German, and Dim h languages were supplied to the immigration depot s, they might save a great deal of expense to the country A book printed in the Danish lan Range could be read by all the Scandinavian immigrants, and these, with the German and English, compose the bulk of our new arrivals The foreigners, at all events can all read and if they can be made to understand clearly the position, would not give so much trouble " THE Wide Bay) at d Burnett News of the 11th, says " One of the largest cattle stations in this district Widgee Widgee has lately changed hands, and the muster for delivery which was to have taken place some time ago but which was delayed by the drought, has now commenced There are 2 000 head of cattle on the run, and it is expected that the mustering will take nearly three months. It is understood that the price was 50s per head, with the usual proportion of call as given in lins price more particularly as it is said to be a cash transaction, must be considered a very fair one and shows that the coast country in this part of Queen land is highly thought of for cattle The vendors of mau) stations which have been sold in this district have pocketed the money, and at once left the country, but the considerable sum which Messrs Tooth and Cran will receive on this sale will probably be located in the development of local industries which have already very considerably benefited the Wide Bay district "A
