The report of the Police Commission upon the charges preferred against Supertntendont ?»Vinca ana Sab-inspoctor Lamer, of the Metropolitan police, has been presented to His Excellency the Governor It is a length/ argumentative document, and throughout ia hostile to the officers, matters referred to in evidence and otherB founded upon inferonco being used against Mr Winch Seven charges were preferred against him, principally of having borrowed money from publicans and of having been found in a notorious boase under suBpiciouB circumstances Mr Lamers case included specific chargea of having borrowed money from publicans and mem bers of the force, winch he admitted, but urged in extenuation that he had been Bubjected to great expense in consequence of Ina promotion, and that he had never allowed his transactions with publicans to in Huerico lum in the discharge of tua official dutieB The commission state that bavinL, carefully considered the evi dence, they are of opinion that it is not de-îir able, in the interests of the public service that Superintendent Vi inch and hub inspector Lamer should be permitted to return to duty and they recommend that thoao officers lie called on to retire from the force without rrejudice to any claims for a superannuation [illowunce or compensation to whie,h, by teoso« of their service, they may have become entitled It was known before the report was published that Mr Winch intended apply nig for a board to deal sith the charged against him, under the Police Reflations Siatuie, as he was dissatisfied with the manner in which ho had been treated by the commission W hen th« roport was re ceived by the Chief Secretan, ho called upon the oDicera to make any Btate nients they might think necesBary ihey accordingly submitted commenta upon the finding Mr Winch, referring to the only charlo which ho admits namely of havirg borrowed money from Mr Kdwarda, of the Old Vi bite Hart Hotel, wrote as follows \- ' I did not consider I was incurring any obligation to Mr Kdwarda as the licensee of an hotel, but that the emull transactions < between us were those of two very old friends, involving neither a breach of the regulations nor any personal impropriety All the other charges he demea and, speaking (.enerally on the report saya - 1 Insinuations aro made and inferences drawn in the most general and partial

that a service of upwards of oO years will not be rewarded by a con demnation founded on hearsay und irregular evidence implied insinuations, and im proper inferences Mr Lamer says - Whilst admitting borrowing money from five persons, as stated by me before the commission I deny that I thereby or otherwise have been guilty of any breach of duty or of any conduct rendering it unlit that I should remain in the police force , and I proteBt there is nothing whate/er to justify the commission in practically branding me a dishonourable man Each officer having applied for a board, this will be appointed at an early date In the meantime the com mission has adjourned GOLD AND GOLDFIELDS The mining industry is in a prosperous state on many of the leading goldfields and more especially in the Sandhurst and Crea wick districts The quartz mines of Sand burst are now yielding higher returns than for many years past The yield for the week ending 14th inst was 5 000.07 , and judging from the present prospects of the district there is every probability that still larger returns will be obtained The deep alluv al mines in tbe Creswick: district continue to improve on their past satisfactory Btate I or the week ending on the 21st mat Beven of the leadme, mines there returned no less than 2 J20O7 , of which the Iliaton ivas credited with G21o¿ , the Madame Berry, 5G3c/ , the ¡New

Las been discovered in Mr Lanaell a No 180 mine at Sandhurst at a depth of 1700ft The finding of payable quart/ at such a depth on Sandhurst would be coiiai dercd equal to the discovery of a now gold field as other companies winch have hitherto found gold in their mines to various depths up to 1,200ft may, if the report is correct, naturally expect to obtain it at lower depths, and the attention of the Minister of Mines has therefore been drawn to the rumoured find in Ivo 180 That mine ia leased from the Crown and it ia thought by BOLUC person3 that tho Mining department ou"ht to cull upon Mr Dyason, the agent of Mr Lansell, lo Btato whether gold has actually been ":>t in the quart? at the depth named Mr Dyason baa been requeäted by the depart ment to furnish the desired information, but there are doubts as to whether he can bo compelled under the mining laws aud regu lationB of the colony to do BO AGRICULTURE W e are at length enabled to give a more satisfactory account of the condition of the crops Bains for some time past have füllen only in tantuliaint, quantity, and in all the corly districts the wheat and oats were in a most critical condition In certain parts the cropB had been given over to the Btock, and these, of course, are past recovery Butraiua have now fallon so generally, and in BUuh ample quantity as to remove all present anxiety for thoao cropa that were not abso- lutely gone In some districts hailstorms have occurred, dome, considerable damage to the cropB, and 111 others the rivers have been in Hood, but the benefita of the great change that haa occurred in tho character of the sea=on will fur outweigh the lo&seB; The fall has extended also to New South Wales and Queensland, or rather it lins come thence southward to Vic tona and South Australia It may be hoped that it has come Boon enough to prevent the marketing of stock from runs in lav erina that were sufi"enn" the efïecta of drought Although the temperature has fallen coiiai derably and li(,ht frosts have been eipe rienced, there ia sufficient heat in the aoil to carry on the grasses, and îuduco a lair growth of 1 asturage Some little damage baa been BUBtained by viue=, but ita extent is not largo enough to alîect the yield THE WE AT EL R The prevalence of dry weather for some weeltB paBt, coupled with the rainfall for the year having been very much below the average, had rendered the prospects of tho coming harvest very doubtful From the northern and north western districts tho re ports of the state of the crops were very dis heartening, and throughout

and lasted with some inter, missions until luesday, doing an incalculable amount of good, both to the agricultural aud pastoral înfrests The chance in the weather was moat welcome, and except in thofie districts where the continuance of dry weather had already injured the crops bey ond redemption haa completely altered the pros pects of the coming harvest The rainfall has been heavier in the

She got off again, but soon after it was found that she was leaking, and all hands were engaged at the pumps throughout the night. After she had been firing rockets for an hour the steamers Dairymaid and Civility went to her assistance. The Civility took off about 150 passengers, and the two steamers then piloted her into Botany Bay, where she was beached near the telegraph station, in 18ft of water at high tide. The passengers were transferred back to the Northampton, and were safely taken to Sydney on the Saturday afternoon in the steamer Captain Cook. The scene among the passengers during the early hours of Saturday morning was very exciting. The men, women, and children crowded the decks and cabins, crying, shouting, and impeding the operations of the officers and crew, notwithstanding the repeated assurance that there was no immediate danger. As soon as the steamers came alongside there was a frantic rush to get on board them, but fortu- nately there were no lives lost. One of the immigrants broke his leg in jumping on to a block of wood on the steamer At low water Ihe Northampton lies with about half her length on the sand, with 8ft of water in the hold, and unless the wind changes no further damage is apprehended. The vessel was under the command of Captain Clare, who is not cer- tain as to the place where the vessel struck, but thinks it was on a rocky point a little north of Botany Bay, and he accounts for being in that position by the strong southerly current running along the coast, and a dense fog which prevented the land from being aeon until they were too close in. Captain Clare knows the coast very well, having visited Sydney as far back as 1854, and having in recent years made five consecutive voyages to Sydney in the Northampton. The Northamp- ton bumped heavily on Sunday night, and was shifted several feet nearer to the shore; but the change in her position would not materially interfere with her safety. Divers have been busily engaged repairing the gap in her bottom, so as to ensure her safety whilst being towed to Sydney. The extension of the Great Western rail- way from Dubbo to Nevertire, a distance of 65 miles, was opened on the 28th inst.

A cable meBBage from our correspondent in London Btates that some anxiety ii felt in city circles as to the Victorian loan of £4 000 000, on account of the high price and ita not being inscribed stock On communi- cating with the Treasurer, we learn that no minimum has yet been fixed, and the reference to the high price is therefore not altogether intelligible In the usual course, the ogent generai and the associated banks in London will confer aB to the minimum and afterwards obtain the approval of the lreasurer by cable The minimum will not bo fixed until it becomes necesBary to advertiBe the loan in London 'Ihe Government about a fortnight ago received a somewhat Bimilar mesaage, and they attribute the stir which baa taken place in London to an attempt on the part of Bpeculutora to depress the market in the hope of profiting by the nae that might bs expected to follow The fall of 2 per cent in Victorian four per cents which hoi taken place during the laat month ia attributed by the Government to the gama influencée In the meBBage we published on tho 19th inst this stock was quoted at 101 whilst on September 27 it was at 103 Since we laat wroto buaineaa generally has been of an unusually quiet and unimportant character, there being only two or thro» tranaactiona of any special interest The) opening sale of the Melbourne wool season was held on Wednesday, the 18th mat, and Bince then salea have been held almost daily, lo date five sales have been held at Mel- bourne and four at Geelong, at which a total of G.729 bales have been offered and 5,449 Eold The attendance of buyers haa boon very numerous, ond competition has been keen 1 ho Balea, however, have hardly been representativo enough to enable us to speak with confidence of the new clip, hut wo may say that of the wools already catalogued thoa* from BOuthemRivenna show the eftectaof the Bevere season suffered recently As a rule, this year s clip is lighter in condition than last years, but not so well grown, and has a tendency to unBOundueBS in staple To day several choice Western district clipa of cross- bred and merino wool were offered, and sold well In theae wools there is very little difterence between this year a clip and that o£ lost year, and those eold to day were gene- ral!) well grown and quite sound in staple. LaBt year a wool shipments from the four colonieB, Victoria, New South Walea, South AuBtraho, and Queensland, show an lncreos» from October 1 to September 30 over those of the previous year of about ¿3,000 bales, a total of 792 G05 having been reached in the year end lDt, September 30 last Ibis increaso may bs accounted for by an increase in the produc- tion of Queensland wool by the growing ten- dency to ship wool in the grcas», and by the fact that some 14 000 more bales of the new clip have been shipped prior to September 30. The shipments of wool from Victoria from July 1 to the 17th inst amount to 25,053 bales against 11 741 bales shipped during tho carne period last year The clip ia now arriving more freely, and the solea during the coming fortnight will probably bo very large The recent break in tho weather baa been a aonrce of great relief to all thoee interested in agricultural mattera and to traders also, as a bad season indirectly bffects business generally, and prevents any speculative or large buBineeB being entered upon, and also prevents any active demand from tho country Nothing has occurred to shako confidence or to cauBo any anxiety Bince the last mail left Ales and stouts ara coming into notice, and some good parcels ara being taken up to meet the summer demand, which IB now setting in. Jute goods havo not bad much attention, but this no doubt waa duo to tho uncertainty of the prospecta of the crops, which are now more assured, and prices are in consequenco firmer Candles, owing to lighter Bbipments coming forward, have been m moro renuest, and prices arc a shado better 1 runs have been in moderate request, but little has been done except in supplying ordinary trade re- quirements Tho rain, which has been teneial throughout the colony, has been most beneficial to the crops, although in eorno fpw districts it haa arrived almost loo late But, as a rulo, the crops for the present aro secured, and unless something unforeseen and unexpected Should happen, a very fair harvest ia anticipated Bread stuffs continue slow of Bale, and it ia difficult to get rid of anything Ilka a hue unless at a considerable con- cession on prices lately obtained, Hour ia only moving in email parcela at declining rates Tor wheat there ia a moderate de- mand, but nullera will not pay tbo prices asked by holdere A few emull lines have been placed dunng the past fortnight at slightly easier rates.

Tor feeding grains there is hardly so Btrong an inquiry BB haB been experienced of late. 1 he rain no doubt has diBpelled the fears of the entire failure of the first crop of oats, and the prices now depend moro on the quantity in hand to supply iramediato requirements than the quantity of the new crop to come forward at a future date.
