' DANISH CHURCH. A large number of Scandinavians, to- gether with their Australian friends, as- sembled on Wednesday night in the beautifully-decorated room, of the Danish Church, in George-street, to commemor- ate the 47th anniversary of the Danish Lutheran Church on Queensland. When speaking on the annual report the Rev. P C Ligaard said the preceding year had been very progressive and successful as regards the various branches of the church work. The rather strenuous time Queenslanders had gone through lately, however, was reflected in the balance sheets, and he regretted that the work in Queensland still had to lely to a large extent upon the support from the mother church in Denmark. Apart from the purely 'spiritual work ' the church had en- gaged in several social activeties, and seamen and immigrants from the Scandi- navian countries always found a helping hand stretched out to welcome them on their arrival in Queensland. Taking into consideration that the activity of the church had been extended to various centres outside Brisbane, he appealed for support from all Scandinavians in Queensland and other well-wishers. At the banquet the Danish Vice-Consul (Lieut-Col V. Larsen) was among the speaker who expressed then apprecia- tion of the untiring and unselfish efforts of both the Rev and Mrs P C Ligaaid to meet the spintual and material needs of their countrymen in this part of the world.
