To the Electors of Grenville. GENTLEMEN, - I have the honor to inform you that 1 purpose offering myself as a candidate for the representation in the Assembly of the County of Grenville. 1 have resided some ten years in this district, and although I have hitherto taken no active part in politics I have endeavored to make myself acquainted with the requirements of the country; and should it please the Elec- tors to return me, 1 may state that I have no other view in presenting myself for your suffrages than the honor of serving your in- terests in the Assembly. I am in favor of the following measures: - . Free trade. Abolitioi of export duty on gold. National education. Gradual abolition of State aid, Liberal land ¿ill. Colonial mint. Mining on private property. Colonial distillation. District Councils. Complete reform of mining registration. Abolition of the close monopoly enjoyed by the uurveyors under the present syBtem. Reduction of the present exorbitant rental of mining leases to £1 per acre. I hope to be able to meet you personally before the day of polling to give you a fuller expesition of my political opinions. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, GEORGE A. BROWN. [ADVERTISEMENT.] To the Electors of Ripon and Hampden. GENTLEMEN, - You are particularly requested to stand out against Jdr Ser dee and vote for Mr Campbell. There is no truth in Messrs Robertson, Ross, and M'Arthuc having joined Mr Service's Committee. Mr M'Arthur only pledged himself to support Mr Service on condition that his conduct in the late Assembly was correct, and that his views on the political questions which affect the welfare of this constituency and the country generally were the same as those of his constituency ; these were the remarks made as one of the meetings held at Bath's Hotel (by Mr M'Arthur) previous to the requisition being sent down. Well, when at Miner's Rest, Mr M'Arthur asked Mr Service how he voted on Mr Loader's immi- gration question, " he boggled at that;" after a little consideration he said he thought he voted against it, but after he saw it took well, he would support it. He got enlight- ened then, he had not the slightest idea that the people would aend for their brothers, sisters, or other relatives, when the question came before him at first, could any one desire a better syBtem, no, no person in this colony would pay five pounds sterling for bringing out a useless person of either sex. And surely Mr Service as a candid politician ought to know, that the greatest want in this country is population. We have all the elements of wealth in Victoria, except that. -Why should we import nine or ten millions worth of foreign manufactured articles simply because, the population is too small. Accordingly as population increases, will new branches of industry be entered into by tradesmen with capital, there will be plenty of employment for ah, and times will be better for bankers, lawyers, clergymen, physicians, merchants, ¿c., &c.; By this judicious system of assisted immigration, a change will take place gradually and in a regular way, which may for a short time ofiect the profits now made, by the import- ing merchants, but ultimately they will find, with a regular and steady increase of popula- tion-they will have to impart more in the shape of raw material. In conclusion, I must respectfully request the electors of Ripon and Hampden, to vote for a disin- terested candidate-who will advocate any measures brought forward by any ministry which will tend to relieve the colonists from this wretched state into which they have been driven by the factious opposition ex- hibited by our legislators, for the last four years. M r Campbell bas got good common sense, and honesty of purpose to act as your representative, his interest is more identical with your's than Mr Service's, the latter is an exchanger of foreign manufactured articles, and requires to employ very little labor hére, whereas the former is a producer, and conse- quently an employer uf labor the same as yourselves-therefore take no notice of the electioneering "dodges" tried, by Mr Ser- vice's friends, but be early at the poll on Monday, and vote for Campbell. _ABATOB.

SMITH intimates to the public that for this last nine years he has had the '[ largest practice and one of the most extensive in this colony. From every part of the colonies he is daily consulted, not only by those afflicted with the ordinary maladies incidental commonly to the human frame, ' and "to this colony in particular, but in all those diseases which have baffled the skill and -science of the most eminent surgeons and physicians of the day; the well-known name of Dr L. L. Smith, which has now become as familiar to the ears of the Sydney. Adelaide, and Victorian public, as household words, has naturally caused those suffering from these more serious diseases to consult him as a dernière resource. Dr L. L. Smith has thus gained not only a competency and independent position in this colony, but he j has also gained the nighest amount of prac tical and theoretical experience in his pro j fession. To THOSE RES Illino IN TSE BUSH., desirous of consulting and being under his IMMEDIATE TREATMENT, Dr L. L. Smith begs leave to state that he has for their convenience estab- lished one of our largest private institutions in the colony, namely : A LOCK HOSPITAL, And Hospital for Skin Diseases. This admirable institution combines within itself for the patient all the ADVANTAGES OF A HOHE, together with the GREATEST PRI- VACY and certainty of speedy cure. It has been well supported and patronised by the public for some four years, and that too at a time when, as is well known by all old colo- nists, every other institution of a similar character failed. - Indomitable perseverance, steady attention to his patients, together with the advantages of extraordinary expe- rience in his profession, and one of the largest medical libraries in the colony for reference, has been the sole secret of the success of this institution and its founder.

ROW'S EMBROCATION, OR FARMERS' FRIEND. I^HE old system of quackery, so long pur- sued in the attempted cure of the many ills to which horse flesh in particular is liable, has received its death blow since the Messrs J. & E. Bow gave the world their celebrated Embrocation. If the brute crea- tion were capable of speech, their recapitu- lation of the benefits they have received through the use of the Embrocation would supersede the necessity for any testimonials as to ita admirable curative properties. But the Messrs J. & E. Row are content to rest the value of their Embrocation upon the fact that it has an enormous daily increasing sale throughout the colonies. In all cases of sores, bruises, saddle, girth, and collar galls, cute, sprains, Ac, &c.;, &c.;, the Embrocation is a certain and infallible remedy. It first cleanses and induces healthy action, and then heals tile wounds. Sold in battles, 3s 6d each. To be had wholesale of the proprietors, J. & E.
