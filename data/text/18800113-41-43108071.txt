The special lines offered this week comprise the whole stock of GENTLEMEN'S STIFF FELT HATS in all qualities.

I am thankful to say that success has attended my efforts in business, and am led to believe I have given my customers satisfaction. Unfortunately my Furniture Show Rooms, although ? very spacious, are not situated in as prominent a position as I cculd wish, being off Leigh-street in those commodious Buildings knoztm as Peacock's Stores. I have heard many exclaim ' Dear me, I had no idea you had such a Monster Styk to choose fromF' Such is a fact. Any one paying these Show Rooms a visit will find, 'without exception^ He Best Assortment of Bedsteads, Children's Cots, Afattrrsses, Palliasses, Pillows, Chairs, Tables, tVashstands, Suites /or Dining and Drawing Room, Carpets, Rui;s, Floorcloths, Door mats, Meatsafes, &*c.t &v.;, in fact everything necessary to make a Home Comfortable ; and the Front Premises at the Corner of Leiqh and Hmdley Streets are filed -with an excellent assortment of Ironmongery, Cutlery, Crockeryware, Ckinaware, Earthenware, Fenders, Fireirons, Clocks, Vases, Lustres, Perambulators, &*c, &*c.; I may say every article required in a Home. All I ask is a fair trial. Every Article xs Warranted. Should anything purchased not give entire satisfaction it will be exchanged or the money returned. Goods delivered promptly, and free of charge, to any reasonable distance. Cash Customers -will be treated liberally ; whilst with Customers requiring extended Credit arrangements can be made.

Zz~ S'he company of a fellow who possesses a good vein of humorous pleasantry is invariably preferred to another who is morose and disagreeable — the presence of the one is acceptable because he endeavours to make everybody happy ; the visit of the other it undesirable because he is regarded as a bore. The same rule applies in exactly the same proportion in the purchase of Clothing. Take, for instance, the Glasgow House Clothing Depot, where there is a tremendous assortment to select from, with competent Salesmen, and there caa be no comparison with an Establishment where there is a miserable Stook and Assistants to correapond.
