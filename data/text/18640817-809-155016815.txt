RINGER'S MACHINES will sew tho finest CAMBRIC or heaviest BROADCLOTH and 11 intermediate textures with the same ease, rapidity, — urability of stitch, and beauty of finish. They f rill HEM, STITCH, FELL, and GATHER, and 1 0 a greatcrvariety of work than tho machines f any other manufacture. They are strong, durable, o nd simple in construction, and cannot be put out te f order except by gross carelessness or violent ai lisusnge. Prico, £12. di Particular attention is called to tho fact that, — 1 consequence of tho superior construction of ma hinery, the celebrated SHUTTLE STITCH of J 1INGER & CO.'S is vastly superior to the Shuttle pj ititch of any other manufacture. But especial at- m antion iB called to the more important fact that ilNGER'S MACHINES make the TRUE LOCK ITITCH, which is exactly alike on both sides of lie fabric, and ono that positively will not ravel ; liat they do not make a ridge on one sido of 110 material sewed, as do all CHAIN STITCH IACHINES ; that they do not use one-third as inch cotton or sewing material as do all CHAIN TITCH MACHINES ; that they will not ravel ?hen ono end of a seam is started, as will nil Chain titch seams. And further that Singer's Machines o not use a curved needle and circular motion, in the contrary SINGER'S NEEDLES are traight and the motion perpendicular, henco they 111 stitch through a very great thickness, and sow cross seams, which would prove instant destruction ) a curved or bent needle. For a confirmation of our assertions wo would 3speetfully refer to tho manufacturing establish tents of Messrs Sargood, King & Sargood, Mossrs [arris & Heymansen, Messrs Solcsberg & Son, ronster Clothing Compr.ny ; Mr Skinner's Crino no Manufactory, and to all other large manufac iring houses both in Victoria and the other Aus ?alinn colonies, and to the thousands of families ho have Singer's Machines in daily use.

As ?idence of tho fact, they were awarded tho prize old medal at the Great Exhibition 1862, and at the aris Exhibition 1801. These machines make the ght lock-stitch — the only only ono which cannot bo ivelied — with the rotating hook — a great iinprovo lent on the shuttle, as it is far more durable, and ot near so liablo to get out of order. Wheeler and Wilson's machines work equally ell upon silk, cotton, woollen, and linen goods, raiding, binding, cording, tucking, hemming, flll g, gathering, seaming, quilting, performing every lecies of sewing with a speed of from 1000 to !,000 stitches per minute ; makes a regular, strong nd beautiful stitch, exactly tho samo on both des of the fabric sowed; is simple in construction, isy in management, and elegant in appearance, t the present reduced prices there is no excuse for iving shuttle machines. Reference given to dress akers, tailors aud manufacturers of clothing who ive had tho machines in constant use for years. Show-rooms, 166 Bourke street east, up-stairs.
