Siberian Superstition. — Superstition and extreme conservatism on the part of any people are always ludicrous to those who are a few degrees ahead of them. Far mers will read with incredulity and amuse ment of the difficulty with which modern dairy methods were introduced into Siberia :— ' In the Altai region the super stitious peasantry spoke of separators as 'devils,' and laid upon them the blame for a famine that occurred, and lasted for three years. Towards the end of the third year the people attacked the creameries, owned principally by Danish immigrants, and when not driven oS with firearms, carried off the separators, whi b they threw into the nearest river. Un fortunately, this raid on the separators was followed by the end of the famine, and a harvest muchibetter than that of pre vious yaira. The coincidence confirmed the peasantry in their belief that the separators were of diabolical origin, aad strengthened their resolution to make an end of them. This lingulat belief has done much to retard the development of dairying in the Altai country.' Sprained Ankle, Stiff Neck, Lame Shoulder. — These are three common ailment's for which Chamberlain's Pain Balm is especially valuable. If promptly applied it will save you time, money, and suffering when troubled with any one of these ailments. For sale by B. F. John tone, Latrobe and Devonport ; A. J Collins and Co., Ulverstone; H.

Digest What Yon Eat.— The reason why any wholeaome food is not properly digested is because the stomach lacks some important element of digestion. Some stomachs lack peptone, others are deficient in gastric juice or hydrochloric icid. The one thing necessary in any case of poor digestion is to supply those digestive ele ments whioh the stomach lacks, and no thing does this so thoroughly and safely aa Dr Sheldon's Digestive Tabules. They digest what yon eat, thus giving the stomach a rest and assistance until it is restored to its normal action and vigor. For sale everywhere. L. E. O. Ready, Latrobe ; fi. G.
