Although the modern Materia Medica"" includes, many valuable remedies for human afflictions, it is a matter of certainty that in all cases where the animal vitality is failing,) PHOSPHORUS is decidedly superior to every other, remedy at present known. It will work effects, such as nothing else will produce, and it possesses the great advantage of not causing, when its use is relinquished, the slightest reaction or depression. Protected by Royal Letters Patent, Dated October 11th, 1869. UNDER DISTINGUISHED PATRONAGE. DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE. (OZONIO OXYGEN.) The New Curative Agent, and-only Reliable Remedy for Nervous and Liver Complaints. This Phosphatic combination is pronounced by the most eminent members of the Medical Profession to be unequalled for its power in replenishing the vitality of the body, by its supplying all the essential constituents of the blood and nerve substance, and for developing all the powers and functions of the system to the highest degree. It is agreeable to the palate, and innocent in its action, while retaining all its extraordinary properties and as a specific, surpassing all the known therapeutic agents of the present day for the speedy and permanent cure of Nervous Prostration Lassitude , Liver Complaints Shortness of Breath Palpitation of the Heart Trembling of the Hands Dizziness and Limbs Noises in the Head and Ears Impaired Nutrition Loss of Energy and Appetite Mental and Physical De Hypochondria pression , Female Complaints Consumption (in its first General Debility stages only) Indigestion Timidity Flatulence [ness Eruptions of the Skin i incapacity for Study or Bim- Nervous Debility in all impaired Sight and Memory its Stages Not vous Fancies Sick Headache Premature Decline Impoverished Blood And all morbid conditions of the system arising from whatever cause. The action of the Phosphodyne is twofold on the one hand increasing the principle which constitutes nervous energy, and on the other the most powerful blood and flesh generating agent known ; therefore, a marvellous medicine for renovating impaired and broken-down constitutions. It quickly improves the functions of assimilation to such a degree, that where for years an emaciated, anxious, cadaverous, and semi-vital condition has existed, the flesh will rapidly increase in quantity and firmness, and the whole system return to a state of robust health. The Phosphodyne acts electrically upon the organisation for instance, it assists nature to generate that human electricity which renews and rebuilds the osseous, muscular, nervous, membranous, and organic systems. It operates on the system without exciting care or thought upon the individual as to the process. It moves the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, stomach, and intestines, with a harmony, vigour, yet mildness unparalleled in medicine. The Phosphodyne gives back to the human structure, in a suitable form, the phosphoric or animating element of life, which has been wasted, and exerts an important influence directly on the spinal marrow and nervous system, of a nutritive, tonic, and invigorating character, maintaining that buoyant energy of the brain and muscular system, which renders the mind cheerful, brilliant, and energetic, entirely overcoming that dull, inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience in all their actions. The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are frequently shown from the first day of its administration, by a remarkable increase of nervous power, with a feeling of vigour and comfort, to which the patient has long been unaccustomed. Digestion is improved ; the appetite increases wonderfully ; the bowels become regular 5 the eyes brighter the skin clear and healthy and the hair acquires strength, showing the importance of the action of the Phosphodyne on the organs of nutrition. Finally, the Phosphodyne maintains a certain degree of activity in the previously debilitated nervous system ; its use enables all debilitated organs to return to their sound state and per- form their natural functions. Persons suffering from Nervous Debility, or any of the hundred | symptoms which this distressing disease assumes, may rest assured of an effectual and even speedy cure by the judicious use of this most invaluable remedy. - DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE Is sold only In Closes at 10s. 6d. by all Chemists and Patent Medicine Vendors throughout the Globe. Full Directions for use in the English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Danish, Turkish, Persian, Hindustani, MadrasBO (Tamul), Bengalee, Chinese and Japanese Languages, accompany each Case. jgST CAUTION.-The large and increasing demand for DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE has led to several imitations under similar names ; purchasers of this medicine should therefore be careful to observe that each case bears the English Government Stamp, with the words " Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne" engraved thereon (white letters on a red ground), and that the same words are also blown in the Bottle. Every I Case bears the Trade Mark and Signature of Patentee. WHOLESALE AGENTS FOR Victoria : FELTON, GRIMWADE, k Co., Melbourne, New South Wales : ELLIOTT, Bros., Sydney.
