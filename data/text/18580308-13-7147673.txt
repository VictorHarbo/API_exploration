COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Saturday Evening; Export entries were passed to-day at the Customs for 127 ounces of gold, of which 6) ounceswerefor shipment in thec/íípi'íírfor Hong Kong, 48 ounces in the Red Jacket for Liverpool, and 13 ounces in the Maidstone for Loa i don. The utter inactivity which prevails in the import markets has had the usual effect | of checking shipments of the precious metals. 1 Prices remain unchanged at £3 14s. 6d. to £3 14s. 9d. for Castlemaine and Sandhurst ; £3 12s. 6d. to £3 15s. for Mount Korong ; £3 15s. 6d. for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Creek, and Avoca ; £3 15s. to £8 16s. 9d. for Ararat and Pleasant Creek; £3163, to £3 17s, for the Ovens; and £3 17s. 6d. to £3 17s. 6d. for Ballaarat. The escort returns have been again below the average of the preceding year. As compared with the returns of the corresponding week they show a remarkable falling off in the Bendigo and the Ovens districts. In deed the escorts from the latter gold-field are now little more than half of those of the former period. In the subjoined list the fortnightly escorts are distinguished from the weekly by the prefix of an asterisk to the names of the gold-fields : 1858\. 1857. ozs. dwts. ozs. its.

The only declared shipment of specie has been £1,920, In gold to Hong Kong. Although the escorts are below the average of the year 1857, they have been in excess of that of the last 13 weeks, a fact which bears evidence of the effects of the late welcome rains. The reports from all th; sold gold-fields are to the same effect, The puddling machines, which were stopped, are again working, and the usual quantity of gold is produced by them in Mr. Bannerman', report from Bendigo, he notices the purchase of 96 ounces of gold dust from Messrs. Madden and Co., who have a puddling machine at the junction of Edward's Gully and Ironbark, This was washed from the earth forming the bottom of the machine, after removing the boarding, and it had accumulated in something less than nine months. The party expected only about eight or ten ounces, and were agreeably surprised at their unexpected good fortune. The district of Bendigo is about to be secured in the possession of an unfailing supply of water by the enterprise of Mr. Emmett, supported by other capitalists. The whole of Golden Flat is to be excavated and converted into one vast reservoir for the supply of the municipality and the miners, under an agreement which secures to the township many Immediate advantages as well as the ultimate possession of the works. The whole of this large flat has been turned over several times, and with profit to themselves, by succeeding parties of diggers, until Its riches have been exhausted, and the locality deserted by the private miner. Mr. Emmett proposes to send the enormous body of earth which he will have to excavate, extending over from 80 to 100 acres, through the process of washing within a given time, and to carry on simultaneously the work of laying down pipes for the supply of the town of Sandhurst. Similar projects but in a less forward state, are on the tapis, for the supply of other districts, and another year will witness great changes in this respect. The mining intelligence from the gold-fields is devoid of general interest. At Mary borough, in the old main lead, some good patches are reported to have been struck, and the rush near Havelock has turned out well. Some good ground has also been opened upon the Daisy Hill road. Dunolly is stated to be improving, the new ground at Jones's Creek and Cochran's being spoken very highly of. Ballaarat has begun to show signs of reaction, and the escorts thence are, from all accounts, likely to be on the Increase The falling off in the yield of the Ovens district, is so marked, and so continuous, that it is to be wondered at that no corresponding movement of the population takes place. The Omeo district, which still affords employment for its limited number of inhabitants, has been almost flooded out by the late rains. The number of persons who arrived by sea, at Melbourne during the week amounted to 400 of whom 228 were from the neighboring colonies, and 182 from the United States. The departures are computed at 300. The net addition to the population by the sea- board during the current year has been 4,342. Arrived. Departed.

For commercial purposes there is little doing in money outside the banks, except at usurious rates of interest. The banks charge for bills under 95 days' currency, 8 per cent. ; from 95 to 125 days, 9 per cent. and over 125 days, 10 per cent. and on overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent. Exchange on England is, at all the banks, at par for 60 days' sight; for amounts under £60 at i per cent, premium for 30 days' sight. Freight on gold, by direct steamer. or sailing vessels, 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London ; insurance 15 per cent., by the overland route 5 per cent. that is, 71. par ounce as nearly as possible ; Insurance li to 15 per cent. In the stock and share market sales are reported of Colonial Bank of Australasia shares at 55s, and of Bank of Victoria at 40 to £41. Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway at £73, Australasian Insurance Company at 10s,, and Colonial Insurance Company at £35. Pending the arrival of the English January mail trade is dull There is but little disposi- tion to speculate in anticipation of advice. The country trade is gradually becoming more active as the summer season declines, but it is yet far from brisk. The following is a comparison of the imports and exports at the Port of Melbourne for the current year, with the corresponding periods of the year 1867 : Imports. Exports.

The arrivals at that point had been heavy. On Sunday last another cargo of barrel flour came in from New York, and another cargo of sugar from Manilla. The papers report, without giving names, the suspension of a firm engaged largely in the timber trade. The liabilities are large, and most of the losses will, it is stated, fall on Melbourne houses. The Sydney Morning Herald remarks, with regard to the present position of the London money market, and of the Australasian debentures therein : We do not know that it is to be very much bewailed as a great misfortune that our local Governments are thus arrested In their borrowing career. That it is often policy to contract a loan to carry out a reproductive work which is beyond the immediate resources of a young country, and that such ventures soreness may give a stimulus to its prosperity that more than compensates for the burden involved, cannot be disputed. But in these colonies the debt contracted had hardly achieved its justification. The money had not effected all that had been promised. Our railways were not reproductive, and the burden was fast increasing, while the compensating benefits were barely appreciable. A cessation of this kind of investment will, therefore, hardly be vary ruinous, and may possibly have advantageous re- salts. The Government of this colony is for the present, it is true, somewhat pinched for want of a little ready cash, but this arises simply from the fact that money has been spent before it was borrowed spent under the impression that it could be easily obtained when it was wanted, while the sudden commercial crisis that hosauporvonod in England has altogotbordlsappointoi this hope. But this is only a temporary difficulty, though very embarrassing for the time. There is no cause for permanent anxiety in the state of our finances. The ordinary revenue isquitosufficieutforall ordinary expenditure. Loans are not essential to our prosperity. It may be very convenient and even post I bly advantageous, to borrow money, If it can be got, but if the money is not obtainable, the colony is not straitened. It has resources equal to its wants. No foreign wars, no large standing army, no insupportable debt drains away its means, of discourages Its industry, it has little else to provide for besides the amount absolutely necessary for the purposes of civil government - an amount which need not be more than very moderate when compared with the power of the community to provide it; Taxation may fall ruinously on an impoverished or decaying country, but it is a light burden where productive interests are constantly expanding. The staple industry of this colony is steadily advancing. The price of wool has momentarily suffered a decline, and the amount of money anticipated for this year's produce will not be obtained. But the general demand for wool and its relation to the supply will remain quite unaffected by a passing monetary panic. The market is as unlimited as ever for all that can be produced. While the people are profitably employed, the Government can raise the necessary taxation without inflicting any severe pressure, and may consider itself quite independent of the facilities that may offer for borrowing. We can afford, therefore, to wait, and hear without consternation that no more money is to be borne well A little patience and self-reliance will put us in a better position, if in a year or two hence it shall be thought expedient again to venture on the Stock Exchange, At present colonial debentures are not appreciated. A sense of distrust attaches to them. The colonial Governments have not inspired confidence. The sense of security that attaches to the promises of the Imperial Government was strikingly shorn In the late panic when consols rose while socks tins of all other sorts were dropping in value ; the reason being that investors, distrustful of banks, railways, and joint- stock companies of all sorts, sold out to invest in what they made sure could never dis- appoint them. In putting faith in the Imperial Parliament, they calculated on perfect exemption alike from roguery and repudiation. It will be well for the Colonial Parliaments when they succeed In Inspiring some slender share of such a confidence. But they must possess more stability and exhibit more discre- tion than has hitherto characterised them, before such a result can be attained. The monthly general meeting of the mem bers of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce was held on Monday last, at which, after the usual preliminary business had been despatched, a letter from the Postmaster-General, respecting the delivery of letters per English mail at it is Post Office, and a letter from the Colonial jj. cretary, with reference to steam communica- ? tion, via Panama, were read. Mr. T. W. South moved for a select committee to inquire late the present system of brokerage; and some { resolutions with reference to the European and Australian Steam Packet Company were moved by Mr. Hirst. The debate on this latter question was postponed to Friday. One of the resolutions proposes that a part of the subsidy granted by the colony shall be at once withdrawn, and the same amount paid to any company in the colony who will guarantee to deliver the letters from England, via Panama or Isthmus of Suez, within 60 says. The Empire of the Sid inst. reports of the road to t : There is but little animation In any branch of tr vie. The large auction sale of teas has tended to depress this market; the lots realised high prices, with much competition, considering the quality and condition of the goods offered. The spirit market is exceedingly flat for all kinds. In flour there have been inquiries, but at very low rates, for both barrel and bog. Thogonoral feelingly, be war or, in favor of a slight advance In all kinds. The large arrivals during the last few days of all articles of general consumption, although tending to flatten trade, have not caused much depression, and many Goode of actual demand will leave a fair profit to importers. There was a good supply of produce. Oaten hay fetched from li!, to 157, per ton ; straw, from 4. to 59 5s, do. ; wheat, 8s. to 9s. 9d. per bushel ; maize, 6s to 10s. 6d, do ; barley, 6s. to 6s. 6d. do. ; green -BUT, Is, 6d. to 1?. 9d. per dozen bundles; milch cows, li. to El. each ; calves, li. to li. 10s, do. Monday Morning. Captain Parfitt and the Royal Mail ship European have not yet made their appearance in Hobson's Bay, greatly to the disappoint- ment of public expectation. The agent of the company had negotiated arrangements by which, the European would have been at once despatched on her way to Sydney after having delivered the other colonial mails, had she come in. This act of forethought would have secured the Sydney people an extra day for the perusal of their correspondence without inconvenience to the other ports. As it is, the European will be sent away at the shortest no 1 ice consistent with the convenience of the Public The mails by the Emeu we appointed to close on Monday next, the 15th instant. The periodical sales of Crown Lands in the Melbourne district for the present most! cr commence this day, at Messrs. W. M. Tennent and Co.'s auction rooms. The lots to b submitted consist entirely of country land, in the following localities, viz., Cape Schanck Nunawading, from five to eight miles south of Anderson's Creek ; Ringwood, on the Dandenong Creek, between 14 and 17 mile East from Melbourne and Scoresby, also of the Dandenong Creek, immediately east from the parish of Nunawading, distant from Melbourne between 14 and 17 miles. Lots C, 19 and 11 have been withdrawn. POST OFFICE NOTICE.

There was an abundant supply of vegetables in the market this morning, and this, coupled with the irregularity and want of arrangement which has prevailed for some time back, and on which there certainly appeared to be no improvement this morning, rendered confusion worse confounded, and affected the sales very much. The space devoted to the purposes of this market is not exactly what it would need to be ; but even as it is, very little trouble the part of the authorities would make the accommodation much better than it really is, and the matter ought to be looked into. Beans,' kidney, 3d, to 5d. per lb. ; beet, 2s. per dozen bunches bouquets, 6s. per dozen ; cabbages, 3 to 3 per dozen ; carrots, 2s, to 2s, 6d. per dozen bunches ; celery, 5s. per dozen heads; cross, water, 1s. per dozen bundles ; cucumbers, prickly, Is. per dozen; do., long spine, 3s. to 4s. do. ; lavender, 2s. 6d. per dozen bunches; lettuces, 2s. per dozen; marjoram, is. per dozen bunches ; mint, 1s. per dozen bunches ; onions, dried, 10s. per cwt. ; do., green, 1s. per dozen bunches; parsley, 18, do. ; parsnips, 2s. 6d, to 3s. 6d. do.; potatoes, 12s. to 13s. per cwt. ; pumpkins, 18s. to 20s. per dozen ; radishes, 2s, per dozen bunches ; rhubarb, 2s. do. ; sago, Is. do, ; turnips, Is. 6d. to 3s. 6d. do.; tomatoes, 2d. per lb,; vegetable marrows, 4s. to 8s. per dozen; Fruits Almonds, 7d. per lb. ; apples, sid. to 8d. per lb. ; damsODB, 7d. to 8d. per lb. ; grapes, 4d. to 6d. do, ; melons, water, 8s. to 8s. per dozen ; do. rock, 20s. to 22s. per dozen ; peaches, 6d. to 2s. do. ; peas, 7d. to 9d. per lb. ; plums, 10d. to 1s. 3d. do.

Bay Market The supply at market has continued fully adequate to all requirements, and prices ram are unchanged. The number of loads brought In has 1936 542 against 500 the- previous week, and the market continued crowded with supplies to its close. Boat hay may be quoted as. 5s. to 77. 7s. ; inferior, Bl. to Ol. ; straw, 42 to 6s ton. ' Wool, Tallow, seatholders still evincing a disinclination to sell at the price offered, and shippers, although willing and even apparently anxious to some- in B tances to purchase, continuing resolute in limiting the extent of their offers, consequently prevents any amount of business of importance being transacted, and both parties are lying on their oars" until the arrival of the new air mail, as, although no advices of further silos can arrive the news of the money markets and intelligence from the manufacturing districts it is hoped may justify more firmness in prices here. No public sales having occurred during the week, transactions have been limited to private sales, and although several parcels of both wool and tallow have changed owners, the amount of sales has not been extensive, and the rates raid have been unchanged from those of the previous week. Live Stock Fat Cattle The supply of prime stock has been light, and prices of last week are fully supported, the greater portion at market having been of second quality. Prime beef may be quoted at 30s., second quality and good 22s. 6d. to 27s. 6d. per 100lbs, Messrs. Ryan and Hammond report having effected Union of 120 head of bullocks of fair quality at an average price of £9 per head Store cattle have not been in much request, good lots of equal sexes may be quoted at from 57s. 6d. to 72s. 6d. per head, Working bullocks have been in good demand, and those at market met ready sale, Messrs. J. L. Iiohau and Co. disposed of several teams at an) average of 21s. per pair, and teams of six, with drays and gear complete, at from 800. to 1081. Calves have, particularly towards the close of the wool-, been supplied in excess of demand, and lower prices have been submitted to. Messrs. Ryan and Hammond report the sale of a lot of 23 head, at from 37s. 6d. to 75. eich. Fat Sheep. [ Fow of really prime quality have come to market the s v. cock, and the supply generally being short of require agents. prices have ruled higher. Prime wethers brought 21s. to 22s. Fair quality, 17s. to 20s. and food ewes, 13s. to 10s. each. Store shaopltavo lived a better inquiry, although at present ruling prices, I few transactions are made Lambs were in good demand, but the supply having been short, prices have ruled from 9s. to 12s. each. HORSE MARKETS-The demand for good broken-in stock continues brisk, especially for heavy draught and light upstanding horses in good condition, prices for which description have been in advance of the previous week. The supply of colts and Allies has been lees than of late, and more satisfactory prices have consequently been procured. Blanch heavy draught horses, sound and equal to full weight, may be quoted at from 75s. to 1962. second class, of same description, 801\. and 481. Messrs. J. L. Logan and Co, report sales of first class hacks, at from 222 to 802. ; well broken light draught horses, from 182. to 352. and stock horses, from 122 to 192, each. LABOR MARKETS-The demand for thoroughly competent domestic servants, more particularly females, continues unabated, even at somewhat advanced rates. The system of assisted emigration now adopted although not Introducing so large a number, brings a much improved and more suited class of domestic servants into the market, who readily find situations. The demand for farm servants, in Melbourne at least, has almost wholly ceased, although in the farming districts a fair demand for this class of labor is still reported. Tradesmen and mechanics are in excess of requirement, and as the summer closes situations and employment will become still more difficult to pro- em o. The following continue to be the nominal rates of wages, subject, of course, to arrangements With rations, married couples, without families, 102\. to 102. per annum ; ditto with families; 002\. to 702. ditto ; gardeners, 002. to 652. ditto, grooms 6-2. to 052 ditto ; shepherds, 802. to 402. ditto ; keepers, 802. to 402. ditto ; hutkeepers, 202, to 252. ditto ; general farm-servants, 20s per week ; plough- men, 26s. per week ; bullock-drivers, on road, 25s. on I stations, 20s. per week ; men cooks, 622. to 1902. per I annum ; female ditto, 852. to 402. ditto ; general servants, 802. to '352. ditto ; nursemaids, 182\. to 262. ditto.

Seamen's Wages There is no change in rates of this description of labor. - There is a brisk demand for hands, but the supply is quite equal to requirements, and the following continue to be the rates pay- ing: Coasting Voyages, 62. per month ; India or Calais and back, 42 10s. per month : India, China, west coast of America and England, 42. 10s. per month ; England direct, II. 10s. per month for Callao only, 22 10s. per month. CAaTAOB.- Large quantities of loading have been dispatched, principally being bullock team, and prices have rnleoVexoecdingly low. Building in terials form a considerable portion of the loss ling despatched at present; and, although some ago for timber prices were fully 22. per ton higher than for general loading, there seems to be no difference between that and other loading.

The amount of business transacted in the import market during the past week has been generally very light, flour and horse corn being the chief exceptions, both having steadily advanced in price as well as demand. The country trade, it is satisfactory to remark, has been steady and continuous, while the extensive quantities of building materials forwarded to the various diggings and inland townships, strongly indicate an appearance of a more settled population and less fluctuating business than has hitherto characterised these localities. By auction, large and varied assortments of imported goods have been submitted to sale, but have generally met with somewhat unfavorable results, as, although the demand has been fair, the prices offered have been low, and in many instances the goods have been withdrawn for want of offers. Indeed, overstocked as our market is with nearly all descriptions of goods, the uncertainty as to what will be the result of the late crises at home and in the United States, and the consequent utter impossibility of calculation as to what our future supplies are likely to extend to, render any attempt to force sales an ill-judged proceeding, and as likely to drive prices down without causing any augmented amount of sales. Advices by the expected mall are anxiously looked for, not only as regards the probable extent of shipments made to this port, but as deter- mining the result of past monetary transactions, to the uncertainty of which much of the present dulness in mercantile matters may doubtless be traced, and which, as we trust may be the case, if likely to terminate favorably, will restore confidence and give renewed impetus to business Liquors, The exceedingly variable weather lately experienced has much affected the condition of many of the lighter classes of draught boards, and rendered buyers very chary of purchasing to investors beyond their immediate wants. White, therefore, known and tested brands are of ready solo, the amount is limited only, and prices consequently unimproved, while less save life brands showing any effects of the sudden changes of temperature are almost unsaleable, except at prices usually paid for unsound beer. Bottled beer has latterly been somewhat dull of sale, the large quantities of inferior and unknown brands offered for sale, as well as the extent to which local bottling with fictitious labels has been carried on, have much selects- the value of genuine importations of best brands, and in these descriptions but little has been doing, and prices have been nearly nominal. Within the last few days, however, more Inquiry for best brands has been exhibited, and prices for Byass's and other approved brands seem disposed to rally. Spirits continue dull without the least animation Brandies, either of bestqualltyand guaranteed authenticity or of lowest and cheapest descriptions, have been the chief sorts saleable, for demand there has been none to speak of Medium sorts have been wholly neglected, and prices of all kinds are nominal. Sales of United vineyard Proprietors' have been effected at 37s. per dozen, which is, we believe, the highest rate of the past week. Old tom and whiskey appear wholly forgotten, and rum is in extremely light demand, even at nominal rates. Genova Is tolerably saleable in small quantities, but only of best brands, and those at declining rates. By auction JDKZ, guaranteed, has been sold at 15s. 3d. to 16). 6d. per case. Wines are without alteration, demand very light, and Saleable only as requirements good Flour, Grain, Co-The market for these descriptions of produce has been very animated, and more activity exhibited than has prevailed for some coral derable Time. Adelaide flour, which is the chief description in stock, has, owing to short supplies from that quarter, steadily advanced, and all parcels offering under 182. per ton have been cleared off, and holders are now asking 182. to 208. per ton, according to brand, while several fielders have altogether withdrawn their flour from the market, In anticipation of higher rates shortly ruling. The arrivals of wheat and flour since the commencement of the year have been only slightly in advance of exports, and as growers, both in this and the neighboring colonies, evince a strong disposition to hold, the probability is that flour will continue to command on hanced value until prices tempt excessive shipments from the neighboring colonies, when reaction will, of course, ensue. Beat Adelaide brands have been sold at 15s to 192. per ton, but to-day higher figures are demanded. Good barrel flour is in brisk demand for shipment, and whatovorparcels of Tasmanian, Chilian, er Californian may be on hand are not offering ; indeed, we believe stocks at the present moment are lower than they have for a long time past been. Oats have improved in demand, and consequently in prices. A cargo of Danish, arrived during the week, has been sold for Os. 3d. Irish (Hayes's) oats have brought 0s Od., and good parcels of Scotch are readily disposed of at 6s. 3d. to 6s. 6d. The hitherto low price of this grain has at length attracted attention, and the Increased consumption has much reduced stocks of imported kinds; and as some growers are firm In holding for better prices, an advance on present rates may fairly be looked for. Darley la In considerable requests for seed use. indeed the demand so far exceeds the supply as to render prices nominal. The latest advices from Tasmania quote this article at 7s. per bushel there, and our present quotation of 7s. to 8s. per bushel of course offers little inducement to ship thence. Wheat, particularly of home growth, comes very slowly forward. Millers are offering. 6d. to 7s. 3d. delivered, and are reported to be buying in the neighboring colonies at prices which will cost more when laid down here than they are offering to home growers. Bran has been partially supplied by arrival front South Australia, but the quantity received is inadequate to affect prices, which are now from 2s. 11d, to St., having receded somewhat during the week. Gram has been influenced in value by the advance in oats and other sorts of horsefeed. Sales have been made during the week to rather considerable extent at from 132. to 141 and others are reported at avon Stirling Stirling. Corn sacks are again easier, ample supplies having been received by the neighboring colonies, and late prices hero of JCd. to 15d., are barely supported. Provisions Butter of the best quality procurable in the market realises ready sale at 1s. 2d. to 1s. 3d. per lb, ; but really prime Irish butter is scarce, and if here would command both ready sale and enhanced prices. Inferior, unsound, and rancid sorts abound, and cannot be quoted. Really prime cheese has become scarce and is wanted ; the best hero is worth about Is. 6d. to is. 2d, but the greater proportion is of such very Inferior description as to be difficult of sale at almost any price whatever. Bacon, although In fair demand, does not improve in value, and until stocks are reduced advanced rates can scarcely be expected, although there can be no reason for further decline in value of this article. Hams of prime quality still continue in request, and for really good sound sorts 1s. 3d. to Is. 6d. is readily procurable. In salted provisions there is no change to remark. Oilman's stores, although of steady solo, have somewhat doors ned in request as well as value, and to effect sales rathoreosior rates have been submitted to. Candles, notwithstanding reports of inquiry for speculation, remain very quiet, and the quoted rate of 1s. 2d. per lb. is still the extreme value for Belmont sperm, No. 1. Groceries.-Coficos continue quiet, without variation in value. Consumption of this article is very steady. Stocks are in few hands, and there is no reason for looking for any lessened value for this article. Tea The wreck of the ElolLaJond, and the fact of the Cashmere's having damaged a considerable portion of her cargo, have brought a large quantity of unsound tea into the market; and having been disposed of by auction for whatever it would fetch, has of course caused a temporary inactivity in the demand for the better class of meat. The sales of damaged sorts went off, however, well, and the prices realised, considering the quality and condition of the goods, quite support the prices for really first-class teas. A portion of the cargo of teas ex Sabina, from Hong Kong, have been disposed of by auction during the woo- ; a few of the brands were fair ordinary congous, but the greater part consisted of coarse leaf, stalks, ordinary teas, barely coming under the class of congous. The prices realised wore-for the former class, 02, per chest' other sorts bringing 72. 6s. to 72 12s. 6d. per chest, 32 12s. 6d. to 42. 5s. per half, chest, 24s. to 25s. per ten-catty box. A few chests of very ordinary twankay brought 62, 2s. 6d. to 62. 5s., and some 10 catty boxes of hysonskin, 20s. to 22s. each. Sugars Considerable quantities of this article have been forced on the attention of the market by auction during the week ; the parcels of Mauritius, although considerable In the aggregate, have consisted chiefly of remnants of former cargoes disposed of, and odds and ends, of qualities not of the most saleable kinds in this market, and the consequence has been a decline in value to greater extent than would, in all probability, have occurred had the parcels offered consisted 1 of new entire lots. The sugars per Pet, from Manilla, and a portion of those per Orange, team same port, have also passed the hammer. Fine brown brought £82. 10s. for the bulk, low of the earlier lots disposed of bringing rates as high as 312 10s., and fine by one of 342 10s. to 152. per ton. As, however, these sugar are unsuited for the consumption of this colony, the prices procured afford no just criterion of the value of other sorts In general UBO. IIIco, despite all attempts to induce speculation, romulus perfectly quiet. A parcel of (- r church Patna was offered in vain by auction Yussuf the Week, and taken in at 162. 10s. The parcel of cargo rice per Pet was withdrawn, 62. and 102. being about the highest obtainable offers ; but as this description of rice is wholly unsuited for European markets, higher offers could hardly be looked for. Timber The demand continues brisk with an increasing trade with the interior, and, notwithstanding arrivals, ready sales are effected, although prices generally have barely rallied to formorquotatlons. By auction, on the Wharf, lumber has brought 72 12s. 6d. to 122 15s. per 1,000 feet ; five-feet pickets, 72. 2s. 6d ; four-footed., 62, 12s. 6d. per 1,000; oak plank. 132. ; ash plank, 122 15s. per 1,000 ; rod dolls, 11 x 8,6. and 768, 11s. per foot. Metals. Corrugated Iron, and other descriptions, suited for building purposes, are In slightly improved demand, although unchanged in prices can be recorded. Other description of Irons still very unsaleable. Lead of light sizes is in better inquiry, but not at amended value. Tin plates, overstocked and difficult of sale. In other articles there is no change to report, and for quotations (many of which are, however, nomi- nal) we refer to subjoined list of prices current. ALE AND BEER (duty paid). £8 d. J B. d.
