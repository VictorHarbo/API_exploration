VITAL STATISTICS. ANNUAL REPORT OF GOVERNMENT STATISTICIAN. SOME INTERESTING FIGURES. The report of the Government Statistician (Mr. Malcolm A. C. Fraser) on tbe popular lion and vital statistics of Western Australia for the year ended December 31 was issned on Monday. Following are some extracts from Mr. Fraser's remarks. (Throughont the report "rate'" means rate per 1,099 of i h s mean population for the year. Thc "nor- mal" referred to, unless otherwise staled, ¡s . the average for the previous' ten years. Figures in parentheses, unless otherwise spécifiée!, Télate to the previous year) : "The leading feature of (he vital statis- tics of the State for 1S11 is thc Rain by mi- gration of 12.150 persons BK compared with 6,655 during 1910. When taking this into account, however, it must be remembered that during (he period under review the .immigrants introduced under Government auspices numbered 9,562, consisting of 4,703 adult males. 2,628 females, and l,02i mah and 1,004 female children. Thc birth, death, and marriage records also show in- creases both in number and in the rate per ; 1.000 persons. The increase in thc death rate is, fortunately, rather less pronounced | than those for births and marriages. Births. "Births during (he year numbered 8,095 (7,585), consisting of 4,125 (3,858) males and 3,970 (3,727) females. The crude birth rale, that is, thc number of births per 1,000 per- sons in the mean population, was 28.25 (27.99). This is a fair increase upon thc rate for 1910, but is less than the average for the previous 10 years, 30.00,'' The crude birth rate is, however, a very inefficient measure of (he fertility of a community, especially of ono so abnormally constituted as that of W.A.. and is only useful when no other is available. A much better method of throwing light ou the subject is to com- pare the number of legitimate births with the numbei- of married women at the usually recognised reproductive ages, namely, 15 io SO, and the number of illegiti- mate birth's with (lie number of unmarried women at similar ages. It is, of course, only possible to do this accurately when the data required have been ascertained by a census, and, unfortunately, that only hap- pens, at present, once in every ten years; it is (o bc earnestly hoped, however, that thc taking of an intermediate census will very shortly be arranged by the Common- wealth authorities. Three cases of triplets oc- curred during 1811. Twin births numbered 115 (88). Births" in public institutions were 132 (96), a considerable increase on the pre- vious year's figures. Illegitimate' births num- bered 363 (313), also showing a large in- crease. Deaths. "The total number of deaths was 2,924 (2,744), consisting of 1,923 (1,764) males and 1.001 (980) females. The death rate, 10.20. was slightly higher than that for 1910,10.12. The following table shows what variations have taken place in the mortality of West 1ern Australia from 1891 to 1910. The mean population has been divided according to ? i. j ? .in ..... ? Ees, and in several divisions according to age :- * Hean Population. 1891\. 1901.

The rate has almost consistently declined since 1902 until this vear, when a slight increase is recorded. Migration. "The arrivals. 40,865 (31,208) exceeded the departures, 28,735 (24,553) by 12,130 (6,655), the balance in-favour of the State being composed of 8,087 (4,720) males and 4.043 (1,935) females} This net gain was mainly composed of 12,482 Europeans, of whom 11.147 were of British birth, the remainder being chiefly made up of Austrians 441, Dan- ish 60, Italians 324. Russians 62. Dutch 22. Greeks 139, French 30, Swedish 43, Nor- wegian 36, and Germans 135. The total Asiatic population of the State was decreas- ed by 20, the Chinese and Manilamen losing 25 and 22 resepctively. There was a fairly large influx of Japanese, 272, 261 males, ll females, as against 231, .213 males, 18 females, who left the State: whilst 190 Malays arrived and 185 departed. These two latter nationalities, however, are princi- pally non-resident, being for the greater part employed on the North-West pearling fleet. During the period under review the Government introduced 9.562 immigrants, vic, 4.709 adult males, 2,828 adult females. 1,021 male children, and 1,004 female chil- dren. There was a continua] inflow of per- sons from oversea, the total for the year, 14,350, being 4,788 in excess of the immi- grants introduced under Government aus- pices. On the other hand, there was a considerable loss to the Eastern States during the latter half of the year. "Bings has just called be a blackguard." "Just like BingB to 'go blurting out the truth. He's got no tact at all."
