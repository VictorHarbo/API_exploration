POLITICAL SUMMARY. I The event of tlio fortnight has been tho retironiont of tho Berry Govornmont and tho accession to powor of a now Ministry formod by Sir Bryan O'Loghlon. On Tuesday, Dth July, Mr. Berry inti- mated that ho had asked for and hadbeon refused a dissolution. As tho rofusal was Confidently anticipated, Mr. Borry havsôni,0i*r%o substantial grounds, for his appU aon, no surprise was oooasionod by ti.intelligence. In tho Assembly tho intimation that tho application had been mado was coldly recoivod, not ono of tho Ministerial supportors raising a cheer. Mr. Bony was asked by Mr. Murray Smith to read tho correspondence with tho Governor. Mr. Bony declined. Ho promised that tho communications should be published upon an early day, but so far the plodgo Iia3 not beon re- deemed. Both sides wore unanimous í that tho public creditor should bo paid without fuithor delay, and a Supply Bul appropmt'ug £474,CC3 was rapidly pushed through all its stagea in both Houses. His Excellency placed himself in com murioation with S¡r Biyan O'Loghlen, tho member who submitted the motion of want of confidence on which tho Borry Government retire d. The hon. gentleman undeitook the task. In tho first place, ho saw Mr. MuriTiy Smith, and offorod that gentleman tho post of Treasurer. Mr. Murray Smith, howovor, declined. For obvious reasons tho Constitutional party was by no me"ns ready to serve under Sir Bryan O'Loghlon, though if tho lion, gentleman had retired, his olaims, conse- quent upon his recent action in the House, could not but have boen acknowledged. At a caucus of the Opposition mem- bers, Mr. Muiray Smith's action wa3 approved of by the party as a whole. However, Sir Biyan O'Loghlon went on with his mission. He induced two Oppo- sition members, Mr. T. Bent and Mr. 0. Young, to join him, and he filled up the other posts with tho mombers who left tho Ministerial Bide of the House to sup poit tho want of confidence motion. On ' Saturday, July 9th, tho new Ministors were sworn in as follows : Attorney-General and .* Actine Treasurer ... Sir Bryan O'Loghlen. ' Chief Secretary and Minister of Educa- tion .Mr. J. M. Grant. Minister of Lends ... Mr. D. Garnison. Minister of Kailwaya... Mr. T. Bent. Minister of Customs ... Mr, J. H. Graves. Minister of Water Sup- ply and Agriculture, podMinietetofMinea Mr. C. Young. PoBtmaater-General ... Mr. Ii". Bolton. Solicitor-General ... Dr. Dobson. I, Portfolio without office Mr. L. L. Smith. [ Tho post of M'n'ster of Public Works is > 'vacant. Dr. Dobion is tho M:":stoihl re I presontative m the Upper Hou-o. Tho | Government thus formod took the pubUc s condemnation J David Gaunson, the vituperativo and f unprincipled politician who has in * turn sold both s'dos, ond who rccontly | scandalised tho community by Ms excr- etions in favour of tho bushranger Ke"y. Î Most of the Ministers aro now to office. I Sir Bryan entered Parliament in 1878 as tho Attorney-General of tho Beiry Ministry. He was not, however, asso- ciated with Black Wednesday. Mr. Bent was Minister of Putfic Works in tho shoit-'ived Sorvico Government of 1880\. Mr. Grant is a veteran, but .the i othen aro aU new Ministors, and most of ä them are new mombors also. 4 The Ministerial programme was stated 5 by Sir Bryan O'Loghlen at Lancefield, on gAVednesday, 13th July. Tho hon. gontlo §3 sum says that the state of the finances ¡rjvyill not permit of any immediate ro ¿Smission of taxation. Mr. Borry foiled to J pay £200,000 from tho )"nd fund to the «railway constiaction account lost year, Sand thiB Bum has to bo provided, and lone-tlrrd of tho £500,000 loan of last ¡j year has to bo met aho. Tho Ministry I will ro-adjust the land tax, so as to in ¡j elude city as well as country property, I and should thoy obtain a suiplus by this i mentis thoy will apply it not to remitting tho beor and tobacco duties, but to granting a free breakfast table. Some- thing was said, however, about reducing tlio duty on beer to Id. por ga^on. The great feature of the programme is a loan of £4,000,000 for railways, 3 waterworks, and schools. Debon 3 tures to the amount of £8,000,000 Shave to bo redeemed within tho noxt S four years, and the oxiating holdors § aro to be offered 4 per cent, in Jiou of | 0 per cent, debentures, and if they aro % irnvfilliug to consent to these terms, 1'money will bo raised to pay thom off. Tho first repayment has to be mado in 1883, and the amount then duo is £3,800,000. Before thon Ministers pro- pose to raise tho new loan of £4,000,000, ond with this money in hand they will be ablo to offer to pay off the dobonture holders. Judging from English and Amorican experience, Sir Bryan O'Logh- len assumes that nino out of ton of the "old investors will be willing to renew at tho reduced rate, and thus the old loan Jtill bo floated again by a mere bookkoep ing transaction. Tlio holders, ho bo Jiovo3, wiU surrender one sot of deben- tures and receive another. Wo ftive Ulis portion of the address else- where, Largo alterations in the land system aro contemplated. The Mea of solection ia to be increased from 320 acres to G40 acres. Chil- dren of IG are to select, and compulsoiy improvements are to be reduced from £1 to 10s. per aero. Tho mallee country is to bo disposed of by long leases. Royal commissions to inquire into the working of ?'"> Education Act and of the tariff ' 'issue, but Ministers pledge them , is not to touch the principles of either the educational or the fiscal system. The municipal subsidy is to bo continued ; country waterworks and tho Melbourne Harbour Trust Bill aro to be proceeded with. Tho Govornmont policy, says Sir nryan O'Loghlen, is contained in the words "peace and progress." Tho hon. I ?cntlelnftn BP°ke of tho number of native | bom Australians in tho Cabinet, and g declared that Ministers aro tho farmers' f mends. Tho delivoranco has not at- ti tacted tho usual attention, inasmuch as >' " is felt that tlio want of tho Govorn . merit is not a policy but a party. ' KTT Ministers who have followed Sir wynn 0 Loghlon have echoed that lion. gentleman. Mr. Bent at Brighton mado to important addition to tho pro- gramme- namely, that his colleagues wero propared to abandon aU patron- eo m comioxion with tho civil sor- oco, and creato a board to act in tho na«« of appointments to tho several «epartmonts.

The Government are therefore to propose a loan for these three pnrpoBes At the same time it is necessary that the £8,000,000 which is coming due during the next three j ears should bo in some way pro vided for The Government proposition, then, ib that they should apply for power to raise a loan of £12 000 000 in order to pay off the £8,000 000 coming due, and the £4,000,000 which we want to use in the advance of raihvajs and water supply Now, this may appear a very large transaction, and from one oomt of view it l8 a very large transaction, indeed, for this colony But m the mode in which mattera are dealt with financially m London or New York it is a very trivial transaction, and what the Government propose to do is give holders the option of extending the £8,000 000 of debentures coming due, ana to offer them 3J or i per cent, or a rate hereafter to be determined by financial authorities To show that this is a Bystem which has been very successful in the past, I have only to refer you to Mr M'Calloch'e Bi tory of Taxation, where you will find a long table of transactions of the kind which were carried out in England-transactions in which Bums so large as £250 000,000 were dealt with, and m which the effect of the procesB was to reduce the interest from G per cent to 4 per cent, nnd in other m stances from 5 per cent and 4 per cent, to 3 per cent and 3} per cent In the operations between 1822 and 1841, something like £0 000 000 or £7,000 000 of debt were dealt with by the various Chancellors of the ExchequerofEngland Bat I can refer you to a later occasion on which a similar process was carried out, and that is to what has gone on during the last six months in America. The Americans are not afraid of large Bums, but last May or June they bad a large amount of bonds bearing 5 and G per cent coming due A bill was introduced in CongreBs dealing with this amount, and they proposed to raise 140 millions to pay off these 5 and G per cents , and to reduce them to 3 per cont for the future The measure passed Con- gress, and was called the Fund Bill, but it was vetoed by the late President Subse quently, public opinion was very pronounced against many of its Drov lsions It was thought, also, that 3 per cent was too low, and some of its provisions made it compulsory on various public institutions which held the bonds So soon, however, as the new Preaident came into office the Secretary of the Treasury dealt with the G per cent bonds They amounted to nearly 200 m<Uions of dollars, and (hey were this timo dealt with so sue cessfully that, according to tbo latest ad vices, out of 193 millions of dollars 175 millions of bonds bad been converted into 3J per cents On that transaction, then, the Government of America saved a large rnnuel sum in interest in fact the difference between 6 and 3J per cent And this waB done without an} disturbance in the money market Now, our Government pro pobo to deM in a similar way w.th the £8,000 000 coming due, and at the Bania time to obfun a further loan of £4 000,000 If li ey obtain the £4 000 000 loan, then they will have command of tho first £3 800 000 which comes due in 1883 We would then he in the position to say to the debenture holders-" We aro ready to pay any dissentient his money, and theconse quence would be a very beneficial effect on the public mind Tho debenture holders, having confidence in their securities and having also perhaps no opportunity to invest their money m a better way, would accept the bonds for an ex tended term at 4 per cent The dissen tieuts on the 40 000 000dol of bonds in the United Statea have by latest advices dwindled down to 5 000 OOOdol, and the Go vernment aro prepared to pay them if they do not extend their bonds Moreover, I find that between 1822 and 181r> in England the sum represented by tho whole of the dis sentients on the £00 000 000 or £70,000,000 of Btock converted did not amount to much Here, then, is an operation that does not diBturb the money market Onco the Government is m a position to eay to the first men entitled to bo paid, "We are willing to give you > our monej, or to extend your bondB at 8i or 4 per cent, nine out of ten will prefer keeping their securities, and to accept the market rate of mtereBt And that which I have named as the market rate is evident from what haa oc enrred in connexion with the loan floated by South Australia the other day South Aus- tralia, which has always bad to poy high.« for money than Victoria, has got £3 000,000at4 per cent, and nearly £103 for the debentures The operation wo propose is feasible, and is one which will give ub tho money required to execute additional railways, and to carry oat water supply withont entailing one shihng more as a charge on the revenue And why would there be no additional charge on the reverue' Because the 2 per cent on the £8 000 000 gives Í.1G0 000, and if you get £1 000 000 at i per cent the interest will come to £1G0 000 a rear The practical result then will be that j ou vt ill not pay one stiillm«; after the j ear 1885 moro than yon are pajing at present aa interest, and j ou will have £1000 000 more of money for canying out railway conatruction and water Bupply The finances of the country, as I havo said, aro exactly in the position of this time 12 months , but it was proposed that £-100 000, which were arrears of the railway consti action fund, Bbonld be paid out of the income of the present year I am glad to Bay that £203 000 has been paid, but the other half will have to be included amongst the items which will have to be paid during the ensuing} ear and we will have £160 000 to pay off the £300,000, which represente, in fact, something more than the deficiency which a number of hard years had left the Treasury Therefore with the £200,000 and the £100 000 which we bave to pay in order to keep up faith and credit, the Government ia very much afraid that it cannot remit any taxa tion _ THE REVENUE RETURNS The revenue returns for the quarter and year ending June 30,1881, have been published in the Government Gazelle The follow- ing is a comparative statement of the net revenue received Curing the quarters and years ending June 30,1880 and 1881 respec- tively-_ Quarter (railed Year ontleel I -Cubtomb Spirits Wlno Beer ariel cider Tobacco and snuff Cigars Tea Sugar and mo lasses Coffee, chicory, cocoa, and clio colate Opium rico Hop« Matt Dried and pre ecrved fruits and vegetables I »vos ock Ar Je es Bubject to ad valorem du tics AU other articles Wharfage rates Export duty on timber Total customs II -ExasB AKT) iMJXDltBVEMnî Spirits distilled in Victoria Auctioneers' ccnccs All other licences Licensing Act No 6(10 - per cent nie Duties on estates of deceased per eons Duties on baili' notes Land tax Str-tnp duty III -Tpiuuto mai, Alienation Crown lands by auction Alienation Crown lanela by liccncoandlcos , Ä-c Licences andlcascs other than agrl cultural -Fees under licences and rents under leases Pastoral occupa tion Miners richte Business licences Leases of aurifer ous aud mineral lands Water right and scarcbiiiLT ccnccs, &c;

station of another Chinaman Ho at tho time cacar, d capture by the polie,e, and took refuge at a suburban market garden kept by a fe"ow countryman When he developed the disease, the case was reported by hia host, who waB marched off to quaran tine with e1! the p 3ple belon^m«? to his eBtal hehment, the removal, however, being ve./ clumsily effecf,,d The next case was that of a women who had been Biasing with her mother in Bathurst Btrcet, m which street a diseased Chinaman secreted himself for a night before he was carted to Waterloo The third caae was that of a girl in Sussex street The extraordinary part of this case is that tho girl must have been lH for 17 days, and had been under tbo care of a doctor, and it was only on the filth-day of. the eruptive stago that the disease was finally pronounced to be smeU pox A further well developed caso waa afterwards discovered at The Globo, which proved fatal, and another flmost in the heart of the city Subsequently four fresh cases were discovered, the infected persons with the other residents in the bouses being placed in quarantine There aro now 11 or 12 infected houses in the city and Buburba, and each houBO ia (.aarded by policemen An official visit of inspection nos been made, by direction of the Govern ment, to Little Bay, near Botany Bay, where a house was erected some l8 months a^o to receive some Chinese who wore suffer ing from i'lnesa The object of the mapee tion was to ascertain whether the site was suitable for the erection of a smaH pox hos pitol The place was found to be îneveiy way admirably adapted for the purpose there being plenty of level ground on which build inga could be erected, together with a stream of fresh, pure water, apparently never failing running into the bay The place m question is about seven miles from bydney and three miles from the Customs station at Botany Bay The site selected for the new hospital is in the midst of a largo area of reserved church and Behool land The buildings have been plready commenced, and everj thing will be completed on the most comprehensive scale within a month from the present date AH the buildings will be of galvanised iron with every provision for the most perfect ventilation Dr .AUeyne, chief medical officer, has been endeavouring to trace the introduction of small pox into the city and has elicited some information which leads him to believe that On Chong s child was not the first sufferer from the disease It appears that about a fortnight prior to the discovery of the fact that On Chong s child was suffer ing from an attack of small pox in a mild form,a nurse in the employment of the child a father suffered from a similar eruptive disease, which ib now beheved to havo been variola THE POLICE COMMISSION The Poll co Commission have up to the present, examined over 40 witnesses, yet they aro Btill far from the end of thoir labours They have suspended their sittings until the Ministerial elections are over, but in

The reporta on crop prospects differ widely in tone On the portion of our north western area near the Murray more ram is wanted by the early crops whilst the lato ones are Buffering to some extent from frost On the Wimmera proper each locality has a special report to make Aa a rule the rainfall baa been just enough to keep the crops going they are healthy but thoy aro living from band to mouth

the fourth winter in which tho rainfall haa not sufficed to moiaten tho subsoil Grass is very Bhort in most districts the autumn rains having como too lato to give a spring to tho grass . and froats having been prevalent there has been no growth during tho winter Tho early lambing as has been already reported, was almost a fniluro on many properties in the Western and North western districts, but the flocks now lambing aro showing better results, and «lip longvvools and croBBbreda will give good average percentagea In South Anatraba the reports speak of frosts of unusual severity, retarding vegetation considerablyi without, however, doing any harm to the wheat« Fine rains have since taken place, and it is thought that the chi nicter of the season has changed for good. In Queensland shearing has already com- menced , on the Upper Darling, too, a start was made last week, tbe clip is expected to be heavy and of fine qunlity.

MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL The Aigus Oflice Saturday Evening The H M S S Catlny, with the Australian and Kew Zealand mails for India and Eurone, left the bay on the morning of the Gth mat The Orient steamer Sorata after undergoing a thorough repair, of a character aufiicient even to satisfy the most captious critic on such matters, left the bay for England on the evening of the 8th mat, with passengers and a very largo cargo The R M S S Venetia with the English mads via Suez, to date 3rd ult, anchored in the bay on the morn- ing of the 13th inst, shortly after 10 o clock. This is the first trip of the Venetia on the Australian line, and she has made a reasonably good passage, the mails having been landed within 39 days The Bteamsuip Cotopaxi, of the Orient line, arm ed ou the morning of the 8th mat from London, via Cape Town Her dates from London are to May 28, and from the Cape to the 18th ult The mails brought by her were contained in 27 bags In addition to a large cargo for the porta of Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, Blie brought out on freight ¿20,000 worth of new silver coinage The feature of the fortnight absorbing general interest has been the resignation of the Berry and the formation of a new Ministiy under the leadership of Sir Bryan OLoghlen, and although with a generous fooling natural to an Luglish community, fair treatment has been bespoken towards them what can be expected of a Ministry which on all hands is admitted to be extremely weak It is therefore felted that by their advent to ofiice the time of the country can only be needlessly wasted at a critical period, when only the best menin Par liament should be juBtly allowed to form a Go vemment Every preparation is, however, making for the elections, which will come off shortly Though the l'rotos has but recently been deapatched with another shipment of frozen meat for England, the energy and the activity of the directora of the company will not allow them to reat there , and we under stand that theae gentlemen have just con eluded arrangements with the Orient Steam Navigation Company for a shipment of frozen meat, similar to that sent by the l'rotos, to be forwarded to London per the Orient steame-, which leaves hero on the 22nd of August It gives üb equal pleasure to learn now that the English market has been openad to the enterprise of our fellow colonists, that others besides ourselves are equally determined to avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded to enter the field of enterprise, as we learn from Sydney that a quantity of frozen meat is now being placed on board the s a Cuzco, which leaves for England on the 20th inst The whole of the freezing chamber has been engaged by the Orange ¡slaughter ing and Freezing Company i ho company have already about 150 tona of beef and mutton frozen prepared for shipment, but it ia not expected that more than 130 tona will be taken by the Cuzco on her preaent trip The meat ia frozen hard at the works in Orange, conv eyed to Sy dney in cloae trucks, and thenimmediately put on board the vessel. As a further memento of the enterprise of the mercantile community here we may state that the iron clipper ship Hereford, 1,450 tons, after having been completely repaired again and fitted out for sea, was on the 12th inst cleared out for London, and will sail immediately with a large aud valuable cargo returning a handsome freight The story of the slim and what happened to her, how she got stranded, and how she waa got off, and of the imminent risk she ran of foundering on entering Fort Phillip Heads-has already been narrated in due course, and in celebra tion of the success which has crowned the variouB efforts of the new owners to first float her, and then repair and finally freight her, a luncheon was given on board on Wed nesday by the owners Messrs John Blyth, Archibald Currie, and Hugh Thomson The company comprised gentlemen well known in shipping and commercial circles, aud othera identified with the banking, manufacturing and trading interesta Very considerable ex citemeut was created in mercantile circles in coneequence of Mr Berry s resigning office prior to the passing of the Duties of Customs Act 18801, through its remaining stages, but an assurance having subsequently been given that this important measure would not be neglected, all feeling regarding the matter has been allayed In the markots business has been exceedingly quiet, and much disappointment bas been exhibited tim the month, half of which has already passed has bo little carried out tne renewed activity of which Buch anticipations had been formed, but Bcarcely the semblance of animation has been apparent throughout the past fortnight Even the demand for ordinary require ments has been of the moat common place character, giving little hope o improvement, as scarcely a movement can be traced to the most important staples though in some instances stocka have been entirely cleared out of importera' hands further supplies advised being at the aame time of no account whatever On the otc r hand, money was never more plentiful, and seldom, if ever, bo freely offered to the trading community Billa, however, are well paid, and though country orders come forward slowly, and on a limited scale, confidence is fully sustained, and nothing bas arisen to give use to the slightest anxiety with respect to the solvency ot traders In jute gooda, corn sacks have had eotne degree of attention, and last week about G00 hales wero taken up to arrive at the extreme figure of 9s in bond, while early thia week 9a ljd wa3 paid for 150 balea The market baa been quieter Bince Breadstuff's have been sluggish throughout and values are slightly easier than when we last wrote Country supplies, though larger, have been moderate, but all export business hai lug cetsed, local bujers have operated moat sparingly lu oils, kerosene attracted notice, leading to the Bale of about 14 000 cases, or thereabouts, ut a concession In Bugara, the Agnes Wilson a cargo, comprising ubout 12 500 packages, was cleared out publicly to vvithm 800 packages, subeequently Bold privately Little, how- ever, has been done Bince, and the market cannot bo stimu'ated, although acarcely a hundred tons can be found in first hands, and the Refining Company have ceased working for some weeks Ihe arrival of the new Bensons teas has, however, given an impetus to business in that direction, but in otder to Bell freely importera had to meet buy ers at lower ratea 1 he Killarney Bteamer with the first shipment, arrived just before the last mail left, and at tie first day s BuleB on 2nd July, 7 200 packages were sold at from 9}d to Is 8{d On the second day, say on 4tli July, l8 167 packages were quitted This week 1000 paeknges were sold.
