Dominions Commission. DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS. COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. LONDON, January 28. The Commissioners wen deeply im pressed throughout Australia by the desire of all classes to deal with the ttritiah Wmnlr* rather than with foreign nations, not ' only by mean* ot tariff prefecuu*. but iiy clear, distinct pre ference baaed on sentiment and pat riotism. Dtecussing -migration, the report atate* that labor-saving machinery i* much more used in agricultural pur suits In Australia and New Zealand than in Europe. Comparisons show that the propir tlon of the population engaged in agri cultural and pastoral pursuits is smaller ..than In the United States and many Suropean countries. Tbe town population is execsslve and single. The mother country i* already dependent upon oversea* for a considerable pro portion of bar food and raw material, and tb* ComaissioD Is Impressed with th* deatrabUlty of a* large a portion as passible of tbe dominion* being oc cupied by a population which will a* bm In tb* development of the primary resources, The best age for Immigrants Is from 1C to 24. A town-bred youth often finds his feet quicker in new environments than the rustic. Australia's and New Zealand's requirements are largely ful filled by well-disposed youths, whom the environment of the United King dom bad forced from blind alley em ployment* and youth* from Industrial onhnni* The Contfnuulon had cot round evidence that only tnose who followed agriculture in the old country can become successful agrloulturlaU in the new. There i* a strong under current of opposition in Australia and New Zealand to emigration, principally among the urban wage earner* and artisan*, who regard Immigration n* likely to increase competition In .he skilled labor market. Tbe Commission believe that this hostility arises mainly from the present defect* of the Immi gration system. Discussing female Immigration, the report sUUd that the surplus ot Bri tain, were mainly residential In towns, being principally elderly laale* and women servants. Tbe first war* lot possible emigrants and servants coiiW 111 be spared from the rankest the fe male domestic* which were depleted by the demand of the commerce and indus try ot the United Kingdom compared with' 20 years ago. The Commission Intend- to deal with the matter In greater detail In their final report. Dealing with the difficulty or family migration, the Commissioners state that the parent* -are often too old to; settle 'comfortably, and the man who: could be tempted to establish him self prematuraljr as a farm owner or tenant on ready-made farms was non existent to any large--extent Farming on -the .snare system la ?standing in Australia and Is a highly commend able organisation. Family jalgcaMon will entail considerable public expense before an Ideal system Is reached. The report recommends fuller use of the methods adopted at P|U Town, New South Wales, which is an admirable Institution. It is undesirable to leave the duty Ot describing the attractions of the Dominion* to interested passage arebta. There exists a. widespread feeling which the Commission consider Justifiable, that misrepresentation 1st common enough while there have been some oasa* of actual fraud. The poulbllltr «£ making greater use of British labor exchanges deserves close attention, particularly In connec tion with Juvenile emigration. The Commlssten noommeha* greater co operation between the Home and Aus tralasian Governments regarding the migration ot discharged Indian Mi dlers, many of whom are wllltng to *o to. Australia and New Zealand, but find some difficult:', though already to- j custainefl t* a .climate more trying than I that ot Northern Australia. The sav in*; by direct migration would allow Df considerable Ananchu assistance to Buoh emigrants. ? Th* Commission wa* j favorably Impressed by the German settlements in Queensland and South Australia; Ihe Danish, Swedish and! Norwegian farmers in Victoria. Such1 migration would be a wholesome addi tion to the population of New Zealand and Southern Australia. i Regarding the Bum Canal, the Com mission wfca impressed by the canal's1 capacity to deal, without undue delaV, with 16.000 ships ta against the present MOO, provided certain traffic regula-. tlons were observed. They were 'also Impremed by. the Increasing ability to take vessels of d*ep draught. It will shortly be 10ft. deep, but It la doubtful whether this I*. sufficient to provide the necessities for *. Quick ocean service to Australia. Th* fact that the Panama Canal gives a depth of ,40ft. will acctl eraU.tbt already rapid increase Id sit* ?nd -draiBghl *f Mm carrier*.

The Commtalmi cannot us* too strongly that t!» *o JSSngiBodie. of poru.itouia ««ob* earnest consideration to til* frobltm of d**penlng their tasTbora. y Any «eml-automaUc renewal ot ta* mall eontract ?with *' *llg»t fmprere ment In »p««d and »»-u'1-n*J'B* ?llgbt decrease In tbe «o*t. -would **? inadequate a* a solution of *«*«*? lam. which needs to be bandied on broader line*, giving; ,iuu connamuaB to all varient*, particularly speed re striction* In the Sue* Canal. T*ere to grave reason to doubt the reality of the competition under th» pre«ent arrange ment* wtilch are a cbhOnusiioe of « quad-monopoly wnic» baa existed for a long period probably previous to the development or shipping, as It removes a great Incentive to the construction ot faster ship*. No -mall oontract 1* satisfactory which doe* hot provide (or a sea speed considerably In excess ot that of unsubsldlscd lines. The Com mission drVw* attention to the com plaints regarding outward bill* of lad ing which are out of date and unduly complicated, while they favor the ship owners against their customer*. Never theless there Is evidence that many companies had granted a redress wnico they were not legally compelled to glee. There teas evidence that the extent rt the snipping ring In -t/ondon Is so great tbat the combined action of importers would be of -little avail. The report draws attention to the possibility of amending the United Kingdom law in order to bring It Into Un* with th* Australian Sea Carriage Act of U04. The report Includes detatls at the disposal of the British Cotton Growing Association to establish cotton grow ing, which the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments have accep ted. The Commissioners deny that ex perience has shown -that cotton can only be successfully grown by black labor; on the contrary, 76 per ceni, oi the labor In Terns is whit*. It was possible that tlnhese would furnish Just the type ot labor required. It Is estimated that picking In Australia cost* Id per 1b. There la evidence that the quality of the Australian cotton I* such a* to Justify the expectation ot - a higher price being secured than In most other cotton countries.' There Is also the possibility ot a cotton picking machine reducing the Importance^ of the Australian labcr factor, s,nd It sbould also be passible to organise small growers I mo associations for picking the crop co-operatively., . While admittlnB that hide* are dam« aged by branding, the natural remedy Is differentiation in price between hides branded as tbe farmers suggest, and those branded as now. The Com mission did not recommend the imposi tion of more stringent regulations re garding glucose In leather.
