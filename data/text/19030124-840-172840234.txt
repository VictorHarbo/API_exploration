During tho period . that I havo enjoyed your aonfidenec, no pains huvo been spared by mo to justify tho esteem which you have, on two occasions, been phrased to express at tho ballot box and othorwiBo, and the requests I have reoeived, aod am still receiving, from many of your number, to gether with the hopes expressed of a contrail- unoo of my oorvioes, ' are very gratifying to me. I havo therefore decided to again offer my self as- a candidato for your suffrages, and can only say that, Bhould you honour me with a renewal of your confidence, I shall place my experience and ability at your disposal, and do my host in tho interests of tho East Ward and tho City generally.

Ladies add Gentlemen, — At the request of many influential ratepayers of No. 3, I liavo allowed myself to ho nominated to con test tho seat at tho coming eleotion, nud I promise, in the event of Doing returned as your representative, to give my undivided attention to tho watching and furthering of your interests, I have been a resident for about 37 ycarsiti tho district, and, therefore, I know tho needs o£ tho ratepayers, and boiug a largo ratepayor in No. 3, my interests lire identical with yours. Without doubt tlio timo has coma for tho excrciso of the striotoxt economy, partly owing to tho greatly reduced ondowmont Local Authorities are likoly to rcoeive, and the finances will havo to ho very ourefnlly managed. Without in tho least impairing tho effioienoy of our roads, economy will havo to ho very rigidly practised. Somo of tho expenditure that lias boon thrust upon us in the past will huvo to ha curtailed and genorally reducod so as to bring it within reasonable bounds consistent with the income. This fact combined with tho gouoral operation of the now Locnl Government Act will mako it necessary for tlio ratepayers to pay more atteution to tho finances, and, in order to seouro judicious managemout, aim at tho election of moil of proved business capacityns their representatives. In tho opinion of many ratepayers through out the division tho office expenditure proper, some £506, couldv.be considerably reduced without lessoning its officienoy, nnd. if lam returned I will gladly assist in so reducing that expenditure. In Roino othor directions, I think, oconomy can bo scoured to tho advantage of tho ratepayers. Whilst thanking those gentlemon who havo promised to support me, 1 ask the ratepayers generally of No. 3 for their vote aud interest on polling day, SATURDAY, January 31. hours, 9 to 5, and if I urn returned I will tnoko it my first duty to consider your interests, nVid the good, management'- of the wlinld division.",, \ .
