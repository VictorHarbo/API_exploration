The South Australian Register. Adelaide: Saturday, January 13 1849. THE 'SAMUEL BODDINGTON,' FROM ENGLAND. The Samuel Boddington left London on the' 27th September, and Plymouth on the 8th of October, to which date our papers and advics extend. This vessel brings several cabin passengers, and 241 Government Immigrants; but, not withstanding the efforts of our shipping re- porter, he could not obtain the manifest or passenger-list in time for. our publication to- day. Her Majesty, the Prince Consort, and the royal children returned to London on the 1st October, .and on the 2d set out again for Os borne House. The Court having left BaI moral on Thurs day (he 28th September, arrived and embarked at Aberdeen . on the same evening; but the weatheV proving unfavourable, a relanding took place, and railway conveyance from Perth was adopted. On Saturday, September 30th, four of the most deeply implicated Chartists (William Dowling, William Lacey, Thomas Fay, and William Cuffey) were found guilty at the Cen- tral Criminal Court, and sentenced to trans portation for life. On leaving the dock, Dow- ling said, "This will be the baptism for Irish felony ;" Cuffey said to the Judge (Mr Baron Platt), "Good bye, my Lord ;" but the other prisoners withdrew in silence. It was clear from the evidence, some of which was fur- nished by former accomplices, that the organi- zation was most extensive ; the preparation of arms, ammunition, and combustibles very con siderable; and that murder, fire, robbery, and every species of violence were contem- plated by the Chartists in the intended demon- stration of their "patriotism." On the 2d October, in the same Court, se- veral of the remaining Chartist prisoners pleaded guilty. With one exeption (Ritchie), all who pleaded guilty were sentenced either to two years' or eighteen months' imprison- ment. Ritchie was sentenced to transportation for life. The trials of those who put in a plea of not guilty were to proceed in the usual way. Smith O'Brien and the other State prisoners bad been put on their trial. In the case of O'Brien, the jury was known to have retired to consider their verdict; but, up to the sailing of the Samuel Boddington, no account of the verdict had been received. A conviction was anticipated, and tho sentence of transportation for life was likely to follow. Some fatal cases of cholera had occurred at Hull — the two first being on board a large ves sel from Stettin, detained there in consequence of the Danish blockade. The Government had sent down Dr. Sutherland from the Ge neral Board of Health. Among the obituary notices, we find ac counts' of the deaths of Lord Geo. Bentinck, Lord Berwick, Lieutenant-General the Hon. George Murray, and Lady Frances Burrell. The death of Lord George Bentinck, which was sudden, was likely to lead to a re-union of the Conservative party. It is said that Mr Luke Hansard has been dismissed from the lucrative office of Printer to the House of Commons. The latest average price of wheat in the Knglish market was about 56s. per quarter. In wool there was an upward tendency, al though it was difficult to specify the improve ment. The corn harvest had proved only an average one; but the potato crop was to a considerable extent a failure, both in England and Ireland. Copper ores had a tendency upwards. The sales of South Australian copper ores at Swan sea, on the 2 1st September, 1848, were the following:— nuauA uuanA. 21 cwig. Produce.

In France, the aspect of tranquillity conti nued to be preserved— the most remarkable circumstance being the unqualified admission of Louis Napoleon to a seat in the National Assembly. In Spain the Duchess of Monfpensier had given birth to a daughter, and the sanity of the Queen was more than ever questionable. Sicily was not subdued, although Messina had fallen. Austria proposed a Congress of the European powers at Inspruck for the settlement of Italian affairs.
