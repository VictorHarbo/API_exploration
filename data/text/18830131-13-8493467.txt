Their duties will be to investigate the respective merits of the Westinghouse and the Woods automatic continuous brakes, with a view to ascertain and report as to which, if either, is the most suitable for adoption on the Vic- torian railways. The board have begun their labours, and have already subjected the two brakes to practical tests.

They tried to reach the eBcape drive at No 5 rise, but wero dru en back by tho water, and then took refuge in No 11 rise, from which, two days after wards, only five were reaoued alive 'J ha in quiry made it tolerably clear that the new drive waB much nearer the old workings than tbo plans allowed. I hese plana had beon madoby the former manager (\lr Douglas), a man of great ability and experience, and tho Burve)B wero implicitly relied upon by bia euc ccBBor (Mr Nicholas), also a man of good ro puto, who did not check them In two mattera Mr Nicholaa a own calculations were necessarily a matter of surmise and guess, and according to the evidence of an expert the gutter which was relied on as a gauge did not fall in a regular gradient of 1ft in 100ft , as the manager supposed In the Becond place, no allowance had been made by him for the gradient in the drivea, which would havo to bo deducted from the supposititious 22ft of reef above the new drive On the othor hand it was contended that Mr Nicholas a method of calculation waa tho only one available, as the old workings could not be entered to ascertain their relative position to the now mine lie put in twoboreB over- head to ascertain the height of the reef wash, but he did not take any other precautions, biB explanation being-lat That hia plana showed he waB far removed from an) danger ¿nd 'I hat ho believed the old w orkmga were drained by a culvert put in two )ears ago for that purpose, and which had carried off a great deal of water 3rd That ho appro hended no danger from tho ordinär) burBts in an alluvial mine, and that the) had ceaeed Two da)B heforo tho accident «hat ia called a ' fretting waa observed in the face, but from the evidence of moat of the vvitnesees this did not make the manager Btiepicioua of a quantity of water being above him The fact ib that tho "fretting created no apprehension m his mind or in the minÜB of tbo men who noticed it, and these were all experienced miners Before pushing any further tbo water broke in on the top of the drive, and at tho right hand side, about 3ft from the face It waa put to tho jury that aa there had been provioua buratB of water in that and the adjacent mino, moro care should havo been taken ni testing the ground It waB asked ought not the escape drive to have been continued to No 9 rise aa a provision for the Bafet) of tho men' Ought they not to havo been made thoronghly acqua nted with tho refuge within their reach' Had they gone to No 0 rise not ono life need have been lost 1 our of the men did not go to that nao, but as the) did not know it waa the highest ono in the mine, thoy left, and went to meet their death in No 11 nae At the same time, an escape drive waa the only really efficient means of safety, aa had the water happened to go higher than it did, even No. 9 riso would havo been flooded to the top Alarm signals-clear and well defined-should, it was urged, be provided, and Hood gatos erected in tho drivea As the Mining Acct dentB Act did not provide for these moana of safety being carried out, the law should be amended in this direction In reply, it was submitted that there was no evidence that Mr Douglas s plana were trustworthy He had laid down tho position of No 2 Bhaft in relation to No 1 workings ITence, if, as was eaid, No 2 shaft was 01ft nearer the old workings than Mr Douglas s survey showed, No 1 workings must alao be 55ft further hack One portion of the aurvoy could not be altered unless the whole was treated on the Barns basis It was quite poaaible that the water had forced Us way through the soft Beam along n great thickneas of reef According to the chief mining inspector, 20ft of reef would be no protection against water if the ground showed a soft vein At best it tv ob only surmise how much ground there wob between the new and the old work- ings, as the country waa too much honey- combed by the inundation to permit of a practical experiment being made. The coro- ner, in summing up, asked the jury to Bay whether in their opinion the deaths of the men were caused by the want of reasonable and ordinary precaution, amounting to gross negligence, on tho part of any person in the course of his duty. If Buch a verdict as this waB found, it should he expressly stated that it waB intended to bo equivalent to a verdict of manslaughter, or if the jury did not find grounds for going bo far as thla, thoy might find that the men lost their liveB through an error in judgment on the part of any person -an error which might bavo been com- mitted by an ordinarily careful manager Lastly, it was open to the jury to state that the men had been accidentally drowned In deciding these questions the jury must place themselves in the position of the mining manager before tho accident, and with all the influences and circumstances which surrounded him, and having done this the) must ask themselves what they, aa managers, would have felt, or thought, or done on his appointment to the mine about eight monthB ago It would not be fair to the manager to be wise after the event, and judge him accordingly. After three hours' deliberation, a verdict was returned to tho effect that the disaster was due to an error of judgment on the pact of the mining manager, in approaching too near the old workings, which contained a large body of water, whioh error of judgment nnt,ht have been com nutted by any ordinary mining manager, and which error tho jury believed resulted from mistake in the eurvey.
