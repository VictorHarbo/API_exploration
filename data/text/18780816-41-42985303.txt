FUL THE MAYOR OF ADELAIDE. In view of the forthcoming Election of Members to serve in the Legislative Council, we the undersigned have the honour to request that you will cause a Public Meeting to be called for an early date at the Town Hall, Ade laide, to afford electors an opportunity to decide upon the merits and fitness of the various Candidates. [Here follow 131 signatures/] In compliance with the above requisition, I hereby Convene a PUBLIC MEETING, to be held in the TOWN HALL, Adelaide, on TUES DAY, the 20th inst., at 7.30 o'clock pjn. Candidates are invited to attend. HENRY SCOTT, Mayor. Town Hall, Adelaide, August 14, 187S. ? 227 32 TO THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLA TIVE COUNCDL. Gentlemen — I beg to off er myself as a Candidate for one of the existing vacancies in the Council ; but at the same time I beg respectfully to inform yon that it is not my intention either to canvas or in any way to solicit your votes — I consider these matters to be your duties and not my busi ness. If my services are worth having it is surely worth your while to secure them by taking the trouble of electing me. Independent in cir cumstances, I have no object to promote in offering myself except our country's welfare, especially as I am dead against payment of members. Even if my health at the present moment allowed it, I should decline to go about amongst jou to electioneering meetings, now at one public- house new at another, as is too generally done at these times. Such conduct is, I think, unworthy of a gentleman or a legislator. The votes of the publicans and their friends may be secured by these means, but at the expense of how many a deeper stain upon the souls of the intemperate village politicians, who remain to drink and discuss the proceedings of these meetings over the tankard. As regards politics, I am decidedly against protection, against the present unequal tariff, and strongly in favour of Customs Unions with the neighbouring colonies, as well as the introduc tion of a modified property or income tax, com bined perhaps together, the expense of. the collection of the one and the odious inquisitorial character of the other being duly considered. Electors ! remember that no one class of the community can be injured by oppressive or unjust laws without its ultimately telling upon the whole community. I am also in favour of reforming the Constitu tion to prevent deadlocks and legislative obstruc tions. The administration of justice requires, I think, cheapening and simplifying, and our railway management appears to have something radically wrODg about it, and I should say wants a thorough overhauling. I am. Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, 22S-9vk B.HERSCHELBABBAGE. TO THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGIS LATIVE COUNCIL. I have been induced to offer myself as a Candidate at the ensuing Election, and I would now beg leave to state my views on the most important questions which are likely to come belore the Legislature during the present seat ion. LATV REF0H3T. I am in favour of giving unlimited jurisdic tion to the Local Courts in civil causes, with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court; thus making the present Supreme Court a Court of Appeal only in civil cases. In amending the law of insolvency I thick it would be well to give creditors more power and control over insolvent debtors and their estates than they now'have, and I should be in favour of repealing the penal clauses, leaving fraudu lent insolvents; to be punished by the Criminal Courts, and not as now by the Court of Insol vency. TAXATION. If we are to have additional taxation at all I think the time has now arrived when some general system of direct taxation should be devised. I am still of opinion that the plan I suggested in letters to the Register many years ago (Register, 31st May, 1859, and 13th May 1374) might be adopted, and if so the Customs duties, which it appears to me press unfairly upon the labouring classes and others in receipt of low-fixed incomes, might be abolished altogether, and Port Adelaide made a free port, giving this colony another advantage in addition to those she already has over the other colonies. I don't think we should have the exciseman and the taxgatherer too. And the system I have referred to would also prove a very wholesome check, now so much required on that reckless expenditure of the public funds which has been allowed to go on unchecked so long, and which has at length resulted In the present demand for additional taxation. EAIL-SVATS AND PUBLIC ?WORKS. I am in favour of a judicious outlay on re productive works, to be provided for by special vote from time to time, and not out of the annual income derived from taxation, which in my opinion should be applied to governing the country only and for no other purpose ; and I think the annual income and expenditure account should be kept quite separate from the Land Fund and Loans Accounts and accounts of expenditure authorized for special purposes. I should of course consider it a great honour to be elected as one of your representatives ; but as I think it was intended by our Ballot and Electoral Acts that you should be left per fectly free in the choice of your representatives, and that your votes should not be solicited by or on behalf of candidates, it is not my intention to appoint canvassers. I am yours faithfully, xvk W. D. SCOTT. TO THE ELECTOBS OF SOUfH AUSTRALIA. Gentlemen — I have on more occasions than one felt it necessary to decline being Nominated for the House of Assembly from a fear that I might not be able to give sufficient attention to public matters; but having no* rather more leisure, and believing that I can devote such thought and attention r-a the responsible posi tion of a member of tbe Legislative Council demands, I beg to offer my humble services to the Electors. My intimate knowledge of nearly all parts of the colony, and a tolerably extensive acquain tance with the inhabitants and their wants, may possibly be useful in assisting to mature useful schemes for the advancement of the colony. I firmly believe that the steps which are being taken for opening up the boundless resources of the country will be attended with the happiest ; results, and that a great and glorious future is before us, and I shall be proud to take some part in bringing tham to perfection. We none of as like taxation, bat I am con vinced that the rapid development of our resources by the jndicions prosecution of public vrorks will so increase the prosperity of all classes that we shall be able to bear without inconvenience the necessary burden which a large present expenditure will involve. I believe that the chief burden of taxation should, however, fall on those best able to bear it. 1 shall take such opportunity as may be afforded of expressing my views on things in general. I am, yours faithfully, 22&C7; C. B. YOUNG. ELECTOEAL HOTICES nr\O TBE ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLA X TIVE COUNCIL OF SOUTH AUS TRALIA. Gentlemen— At the request of a large number of Electors I have come forward as a Candidate for tbe honour of representing you in the Legis lative Council at the forthcoming Elections. If returned I will assist in altering the Constitu tion Act in the direction of making the Council more responsible to an expressed will of the Electors and also assist in passing all measures calculated to further the interests and develop the resources of the province. RICHARD VAUGHAN. Adelaide. 222mwfszcv O THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGIS LATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen — As one of the candidates for the honour of representing yon in the Legislative Council I respectfully place before jou an epitome of my views on some of the most important questions of the day which will shortly engross the attention of Parliament. One of the first will be the Reform of the Legislative Council, and the scheme brought forward by the present Government, though not perfect in detail, is I consider sound in prin ciple, as in the event of a deadlock or serious dispute between the two Houses of Parliament the voice of the people should ultimately prevail. I am also of opinion that considering the large increase of population that the present number of members in the Council is inadequate. EDrCATlON. The present Education Act has, I think, scarcely been a sufficient time in operation to fulfil all the anticipations formed of it, but con sidering that the old system had to be sup planted, and the great undertaking of erecting schcolhouses accomplished, which must have occupied a large amount of the attention of the Council, I feel reluctant to amend the Act, except in direction of enforcing the Compulsory Clauses in the thickly-settled districts, but with discretionary powers to the Minister of Educa tion. TAXATIOH. The remission of Customs Duties upon all articles of consumption except Wine, Spirits, and Beer, and npon all other articles that cannot be profitably made in the Colony, having regard to existing Industries, this I consider necessary, as I believe that the middle and poorer classes are paying more than tlieir fair share towards the government of the country. The present state of the Revenua alone without these remissions will require that some other system of Taxation be found, and I am in favour of a Tax upon Property. Thi3 is preferable to the increase of Customs Duties. The withdrawal of the Government Grant in Aid to District Councils and Corpo rations is entirely out of question, as I con sider they encourage enterprise and progress of the local bodies. LAND QUESTION. I would give every encouragement to the settlement of the country by the squatter by extending the leases of the runs in the interior and those lands unfitted for agriculture at a distance from the seaboard to say 30 years, at the termination of which the runs to be offered to competition at public auction, the Govern ment retaining the right of resumption by giving two years' notice ; improvements of a substantial and useful nature to be allowed for at a fair valuation either on resumption or termination of lease. I am in favour of reserving land for forest culture, education, and other necessary purposes; to an extent that will Dot interfere with the demands of the agriculturist. The object of land legislation should be to disburse the land among the people, rather than in the direction (as in past legislation) of making a small class of large landholders and a dependant tenantry. : EAILTTATS. The opening up of the countryj necessitating the construction of roads, I would prefer railways where practicable to main lines of roads, as lessening the cost of produce. The proposal of railway construction from Adelaide to Mount Barker, from Saddleworth to Clare, and the connection of the Northern lines with the Port Augusta line, is, I consider, necessary. Though anxious to connect this colony with our neighbours, yet there must be a delay until we are sure of tbe route taken by other colonies to meet us. PORT ADKIAIDB, OPTPOBTS, JETTIES, BTC. I would advocate the erection of an Outer Harbour at the Semaphore, so as to afford facilities to the large class of vessels which are now trading with us. Looking at the impor tance of our principal outports, such as Ports Augusta, Firie, Wakefield, Kingston, Rivoli, Lincoln, Victor Harbour, &c;, I view any attempt to divert the natural trade as suicidal to the best interests of the country, as by their development the cost of production is lessened, and a national gain must accrue. The deepening of Port Adelaide and other shipping-places should be pushed on vigorously, also the erection of Jetties of a larger and more useful description. IMMIGRATION. The introduction of Immigrants I consider necessary while we are constructing railways and other useful public works, but great dis cretion should be used by the Government so that the labour market does not become glutted thereby; but at all times I should prefer assisted to free immigration. I remain, yours respectfully, RICHARD VAUGHAN. TOTE FOR YAUGHAN. MARK YOUR VOTING-PAPER THUS. INGLEBY ? | MARTIN ? ...
