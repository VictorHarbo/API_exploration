THE VITAL STATISTICS OF QUEENSLAND. The twenty-ninth annual report on the vital (italieti 39 of tho colony has been prosented to both Housos of Parliament by Mr. W. T. Blakeney, tho Registrar-Gouoral. It states that the population of Queensland as estimated to the 31st of Decombor, 188S, was 387,463 persons, consisting; of 225,51o' males and 161,947 fontales, showing an iucrease during the year of '20,523 persons, oomposed of 10,985 males and 9538 females, the ratio of total in- crease in the estimated population us compared with tho estimate at the close of the previous year having beou 5-59 per cent, and the ratio of increase as regards the sexos oaloulatcd ou the same basis being 2-99 per cent males, and 2-60 per cent females. Tito ratio ol in- crease is not equal to that shown by the records of tho previous year comparing 18S7 with 1SS6, but is better than that Bhown between the rooords of 1885 and 1SSG. Tho increase lost year waa derived from tile excess of arrivals over departures by sea, from the natural iuorease by excess of births over deaths, and from the excess of interco- lonial traffic by railway over the border, whioh latter has now for the first time been taken into consideration. The increase to the population by the excess of arrivals over departures by soa and railway amounted to 11,805 persous-"267 males add -153a females, and the increase of births over deaths was S71S-371S males and ÖÜ00 females. The greatest immigration was in tho second quarter of the year, and the smallest in the ionrth. It ia frequently the case that tho fourth quarter shows the smallest increase, which is accounted for by the faot that many residents of Queensland go south during tho hot weather. The greatest inorease from natural causes was iu the third quarter. The ratio of immigration increase over the estimated population was 3'22 per cunt, aud tbo ratio of natural increase was 2-37. The im- migration inorease during 18SS was not equal to that in 1880 or 1887, aud very slightly in excess of that during 1S85, but on tho other hund the natural increuso was a little largor than that of 1887 and considerably in excess of any of the previous ten years. Of the 11,805 of the persous added to the population by oxcess of arrivals over departures 95SS wero over 12 years of age, IOS'2 wore between 1 and 12yours, and 117 wore infants. Amougst thoso classed as adults the proportion of males was nearly two to one in oxcess of the fomalos, whilo the proportion of the sexes amongst the infants and children was nearly e'qual. Eight hundred and thirty-five persons left the colony for China in excess of the arrivals from that country, and 944 Polynesians arrived from the islands in excess of the number which returned. The doparturo of females, however, oxceoded the arrlvuls by nineteen. There arrived from tho other colonies of Australasia 22,083 parsons, but onlv 18,998 loft Queensland for those places, and there was consequently au increaso from this source of 3085 persons, 2832 of whom wero males, nud 853 leinalos. With regard to the aliens at present in tho colony, tho report states their numbers as follows :-Chlnese, 8226 males, l8 females, total 8244 ; Polynesians, S067 mules, 000 fomalos, total 8007 ¡ other alion races, 1007 mulot, soven females, total 1014\. The Chinese and other aliens have decreased during 1888, the former by 925, and the latter by 433, while the Polynesians have increased to the extent of 467 persons. The proportion of tho soxos calculated on the wholo estimated population to 31st December is 71*81 f emules to overy 100 malos. Tho marriages registered during the year numbered 3254, being an increaso on tho num- ber registered in 1887 of 340. Tho marriage rate per 1000 of the mean population was S-G3 which is better than that of 18S7, which waa 8-21. Calculated on the estimated mean population, exclusivo of aliens, Hie mar- riage rate was 9-07 per 1000. Tho Viotoriuu marriage rate, whioh was S-03, is tho only one of the other colonies whioh approximates to that of Queensland. The rato m Now Zealand, 5-97, was tho lowest of any of the colonies, aud this was also the case in 1887. Calculated on tho number of persons married to overy 1000 of tho moan population, the Queensland rate for last year was 17*20 per 1000, and excluding uliens it was 18*02. The greatest number of marriages registered was in the second quarter of 1888 namoly, 813, and the smallest in tho first quarter-namely, 789. The largest iuoronso in any one reiriatry district appears in Oxley, whioh includes within its boundaries some im- portant suburbs of tho metropolis. Tho number of marriages oelebrated by tho various religious denominations and in the registry offices is shown by the following figures:-Church of England 89G, increase 129 ; Church of Home 682, increaso 94 ; Presbyterian and United Presbyterian 540, increaso 42; Primitive Methodist 260, increaso 35 ; Wesleyan Metho- dist 191, decrease 7 ; Lutheran M5, increaso 20; Congregational 107, increaso 13; Baptist 91, decrease ó ; United Mothodist Froo Church 19, inorease 1 ; Church of Christ 9, increase 5 ; Biblo Christian 7, decrease 3 ; Particular Baptist I, decrease 8; Now Jerusalem Church, 3; Hebrew Churoh 1, decroase 2; Salvation Army 7, increase ti ; Catholic Apoklolio Churoh 2, increaso 2 ; Registration and ,1 usticos Marry- ing Aots 284, increuso 12. Tho percentage in crease of marriages in 1888 was much greater than in any year since 188(5, and oven exoeedod that increase by 0*42 per cent. The greatest number of marriages celobratod during the last ton years in the colony has been by the Church of England, the Church of Romo comos next on the list, and is followod by the Presbyterian Churoh. Of the numbor of men married 1091 were born in England or Wales, 565 were nutives of this colony, 520 wore born in Ireland, and those horn in Scotland numbered 354\. Of the women who were married 991 wero born in the colony, 848 in England, 1594 in Ireland, and 235 in Scotland. Four hun- dred and seventy marriages took place between mon and women bom in Englaud, and simi- larly 310 Irish and 315 colonial couples woro united in wedlook. The next number of inter- marriages of any importance-namely, 290, took place between men natives of England to women born in Queensland. Marriages of men of alien races, Buoh as Chinese, Polynesians, and East Indians, show the following results : -Four Chinamen were married to English- women, 2 to Queensland-born women, 1 to a woman horn in New South Wales, 1 to a woman born in Ireland, 1 to a Danish woman, and 1 to a woman of the same race as himself. In the whole 10 Chinamen were married in 1888. There wore 12 Polynesian maloB married in that year, of whom 7 wero married to Polynesian women, 2 to women born in Queensland, 2 to English women, and 1 to an Irish woman. 80-33 per cent of the marriages took place in respect of personB who married for tho first time. Tho marriages in which men married widowa formed 5*22 per cent, females married to widowers 5-59 per cent, and 2-80 por cent of tbo marriages wero between widowers and widowa. Two men who had been divorced were married to spinsters. The number of persons who signed the marriage certificate with a mark was 260, and by a strange coin- cidence this was oxactly the same number as wa« recorded for the previous year. The report, howover, Bhowa that the number of persons married who are unable to write is gradually decreasing. In the year' 1877 tho mean proportion was 10-D0 percont, and last year it was but 4-00. It is added that tbo proportion of person« who signed the marriage register with a mark in England was nearly double that of the proportion of such persons in any of the Australasian colonies in the year 1867 and 1886 respectively. The mean age of parties married in Queensland in 18S8 was for men 27-75 years, and for women 23*34 years. The proportion of tho greatest number of those who married at the same age-namely, C3 men and C3 women at 21 years-to the total num- ber married was 1*94 per cent ; aud the propor- tion of minors married waB in the case of men 3-56 per cent and of women 28*37 per cent. The youngest person married amongst the men was one at 16 yearn, and amongst the women three at 14 years. The most noticeable disparity in age between the parties at time of marriage during the year under review was a man of 49 years to a woman of 27 years, so that there was no instance of any extreme dissimi- larity in age amongt>t those married in 1888. The age at which the greatest number of iu9n -namely, 323, were married was 26 years; and the greatest number of women-namely, 625, were married at 21 years. The oldest man married was 70 yea», and the oldett woman married 57 year«. The greatest num- ber of moa married at the ago of 24 years and the greatest number of women nt 21. The report "tutos that it is evident, from the records of the department that a con- siderable number of fornidos misrepresent their age. wheu about 21, so as to escape the neces- sity of obtaining parouts' or guardian's consont to their marriago. Something should be done j to provent such a state of _ things cither by making the form of declaration moro compre- hensive or by logislatiug to do away with the necessity of a miuor requiring consent to mar- riage uuder the SUtute when say 16 years of age. Tho number of birtliB registered during the year waa 14,247, whioh was in the proportion of 3*78 to every 100 persons ia tho moan population. The proportion the previous year was 3-S1 per cent. Of the 1-1,247 births registered 7299 were males, and 6918 females. The number of births registered since 1S84 are as follow :-1884, 10,679; ISSii, 11,672; 1886, i.,5S2; 1337, 13,513; 1SS8, 14,247. The birth rate for the varions Australasian colonies for tho year 18S8 was as follows : Queensland, 37*77 ; Wostorn Australia, 3G-09 ; New South Wales, 36*18 ; South Australia, 33*81; Tasmania, 33*U ; Victoria, 32-45; New Zealand, 31*22. The birth rate in Queensland was also_ higher in 18S7 than auy of the other colonies. Tho number of illegitimate children born during the your was 588-males 306, females 2S2 ; this is a deoreose of 19 ou tho number recorded iu the provioua year. Tho proportion of illegitimate births to tho total number ia 4*13 percent as against 4-49 per cent iu 1387. It does not, however, appear that illegitimacy is auy less provalout hore than it was tea years ago. The proportion of illegitimate births in the various parts of the colony was as follows :-Brisbane, 181 : Ken- nedy, 34; Maryborough, 31; Rookhampton, 3t; Maokay, 29; Oxley, 28; Townsville, 20; Westwood, 14; Ipswich, 11; Caboolture, lu; Bundaberg, S; Cairns, 7; Marauoa, 3. There was one case of tripiots, and tho children woroall mules. Tho births of 263 twin children wero registered, of which 135 wero uialeB and 125 females. Only 210 twin childrou wero registered in 18S7. Tho mortality in 1888 waa greater than iu tho previous yoar, making duo allowance for tile iuoroase ot population, but uumorically los» than in 1886. The total number of deaths wa« ÛÔ29, including 3581 males and 1948 females, lu 18S6, 6238 persons died, aud iu 1887, 5529. Tho proportion of deaths registered in 18S8 to tho moan population was M*(16 pur 1000, whioh slightly oxeeeda that of 1887, whioh was tho lowest reoorded since 1831. The death-rate in England iu 1887 was 18-8 per 1000 persons living, and tho avorago for tho seveu years ending 1SS7 was 19-2 per 10Ü0, with which tho present death-rato in Queens laud compares veryfavourably. Tho following is tho doath-rnto in the Australasiun colonies for the year 1888 per 1000:-New Zoalaud, 9*43; South Australia, 12*09; New South Walos, 13*54 ; Queensland, 14-66 ; Tasmania, 14*12 ; Viotoria, 15-30; Woätcni Australia, 10-00. Tho death-rato has dooroaaed in 1888 in all tho colonies except in New South Wales and Queensland, bue tho increase in both thoso places ¡b very slight. The actual number of Chinese, Polynesians, and persons of other alien races who died in Queensland during 1888 was: Chinese, 100; Polynesians, 524 ; persons of other alien races, 20\. The greatest mortality has been in the fourth quarteri of tho year, tho first quartor being that in whioh tho next greatest number of deaths was registered. In the second and third quarters tho number of deaths registered wero nearly the same, the deaths in the third quarter exceeding tho second by 70 pot-sous. The following extraot shows tho oxaot number of doaths rogibtored each quarter :-First quarter, 1319; second quarter, 1231; third quarter, 1304 ; fourth quarter, l61.. The month of October was the most fatal, in which 550 doaths woro recorded. Novorabor was the next with 547 deaths, and Dcoombor tlio next with 515. It esoauis au extraordinary coiucidunue thai the number of deaths iu those threo months should be so nearly oqual, only five doutha more in October m whioh the grcatost number, was reoordod in any month of 1833, than in Dooember the smallest uumbor registered in any month of the fourth quartor, whioh quartor oontained the greatest rooord of mortality during the yoar. The month of May was that in whioh the least number of doaths was registored. The following ia the record of deaths in eaoh mouth of 1888 : Percentage Month. Persons. to total Don tin.

Tho «aine remarks applied to the Brisbane district, i In this district deaths wore most numerous j during Ootober and Novombor, 121 deaths having beon registered in the formor month, aud 122 in tho latter. The months of | March, May, and Juno woro those in whioh the least number of deaths took placo, tho number reoorded having boon nearly equal-in March and May 65 and in Juno C7. Tlio deaths rogisterod in tho urban district was 700, and in the suburban 700, a total of 1020. Doaths occurred in institutions situated within the registry district of Brisbano an follows ; General Hospital 211, Lady Uowen Hospital 2, Children's Hospital 29, Lock Hospital 1, Dia- mantina Orphanage, Infants' Asylum 9, Luna tio Reception Houae 2, Brisbane Gaol 4, and Immigration Depot 4, total 203, aa compared with 247 in tho year prooeding. The per- centage of deaths in theso institutions to tho total deaths in the Brisbano district was 25*78, or 2*53 per oont highor than in 1887. Daring the year 2309 children died boforo thoy reached 6 years of ago, and of these 2057 wera under 2 years old. The rate per cent to tho total deaths was 41*76, an increase of 0*41 on tho previous twelve months. Tho rate por oont in ISagland and "Walos in 1887 was 38*47, while the rates per cent in tho other Austral- asian colonies in the samo year were as follow ; Western Australia, 43*02; Now South Wales, 41*79; South Australia, .'¡O-OD; New Zealand, 39*18; Victoria, 3G-90; Tasmania, 30-27. The rate per cent in Queensland had been steadily increasing sinco the yoar 1884, when it was only 33*95 per cent. Of the 14,247 births reoorded in tho colony in 188S 1719 of the children bora died whilo under the ago of 1 year. The infantile mortality was therefore 12*07 per cent, which was somewhat higher than in the previous twelve months, but was under the average rate for the last fivo yoars. It waa also loss than the infantile mortality in Victoria and Western Australia, and compared favourably with the English rate-142 per 1000\. Eioluding deaths under !> years, the greatest proportion whioh took place lu any quinquennial period was between tho ages of 20 and 25. The greatest proportionate increase in deaths in any quinquennial period was in persons between those ages also. Further, during the previous year the greatest proportion was between those ages. The following are the total numbor of deaths recorded in 1888 in each class into which the system of arranging fatal diseases is divided, with the increase or decrease on tho previous year:-Zpmotio diseases 1109, increase 103 ; perasitio9, decrease 8 ; dietic 150, inorease 21 ; constitutional 818, increase 35; developmental 340, increase 36; local 2387, ulerease 210; violence 593, decrease 0 ; ill-defined and hot specified causes 87, decrease 28. Aa was usual in Queensland for some years past, the greatest number of deaths recorded in the colony were caused by phthisis, which proved fatal to 492 persons-3S8 males and 124 females. The proportion of deaths from phthisis was 13-04 to every 10,000 of the mean population, which was a little over the rate in the previous twelve months, but with that ex- ception was much leas than the rate in any year ] J during the last quinquennial period. Tho rceords showed that the greatest uumbor of deaths from phthisis took place between the agc* of 20 and 45, and the proportion of «viles was much greater than that of femaUsa. Tho death rate in Queensland from phthisis was lower than that in England or Viotoria, and ( thore could be little doubt it was considerably I increased in this colony by persons coming to it hoping to obtain benefit from tho warmer climate. Tho rate was further augmented by tho numerous deaths of Polynesians-a raco peculiarly snsoeptiblo to tho disease. If out of I tho totul number of deaths those of Chinamen aud Polynesians and thoso who had not resided in the colony for more than twelve months ' wero excluded, the death rate from this J disease would ha only S'OS, a rato lower than all tho other colonies, Diarrha caused the next greatest number of deaths, j This was a disease more particularly fatal to tho children of the colony. Convulsions carno next, followed by pneumonia, toothing, dysen- tery, bronchitis, and typhoid fever in the order named. The proportion of deathB by violonco ' in Queensland, 15*77 to every 10,000 of tho mean population, was larger than in any of tho ofher colonies except "Western Australia, and waB very muoh greater thau in England and Wales. The revenue recoivod by the office from feos in connection with tho registering of births, marriages, and deaths during the year waB £490 odd, a low shillings over,tho receipts 'of the previous year.
