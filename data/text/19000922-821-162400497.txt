I TRADE AND FINANCE. REVIEW OF THE WEEK. There is as yet no break in the dull pas toral outlook. Wool is coming to Land fairly freely, though the total to date is not quite up to, last year. It has been de cided to postpone the opening sale here eo as to approximate with dates in the other colonies, and to follow the London auctions, which commence on October 9. There is likely to be an unusually large quantity of clip shipped to London for disposal this season in the hope of better prices ruling later on. The lists for the next sales have been closed. There are 366,000 bales to be ' disposed of, a total not equalled for years. Even if trade revives considerably it cannot be hoped that this huge quantity of raw material will be cleared off all at once, and buyers are sure to make the most of it hanging over the market. The October auc tions will be the fifth series of the year, and the way in which available supplies have mounted up in London this year will be seen from the following figures for each series:-First, 185.000 bales; second, 256,000 bales; third, 288,000 bales; fourth, 286,000 bales; fifth, 366,000 bales. New arrivals were 251,000 bales, the largest quantity tor the period of the year since 1896. Only 43,000 bales were forwarded direct to manu facturing centres, an exceptionally smali amount. The following shows the available total at the fifth series qf London sales for the last five years:-1890, 314,000 bales; 1897, 174,000 bales; 1898, 230,000 bales; 1899, 195,000 bales; 1900, 366,000 bales. Butter is | not coming forward for export in as large quantities as expected, but it is neverthe less considered likely that if present con ditions continue the colony will have nearly twice the quantity to dispose of as last year. BKEADSTUFFS. Messrs. John Darling & Son, in their mar ket report dated September 17, write as follows: Wheat.-European markets arc reported as being slightly firmer, and while values of cargoes ot Australian wheat near at hand are not quoted aa over 31/3 per 480 lb., c.i.f. cargoes, for shipment : during October, are reported as having been sold at 32/ per 460 lb., c.i.f., which' represents to day's value. Wheat on spot has ruled quiet, and the amount of business passing is extremely small owing to the indisposition on the part of holders <o arc-opt the reduced price offered by buyers, and the difficulty on the part of buyers to find a sat isfactory outlet in the markets of the world. While the tone of the linglish market lias improved, the shipowners have in the meantime been able to es tablish a higher rate of freight, and as the cur rent rates a short time ago were 82/0 per ton O.U.K. or Continent, they have now advanced to 35/ per ton for spot or to arrive vessels, and afc this rate tonnage is difficult to secure, so that for the moment the advance that lias (alien place in the English market does not benefit the producer, as the shipowner is reaping the whole advantage. Values of wheat at Port Adelaide may l>e given as 2/10 to 2,'10J per bushel, with a steady mar kef. In Victoria a similar state of things pre vails as far as tonnage is concerned, and also offer ing!) of wheat, and (lie market, although steady, does not show any great amount of firmness. Values there may be given as 2/1'.'J to 2/11 per bus hel f.o.b. for prime .samples of wheat, at which .mine business is said to have been carried through for October shipment. Jn New Hontli Wales verv little is doing, and quotations are given as 2/!)i tn per lni=,hel on trucks Darling Harbour, for f^a.q. Flour meets with no response, aud the slight im provement recorded in wheat is not reflected in any way on the flour market, which remains ex tremely dull and depressed. .Slocks are heavy, and the general disposition is to work even at a're duction rather than continue holding. Values of ordinary brands may be given as £5 17/0 to £6 per ton. and £0 6/ per ton for best patent roller f.o.b. l'ort Adelaide, with only a very limi ted business doing. Victorian markets are equally dull, and quotations there range from £5 17/0 to £0 for country, and £fi 2/0 to £0 5/ per ton for best patent roller, f.o.b. Sydney market is quiet, with very little business passing, at £5 17/6 and £<i 5/ per ton, for ordinary and patent roller respectively. Hian and Pollard. liran, owing lo limited supplv, commands a fair trade at late rates, viz., i)d. per bushel delivered ill Adelaide. Pollard is quiet at lOd. to ]0.1d. per bushel. Victorian markets nro fairly stead v, ani quotation range from »d. to 0',d. per bushel for In an. and laid; for pollard.

Oats, -No new feature to report in Hie market, which remains quiet, with only a retail trade passing and quotations still stand at from 2/2 to 2/i per bushel for dun and Algerian feed quality delivered m Adelaide. Victorian markets are steady, but <|l"et lit 2/1 and 2/4 per bushel for feed anil mill ing Algerians respectively. Tasmania!) and New Zealand markets are being patronised for shipment, principally to South Africa and China, and ship ping rates may be given as about 2/ per b 11=11 el f.o.b., shipping ports. Cornsackj;.-Although the amount of business passing is extremely limited, rates are fairly well maintained 011 spot at !i/G per dozen, and to arrive, September-October shipment at Calcutta, values may be given as 5/4 lo S/fi per dozen in all colonies. Ilranbags are steads- in all (olonies at 4/ to 4/1J per dozen. Till} BUTTER Tll.VDH. Hie butter export season is now com mencing in earnest. The mail steamer Vic toria, which left the Semaphore for Lon don last week, 'look (S23 boxes of South Australian produce, bringing the total to date, since the opening shipment, to 2,737 boxes, compared with 2,140 boxes to the same date last year. The Victoria.also had 230 tons from Melbourne, and from Sydney 1,605 boxes, so that altogether she carried nearly 300 tons of Australian butter for the London market. The attention which is being given to our produce by European competitors is one of the best testimonies as lo its quality. It will be interesting to see where (Jreat Britain obtained her sup plies last year. Very timely indeed is Weddel & Co.'s re view of the Australian dairy produce season for 1899-1900, a copy of which reached us by Monday's mail. Total imports from Aus tralasia during the eight months from September, 1899, to April, 1900, were 24,772 tons, an iucrease of 10,948 tons. The colo nies ranked as suppliers in this order-Vic toria, New Zealand, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland. Regarding prices, there was a still further approxima tion between choicest and finest qualities, and it is remarked that this peculiar posi tion of the market values of these two grades does not coincide with their intrin sic qualities. 'Jlie market difference is not more than 4/ per cwt., the intrinsic, diffe rence at least 10/ per cwt. A properly orga nized, Court to regulate the sale of Australian butter, it is thought, would cause choicest brands to bring jd. to Id. per ttj. more than at present. The average price for the season was 103/4, compared wit A 103?G in 1893-9. Danish choicest was, on an average, 9/5 higher. "Among agents various reasons are advanced to explaiu these fact." the principal being t,hat Australasian butter ? is not. so good as it was, while Danish is getting better. Any one well acquainted, however, with both butters, knows this is not so. Australasian butter gets better every year, and is now so close in its in trinsic merits to Danish thai t very large qua Q titiea of it are retailed at the same price. That some of the Australian brands suffer ed from fishiness this season, and that this particular flavour much reduced the value of those brands, is true, but the figures quoted include the top quotations of all of the 'choicest*' brands, and therefore the falling off in quality of an odd brand here and there does not afreet the question or comparative top.yalue to Danish. In New Zealand butter lor example, fishiness is al most unknown, and it tis recognised by everybody that New Zealand butter has im proved year by year, until it is pressing Danish very hard in the matter of Quality, yet the figures quoted include New Zealand. The principal reason, however, for the tem porary increased disparity in prices during the season 1890-1900 was the diminished supply of Danish, and the greatly increased fluantitv of Australasian butter m the mar ket." Regarding the new season's prospect it is remarked:-"Although, there are indi cations that the prosperity of the country is likely to be adversely affected by the wars in South Africa and China it is doubtful if the decline will be serious. Whether the value of dairy produce will next season show a higher level than in 1899-1900 de pends largely upon the supply, which at the present moment looks as if it would be mucn greater than in season just closed." An English journal remarks:-"The cost of our imported bubter last year was no les6 than £17,213,516, which is a greater sum than had ever been paid before for this' product. The quantity was 3.389,851 cwt., which is also a maximum. The con tributing countries were Denmark, 1,430,052 cwt.; Australasia, 366,944; France, 353,942; Holland, 284,810; Canada, 250,083; SwedeD, 246,539; United States, 159,137;- Germany, 36,953; all other countries, 262,331. Work ing these out in percentages, we get the following results:-Denmark, 42.2 per cent.; Australasia, 10.8; France, 10.5;- Holland, 8.4; Canada, 7.4; Sweden, 7.2; United States, 4/7; Germany, 1.1; other countries, 7.7. Argentina, Russia, and Italy have not yet emancipated themselves from the ob scurity involved in 'other countries,' under which head, however, Germany is rapidly qualifying for inclusion. It will be noticed that last year Denmark sent us exactly four times as much butter as France. Moreover, whilst France sent us 15.4 per cent, of our imports of butter in 1896, she only contri buted 10.5 per cent, in 1899. Simultaneous ly, Australasia advanced from 7.2 per cent, in 1896 to 10.8 per cent, in 1899, and Canada from 2.9 per cent, to 7.4. The Canadian trade is expanding more regularly and with fewer fluctuations than the Australasian.' Prior to 1870 Danish butter was scarcely known in London, but since 1886 the pro gress has been by leaps and bounds. Russia is doing much to increase her supplies, and with the increase of cold stores even the Australian farmer cahuol- afford to alio gether ignore what a country with an oppo site climate is doing. 1 lie Russian Govern ment sent specialists to Denmark, and these have since been propagating up-to-date knowledge even as far as Asiatic Russia.. The fact that butter trains arc dispatched from Omsk to St. Petersburg, a distance of. 2 200 miles and a seven (lays' journey, speaks for itself. French producers are now being urged to regain their hold upon the London market, so that it is abundantly clear that Australia needs to adopt the very best methods of production in order to keep in the race. SCIl'.NCr. IN DAIRYING. Rv.no means the least interesting exhibit at the annual Show was that of dairy pro duce, and the new system of judging butter by points should have the eti'ect ol again drawing attention to the necessity tor science to be united with labour in the daiiy. Rearing on this it may be noted that a leading dairy farmer, Mr. I'itzher bert. of Fielding, New Zealand, has recently been drawing attention to the extraordi nary advantages to lie derived from syste , ma tic dairy cattle testing. Although by no means enthusiastic at lirst, his experience lias convinced hi'iu that the keeping of sys r lematie records of the quantity and qua I lity of individual milk yields-by means ot ' the scales and the Rabeock test-so that the true value of each cow may be ascer tained, the culling of the herd according 1 to the result of these records, and the selec tion of the heifers according to the same standard, is the solid foundation trom i which all dairying success rises. The value of this record lie describes as practically incalculable. Amongst the reasons why this record should be kept, Mr. Fitsshnrbert enu merates:-(1) It enables the weeding out ot unprofitable animals, and replacing them bv animals of superior merit, thus increas ing prolit: (2) it indicates which cows calves will probably be the best to rear and which to dispose of; (3) at enables the selection of animals that make the best use of the food given them; and (4) it en hances the value of the herd and the sell ing price of both cows and calves. LAMBS. Business was done in lambs for expo"t at this week's market, but transactions are not expected to. assume importance for a. week or so yet. The feature of this year s imports of meat into the United Kingdom is the large decrease in live animals. Tnc supplv of chilled and frozen bee! lias in creased, but that o,f inulton and lamb has decreased. Since it is ihe latter in which South Australian growers arc interested it may be noticed that from January 1 tu August. 4 imports of live sheep showed a falling oil" of 109,/77 head, and ol froztn sheep and lambs of 120,640 carcasses. Com plaints have been made iu New .Zealand of the existence of a ring of buyers ol inij1. ton, and in consequence a member oi L.i. New Zealand Assembly has introduced a measure entitled the Meat Export, tym panies Limitation of Profits ISill. i h . mover explained that the Rill was in tended to prevent rings and combinations. A New Zealand ring of sheep buyers existed, who fixed a price, beyond which thoy agreed not 'to go, until the monopoly had built up a. trust detrimental alike to small anu large breeders. 'II i e seconder of the motion stated that it was time something was done to control the ring that had been formed to the detriment of the settlers. Another member testified that the farmc-S were nc,t getting a fail- price for their slice,) on account of the monopoly that existed. He contended that it was a legitimate function of the State to limit the profits of such monopolies in the interests of the dooi)le. Mr. Hovnsby said that for tw - years and- a half he had agitated that some thing should be done to curb the monopoly that had grown up in connection with tin", meat Comnanies. Mr. Field said the profit made bv one Company on its paid-up capi tal was 90 per cent., and it was the duty of the Government to see that these profits should go into the pockets of the producers, not the shareholders in the Company. The Premier said that one Company had obtain ed £70,000 on a paid-up capital of £40,000. It was no use the Government reducing railway charges. lie had no doubt that the . monopoly existed, and leave was given to introduce the Bill. , The same ring is eaii to operate in Melbourne, but fortunately South Australia is as yet free in this re 61!ece- TALLOW. Rather better business was done last week at. the London taliow sales at un altered prices. South Australia is an im porter -and not an exporter at present. The results of the last five sales as oabled to us arc as follows: Medium Medium Casks Offered. August 13 .. 2,825 August 22 .. S.«0 Angust '29 .. 2,250 * September 5.. 1 .058 September 12 1,125 weoL. - London advices with reelect to wool are not favourable. The Bradford market is depressed, and tops, according to public cables, have declined id. per lb;, being quoted at I9d. and 20a. respectively. A private advice gives supers ai worth only lOJd The latent local development is the postponement of the opening; sales of t?ne season iA Adelaide. These were originally fixed for September 27, out they have now been put oft till October 15. Arrangements have been made for the large -weeluy sales auctions will commence on October 7. The clip is now reaching tahe seaboard, but so far shows a decrease on last year. For the week ended September 14 3,700 bales and 30 bags were received at Port Adelaide by rail and 543 bales and 2 bags by sea. The total arrivals since the commencement of the present statistical year have been as follows: -Hy rail, July I-September 14, 1900, 8,139 bales, 88' bags; corresponding period, 1899, 8,35S bales, 80 bags; decrease, "1900, 219 bales; increase, 8 bags.

Last week s shipments comprised 93 bales, shipped for London by bhe R.M.S. Victoria. Elder, Smith, & Co., Limited, are advised by their London house that the wool mar ket in Europe still continues depressed. Bradford OQ's tops are quoted at 19d., and 64's at 19Jd. Merino sheepskins in London have dropped Ad. to $d. on the prices six weeks ago. ARGENTINA PROGRESS. The latest report of the Secretary of the British Legation at Buenos Ayres testifies to the extraordinary rapidity of the deve lopment of agricultural and commercial prosperity in Argentina. It is pointed out that the imports, which in 1895 amounted to 95 millions of dollars in gold, were near ly 117 millions- last year. The recent in crease is mainly in textile goods. Exports also increased from 120 million dollars in 1895 to 285 millions last yeaT. Between 189S and 1809 the increase was over 51 million dollars, half of which was accounted for by increased exports of wool, while the in crease in wheat exports was over a million tons. Of the total exports France took 4l£ millions, Germany 294, Belgium 241, and the United Kingdom 21} millions. The increase in the area of land under wheat in the last decade lias been remarkable. In 1890-91 it was about three million acres, while last year it was about 74 mill'ons. The extension of railways recently has also been very considerable, amounting to about G25 miles in two years. In spite of the p;reat prosperity of 'the Argentine, however, the report adds that the numerous warn ings against British immigration there con tained in recent Consular reports hold good. "Colony after colony has, from one cause or another, failed in its purpose. From a report »y the \ ice-Consul at Buenos Ayres, which has also been just issued, it appears that the population of the Republic, which in 1809 was 1,877,490, was in 1895 over four millions. Italians still form more than half the immigrants, Spaniards coming next in importance. CUSTOMS REVENUE.

A question was asked at the annual meet ing of the .Farmers' Oo-operative Unioii on Friday respecting freights, lu the follow ing from tlie Melbourne "Argus informa tion which cannot fail to be of interest to all farmus is conveyed:-"We have re ported lately the chartering of several sail ing vessels, and now give the following complete list to date, which includes two or three not previously reported:-Halmore, steel barque, 1,33S tons net; Catharina, iron barque, wood-sheathed, 9S9 tons ner. The foregoing arc absolutely ior wheat from Victoria or ^oulii Australia. . the following have all options, and may go on tlie berth to lake general merchandise for London:-Amphitritc, iron Ship, 1,CS3 tons net; Ainazone, steel barque, 1,33!) tons net; Dili-bridge, steel ship, -J,121 tons net; ln veivnaid, -sU'el barque, 1,312 tons net; Lonsdale, steel ship, 1,085 tons net; Ma rion \\\ Doilside. In nearly every ease tlie* rate of freight is Ha,' tier ton dead weight. In addition, the Loeli sailers have been taken up for wool well ahead. Tlie chartering for ihis time of tlie year is small, shippers being deterred from entering into engagements for next season by the high freight limitations. Hut, on the other hand, it is understood that more tonnage ^ill be required for wool during the coming sea son Chan lust season, while it is pretty cer tain that .South Australia will have an un usually large exportable surplus of wheat, and thai in all probability Victorian and ltiveriua will also he able to ship on a very full scale. The circumstances, in their en tirety, do not. however, encourage char tering. I'or, while the position is a complex one. ye! a great deal may happen before the pressure to ship new .wheat in January and February next will be felt to its full ex tent." The al>ove coincides, with what has been written in this column for some weeks past. lrIi 12IC11TS AXD NITRATE. - The export of nitrate from the west coast of fSoutli America considerably affects freights. Local advices state thai there has been recently a "break in nitrate freights, which" have given way about 8/. Total exports of nitrate from Chili last year were 1,273,84b tons, valued at £7,248,771, which was an increase on 1898. It is estimated that the world's consump tion of nitrate last year was somewhat m excess of Chilian supplies. Great Britain and Germany take the largest quantifies from South America. LONDON EXCHANGE. The Associated Banks have made an alte ration iu the rate of exchange on London Buying rales have been raised from 2/C to 5/ per cent. Selling rates are unaltered. This movement is expected at the opening of the produce season. Quotations now are: -Huving-5/ per cent discount, demand 7/6 do. do,., 30 days; 10/ do. do., CO days; 17/6 do. do., 90 days; 25/ do. do., 120 days.

Thif Stock was shipped by Messrs. W. R, Catr^ and Oo. Trade with Java in other respects is growing, and it is {*> be hoped that ft market can be found for South Australian' liorses also.
