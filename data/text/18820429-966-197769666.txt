Greatest, grandest, legitimate, most refined and talented Circus Company ever before in Australia. No act placed in the arena that wearies the eye or offends the ear. Nothing beard in the performance that has been retailed for the last half-century. All the senses of our patrons fully studied, so that nothing but pleasure will arise from a visit to our establishment. TEN GREAT CLOWNS, and but one of them opens his mouth. Forty- four trained thoroughbred horses, twentysix purd grey Arabian Stallions, ten cunning little Pomes, and all educated to the highest pitch of perfection. The wonderful fire horse Salamander, king of the blazing zone (the equine wonder of the world)—a horse who leaps through 3 ft. hoops enveloped in flames. Lord Williams, the champion leaping horse in the world, a horse that jumps over the backs of three full-grown horses and a 6 ft. gate —a fea* nover before attempted by any other horse in existence. A NEW ERA IN ABENIC ENTERTAINMENTS. The old time " gag"—" See one circus you see ail"— does not apply to this gigantic organization, for you witness performances never before produced in circus arena We have the only DEN OF GENUINE AFRICAN LIONS in the world—not scraggy, mangy cabs such as you see with nearly every circus travelling, but GENUINE DENIZENS OF THE AFRICAN JUNGLES—and their Trainer, EDWARD DJERLING, will enter their cage, and put them through a variety of evolutions, running over the top of the cage, jumping over banners, leaping through hoops of fire, &c.;, forming the most thrilling and sensational act ever witnessed. AND ONE TICKET ADMITS TO ALL. The only show that relies entirely upon its merits. The most elegant and comfortably Qtted up circus that has ever visited the colonies. PRICES OF ADMISSION: Dress Circle, 5s.; Stalls, 3s. ; Pit, 2s. Children under ten, half-price. I faithfully promise to my patrons to present arenic entertainments of a superior character to any that have ever been witnessed in the colonies, and the public can be the judges.
