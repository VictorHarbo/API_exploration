Til* Gtxam Rams ih the Meerkt.— Oi Monday there was a report at Liverpool that the steam ram lately lying in the Great lloat at Birkenhead had slipped out into the fog on the pretence of a triul trip. It turned out that it was tbe other ram, El Mo nafesir(the Victory), which was temporarily taken out of Messrs. j Laird's large graving dock, at their shipbuilding works, made a ringle turn in the river, with the aid of tugboits, and then wcot into the dock ngain, the manoeuvre having been performed to f-nabk1 asolber vesFel under repair to enter the graving dock. On Tuesday no small excitement was occasioned at Plymouth among naval circlcs, by a rumour that the promoters of the iron rams in the Mersey threatened to send tbem to sea by force, and tbat a man of war was wanted there to intimidate ihcm. Ihe screw frigate Liverpool was at first spoken of as to be cent tbere, and the postponement of a court-martial upon one of her oflicers took place. Afterwards tbe new iron-plated veFEtl, the Pi ince ConFort,wun ordered to be manned, provisioned, and stored for that destination ; and she panned the Sound the same evening eu route for Liverpool, On the same day a body of seamen arrived in Liverpool to reinforce the crew of her Majesty's ship Majcstic, and in the afternoon a body of armed marines was landed, end, backed by this force, Mr. Morgan, of the Customs, took formal posscstioo of Kl Tousson, lying ia the great float, ana Of El Wonawir, lylog in an unfinished condition in Messrs, Laird'i? graving dock. The workmen were turned on shore and left the hhipp, not, however, without expressing their discsntent pretty freely. The order for the bcizures is eaid to have come from the Foreign Office. The gunboat Ileron now lies with steam up opposite Messrs, Laird's yard, and the (run boat Goshawk still keeps watch over hi Tousson. Tncse decisive proceedings appear to have been taken owing to a report tbat the tcfpcU were ubout to bo taken away surreptitiously, although 1-1 ISonastir is without steering gear, and neither of the vessels have any coai on board, and could only leave the docks at high water. A report i6 current tbat it i6 intended to take the vessels into the river tor greater security. It may be mentioned that the rumours which have been enrrent for some time, to the tflect that a portion ol the Plorida'efiew had arrived some week? ago lo take cburge or the ironclad?, has no foundation in fact. Tbe real fact is, that these men became insubordinate at Brest bccaotie tbey were refused leave ashore, and were subsequently discharged by Captain Mafllu They made their way to Liverpool and on their wages being paid they dispersed, and most of them immediately shipped in vatious merchant vessels.— Mitchell'* lie - gisUr, Octobcr -0, The Alabama Aoain.— Tbe Dutch mall arrived a few days ago bringing the intelligence of the destruction of another Federal vessel, the Contest, by the Alabama, in tho Java Sea, otf the Northwatcher, not far from Batavia. It is also rumoured, but we believe without foundation, that a fourth ship— the Bclviderc ? from Manila, has likewise been destroyed. The Contest was bound from Japan to New York; but her cargo was of little value, chiefly consisting of cotton rags, Tbo U. S. steamer \Vyoming, which i6 in pursuit ot the Alabama, came in here on the 1st iBetant, having on the wav from Batavia 6eea nothing of ber chase. She stayed in our harbour only twenty -nine hours, but remained in the btraiia five miles to eastward und in sight of the town for several days, until the Dutch mail brought tbe news of the Alabama's whereabouts when she started o(f. The Wyo ming is a fine steamer, heavily armed ; and though she bas Wen represented as having very dilapidated boilers unable to carry steam to drive ber six knots an boor, she made a late display of ! speed which indicates a very different condition,— The lndorc, a new steamer belonging to a* Bombay Company, and be aring it is said some slight te&emblance; to tbe Alabama, after entering the Btioits was steering for the anchorage, when tbe Wyoming c*mc rapidly down on ber, overhauling her though ehe was sun ning at over ten knots, &nd; sent a boat on board. It may pobsibly be Captain M'Dougul's de&ire; to conceal the capabilities of his veiECL— Mrui/a' TYmrs, December (lb. Tbk Gkoboia Btkameb,— Jamaica, October 9.— ,fThe Con federate war steamer Georgia, Captain Semmes, lately of the Alabama, passed Falmouth, on tbe north side of this island, at noon on the 30th ultimo, under full steam and canvas, going ut 10£ knots an hour, aud was on a eruisc. She was boarded off that port by a Montego Day pilot. Late in the afternoon of the same day she was observed to come into collibion with another steam vessel, but from tbe distance at which the encounter took place — ae seen by the aid of a telescope— it ma h diflicult to say whether the other vessel returned the Arc or not ; at all events, this much U certain, tbat after -the lapse of eight or ten minutes one of the vessels suiled away, evidently having the other in low, and both were soon after lost to sight.— Mitchell's Rcgistert Octobcr 80. Blockapk Kvhiwb*.— During tbe last fortnight two very fast , end magnificent-looking paddle steamers bave lelt the Clyde for I the West Indies, to be employed as blockade runoers. One of i tbcm is the City of Pctcraburgh, 700 tons, with engines of 250 horse power, and the other, tbe Presto, 164 tons. A third, namod the Dare, bas since followed. Tbey arc constructed that their funnels ond masts can be made to disappear from view, leaving nothing but the hull visible.— ffatfoway Advertiser. Tub TwimScebw System,— ' Tbe eucccsb which has attended the adoption of the double or twin screw principle in England and America during the past three years bas Invested it with creat Interest. To Captain Carpenter, R N., we ore undoubtedly first Indebted for the introduction of the twin screws ; but the first advance of moment in its practical demonstration was made by Mr. G. ltenaiein 1852, followed up in 1857 by the same firm, in constructing several gunboats on the snme principle for Indian river service. From eome cause, however, difficulties appear to have existed, for no great succoss seems to nave been attained, as the principle was not followed up, and a strong feeling certainly existed against its Adoption for either mercantile or warlike pur poses, Tbe single screw, witb all its acknowledged faults, ac cordingly held its own against all comers. The double versus tingle screw has been a subject of strong controversy at the meetings of the Society of Arts, tbe Royal United Service Institution, and other places where such matters are diecussed, as well as of lengthy cor respondence and editorial articles in the professional journals, especially since the Messrs. Dudgeon, of Millwall, have adopted the principle, and have begun to launch from their building yard nearly one double or twin screw steamer per month* The doings of these vessels on their trial trips have been recorded in these columns, and now the Admiraltv have adopted the principle in tbe construction of some iron-ptated gunboats which are about to be laid down for the Boyal Navy, taking the data obtained by their officers from Uessra Dudgeon's trial trips for their guide. Through this long interval, however, of partial and complete success for the twn screws, Captain Thomas E. 6ymonds, R.N., a nephew of Sir William Symonds, once Surveyor or the Nary, has bees tbeir most earnest and persistent advocate, aod tbe triumph of the twin screw iB, lo fact, the triumph of the plan that ofheer has so long advocated, it is, however, doubtful how far at present the twin may supercede the single screw. In tbe Roral Navy it may poaslbly only be adopted in vessels speoially built to carry a heavy arma ment and large engine-power at a moderate draught of water, and whioh may be designed for operations on a line of coast, or off harbours,— as a coast defenee vessel, in faot, and therefore ro o airing a power of turning shortly such as only two screws can sive. It is difficult, however, to say where the line can be drawn, for draught of water and powers of manoeuvring are of equal im norta&oe; with speed. On the 22nd of April last, at a meeting of the Society of Arts, Beer*Admlr*2 the Hon. Joseph Den man, who was In tbe chair, said* with reference to our large Ironclads,— 'He had no doubt two or three ships of smaller site would be r.t.i antagonists to such vessels as the Minotaur or North umberlan£ if the smaller vessels possessed a superior power of tuning ty atta&i; of doable screws,' Taming, hewenr, frem eptelet 4ot facts,' it ' will be found that the tncrieans have veiy largely adopted tne twin screws for their i»en*ef'war. The was oi She ironclad ram lndianola was attri buted, by the accounts in the American papers, to ber ?? inability to masrovre.' Tbe writer says,—14 Bhe fell u-prey to two smaU gunboats having a power of turning to a high degree. Tbey could ram her first on one side, then on tbe other, till the mailed giant was beaten to death.' These two gunboats were driven by (wis rerews, Tbe NaugaUck, another American gunboat, is fttted with twin screws, and carried a SOtaounder Parrett gun on a Used carriage. By the power m her sorewe the vessel is trained at tbe object, and the gnn thus brought in a line of fire. The John Nelson, a vessel used for trans porting the mail trains across the Delaware River, is driven by t«in tcrewc, and has to turn end 'for end at every trip in order to d&ivcr; tbe train at the same end it entered, she is 925 feet long, snd ia stated to often perform the manmuvre io a Strong current cboked witb- icc in from one miiMtciwenty seoonds to one minute thirty eoconds. A twin vessel is now building in America to mount two monster suns of fifty tons each. These irons will be on fiscd carriages, will be fired at point blank range, and nill be brought tobear uponthetobjectfiredat,likctbegun Of tbe Nongatuek, by tbe screws revolving tbe-ohip. This is the position of tbe tain screw aystcm in England and America at tbe present time, and tho civil war now rAging in America will supply tbe means or tenting its usefulness for ships of war. In a paper read by Captata Symonds on twin screws in April last, tbat offtoer advocates double keels and rudders ; for twin screw vessels, and gives as his reasons that by applying twin screws to single keel ship* of tbe present form tbe intervening dead wood is a ?mrious obstacle to twir perfect action ; It divides and materially ruduocs the column of watt r coming totbeinner arms of the screws, increases friction, and causes a series of shocks that produce vibration. The vessels which Captain Rymonda aod Mr. ltobsrta, C.K , con jointly propoce for construction fur twin screws are designed for double keelF, with a rudder in -be line of cach keel, and nearly in aline wilh cach serew -shaft, with tbe two kcelA cellular, and a cellular bottom worked up into tbe engine framce for strength, Tbet-e propet Itionr, however, arc punly professional, and we feci confident that witb Mr. Beed in too office of chief -constructor of the Davy, thuy, together with tho whole principle and adaptation of the twfii fci-cw system, will receive that consideration which their importance demands.- Timt, November 4.
