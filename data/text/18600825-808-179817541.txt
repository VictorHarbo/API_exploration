MELBOURNE MARKET RETORTS. THE MILLS. —There has been a considerable depression in the flour market since our last report, but very little business has been doing. Quotations are for town flour, £17 10s,; Adelaide sorts, £17 5s, to £18; and for the finer brands, £18 10s. In wheat nothing has been doing. The price is almost nominal, at from 6s, 6d. to 7s. 6d. HAY.—Mr. James Fenton reports: Our sup ply has been, lighter this week, consequently we have been able to clear the market, but without any unprovement in prices, winch range from £4 lOs. to £6 5s, ; straw, £2 10s. to £3. Labor Market.—Mr. Elderton reports that little or no change has taken place during the past week in the labor market. The demand for all classes of men is most limited, and very few farm or station men have been hired. The same may be said as to gardeners. Male domestics have been a little more inquired for, and a few waiters and men for private families have met with engagements. Married couples continue to meet with employment at fair wages. Female servants of the best description with good references find situations, but not to any extent. Mr. Elderton further reports, that during the week the ship Ocean Home with government immigrants has arrived, bringing 200 single women, 19 married couples, 20 men, and 36 children. This, of course, will add to the already much overstocked market. Artisans and skilled laborers are out of employment in very considerable numbers, and though willing to work at less than the current wages, cannot meet with work. Wages just now are almost nominal.

Lawrance reports: arrival of the Midnight, from San Francisco, with 40,000 bushels of wheat, bringing advices of other very heavy shipments, coupled with the sales at auction of several parcels of Adelaide flour, has had the effect of shaking the market to a considerable extent, and renders quotations just now merely nominal.—Flour: Tasmanian and Victorian (country) held for £16 to £17; Ade laide (country) has been sold for £l6; Magarey's and Harts brands are scarce, and wanted; con sequently higher prices are paid. Californian is nominally £18; and French barrel £2O per ton. Wheat colonial is offered at 6s 9d. to 7s. 8d; and Californian is held for 6s. 9d. per bushel. Oats remain unchanged; closing quota tions are as follows - Scotch, Irish, Russian, Danish, and Calcutta, 3s. 6d. to 3s. 10d.:Cali fomian, 4s.; Colonial, 4s. per bushel.

Bran : Stocks are well worked out, and a better feeling now exist; closing price, 1s. 6d. per bushel.
