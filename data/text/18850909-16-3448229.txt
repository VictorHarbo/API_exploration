I hereby give notice that I have This Day (2nd September) received a Writ of Election from the Honourable the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly commanding me to proceed according to law, to the ELECTION of a MEMBER to serve in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for the Electoral District of Fortitude Valley. and appointing THURSDAY, the 10th day of September, 1885, to be the day, and Fortitude Valley the place, of Nomination of Candidates. I further give notice that I waR be in attendance at the Foresters' Hall, Brunswick street *? Fortitude Valley, on the day previous to the nomination, from i to 0 pro- to receive the Nomination Papers of Candidates and on THURSDAY, the 10th day of September, 1884, at the Foresters' Hall, Brunswick street.

In the event of the said election being contested, a POLL will be taken on MONDAY, the 11th day of September, 1835, at the Foresters' Hall, Brunswick street, Fortitude Valley. THOS. ILLIDGE, Returning-Officer for Fortitude Valley. T TO THE ELECTORS OF FORTITUDE VALLEY" GENTLEMEN,-In response to this your third requisition asking me to allow myself to be nominated as your Representative In the Legislative Assembly, It is with very great pleasure I accede to your request I am well known to the majority of the electors, having resided amongst you for nearly thirty years, fifteen of which I have spent as your representative in the Municipal Council-a proof that your confidence in me has been unchanged, With regard to the political questions of the day, I am, and always have been, a strenuous opponent of the employment of coloured labour (so it black or yellow being brought into competition with that of Europeans. I am decidedly of opinion that the extra taxa- tion sought to be im DOBod upon you by the present Treasurer would not be required had there been judicious management of the finances of the colony. Even were it necessary the taxes should be so adjusted that the burden should not fall altogether upon the working classes, but be more equitably distributed. I am in favour of promoting local industries, believing that after inducing the working man to emigrate here that it is the duty of the Government to foster and encourage the manufacture of our native products, thus providing employment for the rising generation. If elected, I would give my strongest opposition to the sending away of contracts either to Europe or the other Colonies that could be executed here, and which would provide employment for our mechanics and artisans. I would give my support to any well considered proposal for bringing the railway to the Valley, and thence to deep water. I will advocate the purchase of the land known as the Old Racecourse, New Farm, for a public recreation and drill ground. I conceive the time has arrived for the foundation of a School of Arts and Public Reading room in your midst, and would endeavour to obtain from Government the grant of a site of land for that purpose The speedy erection of a larger Post and Telegraph Office is a necessity the commencement of which I would impress upon the Government. It isnotnooessaryin this short address to allude to other matters requiring attention. Sutil to it to say that, as I am not connected with any party or political clique, I should, if elected, be able to exercise an independent opinion upon all questions that come before Parliament, keeping in view the interests of your electorate and the welfare of the colony at large. I hope to have the honour of meeting you in public before the day of election, when I shall be able more fully to explain myself, and to answer any questions you may think proper to put to me. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN D. HEAL. Leichhardt-street, Valley. T TO THE ELECTORS OF FORTITUDE VALLEY. Gentlemen,-The Additional Members Bill, 1 introduced by the present Government, having now passed both Houses of Legislature, you will Boonoo called upon to elect a second Member to represent you in Parliament As I have been requested by some of your number to allow myself to be nominated for that position, I now reSpectfully, but briefly, lay before you some of my views on political matters. I have, as many of you are aware taken an active interest In political matters for the past twenty years and have always been a supporter of the Liberal party, becausolbollove their policy is best calculated to advance the Interest of the colony generally, and their administration, though perhaps not without faults, has generally been miBlncBsllko and equitable, and so long as they follow their present line of policy and administration they will have my support The Valley Electorate has In my opinion been somowhatnogleoted by previous Governments. the Sandgate Railway, which ought naturally to have gone through Fortitude Valley was taken, as you are aware, through Victoria Park, thus in a great measure depriving the Valley of the benefit of railway communication. The present Government is anxious to remedy this by constructing the main line from the pro sent terminus through Fortitude Valley, to join the Sandgate line about Bowen Hills, with a probable branch line to Bulimba This has my hearty support, and if elected I will do what I as to have it carried out as soon as possible. About seven years ago, when the Douglas Ministry was in power 1500 was voted for a Post and Telegraph Office In Fortitude Valley: this money has not yet been expended, for what reason I do not know; should you return me I will endeavour to obtain an additional sum, Biiffl event to erect a Post and Telegraph Office worthy of Fortitude Valley, and not allow an officer and his family to live in a disreputable building like the present one, for which the Government is paying a rental. , lam strongly opposed to black labour in any form and would not countenance the introduction of coolies, even with restrictions the present Opposition say they would put upon them, believing that this colony is adapted for and should be settled by Europeans. I am therefore in favour of an extensive but judicious system of immigra- tion, similar to what Mr. Randall, our agent at home, is now endeavouring to obtain namely, young people and men with families from the rural districts of Great Britain who would settle on our lands and become useful colonists. There are many other questions that I should like to speak upon which cannot be well expressed within the limit of a published address but I hope to meet you in public meeting previous to the day of polling, and then to address you more fully, although I feel I am not a stranger, having represented you in the Municipal Council for nearly of fourteen years. I remain. Gentlemen. Yours respectfully. JOHN M'MASTER. Fortitude Valley, 27th August D O N ' T FORGET SALE OF ANN-STREET PROPERTY, THIS DAY, At Eleven o'Clock, AT THE CITY AUCTION MART.

Tem. , MR JOHN WILSON, 5 Exchange, Queen-street, The increase and development of the resources of the colony of Queensland during the past quarter of a century justify the belief entertained by the Promoters that the present is an eminently favourable opportunity for the establishment of another Banking Company, having its headquarters in Brisbane, and occupying some portion of the field of operations, which has proved, and still continues to be so attractive to the financial institutions of Great Britain and the other colonies. With this view the Provisional Committee now issue this prospectus, setting forth the objects to be attained, and invite their follow colonists, by taking shares, to co-operate in founding the proposed Bank. i'Lhe progress of the colony, and the opening that exists at the present time for a new Bank, with a local proprietary, may be best realised by comparing the advances made by the Banks here in the years 1870,1875,1880, and 1585. 1870 (last quarter) .. ..£1,300,769 . 1875 ? " .... 3.451.018 ' 1880 " .... 4.053,923 1885 (first quarter) .... 9,790,898 During the same period the deposits lodged in the Banks in this Colony have risen from £923.550 to £G,2G1.3H3; and the note circulation from £146,921 to 2007 03(1 At the same time the Savings Banks' deposits have risen from £332,813 to £1,235,950. The population has increased from 115,667 in 1870 to 3825 til 1885. The Royal Bank of Queensland, Limited, will be a bank of issue and deposit, and will conduct all usual banking operations. It is proposed to open the Head Office of the Bank in Brisbane as soon as the services of a duly qualified staff of officers can be secured. Branches will be opened in the principal towns of the Colony from time to time, whenever it is deemed expedient. No promotion money will be paid on account of the launching of this institution. The only charge made will be for the ordinary preliminary expenses of printing, advertising, broker's commission, &c.; Should the bank not be floated the application money will be returned in full, So soon as the Share List shall be closed and the Shares allotted, the Provisional Committee shall call a meeting of shareholders, to be held at Brisbane. At this meeting the functions of such Provisional Committee will cease, and the shareholders will then proceed to elect a Board of Directors, who shall be empowered to take such steps as may be necessary for completing the organisation of the Institution, appointing a General Manager, and commencing business. Applications for shares (which will be allotted to each applicant ratably according to the number applied for are to be made on the annexed form, accompanied by the deposit, or by the banker's receipt, addressed to the Chairman, Provisional Committee, at their office, 5 Exchange, Brisbane. Applicants up-country may Bond the amount of deposit on application, by Banker's Draft or Post office Order direct to the Chairman, Provisional Committee at Brisbane. The share list will be closed at noon on Wednesday, 30th September, 1885, or earlier the discre- tion of the Provisional Committee, if the shares shall have been fully applied for. WM.
