TO INTENDING PIANO BUYERS Here is a Piece of Trade- information, from the Best Authority in London, which ought to-be of Interest to the General Public Extract from "Musical Opinion and Music Review," London, November, 1911 J n " Pianos sold in England for TWENTY EIGHT GUINEAS* (at twelve and sixpence per month) readily bring EIGHTY-HVE GUINEAS in Australia on tomo payment (usually five to ten pounds dopooit, aud twenty to fifty shillings monthly). They are often paid withm a year {or bEVENTY-rlVE GUINEAS cash).. Somewhat lower prices prevail in the larger cities. There ia a growing tendency to suppoit EDghsh gooda an the colonies, so the sooner the English piano manu« facturer discovers that his -Healthiest buje« aie not living in Great Britain the better." Statements of the same kind often appear in the Germai; and English Music Trade Papers. The Exorbitant Profits made by Middlemen in Australia explain their rooted objection to manufacturing locally, for they would find themselves compelled to turn out a far better article made in Australia and at a materially higher cost.
