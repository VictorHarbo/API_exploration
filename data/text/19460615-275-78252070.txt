He arrived with his blonde wife on the Norwegian motorshio Tai Yin. 'In Norway, the organiser of the Norwegian - Australian Immigration Club was prosecuted' for trying to develop emigration to Australia,' 'de clared Mr. Nielsen. ' The Danish authorities were not interested in emigra tion and it was hard to organise a scheme to bring people to Australia. ,- Mr. Nielsen was having no luck in finding a job in Melbourne, so a friend gave him a list of Melbourne addresses to try first. He - wrote to one who got him a jo.b with a firm which handles farming machinery. He hopes to become an Australian citizen and help other Danes to come to .Australia.
