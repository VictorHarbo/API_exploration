DANISH GOVERNMENT SATIS. LIED. ful Melbourne, July 4. After full inquiries, the DanishlGo vernment has satisfied itself that the Victorian Jmmigration Agent in [Copenhagen did not, ip seeking im migration for this State, do any thing against the law, and conse quently there is no ground for tak ing action against him. Some weeks ago a question was. raised as to whether a breach. of the Danish law had not been committed; and, act-. ing on instructions from the State " government, the Agent-General (Sirs John Taverner) paid a visit to Copenhagen to explain the position. A cable message received to-day from Sir John Taverner states that the matter has been satisfactorily settled, and no action is to be taken.
