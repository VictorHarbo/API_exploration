In Mulbourne for 6 months continually under treatment of one of thu leading doctors in skin diseases, then treated by others equally unsuccessfully. Often laid up for woeks, once even for nine weeks, applying nitric acid to the eruptions, preferring this pain to the unbearable sufforlugs from the itching. Going under Mr. Bronncr's treatment 1 was at ouco relieved, never laid up again and improving continually. I have regained through his caretaking treatment my complote health, being now in my 64th year as strong as ever before and thoroughly new born after the miserable state of health iu which I lived these last 13 years.

This lady, Mrs. M'Mahou, living in Melbourne with Mrs. Htrnwbridge, 72 Park-Btrecl, l\irkvH!o. was 71 years old when consulting me In Augunt, 1893, for general Kczoma, covering hor from scalp to foot— eyes, ears and face not excluded. It was a most distressing case, tho lady having thus suffered for over 20 years, becoming old before time, and incapable when 1 first saw hor to walk without assist ance. Through ouensiotml mistakes in diet some relapses occurred, but patient got finally thoroughly cured, and regained full health and strength. A friend of hers told me some time ago that oven a very severe attack of ulluouzaof which Mrs., M'Mahou lately suffered never brought. b&ck; hny symptoms of eczema. A.
