. ENGLAND'S FOOD PRICES. -.-The Labour Party in the Imperial Parliafuout:- moved 111 1912 for an in quiry iiuto- rents, prices' and wages, and theVrc'uently .-^published Blue Book with the ii'eporb.is' a' mass of detailed social .' information.

Loudon- shows. -a decrease of about 4 per ccnt; other citics no marked move ment. As to wages, the mean percent jiD-e: increases; are: — -Hnildino* frades. 1 ,!) : engineering, 5.5; -printing, 4.1. But. the cost'iot' living raises issues interesting to all classes in all parts .of . tho British Empire, and the committee 's report, includes the civilised world. The . general conclusion is that Itho total cost of living, including clothing, has risen 10 per cent, in tho seven years period. Taking fourteen food commo dities, the rise is 13.7 per ccnt. Retail ~~ prices in London of twenty-three ar ticles of food give 114.5 as- the index number 'in 1912, 1900 being 100. ; A point of interest in this report is ' the vagaries in the movement of food - prices. Tea and sugar have fallen; whilst coal has gone up 22 and pota toes 4(i per cent. The excellent organi ;ation and systematisation of the cliillcd .mil frozen meat distribution in Eng- . land is evidenced by the fact that con siderable uniformity of prices prevails tho extreme variation of' the retail prices of beef Find nvutton (imported) being but Id. per lb. in England and Wales. It may be worth while to men tion the following figures, as the pro dominant prices paid by the working ' classes in October, 1912, in eighty-eight towns: — Beef, chilled,. '6^-d. to Sd. per lb.; mutton, frozen, 4,i/-d. to 5d. per lb.;' pork, S'^d. to 9}£d. per. lb.; tea, 1/4 to 1/0 per lb.; sugar, lum}^' 2^4d. to ? 2V.d. per lb.; bacon, lOd. to lid. per . lb.; eggs, JOd. to 1-ld. per dozen; cheeso.'
