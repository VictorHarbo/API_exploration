A MONTH TO FIND HUSBANDS. Much amusement lias been caused at the i immigration station at Ellis Island, New . York, by the urgent petition of two pretty blue-eyed Danish girls, Alfild Anderson and Ingeborg Jansen, of Copenhagen, for per- mission' to depart immediately for Winona (Minnesota). They (the "Mail" says) are the cheerful victims of an eccentric will made by their grandfather, who bequeath- ed them each a half-share of 600 acres of fine farm lands on the condition that they marry within thirty days of their arrival in New York. By the terms of tho will, which the two cou sj ns explained to an in- terpreter, title to tim lands will not be finally vested with cither of timm until they become mothers. If at the end of five years one of the cousins has a child and the other has not, thc motherless one will lose half her land to thc other. If neither has chil- dren at the end of five years the entire property is to revert to a malo cousin in Denmark. Both girls departed for Minneso- ta, confidently declaring in broken English that they would find good husbands within the stipulated term.
