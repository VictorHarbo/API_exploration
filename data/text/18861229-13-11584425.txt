"For three quarters of an hour the fusilade of bombs and other fireworks lit up the sky without in- termission and evoked the loudly-expressed admira- tion of the spectators, and then came what was re- garded as the feature of the evening, namely, a repre- sentation of the bombardment of Alexandria. A salvo of mimic artillery roared, and then the three war ships became clearly outlined underneath tower- ing forts, which the ironclads cannonaded with a hot fire. The forts feebly replied, while the little Condor was seen moving about as briskly as she did when Lord Beresford was rewarded with the signal from the flagship, " Well done, Condor." As a finale, a great bouquet of coloured rockets was sent up, bringing to a conclusion what was generally recorded as a most successful exhibition. It was announced by means of a fiery legend that the display would be repeated, and the announcement was much applauded. PAIN'S FIREWORKS. EAST MELBOURNE CRICKET-GROUND. SECOND GRAND DISPLAY, TO-NIGHT. TO-NIGHT. READ WHAT THE PAPERS SAY : " Age." " When the display was commenced, it appeared from the frequent expressions of applause to give abundant satisfaction. The programme was opened by the flight of two hot-air balloons, to which were suspended magnesium lights. A variety of rockets, fiery dragons, saucissons, revolving devices, silver and golden and coloured showers and fires followed, and were succeeded by novelties which have not pre- viously been presented in Melbourne." PAIN'S FIREWORKS EAST MELBOURNE CRICKET-GROUND. READ WHAT the PAPERS SAY. "Daily Telegraph." "The 'Device Comique,' representing the sacred white elephant, was a great success. When the smoke had taken unto itself wings, there was seen moving along the ground a huge white elephant, lashing its trunk and wagging its tail, to the great delight of the youngers. The devices, Danish em- blem monkey gymnast, silver fire Wheels, Aladdin's jewelled tree, and Falls of Niagara were each works of art, and each in itself worth seeing." PAIN'S FIREWORKS.

MARVELLOUSLY BEAUTIFUL SCENERY By BRUNTON and HENNINGS. "The prestige which this house has acquired for its spectacular displays at Christmas time will be more than maintained by the production of ' Robinson Crusoe.'"—"The Argus," Dec. 28. " The piece went remarkably well for the first pro- duction of so elaborate a performance. The ballets were very beautifully mounted and were creative. The two great scones—the swan's retreat and the gorgeous transformation—fully maintain the charac- ter of the house and the reputation of the artists."— " Age." Dec 28. "The pantomime at the Royal is a great success. There is a splendid display of artistic talent. The costumes are certainly surprising combinations of artistic skill.

" The handsomest theatre south of the equator First impressions count for much, and the effect produced upon the visitor to the new Princess's Theatre by the main entrance the marble staircase, and the handsome foyer public, is as prepossessing as that which a stranger experiences on ascending to the corresponding portions of the house in the Grand Opera in Paris the Stadt Theatre in Frankfort, and the Grand Theatre in Bordeaux, which contain the finest approaches and foyers in Europe." —"THE ARGUS," Dec. 20, 1886. " The public scarcely knew which to admire most, the beauty of the theatre or the consideration for the comfort of theatre goers, which was apparent in everything. Long before the performance concluded the Melbourne public had unanimously decided that the new Princess's Theatre was something in the nature of a revelation to playhouses."
