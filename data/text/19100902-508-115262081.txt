VICTORIAN IMMIGRANTS SECURED. LONDON, Thursday. â€” At the banquet given by Victorian residents in London to Messrs. M'Kenzit- and Mead, the Victorian Immigration Delegation, Viscount Goscnen, who presided, said that Great Britain welcomed the delega tion, and did not grudge any immigrants which Victoria might obtain, since they would foster the Imperial spirit among all classes in Aus tralia. Sir John Cockburn, in proposing the toast of 'Our Guests,' said that they were engaged in an Imperial mission, solving the adjustment of the population of the Empire. r Mr. M'Kenzie, in reply, said that the Press, the people, and the authorities of Great Britain had welcomed them most generously. He was not suggesting that Victoria was robbing Great Britain of the flower of her manhood, but the fact was that Great Britain imported 60 per cent, of her foodstuffs, of which Australia sent 3 per cent. That alone justified the delega tion. Mr. Elwood Mead said that Victoria would be satisfied with the number of high charactered, thrifty, and energetic agriculturists which ssn had secured. He emphasised the importance of fostering small holdings, and in this con nection he instanced the large yield of crops of lucerne, the grower of which in Australia to day would be the banker of Australia in the next generation. The dairymen selected by the delegation would soon make Victorian butter as well known as Danish butter by enabling Australia to supply Great Britain throughout the year. Sir J. W. Taverner, Agent-General for Vic toria, Insisted on the absence of rivalry be tween the Australian States and other oversea Dominions is immigration matters. Mr. Charleton, Vice-president of the London Chamber of Commerce, Sir John Bingham, of Sheffield, and Mr., J. M. Pratt also spoke.
