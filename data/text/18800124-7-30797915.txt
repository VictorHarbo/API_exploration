On the following eveuing the firvtaanual meeting of subscribers to the insti tution waa held in the same building. There -waa a large attendance. EOS Excellency the Governor presided. The Ber. J. Price opened tte meeting with prayer. His E_c___-"cr, who was received with ap plause, aaid—lndies and 'Gentlemen—l ei_ assure you that it gives me great pleasure, I may add notwithstanding the heat of tiie weather, to be-present on this occasion. I have had aome experience at home of tiie bene fits of a mission of tins character, and therefore, aa _ well ■as .on general grounds aad tiie desirableness of encouraging suoli movements which we are met to advocate this evening, when I was requested some time Xto support this mission, and still further a I was requested to preside ou the present occasion, I had .no hesitation in acceding to tbe request. (Applause.) We are indebted—we who form part of tiie British Empire—to our sailers for the prosperity we have throughout these _ colonies and .throughout tte British Empire generally. The British Government recognise the fact tbat it is deairableand neces sary that religious ministrations should bs pro vided for tte army and navy, and we have chaplains in the army and chaplains in the navy. (Applause^ I may here say from my own knowledge and experience ttat the good which haa resulted from that action has been te^ood calculation, and I em sure that any one who. was en board any of Her Majesty's ships at a. ipta.service forty years ago—the time when I £rat antered Her Majesty's service— could not help being struck with tte devout character of the proceedings and tite whole tone of tiie ahip. company. (Applause.) For tbe nm*cha_tasrvice tou cannot call on tiie Oo vac-meat togsxapotx chaplains,bat you must turn totte public at large, and I am sore we may reckon on their supporting a good work of tbis character. Xam not at all desirou. of en quiring whether the body that is directing aud aupisirU'ug this mission is ia immediate eom __mjna.-yitt.lthe church which I like and to w-Utt I always .will bfjlong-the Ohureh of fetfand-bat I consider that we should hail the movement, feem whatever quarter it comas, aadiamaurejhattarerynne'wha baa a desire Car tte. imprnvenunxtet the mead and ffrifa-J condition of the cesmen wHI joia in supporting tias movement. (Applanaa) . I also think that whilst wead?ooata retigiouan_n_______ to the aeemen we abould be careful tta^tbey abould hoof a practical_haracter. aad ttat we ahould not nunty judalge in what I call religious phraseology, bnt pee ttat religion in tiie highest practical sense is borne ia view in everything that may be undertaken. I have no doubt that thatpr_mp_>a_ar_-ftorisostide mission. lam (lad to aee that amongst tbe proposals it is intended to establish a sailors' rest, in whieh them willbe amusements provided for those who attend it. "With these few remarks I beg to open Ihe .proceedings this ere—ing, and X wph every success to the Port Adelaide Saa men's "Mi wrion, (Applause.) Mr. Gso. W. Sura, the hoa. secretary, read the.report as follows;—"A oommittee, cam posed nf representatives from each of the Port churches, aided by the help and and aymjia—ues of .many persons throughout the province;, has called the Port Adelaide Seaman's Mission incj existence.
