She was used us a 1 merchant cruiser during the war. and on I tho morning of October 6. 1918, was ac companying a convoy of transports carry ing American troops approaching the const, of Ireland. A full gale was blowing, and ; (ll)UUk flttnb llllll'fS ' oil the coast, tho steering gear of the steamer Kashmir broke down, nnd out of! control, she crashed heavily Into the port' side of tho Otranto. Captain Davidson, who was in charge of the Otranto. Immediately ordered ail ! hands to boat stations. There were in all about 1000 men aboard, including Am- orlcnn troops. The Kashmir drifted away Into the hn/.e, nnd the Otrnnto was left! alone, making slow progress toward the shore with the hope of benching. The' coastline, however, presented an" un broken line of clifl's against which the seas! wore pounding. Water flooded the engine- j room and brought the ship to n standstill, i Both anchors were let go, and she wal- I lowed in the sons, getting gradually lower j In the Whtcr. Her call for assistance was i heard by the destroyer H.M.S. Mounsey, ! which dasher! to tho scene at full speed.; When «hc arrived she was asked to stand by ns no boats could live tn the sen that; was running. Lieut. F. W. Craven, of the Mounsey, realising the drsperntentss of the situa tion, determined to put his ship alongside. Captain Davidson warned him of the dan ger of such nn operntlon. but I.iout. Craven replied that it was the only chance of saving lire. Two of the Otrnnto's boats were lowered to act as fenders, and the destroyer went ns near ns she dared un der t.he lee of the liner, and waited for tho big ship to drift down on her. They met with a crash that smashed the boats to matchwood. The first line of men were ordered to Jump, and most of them landed on the destroyer's deck, but a few fell between the ships and were crushed to death. Others, Jumping too late, when the destroyer fell into the trough, broke arms and legs when -they hit her steel decks. Holed and leaking, the Mounsey drew off, but came in ugaln. nnd once more the men on the liner made the desperate Jump. Four times Lieut. Craven took his little ship alongside, and only desisted when he had taken nbonrd 596 men,? and it was dangerous to take any more. I The Otrunto cjriftcd ashore and became n total loss at Islny. Of the 447 ofllcers and men still left aboard, only 15 were saved. Captain Davidson nnd most of his ofllcers being drowned. Other ships Inter.
