THE ILLUMINATIONS. Out from the glare of a million lights, with eyes dazzled by the brilliancy of colors as diverse ils those r'Qf^ the rainbow, with' ears' deafened -with -^hofmnvm-iir' of inany- voices, feet a-wewy, and 'body; generally 'dilapidated . wo come to describe [a. 'scene which ^certainly ?has jno parallel^ in V the history of Australasia, wliioh probably has no more-thnn a parallel in; the history Jot- the world. ' We may 'bo drunk with loyalty, but our drunkenness takes to it self ! a very-; pleasant form sometimes. It could clothe itself in no -' brighter -colors .' than it did on Tuesday night. If it tried' ever so hard it could not show 'itself ' more vividly, or apeak so strongly to ; the - senses. It was written en every wall, pictured ' from every window, reflected in the smiling, jocund faces of many thousands. To those who are familiar with Melbourne in its work a-day attire, the sight was a marvellous one ; to those who know not Melbourne at alii and are not acquainted with the deep devotion and loyalty ef her citizens, it must have, indeed, been more than marvellous — it must have been miraculous. It was a 'fairy city,; astir with active, prosperous life, radiant in smiles, and _ wreathed in beauty too intoxicating to last. Night was not, as far as the city was concerned, for everywhere was radiant with light, beneath which trooped countless thou sands of men and women. Where the people came from must for ever remain a mystery. Was there any house in the suburbs with a human soul in it, or did the dogs alone sit in watch and ward over the goods and chattels of the burgesses ? Gollingwood emptied itself into Bourke-street in all sorts of ways ; ^ from the more aristocratic suburb of St.^ Kilda came elegant and airy vehicles, whiob, however, had to suffer the indignity of following in the wake of lumbering waggons and mud bespattered drays, which had not bsen cleaned apparently for numberless months. Yet in all this vast ' crowd there was no disorder, and nothing but the best of humor prevailed. All looked happy as they felt; all were well clad, all seemed to revel in health, and if not in wealth, at least in content. Such a picture of a thriving, well to-do peopl* must have been a novelty to the Duke of Edinburgh. Driving through the streets ho could not have failed to observe the youth and vigor of. the people ho has como to visit. Here no doorepitude, no pauperism, no cause to tarn away with a sickening shudder from the feast offered to the eye, because there was nothing to offend the eye in the slighest degree. Indeed, the mass of the people, happy, joyous and con tented, was a sight in itself. To be pleased you had no occasion to so much as look at the gorgeousness of the pictures on the walls ; there was enough for you to find satisfaction in the faces of the populace. There was to be seen reflected all the better attributes of our nature : under the influence of a great and allpervad ing excitement. Of course, it is impossible by description to convey any idea of the scene as it presented itself to the eye of tUe multitude. The only man who could photograph it properly with his pen is George Augustus Sala, and it requires all. his descriptive powers to convey anything like an idea of what was seen and what was done. As to what was seen, coming to dry fact, it is hard to say how to commence.. There were so many dazzling sights, that not one of them fastened itself on the mind for any length of time. Were you enchanted with the Trea sury, bewildered by the blaze of light at the Town Hall, gratified by the tasteful blending of colors at Denis Brothers, startled by, the . gorgeous appearance of the Oriental ';, Bank, you always in your . travels found something else to take your fancy and efface the. impressions of the last picture you had gazed on. Perhaps it. was a little bijou of a transparency, passed because of its insignificance by the crowd; .perhaps, a combination . of effects theatrical in their nature, and highly effective. And 'writing of theatres reminds one that theatrical managers . have every reason to . complain of the dullness of their trade. . Lately, the streets have been converted into theatres, and; in them sights have been seen more real and more vivid than those presented on any stage. Again to come to mere matter of fact, it . may be said that the streets of Melbourne were densely thronged from eight o'clock till midnight on Tuesday. Prom every house: shone forth, some words of welcome, and from, the tops of many there .were burst great pots, of .blazing fire, whioh illumined the night even more brightly than the gas. The weather was most propitious. A gentle breeze only stirred the gas jets of' the illuminations, but did not ? in any way rob any of thorn of their due effect. , Through the centre of the streets in solemn march went a string , of : carriages of every description, from, the elegant barouche' to the ' lithesome .buggy,' . the ; lumbering, dray and to the heavily laden lorry. These last were in themselves features of the Bight. They were for the most part crowded with the wives ef men who are the bone and sinew of our colony, and a very comely^ pleasant sort of people they seemed to be. Side by side marched, densely paoked . together, those who preferred freedom of limit to comfort of body. Their name was legion, and amongst them thero was no comfort for ? those who were troubled by their poor feet. They were reckless in their loyalty, these people, and whatever their respsot for the Crown, they had none for the corns of their neighbors. As to centres of attraction, they were to be found everywhere. The glory was : not confined to our four principal streets, but scat tered about everywhere. So splendid was it, that by its splendor it satiated the eye long before you had arrived at the end of it. There was a plethora of gas, and infinity of paint ings. There was beside, here and there, an electric light shown, and this lit up the sur roundings with astonishing effect. Bourke street and Collins-street, seen from their best points of observation and . regard, seemed as if they were endowed with a strange life. The 'head3 of the people,' with the re flection of the gas upon them never .'showed to better advantage. In Little Bourke-street there was an independent display. Here the Chinese exhibited their skill as pyrotechnists in a remarkable manner, and woe betide the man or woman wjth delicate nerves who tra- ' versed its length. The noise of the crackers a** the glare of the blue lights made lively . the dingy tenements of the Celestials. Fortunately the cracker, nuisance was not allowed to extend beyond this, street, and for this all thanks to the police. The Duke drove through the streets in state about ton o'clock, and was received by acclamation along, the whole route. He expressed himself highly delighted with the display, which he said he had never ; seen equalled out of Lon don. We now proceed to give our readers. a ; more detailed account of the proceedings. . ??'. COLIiINS-STnEET. ,:-' . The Treasury being one of the few prinoipal Government buildings that are ??? completed, .'.. there was a fair opportunity for' the -exercise of ' good- taste in planning its illuminations, and they were; certainly very successful. ; As none of its architectural features are vory promi nent, no great difficulty 'could; have been expe rienced in .throwing over all of them an equal flood of light, in ? which even the minutest points of beauty and adornment were seen with - noonday distinctness. And ns the 'building, though large and/.imposing in its general ap pearanoe, is quiet in its style of architecture, it :b most to be admired for- the highly ornamental character of its various details ; and hence the chief object to be attained -was to avoid throwing any .part of it- into ;- shade, and to effect' a clearly defined display.
