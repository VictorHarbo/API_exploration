Senator. McCormicK, in the course of a state ment made in' the Senate, said: "It .is astonishing "that some public men in England and France say that America is repudiating her agreements because the Treaty remains unratified. They must know that when the American people last year elected a Republican Congress, President Wilson was re pudiated. He therefore had not the power to bind /the: American-people at - a Peace Conference." 1 . The Necessity for every household— ' CORNWELL'8
