He was exceedingly ill with double pneumonia ; both doctors had given up all hope of his recovery, leaving me with instructions not to move line as it would only hasten the end. I could not see my child die without making some effort to save him, and on the advice of my chemist I wrapped Wonder-Wool on his back and chest. Next morning he had recovered considerably, and it was not long before he was completely cured."
