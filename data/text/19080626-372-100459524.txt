He (my father) was speaking one day to a friend of mine who mentioned that he was being cured of an ulcerated leg, due to a bone-kick, by* Choke's Blood Mixture.' I continued, however, to suffer until April 4, Last, when my friend told me be was com pletely cured. Then I started to take Clarke's Blood Mixture' myself, and I am now com completely cured, efter suffering and being disfigured ior several years. I am able to fol low my employment, ana am very pleased to think there is anch a valuable remedy obtain able for such a small sum.

' There Is an «Id axiom to the effect that I what everybody aaya most be true. Certainly It Is generally safe to follow the I crowd. Its Instinct Is usually right, and . In the matter of common ailments yen ' may profitably pay heed to the opinion of j the majority— which In times of sickness puts Its faith in the efficacy of Beecham's \- Pills. Nor has that trust keen misplaced. An annual sale of 6,000,000 boxes proves ' the universality of the belief In the value of Many preparations, miscalled remedies, claim Impossibilities. They could not reasonably make good much that is claimed for them. No exaggerated state ments are put forward respecting Beecham's Pills. The steady demand for them— year after year— proves that those who have fceed of them have found thct they wrought those cures that they arc ' announced to effect. No other medicine I j so generally and uniformly successful In giving strength to tlio stomach— correct - 1 Ing tbe digestive system, and regulating the liver, kidneys, and bowels, and tbe use of Beecham's Pi!ls will prove to your : perfect satisfaction that they MAKE GOOD EVERY CLAIM.
