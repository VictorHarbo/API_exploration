DANISH IMMIGRANTS. ' -. Included among immigrants who have arrived recently is a small number of Danes. The Minister in charge of Immigration (Mr. Hagelthorn) stated yesterday that the Danes, most of whom were farm workers, constituted a very satisfactory type, and had experienced no difficulty in obtaining em- ployment. The department was largely in- debted to several members of the Danish Club for the assistance they had given in placing the men.
