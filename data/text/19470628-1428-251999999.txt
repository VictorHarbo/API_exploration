% Canberra To-day Â» ! Notes and Comments CALWELL'S FEAR (From Our Columnist in Pariiaiuenr i House) | Carrying with him "a haunting fear j that Japan will rise again before Ays- J London and Europe a few days ago "to get ships, ships and more ships." Not long ago Calwell, a third generation Australian with a mixed Welsli-Irish- Aiuerican ancestry, told a Danish j journalist be would "never go outside Australia." Prime Minister Chifley is sending him "because you, Arthur, can find out what lies behind the shipping j hold-up in London." j So the one-time isolationist, the man who used to breathe fire and brimstone about British Imperialism, the anti- j conscriptionist who even during the ] regime of the wartime Curtia Govern- j ment objected to any compulsory niili- j tary service, Arthur Augustus Calwell 1 is now among the dignified of White- j hall. Off-stage, Calwell is a thoroughly j likeable person. His vituperation comes ; largely from reading the fiery debates of the Federation period and his belief that personal invective is the seasoning of political debate. Handling Immigration portfolio he has dropped this habit and made friends among the Opposition parties and influenced the most conservative party people. On the eve of this departure I quizzed him about liis hopes. He was, lie said, "profoundly disappointed that the logic of the Australian case for more immigrant ships has not brought better results." He recalled that when the Prime Minister was in London early in 1946 it was indicated that by the end of 1947 the number of berths would be about 35,000 for the ensuing year. For each subsequent year the number of berths was to increase mitil by the end of 19.10 Australia would have an excess of 70.000 arrivals over departures. The fact is that now, at the end of 1947, Britain offers only 0,000 berths for the whole of this year while ISG.000 immigrants are registered in London, hence Calwell's fright and flight.
