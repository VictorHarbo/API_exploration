These' people vision, in fact the expression SHORT SIGHTED has beebme a term of reproach. Many of these unfortunate people do not know that they can be made to see perfectly, and to the greatest possible dis tance bv the aid of suitable, carefully chosen, and accurately fitted, spectacles. It is always imperative to make spectacles SPECIALLY FOR SHORTSIGHTED EYES. - For LONG SIGHTED eyes, the lenses should be very carefully adapted by an accurate calculation, so as to avoid prematurely ageing sight. The principle fol lowed by experts is that of allowing the eye to do as much work as is requisite for its well being, and to supply the balance of the power required by means of suitable lenses No one can provide yon with any substitute for lenses. Premature old si"-ht has often followed on peglect of the defect. Th/ longer the correction is put off the more difficult it will be to" restore the eyes to perfect normal activity. .As soon, therefore,' as any uncomfortable conditions ale perceived to exist, not a moment sbould.be lost.
