COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Saturday Evening. There was only one entry passod to-day for the export of gold, that being for 2 ounces, I in the hands of a passenger. The market has remained very quiet. The Melbourne bullion brokers have made no changes in the quoted rates since the announcement of the riee in the rates of exchange, although on the diggings parcels have been purchased at trifling ad- vances on thess. Omeo gold is quoted at C8.3. to 71s. ; Pleasant Greek and Goulburn, 74s. Gd. to 75s. ; Bendigo, Castlemaine, and Jim Grow, 75f.Od. to76s.; Ararat, Maryborough, Dunolly, Fiery Greek, Avoca, and Amherst, 76s. 6d. to 77s. 6d. ; the Ovens, 77s. Gd. to 78s. ; Ballaarat, 78s. to 78s. Gd. The escorts which, arrived in town yester- day brought down larger quantities than have come down for some months past, the total amounting to 67,620 ounces. This is 9,860 ounces above the average of the year 1857 ; 16,695 ounces above that of the first quarter of the carrent year, and 12,280 ounces above that of the second quarter. In the following list the returns are compared with thoa a of the corresponding week of 1857, the fort- nightly escorts being distinguished from the weekly by the prefix of an asterisk: 1868\. 1857.

This has arisen entirely from the circumstance of there not being any vessel on the berth. The quantity remains, there- fore, at 1,417,625 ounces; or 59 tons 1cwt. 1 quarter 10 lb. 5 ounces ; the value of which, at £4 per ounce, amounts to £5,670,500. Since the first shipments were made, we believe we are warranted in saying that the circumstance of two consecutive weeks passing away without adding to the quantities shipped has not before occurred. At present there is a demand for parcels for dispatch by the dip- per ship Lincolnshire, whioh will clear out on Monday with very large values of the metal and of speole. The settlement of the question of mining leaseB appears to be still the main topic of discussion among the mining body. The Conference of delegates from the Mining Boards have decided in favor of vesting the absolute power of granting leases in the bodies they represent-the Mining Boards of Victoria. If this power were placed in the bands of the boards, as at prcsent.'constiiated, very general dissatisfaction would ensue, as these boards are not representative bodies in any sense. The decision of the Government with roference to the new regulations will Boon be made known, as it is intended to bring them into operation at an early date. The 10th of the current month waa the day at first named, but as the regulations havo not yet been gazetted, another day will have to be substituted. It 1B of great impórtanos that this shonld be as early a one as possible, because the month of September is usually the last wet month of the season, and in the majority of cases extensive works will have to be carried on on the leased landB for the collection of the natara! water-shed. I The reports of the yield of the gold-fields have been satisfactory this week, without presenting any prominent feature. All locali- ties appear to be at last supplied with water, notwithstanding that the quantity of rain that has fallen has been mach below the 'average. Large heaps of collected washing stuff are being passed through the various contrivances by whioh the metal is extraoted, and the consequence is shown in the increase in the escort returns. This increase does no1 however altogether spring from any augmen- tation in the yield. The branch banks, whioh establishments are the principal buyers, do not always send down the whole of the par- cels every week, and hence fluctuations arisa vhich, BO far as the yield of gold is con« cerned, are apparent rather than real. One thousand one hundred and seventy eight persons landed at the ort of Me1, bourne durlug the week, consisting of 209 from the Australian colonieB, 814 from the United Kingdom, 28 from Suez, 5 from Calcutta, and 17 from the United States of America, i Tin departures are computed at 140. The total addition to the population by the sea-hoard during the ourront year has been 12,840. Arrived. Departed. January . February . March. April . May . June .

The rates now are at 1 per cent, premium on England for 60 days' sight, and at 2 per cent, premium for amounts under £50 for 80 days' Bight. Freight on gold by direct steamers or sailing vessels, 3d. por ounce, deliverable ia London ; insurance, 1J per cent. ¡ by the over- land route, $ per cent,, that is, 7d. pet ¡ounce as nearly as possible ; insurance, 1J to 15 per cent. This movement has not been ac- companied by any other changes. Money continuos plentifu enough outside the banks for mortgages, at from 10 to 12 per cent., with but few transactions taking place. For commercial purposes the banks oharge : For bills under 95 days'currency, 8 per cent. ; from 95 to 126 days', 9 per cent. ; over 125 days*, 10 per cent. ; and on overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent. In the stock and share market there have been a few small transfers only. Colonial Bank shares have changed hands at £5 193., and Hobson'fl Bay Ballway shares at £7110s.; Colonial Insurance Company's shares at £1 l63., Melbourne Insurance at 13s., ond Austral- asian Insurance at £1 Ils. A small parcel of Melbourne Gas Company's shares was soldat 35 per cent, premium. No sales of Bank of Victoria shares have been reported since the half-yearly meeting of the proprietors wai held. The National Bank of Australasia is advancing in publio favor, The shares have been applied for very numerously in all the Australian colonies, and havj been allotted. Tho first board of directora will be elected on Tuesday. At the half-yearly general meeting of the proprietors of the Bank of Victoria, held on Tuesday, the report of the directors was submitted and unanimously adopted. A dividend at tho rate of 10 par 1 cent, per annum was declared. The net pro- fits for the half-year were stated at £39,744, of which amount £25,000 was apportioned to tho dividend account, £12,500 to the reserve fund account, and £2,244 to tho profit and loss ac- count. Meetings of the shareholders of tho Melbourne Fire Insurance Company and of the Australasian Fire and Life Insurance Com- pany havo been held, and very satisfactory balance-sheets exhibited. The export market has not been moved by the advices received by the mail, there not having been any sales by which to test tha feeling of buyers. In wool nothing will ha done until the public is in possession of tha fullest particulars of the close of the May saW in London. Tallow has not been affeoted, because the demand existing at present; for local use is capable of absorbing all tha parcels offering. The hide market has been very dull under the influonco of the decline of from ia. to id. per lb. in the homo market. In the import market there has been some- thing more nearly approaching to positiva stagnation than has yet been observed. The advices received by the Victoria were vagua and unsatisfactory, and those now overdue by the European are anxiously looked for. The imports np to the date of the last Can toms returns were of the value of £7,522,410, against £8,567,131 for the corresponding period of the previous year.

We have received papers from Sydney to the 5th inst. The monthly general meeting of the Chamber of Commerce was held on Monday, when the report of the Select Com- mittee appointed to consider the propriety of making an alteration in the rate of re exchange, at present charged by the banks, waB brought up. The Committee propose to reduce the rate from 20 per cent, to 15 per cent. The banks, however, aro unanimously of opinion that the present rato is not too i high, and have refused to consent to any 1 reduction. After some discussion on the adoption of the report, which was moved by Mr. Lamb, the debate was adjourned, on tha motion of Mr. Smith, to Thursday, tho 5th Inst. ' The Sydney Morning Herald reports: "Business continues very dull and inani- mate, nor can we oxpeot any improvement will take place until the arrival of later new from Kngland." The rumor as to tho possible detention of the Columbian at Sydney, appears to have origi- nated in that city, and to have gained so far on publio credence that Mr. Champion Wotton had felt bound to notice it in a letter totheSydneyjournalB. This letter says : Having learnt that rumors have been ma- liciously and extensively circulated, to the effect that the B..M.S. Columbian will not bo despatched at the contract time, with the August mails,-and as such a statement, if uncontradicted, 1B likely to prejudice the ship, I beg you will make it public that there is not, and nover has been, tho Blighest founda- tion whatever to justify such a rumor ; and I request that you will let it be knowu that an action for damogeB will be commenced against tho originators and promnlgators of those mendacious reports; as soon as I havo suc- ceeded in obtaining the necessary evidonco. The B. M. 8. Columbian Will bo despatched at noon on Wednesday next, the 11th current, in as good or bettor order than when she first loft the builder's hands. She has undergone a general and most extensive renovation of her machinery during tha three months aha has been in port ; her repairs have been nrither hurried nor superficial, but thorough, In the strictest sense of the term. On Satur- day next she will go to sea for a few hoars on a trial trip, when the professional gentlemen invited will have on opportunity of witness- ing the speed and performance of this noble sli i p. By way of Sydney we have Auckland papera to 20th July. Tho amount of Customs re- venue collected at the port of Auckland, ia the week ending 17tb, was £571 8s. 81., show- ing an increase of £65 18s. 4d. on the receipts of the previous week. The Arew Zealander of the 1'rth has tho following in its commer olnl record : The past week has been an almost unusually dull one. Wo have not a single foreign ar- rival, and but one foreign departure to record, nnineiy, tho Qazellc, for Sydney, with 1,735 bushels wheat, 17 owt. cheeBO, Bli tonB pota- toes, 6 tons onions. 20 cwt. butter, 40 tons Itnuri cum, nnd 4,000 feet sawn timber. The brig Szvan is loading for Sydney. The ship Egmont sails for Singapore at the beginning of next week, and tho barque The Bride is taking on board kauri timber for Hong Kong. The arrivals from the coast have been fllaok, ihe produce received amounting merely to 2,930 bushels whoat, 110 bushels maize, 116 bushels oats, 2 bushels applos, 25 tons potatoes, 21 cwt. bacon, 17 owt. pork, 150 lb. buttor, 70 lb. honey, 7 cwt. onions, 9 sheep, 2 pigs, 12 tons towal bark, 3 tons kauri gum, 86,000 shingles, 21,000 feet sawn and 600 cubic feet timber, 2 boats, 83 tons firewood, 1,600 rails. There has boen a notable deollne last week in the amount of Cas toms revenue received he apprehension of an enhanced rate of tariff appears to have (for that week at least) some- thing more than subsided, the receipts being only £605 10s. 4d. At the cattle sale on Friday last, there was a good supply of fat cattle, with a brisk com- petition, 20 head of fat stock, averaging £10 5a. each. Dairy cows sold at £10 6s. and £11 re- spectively. Thoro was a small market of sheep, and those realised late prices. The owes, ox Moa, from Sydney, sold at 15s. eaoh. Several horses wero disposed of privately. MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRIDES OüRREKTr.
