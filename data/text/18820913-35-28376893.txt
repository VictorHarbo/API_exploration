To understand, these facts better they should bs contrasted with: the experience of the United States. At the census of 1870 tho native American population was, in round numbers, 33 millions, and. the foroign-born 5 J- millions, which gives the foreign-born a ratio of 14-| per cent, of the whole, four times as large as the foreign-born resident ! in these two colonies. But then the bulk of'the American immigrants are Irish, English, and Scotch, speaking tho same language and ^boasting the paras blood as the majority of the people with whom they seek a home. Between 1870 and 1880-no fewer than 3,005,906 " alien passengers , arrived in j American ports; most of them to remain in the . Stetes, for the 'gain of that decade by arrivals over departures was . 2,246,501. Hers ie ah | exodus from the bid world to the new equal in magni- tude to a whole nation, suoh as nations used .to! be prior to tho dawn of our modern eraof coal,, iron; and steam. The excess of arrivals over departures alone for those 10 years .was equal to 4^- per cent, of the total ; popu- lation of tho States at.'tlio 'tónsus bf, IÖ80-^a/larger proportion than the whole foreign-born element in New .South Wales and Victoria. / Perhaps that explains iwhy political and social life is so uncertain, reckless, and dif turbedin the United States; An invasion pf snoh mag ¡tja'd*bjj..the- wiideit^hd ^most; restless^spWm'oi the oid,world;wpuldhkypbeen A-l^à^^^n^f!,un»; but so far in America, it has ended in a peapefni amal- gamation.

Sir,-I notice | your*paragraph yesterday about telephonic communication .with- George-square Church;1 - Perhaps it may interest, some of your readers to know a1 little more of what this now departure, means. I venture to ask you to insert the | following letter, which 1 have received' 'froth ' the Glasgow secretary of the National Telephone Com- pany :-,:Glasgow, June 20. Dear sir;-I was much pleased to hear that the. telephonic communication.which j we have established for you through our. Exchaugo j in Greenock between your house, Thorudean, and George square Congregational Church, fra ve you snob satisfactory results yesterday. - It'may interest you to know my expe rionoe of it hero*. During''the forenoon service 1 went to our Hillhoad Branch Exchange, which is over two miles from the centro of Glasgow, and got connected with the-church in Greenock-a distance of about 25 miles as the wire runs. i.I then distinctly; heard tbe sermon, the text being''from . the sixth chapter of Hebrews, and the words 'Heirs ot promiso.' - Occasionally 1 lost a sentence, but', on the whole, it was very perfect -the hymns given out, the organist play- , in? thom over, the rustle made 'by the people-rising, the volume of'sound by the large congregation, singing, every note coming out quite clearly and distinctly, and tho whole effect very fine. The'benediction (followed by á few moments of quiet) and the rustle: made by the people 'leavine were 'distinctly heard. The whole thing seems almost incredible; and if 1 had been tpld throe or four years ago that it wonld be possible for any one. in Glasgow to hoar a sermon being I 'preached in Greenock, 1 'am sm* 1- would not have believed it. Greenock in thia new developmcrit of the tele- phone bas'led the way in this part of the oountry. I trust I Glasgow Will not bo lons; in having such connection' too, and 'then we may have thé pleasure of letting yon' hear a'sermon preached'from a Glasgow pulpit.^Yours'truly, :D; Juhn ' stone timith;'district secretary.'
