The rainfall; which was experienced in parts of India during the latter part of February is reported by Hoare, Miller, and Company Limited to have had a bene ficial effect all oyer the jute-growiug dis tricts of Bengal. The mills, taking the view that good rains at that time of the year would possibly result in a large 'jute crop, showed signs of weakness in the for ward positions, and a fair business in all sCetious was done in Calcutta at prices that tended to recede. The near positions also showed a decline owing to the small volume of export trade. The weakness in the mar ket for jute manufactures brought out a few mills as sellers of Australian corn sacks for season's shipment, and sales were made at reduced prices. • At Colac, tlie Acting Prcmiei <Mr. McRh^ih), dii^the present#; of in<* tlie hew storage basin of tlie Colac Wate works Trust jpn-April £0. ,Wlien t}iei'proje<| wast first mooted, %! ...'ycscrvflSf had 4 capacity of 1,000,000 gallons.
