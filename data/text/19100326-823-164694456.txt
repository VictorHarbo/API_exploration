DISSUADING EMIGRANTS. SYDNEY. March 20. The Premier lias received from the Agent General the text of a warning issued by the Danish Government against emigration. The Minister for Foreign Affairs publishes the following:—"As enquiries regarding the state of affairs in Australia and New Zea land are addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs from day to day. the Minis try points out that as the difficulties for emigrants to subsist in those countries hare latterly largely increased, Danes in search of employment are earnestly dissuaded from going to the countries named." The Premier has forwarded a cable mes sage for publication to the British press:— "Wade, Premier of New South Wales, strongly resents the publication by the Danish Ministry, of Foreign Affairs of the warning against Australia as a field for emigration.'' He states that no country in the world to-day offers a better field' for industrious workers tlian New South Wales. Fully 10,000 genuine emigrants in 1909 were satisfactorily settled without delay. There was practically no unem ployed at the present time, but a huge unsatisfied demand for agricultural and domestic labour at remunerative wages. Since 1908 New South Wales had assisted 14,009 immigrants. The Government was guaranteeing work for agriculturists and domestic servants, and placing them in -satisfactory employment on the day of their landing. Hundreds of these immigrants had made homes on the land, owning free hold property, and were now prosperous farmers. All the others were earning about double the wages received in the older country. In the same period 179,594 people arrived in New South Wales and 278,619 in Australia from oversea."
