Your Governor seems a very decent sort of follow, and see he is getting from each colony an idea as to what they would pay, when he is going to write to England for steam He might as well as rise to the moon He'll got no Steam from here while the war lasts, and the best thing he can do is to try a id keep the the steamers has, for If once the shore they 'll not come back till the war is over VI I am told some of the steamers to clearing the oheshoroiu twelve months, and I have heard the the Pacific got £9000 for taking out here can KC to Balaclava, which she did in twenty-one days You can therefore make a rule of three sum of it -If a steamer can earn £5000 in twenty one days, what will she charge to carry a man to Australia Some of those fine days you'll gets mall that will astonish you at the cannon s mouth I am, Sir, yours, &c; London, 24th Noi ember, 1855 A Loiíbovpb. Audas a commentary on this letter we have the news of the successful issue of the experi- ment of the Hellespont In sad contrast with these indications of movement al>ioiid,we find an obstruction at home 'îhoSoulhAustralian Reqisterolthe2ird inst has an article on the bill now before the Legislature of that colony, ' which proposes to subsidise the Peninsular and Oriental, or some other ocean steam company, for the conveyance of the mails between these colonies and England " The Register has altogether retraced its steps in this matter The beatty support with which our contemporary welcomed the measure on its introduction has died out, and he now indulges in the following some what narrow-minded suggestions - The Legislative Council of Melbourne express their willingness to pay out of their own treasury the whole of the colonial history of the general subsidy If the people of Victoria are willing time to tax. themselves in order to secure the immediate adoption of a scheme which overlooks South Australia we see no reason why the people of South Australia should go out of their way to contribute to such a scheme Of course we do not expect that the Melbourne Post Office will forward our letters for us, but under any on instances our letters must go to Melbourne, and it is not impossible that we might find it better to fetch them ourselves than to subsidise a branch service of the grand scheme which cannot steep to include us in its general programme Lot our letters go to Melbourne, and he there till we Bond for them. At all events, before committing ourselves to large annual payments, let us reconsider the whole question, in connection with the uttered circumstances resulting from the anticipated peace We are tempted to suggest one question: What charge would Melbourne be warranted in imposing on Adelaide letters before giving them up, should the recommendations of the Register be adopted. The following extract from a private letter, dated at London the 15th February, has been handed us for publication - London, 15th February, 1856 It is generally expected that the conferences about to take place at Paris will be formally opened on the 21st Some of the plenipotentiaries appointed to take part in the proceedings have already reached Paris, and the remainder are known to be on their way, and are daily expected A despatch from Berlin announces the illness of General Williams Ad ices from Vienna state that measures are under consideration for re- establishing the Cn ic Guard It will consist of infantry, artillery, and cal army corps The announcement made on the Stock Exchange to-day, Friday, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will form Exchequer Bills and also raise a loan, the terms and conditions of which will be made known on Monday has created considerable sensa- tion Prices have fallen, with much excitement In the English funded securities there has been a fall of 15 per cent, by reason of the plan proposed by Sir J Lewis to meet deficiencies Consols yesterday up to 625 for the account, and closed at 625, opened to day at 912 to } and have further fallen to 100 to 6.
