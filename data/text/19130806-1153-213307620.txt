A MONTH TO FIND HUSBANDS. Much amusement has been caused? at the immigration station at Ellis Islan.d, . New York, by the urgent petition of two pretty blue-eyed Danish girls, Al- lild Anderson and Ingeborg Jansen, of (Jopennagen, ror permission to depart , immediately for Winona (Minnesota) . They, the "Mail" says, are the cheer- ' ful victims of an eccentric will made - by their grandfather, who bequeathed them each a half -share of 600 acres, of fine farm lands on the condition that-Y. they marry- witMn thirty days of their arrival in New York. By the terms of the will, which the two cousins ex- . plained to an interpreter, . title to .the ....... land's will not be. finally vested with . either of them until they become mo thers. If at the end of five years one " of the cousins has a child and the other . . has not, the motherless one will lose half her land to the other. If neither has children at the end of five years' the entire property is to revert to a : male cousin in Denmark. Both girls . departed for Minnesota, confidently , declaring in broken English that they would find good husbands within the stipulated, term. ; " _ r
