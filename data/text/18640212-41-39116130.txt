Tuesday, January 12. NIGHTINGALE, barque, 2S2 tons, J. Nearing, master, from Adelaide. Miscellaneous. The Nightingale. 282 tons. J. Nearing, from Adelaide, came to an anchor at about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon. She left Adelaide on Satur day night, the 20th December, and had splendid weather throughout the voyage. The Three Kings were .sighted on Thursday morning last, since when she has been making her way along the coast A few days ago she came into collision with the Yana and had her jibboom carried away. The Nightingale brings 3.267 bags flour and 3S0 bags wheat, for Messrs. Henderson and .Macfar lane.— New Zealander, January 15. MISCELLANEOUS. The Adieu is a very fine Swedish brig, which arrived on Wednesday night from Melbourne, and exhibited her superior sailing qualities by passing Cape Willoughby Lighthouse at half-past I, ana reaching the anchorage shortly after sundown. She left this port some months back hulen with cereals for Sydney, and subsequently proceeded through Torres Straits to Timor. Capt Sjolund left New South Wales fully impressed with an idea that the navigation of theStraits was attended with extreme danger, especially as the rate of insurance was so increased as to warrant the belief ; but on reaching Timor after the trip through the northern passage, he felt satisfied that there were no difficulties to mariners of extraordinary character, or even above that of voyages for which a lower rate of insurance ruled. At Timor she loaded ponies and cattle for Mauritius, and from thence took sugar to Melbourne, and after a fa vourable run down returned to Adelaide with general cargo. The Sir John Lawrence, with horses on board, sailedfor Colombo on Thursday morning, and having a fair wind made smart work of sailing down the Gulf. The Verulam has made a coasting voyage to MacDonnell Bay for portion of her wool, and Captain Angel will proceed to the Lightship on Saturday morning en route for England via King George's Sound. Her passengers will embark from the Semaphore Jetty in the Corsair on Monday, and it is expected she will avail herself of the first fair wind. As her wool is ready for shipment, touching at the Sound will not in all probabilty prevent tier from reaching London in time for the June sales. The brig Derwext has changed hands, having been purchased by Messrs. Dale, Fuller, and Co., of Port Adelaide. The Derwent. Omagh, Bowewa, and Sunrise. each with a full cargo of cereals for the neigh bouring colonies, sailed down the river on Thurs day afternoon.
