'the report and balance sheet were adopted The shareholders of the Australian Trozen Meat I'Xpoit Company had to consider at their meeting on Monday a very unfavourable report and balance sheet for the last half year's operations The chairman (Sir Jamea M'Culloch) pointed out that the uncxplain ublo lull in thu price of meat, together with the unwillmgnes8 of the directora of the Orient Company to reduce the freights for the t amago of the frozen mutton, placed the board in the position that it could only re- commend the winding up of the company This was to be regretted, as the operations of the company were of great benctit to stock owners here, and he »as confident that with J good seasons it w ould be found that the surest j way of relieving our stock market would be b) the frozen meat export trade. The corn pan) lind borrowed £11,100 on the security of ita land end plant to meet ita liabilities. In replj to a question put by Mr. T. Moody, ho stated that the sum of £1,000 would place the company m a position to suspend opera- tions and wait for a revival in the trade. A proposal waa then advanced by Mr. Moody, that as only £10 would be required irom each shareholder to raise this sum, an effort should be made to obtain it Several gentle- men expressed their willingness to contribute their proportion The suggestion, however, fell through, owing to tho strong expressions ot opinion on the part of several leading shareholders, that the wisest courso would be to let the compnu) be wound up It was pointed out that the great obstacle winch had been met was the unfair way m which the London butchers bought up Australian meat at low rates, and retailed it at the highest prices aa the local article The report and balance ahcet were adopted, and a motion directing that the company should, bo wound up voluntarily « as agreed to ritlOES OURIIENT.
