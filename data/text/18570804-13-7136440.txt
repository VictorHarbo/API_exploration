THE COAL PORTS. - The usual returns of the trade of the principal coal ports in the kingdom during the month present the following results : - In March the Tyne exported over sea 133,891 tons of coals and 10,723 tons of coke ; Sunderland, 66,898 tons of coals and 8,267 tons of coke; the Hartlepools, 33,863 tons of coals and 2,366 tons of coke; Blyth, 6,161 tons of coals ; Amble, 3,974 tons of coals ; Seaham, 5,900 tons of coals ; Middlesborough, 7,784 tons of coals and 2,013 tons of coke ; Hull, 3,188 tons of coals ; Grimsby, 5,890 tons of coals ; Liverpool, 36,740 tona of coals and 178 tons of coke; Cardiff, 88,059 tons of coals and 497 tons of coke ; Swansea, 19,104 tons of coals and 302 tons of coke ; Newport, 18,088 tons of coals ; Llanolly, 2,781 tons of coals ; Glasgow, 3,366 tons of coals ; Greenock, 2,417 tons of coals, Grangemouth, 2,218; Alloa, 4,158 ; St. David's, 1,678 ; and Troon, 3,656 tons of coals. The quantities of coals sent coast- wise from Newcastle in March were 1,492,203 tons ; Shields, 1,156; Blyth, s,703; Amble, 710; Sunder- land, 97,175 ; Seaham, 50,325 ; Hartlepool, 83,204 ; Stockton, 221 ; Middlesborough, 7,556 ; Hull, 1,324 ; Goole, 5,864 ; Swansea, 22,233 ; Cardiff, 38,115 ; Lla- nelly, 20,009; Newport, 37,397; Pembray, 4,346; Troon, 12,214 ; Ardrossan, 3,424 ; Ayr, 5,547 ; Irvine, 1,815; Alloa, 1,585; Borrowstounness, 2,564 ; Inver keithing, 1,132; Maryport, 17,686; Whitehaven, 10,151; Penclawdd, 845; Charlestown, 5,408; St. David's, 1,546 tons. The value of goods, other than coals and coke, exported from the following north-east ports in March was as under: - Newcastle-on-Tyne, 110,848L.March, 1856, 63.252L.; increase,47,596L. Sun derland, 7,377L ; March, 1856,13.825L.; decrease, 6,448L. The Hartlepools, 135,541L. ; March, 1856, 75,311L. ; increase, 60,230L. Mlddlesborough, 56,245L., March, 1856, 23,888L. ; increase, 32,357L. The long-continued south-east winds considerably impeded the trade of the north-east coal ports in March, and at the com mencement of this month an immense mass of shipping had accumulated in all the harbors. On Tuesday last 900 vessels were in Shields harbor alone, the value of which, with their cargoes, could not be leas than 1,500,000L. sterling;. A beautiful west wind, however, commenced blowing on Wednesday, and on that day and Thursday all the vessels ready for sea sailed. The view from the coast of Northumber- land and Durham on the evenings of those two days was magnificent, from the immense number of vessels crowding under full sail to the southward. Very few casualties have occurred in getting the mass of property to sea. - Brown's Export List. THE LAST OF THE SOUND DUES. - The last ship that paid the Danish dues on passing the Sound was the British steamer Shamrock, and the first ship that passed inward into the Sound free was the British steamer Gertrude. We have here the practical cessa- tion of an impost against which we have unceasingly protested, and the commencement of an immunity which we have earnestly advocated. The Danish Sound dues, after having been levied for nearly 200 years, have virtually ceased to exist, and the ships of all nations, or rather of such nations as have sub- scribed to the new treaty, may now enter into or sail from the Baltic without paying any toll to Denmark for that privilege. We say the levy of the dues has virtually ceased, notwithstanding that the treaty has not yet received the ratification of Parliament, inas much as it is quite impossible that this country will permit a re-imposition of the dues in any shape or form. The treaty for their purchase may not em- body the best terms for Great Britain that could have been insisted upon, and the policy of purchasing an exemption which we could claim aa a right may be open to cavil ; but the expediency of the abolition of the dues admits of no doubt, and the conviction of such expediency will go a long way towards recon ciling the British Parliament to the treaty in question. \- Mitchell's Maritime Register. TELEGRAPHIC COmiUNIOATIOÜ W1TB INDIA. Tho success of any tolographlo Uno to India noces tjorOy depends on tho support of tho commorclal GUIBSOS of this country. Government aid Is only sub- sidiary, and doos not Insure succoss ; and in the form in which It has hoon given (to tho Euphrates telograph It only a payment for work whon it is actually done, for mossagos already transmitted, reserving, however, Kioat supervision over the operations of the company to tho Government. Ula Uno which in practice will transmit the mes- sages with least interruption will bo adoptod by the Oovermnont and all classes. Tho commorclal classes will support the undertaking which liest suits their interests. Now, upo« this point ve approhond there Is n0 difference of opinion. Tho Euphrates telegraph is to traverse deserts in ?which wandering tribes of Arabs soek a livelihood by plundering tho sodontary tribes, tho Turkish officiais, and, tlio caravans. The intermediate stations aro of no Importance to us commercially, and of but slight importanco politically. Tho very construction of a telegraph, which IB of that slight nature as almost to Snvtto destruction at the hands of the mischievously Inclined, renders it liable to interruption in traversing such wild districts without the protection of an esta- blished transit route. On the contrary, the Rod Sea line is to traverse seas which aro tho commercial high- way to countries with which wo have the most ox tondod relations, namely China and Australia. Ships Tiound outward will receive at Aden the latest telegraphic intclligonco from India and England, mioso bound homeward will transmit from ¿dea tho latost Chinóse and Australian news to India and England. Our merchants both in India and hero will bo onablod.to send orders to their ships to any of tho numerous stations in the trtod Sea and Indian Ocoan, and will receive news of thom on their pasBago. Tho "through" messages will bo transmitted instantaneously on each line, so "(hat in that respect notthor will have the advanta^o. In fact each of tho rival linos is to begin at Alexandria, and each is to terminate at Kurrachoo, in the Eist Indies. The difference In longth is immaterial ; it is seo milos. In rospect of spoed of exooution there is 710 comparison botweon the two lines. The Euptiratcs line cannot bo constructed till a con- cession ts obtained from the Porte, which fs not don o till arrangements for the permanont security of the line [hare been modo with the Porto and the Arab tribes. The Porto is incapablo of affording protection, never having yet Bucceodofl in establishing Its autho íty fa Mesopotamia. Tho Arabs cannot for two aucco'slvo years ho dopondcdupon to observe any ti cot} Mid not to ask for incrcaiod subildios. Each tilbe can only protect the Uno in its own territory, end vii on at war cannot provont tho onomy destroy- ing tho wires even thore. Any arrangement whatever must assumo a state of peaco botwocn tho trlboa them- selves and betwoon thein and the Porto, a stato of things which notoriously nover oxists In that c ountry. On tho contrTy, very complote charts and sounllngj have hoon made by tho East India Company of tho Rod Sea and Indian Ocean. Tho cabio Ima only to bo manufactured and laid ; all the preliminary arrangements hove boon made. The manufacturo of tho cabio would at most occupy five months, and the laying of tho line would bo at- tended with small risk in those southern latitud» s. whero tho weather is fit forthnl purposo forton months out of tho twelvo.-Daily News.
