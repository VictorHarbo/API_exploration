WELL TO-DAY, SICK TO-MORROW.— Such is the experience of thousands. Few enjoy continuous health. To what does tho occasional in valid attribute his uncertain condition ? Not to himself, of course. He lays tho blame on tho cli mate, perhaps. It is too hot, or too rold, or too damp, or too dry, or too variable. But does ho toko tho proper courso_ to fortify his constitution and bodily organs against tho extremes and changes of which ho complains 1 No. Ho says, perhaps, that only an iron man could boar such great heat, or such violont cold, or such sudden vicissitudes. Why then does he not resort to the great, tonio and preventa tive, which, if it will not make him an iron man, will at least quadruplo tho capacity of his system to repel all external agoncies that tond to produce disease. HOSTETTER'S CELEBRATED STOMACH BIT TERS, taken faithfully according to tho directions, will so strengthen tho stomach, brace tho nerves, tone the liver, and regulate and invigorate tho .whole animal machinery, that the system, instead of being at the morcy of the weather, and liable to be pres tratod by every chango of temperature, will become case-hardened, as it were, and almost impervious to climatio influences.
