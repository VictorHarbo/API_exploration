STRANGWAYS, Commissioner of Crown I^ands and Immigration. I ''he 'ka e ' unda' post-office!' J- TO THE EDITOn. Sir— In your issue of the 10th inst. you intimate hat with Mr. Darwin's second letter the corre- i ipondence must close; but as the matter is of ' ome iinportance to the public as well us myself, I ind as it has gone so far. I am not disposed tu let ' Hr. Darwin oil so easily, and therefore request ' ou to insert this aud tne enclosed letter as an idvertisement. ' Mr. Dartrin stated in his first letter that it was j alse to say that a letter 9) go by the last train had ' 0 be posted an hour before the train started, and ' issertPil that letters could lie posted up to half an lour of the train starting. In his second letter, by ? )ubjishing the time-table, he convicts himself of I 1 ini- istrUemcnt; for he shows that the mail for ! he half-past 4 train closes at a quarter to 4. True ' by a sort of grace, I suppose), he says letters may i te posted five minutes later. The fact is. Sir,'! Wien Mr. D. thinks fit to close his bags prior to | he departure of a train, he puts up a notice out- i lide the office to that effect; but 1 am in a position o say that it sometimes happens (and has hap- ; -ened very recently) that such notice has ajipeared several minutes before the legal time ; so that I vas not far wrong when 1 said letteis should be josted one hour before the starting of a tram. Mr. I), further says that on the day in question. ! riz., the Friday Iwfore the meeting in Gawler, and :onsequently before any public refcience had been nade to the working of his office, he timed the irrival and departure of my messenger, who he says waited three minutes and a half. Very ?xtraordinar}-, indeed. Does he time every cus ;omer that knocks, and so take stock of his patience? Pity but that he waited upon them m*tcad ef watching the clock. But, Sir, the ;hing is too ab3unl -he has endeavoured to prove too much, and therefore I for one don't believe in liim. I am, Sir, ivc, JAS. HARRIS. Gasler, July 13, 1SG3. 'Kapunda, July 11, 1853. 'Sir— When I went to the Post- Office last Friday week there was some person knocking. He got no answer, and went to the nublic-houEc opposite. I saw him putting a stamp on a letter us he was coming bnck to the Post. He posted the letter; then went away. Then two ladies came, and knocked several times. One said to the other, 'The Post is not open,' and went away unanswered. Then Mr. Darwin's assistant came out, and -went to the Sir John Franklin. When he came back I was standing by the Post- Office door. I saw him go into the letter department, and then back to the telegraph department with some newspapers. I knocked again, got no auswer, then went away. ' I told Mr. John Harris I could get no one to open the door. I said I have been tncrel5or20 minutes. He pulled out his watch, and said, ' Yes, you have.' . ' , 'I '1 d not see Mr. Darwin's assistant when I wa* tfiing to the Post, neithefwhen I was leaving. 'What I have written is' correct. ' ; ' Aitout the time of day I could not say, but it was after the North mails li»d started. ? ' I am, your obedient servant, 'S, A. Bubford. 'Mr. Bams,' x LAND AUCTION NOTICES.
