FROM ALIEN LANDS. Arrivals Last Year Total 4,048. Prompted by anxiety about the numbers of immigrants of alien origin being admitted to Australia compared with those of British Istock, the Returned Servicemen's League has obtained from the Com monwealth Statistician (Mr. R. Wilson) a statement of total arrivals in Australia during 1946 of all per sons of European and non-European origin and of those of each race who came to settle permanently in the Commonwealth. The comparatively high figure for the British would be largely attributable to arrivals of war brides of Australians who served overseas. "The statistics tabulated below were compiled from passenger lists which, under the Commonwealth Navigation Act, are required to be furnished by the master of every ship entering Australia," Ml. Wilson explains. "The requisite date inserted on the passenger lists regarding each passenger is extracted from his or her passport. "Racial origin of persons entering Australia is shown and is not to be confused with nationality. For ex ample, a person included under Ger man race could be a naturalised British national. The number of persons of British nationality is not, therefore, confined to the 27.641 persons of British stock mentioned in the table and the Cypriots (17), Maltese (131) and Indians (511); It includes a proportion of the per sons of other races. "The term Palestinian covers persons described simply as Jews. A proportion of the number shown , under German, Austrian and Polish: races can also be described as Jewish, 1 as the practice has been to code ' German-Jews, Austrian-Jews, etc., as Germans, Austrians, etc." Permanent Total Race.
