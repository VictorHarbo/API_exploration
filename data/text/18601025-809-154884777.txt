There ? are several matters in connection -with our harbour, which are worthy of notioe. The first is the- breakwater at Williamflto-wn. The total length of timber work along the centre line of this work is 1007 feet 4 inchos, by an. average breadth of 55 feet 2j inches, and composed of 101 bays of 10 feet' each. The form is a trape zium, succeeded by five trapezoids. The embank ment extends 660 feet from the northern base of the lighthouse to the junction of the timber work, and from the lighthouse to the intersection of the mainline is-1010 feet. The piles in the work are 1200 in number, averaging 46 feet in length, uud tho total quantity of timber exceeds 1,600,000 feet, which was all cut and shipped in six months; and to carry this large quantity thirty vessels, ranging from 150 to 300 tons_ regis- ter, have been required. The wholo of the piles are driven, and the other portions of ? the work arc in. such a forward state that it is expected that in one month from this time, it will be com pleted, when six vessels of the largest tonnage can bo safely moored alongside- without risk. In magnitude this is the greatest that has yet been done in the colony. Thero is but: one fault, as far as can be seen, and that is the want of u berth at the outer end, long enough for the accommo dation of mail steamers. The longest one being only 200 feet. This would be a serious want Should these steamers at any time make this their head quarters, And as it is a Government work, this omission ought to be remedied by extending tho outer berth 360 feet. . It may not be out of place here, to mention that since the sailing of tho lust mail, the Swangpit Light-ship has been removed, and the New Pilt Light-house illuminated in its steud. ? It is of the same color and character (fixed and red) as 'that 'formerly 'exhibited on board the light-ship, but much superior, being on the catadioptric princi ple; and as there are only two assistants required to attend it, and does not consume above half the quantity of oil, it will bo worked ut a much loss cost than the former one. Some short time ago complaints were made that a ridge of 'Mind, from 15 to 18 feet, had grown out from the lighthouse to the north- east, 'for n distance of Io0 feet, but it is so soft and narrow that several vessels drawing 18 feet of water huvo passed over it, and although sounding for itpurpuscly tho authorities have been unable to llnd less thim 4 fathoms, being the soundings, in mid-channel. During the last fortnight the steam- dredge tender Venus has boon engaged for a few days with a kind of har row raking up the sand on tliis ridge, vrliiuh tho ebb tide immediately sweeps awuy,. and we have been : informed that in another week it will be completely cleared by tho current, in the same manner as the Wandsworth and other shoals in the WeBt Channel have been. We now turn to tho imprd yemeuts in the Yarra. The new en trance to this river has been considerably deepened, and is now open to shipping, thus enabling vessels drawing 14 feet water to proceed , right up to the Melbourne wharves which no ,' doubt will bo a great boon to the coasting ships, j they having lately been rather in a depressed condition. ' Wo are also glad to loam that something is 1 being done, or about to bo done, with regard to ? the protection of Hobson's Bay. The Defence b Commission ha vo recommended a strong battery [ to be erected on piles near the St. Kilda white buoy, and another on the extremity of the break ' water. The old battery at Gellibrand's point to '' be re-modelled, and to prevent these being token ' from: behind, several small batteries, are to be ;' erected on the back beach, each commanding the j other, thus being ablo to keep up a .cross fire, 2 under which nio enemy would bo ablo' to effect n 0 landing. Some small batteries near Saudridge, ' and one or Wo at St. Kilda, are to be formed, also ;! a chevcaux-de-frise, to be driven' in the ' shoal ^between tho white buoy and Sandridgt 5j beach, which will prevent armed boats making a \- dash at our batteries or shipping. And as oui ' military works are now under the supervision 01 a most efficient and experienced cngineer- oflicer, '' we trust the Legislature will vote the suras no '? cessary to complete these fortifications forthwith '? When done, these will, in addition to tho forts ai J' the Heads, put us in a position to bid defiance tc L' any force that could be sent against us. It woulc 1 also -tend to keep alive the martini spirit amonp j our Volunteers, by giving them something to dc ,' in manning the fort.s and accustoming them t( .? their duties. 1, The ship Merlin, under tho command of Captaii 1, Borlase, arrived in the Bay yesterday with 32 i ; Governmen; immigrants, -who aro classified ai 2 follows : 19 married couples, X single man, 26! -, single women, 9 children, and 5 infants. Through ?- out the passage there has been no sickness. Phi 8 cleanliness of the ship is such as to reflect gTea -s credit oh all connected with her. .-AK.-UVAl/j' AND UKIWUTI'KIW' SIXCK LAST' MAIL.
