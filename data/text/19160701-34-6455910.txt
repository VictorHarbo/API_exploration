Mother, Don't Hesitate If your Child is Cross, Feverish, Corj-tiptUed, give California Syrup of Figs. Look at your child's tongue, mother If coated, it is a sure sign that the little one's stomach, liver and bowels need a gentle, thorough cleansing at once. When peevish, cross, listless, pale, unable to sleep, doesn't eat, or act naturally; or if it is feverish, with a disordered stomach and tainted' breath, or has stomach ache. sore throat, diarrhoea, or the " stuffiness " caused by a cold, give a teaspoonful of California Syrup of Figs ' Califig.' and in a few hours all the foul, constipated waste matter, undigested food and sour bile gently move out of its little bowels without griping, and you have a healthy, playful child again. You needn't coax sick children to take this harmless fruit laxative; they love its delicious taste, and it always makes them feel splendid. Ask your chemist for a bottle of ' Califig ' - California Syrup of Figs, which has directions for babies, children of all ages and for grown-ups plainly on the bottle. To be sure you get the genuine, ask to see that it is made by California Fig Syrup Company. Refuse any other kind with contempt.
