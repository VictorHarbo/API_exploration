The -City of Hobart met witli very boislorous wea ther on her passage to tliie port, and lay at anohor for several hours in l-'ortcscue Bay. : The Royal Maii, Ship Blaokwall. — ThcBlnek- wall, Captain M'Kirlie, is to be tho Royal Mull ship of the 30th inst. She is oue of the smallst, and at ilic samn time ono of the smartest of the Blaokwall line. She lias enjoyed on all her voyages tho' repu- tation of being an exoellout sen- going vessel. The Blackwoil will, we understand, be it full ship both as regards passengers and carg ».—Jrgus. As the Wonga Wonga was leaving Sydnoy Heads, a British frigate, apparently of 36 guns, was enter- ing ; she, however, did not show her number, hut. is supposed to be H.M.S; Tribune.— Ibid. Mr. Cleveland, lute of ll.M.S, Juii'o, reports ha ving visited Norfolk Island in that vesaei lately. He says the inhabitants art not in actual watit of any-, thing bnt clothing. Potatoes, were very scarco ; the. Bishop of New Zealand supplied tliant with ten tons, nnd the Juno with yams and thru' root.— Ibid. The City of Hobart reports nothing. of iuterest.' Site brings a more than usually large cargo, having some 200 tons of goods'on board.— Tit'rf. . SttiFPtxa. — Our inner harbour now wears a more cheerful nspect than it lias done for many months. The Brilliant is taking in wool; and within tho' past uiue working days one thousand bales have been shipped: tho lading is to; be oomploted early in December, in order that sho may sail promptly on the 10th. - Tho agents of the Derwcut are also using all despatoh; n considerable quantity of wool'is already on board, and tho intended time of departure is from tho lOtli to tho 15th December. ' The' Aits- ' trnl is a sister ship to the . Heatiter Bell, and lias come down from Hobson's Bay to deliver on the wharf tho portion of the' eargo consigned to Geo- long. The barquo India,: which commenced dis charging on Afonday, lias pushed on the work with such creditable celerity that to-day it was completed, and tile hold swept out; the entire cargo lias' been sold and delivered in a satisfactory condition.": The Free Trader, a pretty little barque from Hobart Town, passed through the ship channel this after- noon in gallant stylo, and took iter place among the other colonial vessels anoliored near the wharves. And at Point Heury there are lying the newly- arrived immigrant shins' Nugget 'and' 'Thames. — Qtehmy Advertiser.
