MONETARY & COMMERCAIL The Advertiser Office. Tuesday evening, February 21. Dealing with the London money market, the Economist of January 14 writes:—The chief monetary event of the week has been the sus pension of gold purchases by the Bank of France. As our Paris correspondent points out, the bank was driven to take this step because its note mrculationhad nearly attained its legal muTimnm The limit of its note issues is fixed at £140,000,000, having been raised nine years ago from £120,000,000 to that figure; and in this week's return the amount of notes in circulation is sell down at £135,902,000. Its reserve of notes has thus been reduced to leas than £1,100,000, and naturally it is more anxious to increase thJB reserve by pay ing out coin than to diminish it by purchases of gold. If the Bank of France were, like the Bank of England, authorised to issue to any extent against gold this difficulty would not have arisen. In a bimetallic country, how ever, it would be anomalous to sanction issues against gold only, and although it has been proposed to increase tbe limit of issue to £1<X),OOO,OO0, the requisite authority has not yep been obtained. But although for the time being the Bank of France has as much gold as it can carry, it would be premature to oorf clude that no more of the metal will be shipped to Paris. There ara some reasons for believing that tbe increase in the bank's circu lation is due to a desire on the part of Paris bankers to strengthen themselves in view of the present unset clement of political and finan cial affairs. For that purpose the notes of the Bank of France are as good as and much more convenient than gold, but if these cannot be had the metal itself will be taken. In looking to the future of our osra money market, moreover, it most be remembered that the Austrian-Hungarian demaad for the gold with which to carry out the currency reform will now become more active, and that very possibly the United States, which have lost more of the metal than they can well spare, may find it necessary to take measures to obtain supplies from this side. It must not be supposed, therefore, that the action of the Bank of France implies a comparative immunity of the Bank of England from foreign demands for the metal. Still as M. Octomar Haupt observes there is something incongruous in the outcry which the bimetallisms are raising about the scarcity of gold at the very moment when supplies of the metal are beating against tbe doors of the Bank of France and are refused admittance. The London Statist remarks: —It is esti mated by chose who are in a position to know that within the past two years the volume of bills has contracted 25 to 30 per cent., and if we take this statement in connection with tbe shrinkage in the bnainesa done on the Stock Exchange we have a very fait explanation for the amount of unemployed money now held in London. One writer turns up the position in a few words—"Trade is depressed, prices are exceptionally loir, speculation is paralysed." Outside communities are going through a period of liquidation, and until this baa been computed new risks will not be accepted. This view of the Euro pean monetary situation, it may be said, reflects in no small degree the situation in .Australia* That this condition of affairs ***** continue muoh longer is difficult to believe, the very weight of the accumulations mnst Booner or later tend to break down the bar riers surrounding credit. It is not in tbe ordinary course to expect that capitalists will be content to earn only I to 1 per cent, for their money long, nor is the steady de cline in bank dividends which is the natural outcome of the stagnation likely to be at tractive to shareholders. If money is to earn money it must be employed, and hence it is quite probable that brighter times, in the absence of any disturbing political events, may not be far distant. The shrinkage in the London bank dividends is shown by the fol lowing statement of tbe rate of dividend per cent, per annum declared by the under mentioned banks and discount companies for each half-year since December, 18S!>, in clusive :— The secretary of the Associated Banks in forms us that the deposit rates now are: —For 3 months, 2 per cent, per annum; for 6 months, 3 per cent, ocr annum ; and for 12 months, 4 j per oent. per ">"nm, Immigration to Australia from the United Kingdom continues to decline. In 1892 only 16,164 persons left British ports for these colonies against 19,957 in the previous year. The falling oS is 3,793, or more than 18 per oent. As, under present arrangements, nearly all Australian immigrants pay their own passages, and are likely, therefore, to be Eelf-supporting and self-reliant, the diminu tion possesses some significance. The ex perience of Canada has been precisely the reverse. Last year 41,888 emigrants left Great Britain for British North America against 33,752 in the previous year, an in crease of 8,136, or about 25 per oent. The directors of,the Broken Hill South Block 5 Company intimate in the half-yearly report that they have called an extraordinary j meeting of the shareholders to be held in Mel bourne on Thursday, February 23, to consider the present position of the company. The balance-sheet, which appears elsewhere, places the company's call*! up capital at £57,512, while there is a bank overdraft of £G23. Oat standing accounts amount to £543, and the total, including the overdraft, is £58,907. On the other hand the mine property is valued at £23,000 and the plant at £2,896, while out standing calls reach £1,348. The profit and loss account shows a balance to the bad of £29,23 L The half-yearly meeting of the company will be held in Melbourne to morrow* In the import market to-day a fair business is reported. Sugars are firm, and a steady i demand continues. The tea market is alow, and there is little inclination to operate in parcels. Respecting teas in the Melbourne market Messrs. Copland, Maokie, & Co. re port as follows: —China—"The chief incident of the month has been the clearance from first hands of all stocks of ordinary common congou, the small quantity now available being above this grade. TJBe is nothing now to be had under 6£d. Upgrades above 7d. there is very little business passing, owing to tho firmness of holders and the dis inclination of buyers to pay the advance. Very good value is to be had in flavory first crop and strong second crop panyongs from Bd. to 9d., and in fine teas about lid. Business promises to be of a hand-to-mouth character for the next few weeks, though an increased demand for export is anticipated. Indian and Ceylon—The New Guinea has been the only arrival, with 194,738 lb. for Melbourne and 162.356 lb. for other ports. Only one small auction, comprising 000 cheats of good pekoes, has been held during the month, when prices again moved up wards. Owing to short supplies private busi ness has been limited to eupplying current wants, the general enquiry being for price teas. The Argus is due at the end of the month with 86,000 lb. for Melbourne. The Waroonga is placed to leave Calcutta on 26th inst. So far only 500 chests have been declared for her, and in is qnite possible that this will not be added to. The Calcutta market is now virtually closed. Anything following the Waroonga will be, from the limited stocks, reserved for this market. Our next auction will be held on 23rd inst., 2,550 packages being printed for that date. We anticipate high prices at auction, and consider that any leaf teas with good oup now obtainable up to 8-Jd. or 9d. are worth attention. Last year arrivals of Indian between Ist March and end of the season amounted to 850,000 lb.; we do not expect to see half this total reached this year. Ccylons—About 1,700 packages have arrived and have sold readily at remunerative rates. At auction 7JWL to 7|d. is now given for brownish brokens, 'and Sd. to 9d. for fair to good pekoe souohongs. Really fine teas are enquired for, but are in small supply. Unfavorable weather is reported from the tea districts, resulting in crops proving tnuoh below estimates. Colombo cables of this week report an advance of 5 to 7* per cent, in lower and medium grades." A slightly better demand exists for kerosine, and sales are re ported of 1,500 cases Crystal Water White to arrive at lOid. per gallon on wharf at Port Adelaide. In dried fruits there is nothing freeh to notice, bales are email. A sale of 70 cases ling is re{X>rted. and this constitutes the bulk of the business effected in fish. In other lines we notice tales ot 5 tons blunstone, 10 hogshead hollowr re, a parcel of whiting, and 10 bales orebags. In liquids sales are reported of 250 cases Johnson's snout, 100 cases Aitkin's ale, and 50 cases D.C.L. whisky. In dealing with the oopper market the Mining Journal, under date London. January 13, says:—There baa been no well defined movement of any eort in the specula tive market this week, but the tendency has been rather towards easier prices, the market being to some extent affected (through the medium of " bear" sales of Tinto shares) by the unsettled state of thing? in Paris. Busi ness on Monday took place at £46 ss. to £46 B.c.,and£46 lls. 3d. and £46105. three months, jfjje total tnwsacjjons were about LlOO tone, j On Tuesday, after £46 had again been paid for 8.0., the tone improved somewhat, and £46 3a. 9d. was done, and £4C sa. and HAS 3a. 3d. on Wednesday. The business on Thurday con sisted chiefly of oarryiug ; £46 11b. 3d. was, however, paid for three months, and £46 for AC. To-day, after transaotioua at £4G a.c. and £46 10s. three months, the market closed eteady at £46 to £46 2d. 6d. c.c., and £« Bs. ad. to £46 lls. 3d. three months. The market for refined sorts continues quiet, demand being limited and affected by the general Blackness of trade. Prices are notwithstanding very steadily held in furnaoe material The few parcels of wheat that are offering are taken up by the millers at 3s. 3d. per bushel, gross weights, bags as wheat, for fair average qualities usual deliveries at Port Adelaide, but there are no eager buyers, which is not to be wondered at seeing that Melbourne quotations are l(d. to 2d. a bushel lower than ours; at outports or for email lota 3a. Id. to 3a. 2d. is value. Leading brands of patent roller flour arc selling slowly at up to £8 7s. 6d., and ordinary brands £7 15a. to £8 per ton. Bran is 9d. and pollard 9Jd. per bushel. Oatu unchanged at 2a. 4d. per bubhel in bond and 3d. 3d. to 3s. 4d. duty paid and delivered in Adelaide. WjilblDg barley, 4s. 3d. to 4s. Ltd. per busheL The Mark Lane Express of January 1G writes :— Foreign 'wheat has fullen 66. p*-r qr. at most markets, but trade is now Bteady at the reduction, which still leaved sclvarCd. advance since the cud of the old year. Liver pool lost ground on Tuesday for tine white wheat as well as for ordinary foreign sorts. But on Friday the holders of tbe better qualities required tbe previous Friday's terms. The total visible supply of wheat in the United Kingdom or on passage ther-to is 10,402,000 qrs., aa compared with 10,498,00(1 qrd. a year ago and 8,689,000 Qrs. two yean since. Tbe visible supply of wheat in the United States is 13,093.000 qre., against 5,G40,000 qrs. and 5,800,000 qrs. in tbe two preceding years. Of the visible supply id Russia we never get full returns, but the Black S«a ports are known to hold 850,003 qrs. of wheat, against 522,000 qrs. in 1592 and 1,235,000 qrs. in 189 L The Netherlands and Franco also give us very incomplete figures, but as those for the present data are not more incomplete than those of 1592 and 1891, purposes of com parison are served, and we are accord ingly able to give the following table of wheat sup plies in hand and in prospeot on 12th January, 1893, 1892, and 1891 respectively:— • It is remarkable that when our 21 millions were in eight value ranged from 35a. to 425., against a rauge of from Sis. to S3s. only when V6\s millions was the total in view. But the present total of 23 millions may be reckoned at fully 5 millions, or 20 per cent, in excess of what is required. Adelaide Dairt Produce ILmiket. Messrs. A.
