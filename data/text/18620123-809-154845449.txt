The Watir Nymph continues to keep up her reputation as one of the fastest regular packets to this port. On her present passage she left Spit head on the evening of the 14th November, and armed in IIobRon'a Uay yesterday, forenoon, thereby making tho passage in sixty-eight days. This, we believe, hus been unsurpassed sinoo the quickest passage on record (G5 days) made by the Jamefl JJaincs. The Water Nymph is still com manded by Captain Stewart. The Kuesian frigate Swetlana left Hobson's Bay, on her homeward route, at 6 a.m. yesterday. She saluted -with twenty-one guns, which was reHjpdnded to by H. M. Bteam frigate Pelorus. The VVliite Swan arrived in Hobson's Hay from Adelaide yesterday at noon. She loft that port on the morning of the 19th, arrived next day in Guichen Bay, where she discharged cargo, and took on board a quantity of ?wool for this port. She left Guichen Bay on Tuesday morning, and accomplished the trip thence to this place xn the short space of 33 hours— the distance being 32.3 miles. After leaving Adelaide she encountered a very severe gale from the south-east, with heavy cross sens, which continued until Tuesday morn ing, when it moderated, and later in the day the wind chopped round to the 80U*- ^R\v, V ® observe by the Adelaide papers that the White Swan made her last trip to Adelaide in ol aoura. The Hydra, having been thoroughly overhauled and repaired, was yesterday launched from out of Dove, Oswald and Inglis's floating dock. The Clakkmont.— The London pilot left the above ship on October 16, and during the royage out, in consequence ef meeting with light, van able,' and unsteady windg, the vessel's progress ha? been considerably retarded, although the passage was completed in less than the average number of days. Captain M'Intosh has, on several occasions, visited tho colonies, having been at Adelaide last in charge of the Oriental, a ship whioh brought out immigrants. The following vessels have been communicated with during the voyage :— On 11th November, in lat. 6° W N., long. 24° 65' W., signalled the American ship Edward, from Liverpool to Calcutta! on Hth November, in lat. 6° 21' N., long. 24° 38' W., signalled the barque Victoria, from London, 30 days out, bound to Kurrachee j on 15th November, in lat. 5 ° 2 N.,long. 26° 41' W., the Danish ship George F.

The Eaui, of Hakdwickb.— The Earl of Hard wicke is expected to float off this morning. The steam- tug Young Australian has been in readi ness during the past two mornings' tide ; but there has not been, sufficient -water for the opera tion. Mr Welle received some damage by a block falling from aloft on his back ; but it is not of a very serious character. — S.A. Register, 17th January. Tub Fikeixy. — The Firefly, -which was stranded near the Semaphore durinc the last gale, having sustained no very serious damage, a contract was' taken to float her, and the exertions ef a gang of men, aided by a set of woolscrews, .placed her in. such a position that on Wednesday morning's tide she floated, and in the evening was towed to the Port, where she was laid on the bank for re pairs. — S.A. Register, 17th January. DISMASTING OF THE SHIP LILLIES. Yesterday afternoon this ship returned to port having lost her bowsprit, foremast, mainmast, mizen topgallant mast, and all the yards and gear attached thereto. The ship left Hobson's Bay on Tuesday morning at six a.m., and had got five miles outside the Heads when she wjis hove to for the pilot to leave. Immediately afterwards Capt. Bell filled on the ship, and before she had time to gather head-way a whirlwind struck her, throw ing her first nearly on her beam ends, and the next instant taking her flat aback, thereby doing the damage above enumerated. The ship being thus placed in a perfectly unmanageable state was immediately assisted and taken in tow by the pilot cutter Corsair, by means of which she reached a safe anchorage inside the Heads. The wreck was secured with the intention of towing it to the Bay, but yesterday morning being so boisterous, it was cut adrift for the safety of the ship. The following is the report, as furnished by the ship's log:— At 5 a.m., pilot came on board and got the bhip under way ; wind, light, from N., and fine weather. Proceeded down the . Bay ; wind drawing to S.E., and at 1 p.m. to N.N.E., fresh. Took in all light sails. At 4 p.m., hove ship to, five miles outside the Heads, to discharge the pilot. At this time courses were up, mizentopgallant sail and outer jib down As soon as the pilot left, trimmed^ the yards, set the foresail, and put the ship on her course. At this time she was caught in a complete whirlwind, let fly the halyards fore and aft, but from her first going on her beam ends, and the next instant being caught_ flat aback, the yards would not run down, and in consequence the following damage was done: — Bowsprit and jibboom gone with all the gear, foremast and all above foreyard over the side ; mainmast sprung, main yard carried away in the slings, and all above that over the side ; muen topgallant mast gone, mizen topsail yard gone, two boats crushed by fall of tho foremast ; starboard anchor (36 cwt.) hove inboard, one flue going through the deck, all sails lost. In this state, being per fectly unmanageable, and one anthor disabled, made a signal for assistance, which was rendered by tho pilot cutter Corsair taking her in tow, and bringing her to a safe anchorage.
