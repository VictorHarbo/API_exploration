COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Tuesday Evening. Export entries were passed to-day at the Customs for. 23,102 ounces of gold, of which 21,752 ounces were for shipment in the European for England, via Suez, and 1,846 ounces for Hong Kong, in the William, the remainder being in the hands of passengers. In the gold market there has not been much doing lately, either in shipments or in purchases for the in A steamer and other opportunities. The quantity offering in Melbourne has been very small, as prices on the goldfields have been uniformly maintained at a higher rate than those given by the Melbourne bullion brokers, which are as follow Omeo gold, 63s. to 75s. 6d. Pleasant Creek and Goulburn, 75s. to 76s. (6d. Bendigo, Castlemaine, and Jim Crow, 75s. 6d. to 77s. 6d.; Ararat, Maryborough, Dunolly, Fiery Creek, Avoca, and Amherst, 77s. to 75s. ; the Ovens, 77s. 6d. to 79. ;. Ballaarat, 76s. 6d to 19s. 6d. These prices are founded on the basis of 74s. per ounce for standard gold. The escorts received last week at the Treasury amounted to 40,760 ounces. This quantity is 2,080 ounces above the average of the year 1857, 7,825 ounces above that of the first quarter of the current year, and 4,460 ounces above that of the second quarter. As compared with the corresponding week of last year, it shows a deficiency of 78 ounces. Comparing the separate items rim mer~. vitamin a healthy appearance. The Sandhurst district is the most regular in its total. In the following table, the fortnightly escorts are distinguished by the prefix of an asterisk : Castlemaine ., Sandhurst ., Ballaarat.

This, added to the previous shipments-the total being corrected by comparison with the export entries at the Cas- toms brings the total of the year to 1,710,610 ounces, or 71 tons 5 cwt. 2 qrs. 3 lbs. 4 ozs. troy, the value of which, at £4 per ounce, amounts to £6,812,560. In the corresponding period of last year the quantity shipped amounted to 1,805,229 ounces, or 75 tons 4 cwt. 1 qr. 10 lbs. 9 ozs. troy, valued at «7.220,916. The monetary movements of the month that has elapsed since the departure of the last mail have been scarcely felt. The Banks have been making advances to the Government under the arrangement entered into for the disposal of railway 6 per cent, debentures in the London market. Hitherto the advances have been comparatively small; but, as the works proceed, large sums will be required, and the public are naturally anxious to hear of the first sales on the London Stock Exchange of the securities upon which the advance is made. During the month there has been some appearance of pressure in commercial circles, which has arisen from the extreme dulness of trade. Transactions have been so small, that purchasers on terms have found it difficult to realise in the time originally calculated, and hence a, pressure on their customers has been forced, which has spread very generally over all branches of trade. Money is still plentiful for ad vance B on mortgage of landed and hence property at from 10 to 12 per cent. The rates of discount at the banks are For bills under 95 days' currency, of percent.; from 95 to 125 days 9 per cent. ; over 125 days', 10 per cent. and on overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent. There is very little done in commercial paper outside the banks. Exchange on England remains at former quotations. The selling rates of the banks are 1 per cent, premium for 60 days' sight for large amounts, and li per cent, premium for 30 days' sight for bills under £50. Freight on gold by sailing vessels is taken al from 2Jd.to 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London; insurance, le per cent. by the overland route J per cent. that is, 7d. per ounce as nearly as pos- sible insurance, 14 to 15 per cent. In the stock and share market there has not been much done during the (month. Sales have been effected of Victoria Bank Shares, at £37; Colonial Bank of Australasia, at £6 2s. ; Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company, at £71 for old, and at £70 for new shares ; Melbourne Gas and Coke Company, first and second leane, at 333 per cent, premium, and new issue at 44 per cent, premium; Colonial Insurance Company, at £1 Ids.; Australasian Insurance Company, £112?. 6d. ; Melbourne Fire Insurance Com-' pany, 12s. 6d. The two new joint-stock core- monies recently launched have not succeeded in securing a favorable introduction of their scrip into the market. Differences have arisen in the board room of the National Bank of Australasia which will produce a considerable effectuate value of the shareholders' property. if not speedily adjusted. The Directors of the Bendigo Waterworks Company, upon the success of which project so much hope has been exported, have not yet performed the first duty which was looked for at their hands-the settlement of the claims of the projector. This difficulty was foreseen by Mr. J. G. Francis, at the first public meeting called in Melbourne on the subject. It will, however, be speedily settled, as a special meeting of the shareholders is about to be called with that vi The Melbourne series- of sales of Crown lands for the current month commenced on the fit h inst., and concluded on the 9th. Altogether, 8,516 acres 3 roods 20 perches of land were alienated from the Crown, the gross proceeds of which amounted to £10,055. The following are particulars of the lots disposed of on the first day Nine town lots at Sandridge, comprising in all 1 acre 1 rood 8 perches, sold for £1,921, or at the rate of £73 18s. 4d. per acre.

Five town lots at Footscray, covering an area of 1 acre, produced £209 10s., or £216 12s. per acre Two town lots at Keilor, measuring together half an acre, sold for £100, or £212 per ton and 30 town lots at Cranbourne, consisting ( 160 acres, realised £254, or at the rate of £1 7s. 10d. per acre. On the second day 10 other town lots, of half an acre each, at Cran bourne, were disposed of for £115, being equivalent to [£23 per [acre. Twenty half acre ' allotments at Dandenong, about miles from Melbourne, sold for 2225, or at the rate of £22 12s. per acre.

The export market has not yet recovered the effects of the advices received by the English June mail, announcing the decline in wool, and also in hides. The shippers of last season's crop have been heavy losers. In wool there has been nothing doing, but the new clip is expected to be early in the market. In tallow and hides there is nothing farther to report than that, awaiting the arrival of the mail, buyers and sellers are alike out of the market. A few small sales of tallow, for home use, have been effected at from £88 to £40 per ton for beef, and £50 to £62 per ton for mutton. The returns of the declared values of goods entered inwards and outwards at the port of Melbourne are still most favorable, when compared with those of last year. The value of the exports is in excess of that of the imports of the current year by £151,814; while, during the former period, the balance of imports over exports wits £788,626.

The deputation explained their object by a reference to the article of brandy. At present, all kinds of spirits in Ported as brandy are classed as brandy in the Customs books, and the quantity in bond is frequently made to appear enormous, while the stockS of genuine brands are low. The trade would prefer that in the official lists the port of shipment should be given, in order that the characters of the branches might be indicated. By this arrangement separate columns would be given for direct, for British, for Hamburg, and for New York shipments, and all other spirits might be divided in a similar manner. The movement well deserves the attention of the authorities ; but, at the same time, it is admitted that it would be extremely difficult to carry out any general system in the manner spoken of. There has been a larger than ordinary number of schedules filed in the Insolvent Court- es ; but the majority of these have been of small estates, with liabilities under £300. The place of abode of 16 of the insolvents! was Melbourne, and of 7 Geelong, the remainder being spread over the country. The trades and callings are thus divided One auctioneer, one architect, six butchers, one barber, three builders, two brewers, one brickmaker, ona birdstuffer, three contractors, three commis- sion-agents, one coach proprietor, one carpenter, one carrying agent, two clerks, one chemist, one drayman, three farmers, two general dealers, two grocers, one hatter, two ironmongers, one land agent, one land surveyor, one law clerk, three miners, one millwright, four publicans, one photographic artist, seven storekeepers, one stonemason, one saddler, one shipchandler, one solicitor, and one wine and spirit merchant. Thirteen assignments were registered, and 16 certificates granted, three of the latter conditionally. In the import market very little has transpired since our last Summary to call for re- mark. The merchandise to hand has not been heavy, but the advices received by the last Mail gave evidence that large shipments were on the way. This has had the effect of adding to the difficulty of effecting sales, and consequent dullness of the market. In Melbourne and Geelong especially, and in all other centres of commerce, the numbers employed in merely catering for the wants of the consumers are far too numerous, and, as goods are in abundance, and sales have to be pushed, prices are with difficulty sustained to a remunerative point. First houses quit their invoices at a low figure, but this scarcely benefits the consumer. The number of hands through which many kinds of goods have to pass entails a considerable expense, and the addition of several per- centages, before they pass into actual consumption; and hence the importer suffers, while the bulk of the public derive; but little present advantage from the undoubted plenty which prevails. There has been very little speculation afloat, and fo this credit is due chiefly to the banks: Some blame was, as it always will be under like circumstances, cost on them ; but in a make so peculiarly circumstanced as this, the spirit of speculation is not to be lightly encouraged. It is easily aroused, and, she aroused, impossible to be kept within bounds. The history of the series of crises which have been undergone has not been lost on those who have charge of our financial operations. Perhaps a present there is a disposition to over-cautious but this is preferable to the wild gambling t 1865\. Very little effect has yet been felt from the employment of large bodies on the rail ways, but as the works proceed some stimulate trade is certain to accompany them. .

The Argus Office, Tuesday Evening. The import market during the past month has heart without animation. No speculative feeling has been exhibited to any extent, purchases having been solely for Immediate use, and consequently of very; limited; amount: The continued irregularity in the arrival of the mail steamers causes great discontent, as in the absence of advices holders are unwilling to accept; lower rates for goods, and purchasers, being left is a state of uncertainty as to oomingauppllos, exercise the greatest caution in buying, in the belief that excessive shipments are still making in the home markets Prices have, however, by the firmness of holders, been generally well sustained, and in the value of leading articles of import from Europe there has been but little variation. Stocks in second hands are low, mi up-country dealers are admitted to be lightly saps piled with most descriptions of goods. The markets are, however, heavily stocked, and no advance on pro- soft rates is at all probable ; while, should the local parted advices indicate extensive shipments, a decline in prices must be reckoned on. Liquors. The demand for bulk beer has continued steady, more particularly for the most esteemed brands, which have found ready purchasers at his proved rates. Bass's Burton ale, which has so long: been the loading beer In this market, has latterly barely sustained Its hitherto character, and causes more attention to other brands, Allsopp's ale now selling at equal price say 83. 17s. 6d; per hogshead. Considerable Bales of other sales are, however, re- ported Worthington and Robinson's No. 3 ale 6!. 10s. ; Ind, Coope, and Co.'s at 81 to 3!. 8s. ; Se store sales at 17s. to li. 10s., and Sheffield ale at Of. 15s. per head Draught porter has been In better demand : the stocks of sound sorts having gradually worked down, has left the market somewhat bare, and sales to arrive have been freely effected ; most approval brands bringing from 11.108. to 6!. per hdd. Bot'loi ht ers have also been in fair demand. The bottled ales lately imported have been generally inferior, both: in quality and condition. Byass's, the brand of which alone used to give it preference over other shippers' Wales, has lost its position, and now commands net higher prices than other sorts. Sales of Byass's Ire equal proportions of ale and porter are making and O'. 6d. to 10s. ; Robinson and Co's pale ale at 93, 943 to IDs and No. 8 at 10s. to 10s. 6d. Sales of Allsopp's ale. bottled by Friend and Co., are reported at Uses and extensive sales of Tooth's (ale and porter) has been made at from 7s. to 7s. 6s. per doz. And see what have hitherto been considered second-rate brands there is a better inquiry,! at proportionate rates We quote ale and beer (duty paid): Ale: Bass's, had., 81 15s. to 81. 17s. 6d. ; Ind, Coope, aaC Co.

In wood Port from £60 to £85 per pipe ; sherries, 810 to £100 per butt, according to quality, ranging from ordinary to fine sorts. The demand for spirit! has been very light, and prices are, from the vaults ness of transactions, rather nominal than actual. Irr bulk spirits there has been very little doing, and quotations are wholly unaltered. U. V. Co's brandy, in cases, is somewhat scarce, and, being in few hands is bringing 40s. per dozen, in bond by auction,' Honncnay's has', been sold at 30s. 6d. ; Olouieaa'i, Miss' 0, at 30s. 6d. ; Olavloz's, at 25s. per dozen and a part coil of Gommandon's dark, in bulk, at from 9s. 51. for 10s. per gallon. For rum and old tom there has been: very little Inquiry. Of the latter article sales have been effected by auction of Swaine and Co.'s and Nicholson's, tinged, at 2s 8d. per gallon. An improved demand has sprung up for geneva within the last few days, and, although stocks are large, there has been considerable inquiry for best brands, not, however' at any improved value.

Quotations are comes " quently difficult to make the result of sales, however, generally unsatisfactory, entailing considerable loss to the owners. Flour The market for this article has at length apparently settled down, and during the last fore night a steady business has been carried on, chiefly for consumption, although a few small parcels have been purchased for the Sydney market, reports as likely to require moderate supplies previously to next harvest. There has been no speculative da maud, and prices have consequently been steady; Adelaide Town brands bring from 182 10s. to 10s, 10d."' and Tasmanian 182., per ton.

The demand during the pas week has been exceedingly light. The amount of unemployed labor of every description is excessive and very many of that class inured to hard manual labor at present without means would gladly avail themselves of any employment at lower rates of wages than those given in our list. Many of this class of ore ployed are unable to earn more than sufficient to turn support, while others accustomed to the work can earn fair-paying wages. For farm servants there is no inquiry in Melbourne, although in the agricultural districts a fair demand for this description of labor is reported. Domestic servants are in less inquiry and tradesmen, mechanics, and skilled laborers are still far in advance of require month. Rates of wages are very unsettled ; in many instances almost any rate being accepted for the sake of employment.

BALLARAT, September am-The rumors of the dirt million experienced in settling transactions by several houses, and the stoppage of some have had a some what depressing effect upon business generally. A usual under such circumstances, prejudicial state monts, afflicting the credit of firms in no way compare raised, have been current, adding considerably to the feeling of gloom and distrust experienced. The force sales In one or two of the estates for as you assign mont and composition have been accepted in preference to the loss and delay of the Insolvent Court have partially checked operations in the class of goods dealt with by the firms in question. The origin of the present state of affairs not difficult to account for want of adequate capital, in the first instance the absence of due caution in the extension < credits ; living *' up " to the means, and general falling off in the productive interests of the district : these combined, have had the effect of summarily exposing weakness, and ma prove eventually the incentives to a sound, system of trading. The flour market is firm, at shows signs of advancement. One of our local mill is on the eve of ceasing work, and the other Is n likely to have very large stocks on hand, as a stoat trade has been done by Its proprietors during the season. Fine flour is selling at 25!. 10s. to 20s. 10: according to quality. Wheat is nominal, at 6. p bushel. Bran is in demand, and the press has a ranged to 2s. 9d. to 8s. per bushel. Colonial or are steady, at 7s. 6d. to 8s. Cracked maize, 46 Potatoes, 9!. to 16!. per ton. Good seed potatoes a inquired for. To command a sale, however, they may be of the best quality, and each sample of one claim variety. In sugars there is a general depression value: the tons of the market is feverish and healthy, on the one hand we learn that the number Australian demands keeps up the price of an ave stocked market, and on the other, that cargoes a thing at a loss, and that prices at the port of ah! ment must eventually fall considerably. There is a doubt that sugar has been sold here at an exorbitant profit to the importers, and the consequent tem tation to embark in speculations very great. The future caution on the part of purchasers is requisite, as prize for some time to come must have a downwa tendency. Butter continues scarce. Imported for quality commands 2s. 6d. per lb. Wholesale, and by fresh butter is readily obtainable by retail at 8s. 0 i per lb. Baited provisions are castor. Bacon and hu are full 1d. per lb. lower than last week ; as al calicoes.
