VICTORIA'S IMMIGRATION EFFORTS. Loudon, August 31. The Victorians in Loudon eave a ban- quet in honour of Messrs. McKenzie and Mead (immigration delegates) in the Gaiety Restaurant, in Gray's Inn-road, last week. Viscount Goschen, who presided, said Great Britain welcomed tue delegation, and did not grudge immigrants since the latter would foBter the Imperial spirit among all classes in Australia. Sir John Cockburn, in proposing the health of the guests, declared that the latter were engaged ou au Imperial mis- sion-the solving of the problem of the adjustment of'the Empire s population. Mr. McKenzie, in responding, said the Press, the people, and tho official authori- ties, of Great Britain-had welcomed his companion and himself most generously and had not suggested that Victoria was robbing Great Britain of the flower of her manhood. The fact that Great Bri- tain imported 60 per cent, of her food- stuffs, of which Australia sent her 3 per cent., alone justified the delegation. Mr. Mead stated that Victoria would be satisfied if aB a result of thc mission ?a number of thrifty and energetic agri- culturists of high character were secured, i He emphasised the importance of foster I ing the idea of small holdings, and in- stanced the large yields from crops of. lucerne grown in Australia to-day. Aus- tralian dairymen of the next generatioa would soon make Victorian butter as well known as Danish was, by enabling Aus- tralia to supply Great Britain throughout the rear. . .Sir John Taverner (Agent-General for j Victoria). insisted upon the absence of rivalry between thc Australian States and the overseas dominions in immigra- tion matten.
