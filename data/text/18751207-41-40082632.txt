The Swallow was expected to discharge her Baltic timber here, but orders have been given for her to proceed to Melbourne. She will sail with the first fair wind, but at present there is a poor prospect of any change from the boisterous iouth- wester. The Eliza, steam-lighter, has had her boilers put on board, and artificers are now fitting up her engines and winch-gear. As soon as possible the will take a spin down, the river, and she is expected to steam seven knots an hour. The Glebelg has had a rest in Franklin Harbour, for upon entering she took the ground ?n a bank, and remained until a good tide last Friday enabled her to get off and proceed to Wallaroo, where the got a load for Adelaide. TheNOBTH has stOi about 150 immigrants on board, but as soon as they are landed she will ba hauled into a berth to discharge at the large crane. She has eight locomotives for the Rail way Department, and as soon as possible they will be taken out. Police Exfkseks.— Recently there has bean a controversy among Portoniana as to how far masters of vessels may command the so/vices of the police. It is asserted by some people that when shi^s arrive with refractory seamen it is the duty of the authorities to bear the cost of the police landing the culprits. Others, how ever, affirm that the expense should fall on the vessels, and that is the rule at present Mr. J. Young, in a letter sent from London to the Sydney Morning Herald, gives particulars respecting two steamships which Messrs. J. Elder & Co., of Glasgow, are building for the new mail service between Sydney, Auckland, aod San Fraadsco. He states that the dimen sions of the larger of the two vessels are— Length between perpendiculars, 376 ft.; breadth, ex treme, 37 ft. 3 in.; depth, moulded to spar deck, 28 ft; height from top of main deck beams to ?par da, 7 ft. 9 in. It will be supplied with compound engines, having three cylinders— diameter of high pressure cylinder, 45 in.; diameter of low pressure cylinders. 62 in. each ; and length tf stroke, 4 ft 3 in. The main deck is fitted entirely for first, second, and third class paseengers— 160 first, 36 second, and 100 third class, with a saloon of the following dimen sions: — 42 ft leng and 37 ft 3 in. wide, the whole width of the ship. The two vessels were built together on the stocks before the new mail contract was entered into. One has been lengthened 22 ft, and double-plated at the junctions to strengthen that portion ; and they are also built with water-tight compartments. It b not jet decided if the other vessel should be lengthened. The first steamer completed wul be named either the City of Sydney or the City of New York. It is thought that she will run 14 miles per hour average, deing the dis tance from Sydney to Ban Francisco in 24 or 25 days. She will carry 1,900 ton, of coal in her bunkers, enough for the voyage there and back ; also able to take 800 tons of cargo on her voyage from Sydney to San Francisco, and 1,600 tens on the return voyage, so that the passage from Sydney to England will be done in 40 days, 25 days from Sydney to San Francisco, seven days for the overland journey, and eight days from New York to Liverpool.
