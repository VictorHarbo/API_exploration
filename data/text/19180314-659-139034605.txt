NEVER MET HIS BROTHER.

The de- ceased left his home in the city of Norwich in the year 1854— being then 15 years of ago — to go to New Zea land, and his brother Alfred alluded to was then only 17 months old. Joseph never returned to see his relatives, and his brother Alfred, who correspon ded regularly, never saw him or knew him. A MONTH TO FIND HUSBANDS. Much amusement has been caused at the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, by tho urgent petition of two pretty ? blue-eyed Danish girls, tAlfihl Anderson and Ingeborg Jansen, of Copenhagen, for permission to de part immediately for Wiona (Minne sota). They are the cheerful victims of an eccentric will mado bv their crand father, who bequeathed them each a ! half-slin.ro of 600 acres of fino farm- ; lands, on condition that they marry within 30 days of their arrival in New York. By the terms of the will, which the two cousins explained to an inter preter, title to tlio lands will not be finally vested with either of them until they become mothers. If at the end of five years one of cousins has a child and the other has not, tho motherless 0110 will loso haif lier land to tho other. If neither has children at tho end of five years the entire property is to revert to a malo cousin in Denmark. Both girls departed for Minnesota, confidently declaring in broken English that they would find good husbands within tho stipulated term. — 'Daily Mail.'
