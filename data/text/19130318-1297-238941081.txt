"Fred Niblo never lost hold of the human quality of the character, and he was always .there with the comedy. "Here is a play that has risen above the trifles of stagedom." Mr. Niblo established himself as one of America's best- light comedians." "Josephine Cohan Is fn the company, mid lcnds_ a lnt of naturalness. Her pathos touches the play with beauty." , 1 -"A play of sentiment, not sentimentality." "The humor of Nat Duncan, as played by Fred. Niblo, Is characteristically American— the sort ubich says, 'cheer up. the worst la yet to come. "You will find the audience, with its constant burets of laughter and its extraordinary sympathetic attention, almost as amusing as tho play." By Wincbel Smith, dramatist of "Brewster's Millions."
