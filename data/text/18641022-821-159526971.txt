The Lad r Dari.lng. -—The Murray steamei Lady Darling having been completed made a tria trip downthe nver on Friday, the 14th. Anum ber of persons availed themselves of the occasioi to take an excursion, and amongst the numbe were several competent to "form an opinion of he """ o 41; i ««« icu wit; wuan soum after clock and proceeded round the Idghtshi and back in two hours and 14 minutes. Thehealt: « r-i.— — ...vxxoiusttuu Avuiuiuua. j.uejicau; of the owners, and success to the vessel also c Mr. Bates, who superintended the building, and c tlie engineer, were severally drunk and responded to during the passage down the river. i We understand that the Pesola leaves Mel- I bourne on the 20th for Adelaide, via JlacDoimell j and Guichen Bays. Her cabin accommodation has been much improved, and the vessel painted throughout. The steamer South Australian "arrived from Melbourne on Monday morning at 2 o'clock, after a very stormy passage, during 20 hours of which Captain l'ain was necessitated to proceed under easy steam on account of the heavy sea. There was some slight detention before final departure from Melbourne from low tides; hut she started at 9.45 on Friday from Williamstown, and at midnight passed Shortland Bluff, and at 0 a.m. was oil' the Otway, with a strong VV.N.W. gale blowing, which continued with violence till Bivoli Bay was passed at 0 a.m. the following morning. The following, having reference to the Cur of Adelaide, which sailed from Gravesend for South Australia, is from a private letter, dated August 2(5:— "The City of Adelaide had very rough weather. She struck off Dungeness, but lias arrived at Plymouth in safety." The Adamant is free from her immigrants, aud the surgeon-superintendent sailed on Tuesday for Calcutta in the A. H. Badger. The Fairfield, one of Simpson's Black Diamond Line, is undergoing extensive alterations, being converted from a full poop to a flush-deck ship. Captain Hall, the master, has seen some singular service since he was here hi the Water Nymph— having served in India during the rebellion, after wards under Garibaldi in Italy, and subsequently in the Federal navy, which he left prior to pro ceeding to Melbourne in his present vessel. The Havilah reports fresh W.S.W. gales from Cape Otway to Cape Northumberland, afterwards fine S.W. and southerly wind, with heavy sea. The steamer Gooliva left the wharf on Wed- : nesday for Port Lincoln and Port Augusta; but after proceeding a short distance down the river put hack in consequence of a leakage in her boiler. The defect was repaired, aud she sailed again on Thursday. The Danish ship Virginie, Captain F. Prehn, sailed from Puget Sound with a cargo of timber for this port on the ISth July last. The Eleanor was hauled alongside the Maclaren Wharf on Thursday afternoon, and shipped her funnel by means of the Company's powerful craue. She will make a trial trip to-day (Saturday). Tim Pi'flTVt rc « roccnl tn trtl'A The Begina is a vessel chartered to take horses to India, and for this purpose she arrived on Friday morning, and immediately sailed into the Port. The Wool Ships are proceeding with stowage in a very satisfactory manner, as a glance at those at present in the Port waters will exemplify:— The Kowena is lying at the Lightship anchorage fully laden with a dead weight of copper and ore, together with 1.4S8 bales from Port Wakefield, to which place a gang of Stone's stevedores accom panied the vessel, and performed their work in a satisfactory manner. The Gooliva is the new Orient liner, which has turned out at Prince's Wharf a full cargo of general merchandise in capital order, and being now light, she affords an opportunity of inspecting a very handsome specimen of marine architecture, especially as the efforts of the chief officer have been so well-directed as to present her in most excellent order from water-line to truck, though she will improve in appearance when the main aud mizen topgallantmasts are sent aloft. In construction she is on the principle of iron frame and wood planking, and in every part it is evident '< she merits the high class bestowed on lier in Lloyd's books. The lower masts and yards are of iron, and throughout she is a most suitable ship for the wool trade. She has at present laden Bi) tons silver-lead ore, 40 tons copper in ingots, and 30 tons tallow. The Damio is a fine spacious craft, chartered from Port Wakefield, where it is expected she will stow 3,300 bales; and every exertion is beiug made to clear out the original cargo, in order that she may lie able to start as early as possible for the loading port. The dead weight already on board consists of 270 tons copper and ore. The Clanalpine is to proceed to Victor Harbour, where great rejoicings are anticipated on the open ing of direct communication with London. The Shepherdess is a very fine brig, which lias just completed her first voyage from Europe, and lias beeu taken up to load wool at Streaky Bay. The Coonatto is in admirable order, and reflects credit on Mr. Waghorn, who has been incessant in his efforts to improve a smart vessel, which she undoubtedly is, aud painting being over, stowing wool is the occupation of the day. In addition to the copper and ore, she has nearly 1,150 bales below the 'tween-decks, and is expected to take 2,000, if Stone's gang of stowers perform the screwing operations to perfection. The Sea Star has 1,160 bales on board.
