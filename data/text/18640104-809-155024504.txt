Total, 23,218 oz 12 dwt. As may be well supposed, business during the nast week has been much liml-on in i,„ ti.„ holidays and, the numerous attractions consequent on a festive season. Operations privately have not been of a very extensive nature, while tlio auction sales have been trifling and insignificant, but apparently sufficient to satisfy the present demand for goods. A contract has been passed for the Rosslyn's cargo of Californian oats. Tho rice portion of the Me lanie's cargo, from Calcutta, has also changed hands. In ration sugars and yellow crystals there have been considerable sales, but theso comprise the 'bulk of the moro importuut operations, everything else having, in a measure, been completely negiecteu. ino Untisu and Foreign arrivals. con-, sist of four vessels from England, onei from France, ono from Mauritius, fivo from Eastern ports, ono from America, and ono from California. Ale and Stout. — The traffic in bnlk ale has been so small as to call for no special remark, the demand during the week having been con fined to supplying wants not provided for before tlio setting in of the holidays. Prices con-, tintie without any alteration. Bass's Nd. 3 is' maintained at £G 5s ; to effect a largo sale less would be taken, hut no inducement in this direction lias been presented. Several lots of No. 4 have been piuceu at 3ji. Allsopp s rules at iia 10s. Marrmn's lias been reduced : sales having been mado at £7 to £7 10s — the rates now asked for 50 hhd parcels to Bmallor quantities. Tho stock held of the Carlisle Co.'s is not such as to create any uneasiness, prices consequently are without variation on £7 10s to £7 12s Gd, at which an average trado has been dono. Joule's realises £7 10s to £7 15s, none being offered uudcr. The Colonial Company's is nominal at £G, though to secure business anything at all reasonablo under this figure would not be refused ; tho light continues saleable at £6 17s 6d. About 100 hhd Burton ale, iu faulty condition, sold for £3. There is little inquiry for stout, notwithstanding tho late concession in prico. Wliitbread's can bo bought at £0 to a shade under. Taylor, Walker and Co.'s 13 moro pressed on the market, and nothing over £G to £G Gs can bo obtained for parcels. Allsopp's, though quoted at £5 10s, is to bo had at considerably less money. Tho consumption of bottled ale, though much retarded by the unseasonable weather, is still such as, combined with inconsidera ble supplies, ;to be capable of supporting tho rates quoted for some time past. Muir's and Prestonpans readily bring 10s Gd. Aitkeu's has been sold at 10s 3d. Jeffrey's realises 10s. Bass's and Allsopp's, 9s 9d to 9s lOJd.

Jujubes sell at Is- Can died peel brings 13Ad to lid. Coiidage. — Salss of inanillav assorted to 4 inch, have been, effected at £48 10s, and £49 has since ! been refused, hoMors requiring longer prices. A large parcel on th«;way is now due and expected in ovory day, a considerable, portion has, however, been sold to arrive,, and 'the market is not likely to be unduly influenced- in consequence. On other sorts we havo no change to note ; common tarred Europe ranging from £40- to- £55 feu best descriptions. Seaming twine is stoady at 14£&to; 14 Jd.

Colonial oats continuo to bo froely pressed -on the market, and a decline has been submitted to ; best samples range at from 5s to 5s Gd ; but inferior de scriptions can bo huil at much less. The liosslj-n's cargo of Californian, consisting of 19,000 bushels, has been sold in the Bay for Dunedin, tho same vessel having been rc-shartered for thoir transmis sion ; tho prico paid has been withhold, but we understand a full figure has been obtained.

'62's continuo to rule at from Is 2d to Is Gd ; hilt, as the former 'commenco to arrivo moro freoly, those must natu rally become less looked aftor and more difficult to quit. ? _ Malt. — Littlo business has transpired iu this article.

Arrivals of Chinese have placed tlio market in a better position ; several parcels havo been sold to haud at 5s Gd. Of Colza supplies aro very baro.

Rice. — The cargo of the Melaiiio, consisting of 4700 bags, changed hands in the early part of the week at a figuro quite supporting holders' ideas of the market ; the selling rates afterwards were fixed at £25 to £27 for large to small parcels, and we .understand that since several hundred tons havo been re-sold at the former figure. ' Sugar.— On Tuesday, the damaged portion of tho carno of the Exnre.ss. from Mauritius. \rns nfffirnd and extreme prices were realised for all but brown sorts, condition considered, good yellow crystals reaching £14 5s. per ton; good counters, £37 10s- — these rates nioro than establishing tho recent advance.

Tasmania.. — -We take tho following from tho Ho bart lown Mbvcury of 1st Januaiiy :. — ' '? Trado to-day was not at all improved, busi ness doing being still very limited. No sales of wheat were reported, but buy ess, still quoto at 5s (id to 5s 9d. For flour, the only dmnaud was for town use, at £12 10s to £13. In. potatoes, butter and hay, there were transactions ; for pressed hay, how ever, thero is just now a slight demand, with litl/le offering. Wool continues to.aome forward in consi derable parcels, and is saleable at Is 2d to Is 5i. ftie Launceston Examiner of tho 31st nit., says : — Thero is no alteration to notice iu tho florae and gruin market. A general dendness pervades busi ness here, as seems to be tho caso in tho neighbor ing colonies. But littlo freight is offering, and neither tho Annio Beaton nor tho Mayflawer, both of which vessels have just arrived from Invorcargill, havo yet found a port for which to load. We repeat last quotations — Flour, £11 to £11 10s. Wheat 5s. Wo observe that at Adelaide this grain lias a ten dency to decline ; and it does not appear likely, in tho face of the approaching harvest, and probable importations into Hobart Town from our neighbors, that any material advanco in pricos can tako place here. Bran remains at Is 4d, and other quotations arc unaltered.
