The prices realised were Fine mutton, 379 per cwt. (an advance of 3d per cwt); medium mutton, 32/6 per cwt. fine beef, 34/6 per cwt. (an advance of 6d. per cwt.) and medium beef, 24s per cwt.

There has been a very quiet demand in the market, and although values showed no material change at the auctions, at the close there is a weaker tendency and quotations mark a decline of about 6d. per cwt. For arrival there has been a fair enquiry at steady prices. The shipments from Australasia during February were advised as 2,6/6 tons as compared with 5,100 tons for the same month last year. Imports for the past three weeks amounted to 2,812 casks from Australia, and 2,533 casks from New Zealand. Stock, all sorts, in warehouse, London, on February 28, 8,092, as against 6,078 casks the previous month, 19,090 casks in 1901, and 11,070 casks in 1868. We quote: Australian and New Zealand mutton, good to fine, 34s to 37/6 per cwt. fair to good, 29/6 to 327; common, 28/3 to 297; low and mixed, 27/ to 27/6; beef, good to fine edible morn., 31/6 to 32/6; fair to good, 29/ to 317; common, 27/ to 29." The condition of the London butter market at the end of March was one of weakness, and Messrs. W. Weddel & Co., in their produce report dated on the 27th of that month, write: "There has been a slowness in demand due to the near approach of the holidays which, coinciding with the end of the month, has added to the causes retarding business. After Easter more trade is expected. There is a further fall to be recorded in New Zealand butter, of which "choicest" is now standing at 104 to 106 per cwt., the bulk of the sales being at 106; "finest" makes, 100 to 102. A further illustration of the peculiar position of the colonial butter market is shown by this continued fall in values while Danish is rising weekly. Three weeks ago Danish and New Zealand were alike in price. In London to-day Danish is 114 and New Zealand 1067. The one kind is falling, the other rising week by week. The Papanui arrived to-day from New Zealand with about 30,000 boxes of butter on board, but will not commence discharging before next Tuesday morning. Although the Danish market has been improving for the last three weeks, the official quotation remains unchanged. Last week a large amount of Siberian butter arrived, but it is stated that this is an accumulation caused by an accidental difficulty of tran ' sit, and not the actual opening of the new season, which will not be for some weeks. The Department of Agriculture has issued a preliminary statement of the estimated crops' of the United Kingdom for 1901, and from this it appears that the shortage of hay from permanent pastures was about as 1.724,000 tons in Great Britain, and 415,000 tone in Ireland, making a total of 2,139,000 ' tons." I Why German shipping is occupying so conspicuous a position in the North Atlantic trade is easily explainable (write.' the Melbourne "Argus" of May 7 by the vast emigration that is now going on the United States being very prosperous and large enough to absorb newcomers to an indefinite extent, while Germany is dull and affords little elbow-room for its in creasing population. The extent of the immigration into the United States may be guessed from the fact that on one day only March 18, 6,876 steerage passengers immigrants landed at New York from five steamers, as follows: Ex Bhcim, from Bremen 2,200 Ex Phoenicia, from Hamburg. 2,200 Ex Milano, from Hamburg. 506 Ex Maasdam, from Antwerp. 710 Ex La Gascoigne, from Havre. 1.076 The Americans very sensibly regard addition to their people as a gain in wealth The Australian politicians evidently holt to the contrary belief. America is taking rapid strides; Australia is unprogressive. The wheat market continues quiet, and no important business is doing. We still I? quote farmers' lots on trucks at Port Adelaide 3/9 to 3/10 per bushel, and shipping parcels, also on trucks at Port Adelaide, 4/ per bushel. Flour remains unchanged at S's 5/ to C9 10/ per ton, with moderate trade doing.. Offal remains scarce, and there is a brisk demand at 1/3 per bushel for bran and 1/3½ per bushel for pollard. The Duluth correspondent of the "North Western Miller," writing on March 31 with respect to wheat, says: "Very little wheat was sold last week, either of Duluth or 1 Manitoba grain, and the market was dull with a declining tendency. Cash and May wheat have come together, and are now . but" -Je. apart. The Duluth and Minne- apple markets are also quite close on account of the lack of shipping demand here. It is seldom that this market has entered the season with so little wheat sold ahead as there is now. May wheat has declined since a week ago to 70., with an advance to 2&c.; last Tuesday. Manitoba wheat has widened the difference again, and now stands at the. under Duluth. Some of this wheat went forward all-rail during the week, but most of that sold is being held for ,- water shipment, and it will be loaded out heavily during the mouth. Mills have done little, and have taken in small amounts of grain, but are running and will be heavier consumers. They took 45,000 bushels last week. Receipts are not large, amounting to 393.305 bushels for the week, of which k 100,000 were Canadian. This compares with 755,909 last week and with 581.0S3 last year. Shipments for the week have been 51.739 bushels, of which 50,000 were Canadian. This compares with 55,582 bushels last week, and with 13.647 a year ago. There were in store in Head-of- the-Lakes eleva- tors at the close of business Saturday night 16,571,580 bushels wheat, of which 1,661,221 were Canadian. This compares with stocks of 16,258,805 last week and 0,053,187 last year. The import markets remain steady. and While there is not a large amount of heavy business to report, fair trade continues to be done, and the turnover shows but little decline on the daily average. Sugars are moving, and the demand for both manufacturing and grocery sorts is satisfactory. Teas have good demand, and to-day's business covers sales in nearly all grades; the individual transactions, however, are only moderate. Dried fruits remain flat and there is not a large trade doing at the present time. Preserved fish is quiet, and sales are-in all cases small. Agents for Canterbury sheep tongues report, business . covering 100 cases. Kerosine is" in good request, and we note sales in both American and Russian oils for distributing purposes. All heavy goods remain dull, and nothing of special interest has transpired. Mr. C. Czarnikow, in his "Weekly Price Current," dated London, April 3, writing with respect to the sugar market, says: "The purchase of two or three best cargoes for New Orleans, and one smaller lot for New York, created a stronger demand last week, and a fresh rise of 3d. per cwt., but when further orders did not follow, values receded nearly 2d., the market closing 4d. to 6d. below last Wednesday. Regarding the extent of beet sowings, there is still great uncertainty; it seems that factories are adopting a more uniform action than in previous years; they have come into closer contact through their cartels and similar organisations?, they are better able to talk over and concert general lines of policy, and to avert a crisis by lowering the prices of roots, which may bring about the much desired reduction in sowings. In Bohemia a certain area is allotted to each factory, thus avoiding competition, and with the low prices quoted it is supposed that there will be a substantial reduction there, but not in' Moravia nor Hungary. About Gee many and France nothing new can be said, and with the excess production of 1,100,000 tons this season, we must be satisfied if visible supplies are not further increased next year. Therefore it is still safer to rely on a low level of values in order to reduce production, than to trust co making profits, by a premature rise in values."
