INNES, F.R.A.S. -- Mr Robert T. A. Innes, F.R.A.S., a well known amateur astronomer is about to leave these shores to take up a position in connection with the Observatory at Capetown. Mr Innes has been an ardent devotee of the science for many years, and so far back as January 1879, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, he at the time being the youngest fellow of the institution. Last evening Mr. Innes was given a banquet at Mr Quong Tart's rooms, King-street. Amongst those present were Mr. G. H. Knibbs (vice presi- dent of the Sydney branch of the association), Dr. Megginson, Dr. F.H. Quaife Messrs H. Wright, C. J. Merfield, D. Manson, T. F. Furber, T. W. Craven, F. D. Edmonds, Captain Bedford, and a number of Iadies. Mr Knibbs in propos- ing the toast of "Our Guest," particularly re- ferred to the services Mr. Innes had rendered. He had corrected Leverrier's " Tables du Soleil," and the value of that effort could l only be comprehended when the calibre of Leverrier was taken into consideration. Pro- fessor Newcomb had stated his regret that it had not been his good fortune to see these cor- rections before he had completed his calculations of ancient eclipses, and Professor J. C. Adams had given similar testimony as to the value of Mr. Innnes' work. Mr. Innes' paper on the 'Secular Perturbation of the Earth Owing to the Action of Venus and Mars," and the computations annexed to it was work which could not be too highly praised. Mr Innes' response to the toast of his health was brief. He decried the en- comiums of the chairman, so far is he was con- cerned, and endeavoured to show that many members of the local branch of the association had done as much or more in the interests of astro-. nomical research as he had PARTIAL LUNAR ECLIPSE. -- Mr. H. C. Russell, the Government Astronomer, writes to us as fol- lows: -- "On the 29th of this month there will be a partial eclipse of the moon, in which 0.87 parts of the moon will be eclipsed. The first contact with the a shadow takes place at 4h 21m 1s, but the moon does not rise until 6.45p.m.; middle of eclipse takes place at 5h. 50m 5s,; last contact with shadow takes place at 7h. 19m 9s.
