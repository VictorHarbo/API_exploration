MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRICES CURRENT. The Argus Office, Monday Evening. Any report or tho condition of builness in tho Im- port market during tho past month must necessarily to unsatisfactory to shippen. By the last mall we had to announce a heavy, Inactive market, with prospect of declining prices, which havo boen unfortu* natoly realised, without creating any improved do amand. Speculation appears quite subdued, and tho Eales effected during the month havo, -with scarcely any exception, been for trado requirements only. Country dealers have continued to exerolso tho greatest caution In making their purchases, no dis- position whatever to hold stocks being exhibited, rot- withstanding tho low figures to which many hu- le rted articles of considerable consumption have d - (lined. The neighbouring markets, being all amp'y sepplled hy direct shipments, have ceased in gro.t mensuro tobo eur customers, andaré, indeed, on the a ntrary, likely to add their surplus stccks to our already overcrowded warehouses. Endeavours ha\o been latterly made to effect the disposal of goeds by tnctlon, and extensive quantities, moro particularly of stiitis, wines, teas, and augar, havo boon, mostly w ithoutsticces», submitted for solo-in several instantes without inducing even an offer; whilst butter, pro-1 siocs, candles, and oilmen's stores have been pushed iff under the hammer, at much reduced rates. The inclement weather at tho New Zealand goldfields and tho modorate results of mining enterprise the o are Inducing the return of many of our reinere, am), -with the influx of immigrant! from herne, increased consumption must onsuo ; but so long as oxcessivo shipments of goods continue to swamp our markets, no advanco In prices can reasonably be hoped for. Te-day no less than eight shiploads of good», from Europo and India, havo entered the hay, in addition to three largo vessels yesterday from England. With the so gcnonl observations, we proceed to remark in mere detail on the leading artlcloa of Importation, Ale and Porter.-Stocks of draught ales aro accumu- lating fast, and sales even in retail quantities are d.'fflcult to effect, prices remaining almost nominal. JtUs that vero readily disposed of last season on arrival cmñot now be placed even at low rates, and have to bo stored fora market. Draught stout slsj partakes of tho daine as. Bottled beers aro dull of sale, and In but little inquiry. Quotations range an follows .--Bass's new Ko. 8, £016a ; Allsopp'!, £016s. ; other Burton brewers', £6 10s. por hhd. ; Torment's, £ C 10s. per hhd. ; Byass's bottled, 9s.

Bacon and Bams.-A decided fall has taken placo In the ab- cr.co of export demands ; and tho decreased la <]uby for home comurnptlcn, together with the lu- cres ted Imports and the attempts to forco sales by auction, added to the coniidorable supplies of local emin?, have caused prices to glvo way, and prices cannot bo quoted above tho following rates :-Yoik tblio or Wiltshire hams. Is ; Irish (Sinclair's), Is. li). ; Coi j's, Is, to la. Id. ; Kownn's, bel ¡ob (bacon), UJd. to Hid. ; Sinclair's, Is. ; Waring's, lid. : and Moflatt's, lid. per lb. Bags and Sacks.-Tho Increased shipments of both sacks and woolpacks have weakened tbo markets, especially for woolpacks, which had previously a firmer tendency, and prices aro eaaler. Corn sacks aro dell of sale, 16s. per dozen being the highest xnaikct quotation. Butter,-A perfect panio seems to havo seined the rxaiket. In the early part of tho month, by auction, Ed. per lb. was obtained for a newly-landed parcel in cloth, ard prices havo sinco dwindled downtoGjd., without any prospect of speedy improvement, as largo supplies of frosh-made are coming into the market, and the new soason's Imports may Boen bo expected. In candios tbere is no improvement to note. Tho continued imports of foreign make, almost invariably mero or loss damaged, are forced off by auction, and corrplotcly prevent any Improvement in prices of sound parcels, which aro difficult of salo. Nova stenrines are offered at Is., and best English moko aro not worth above lljd. per lb. for full-weight«. Cement remains without alteration. Portland is dull of salo at 21s. For roman tbo demand is exceed- ingly limited. American plaster has been placed at 22s. perbarrol. Cheese ia in but moderato Inquiry. Increased sup plica have fully met the demand, and beBt qualities cannot be quoted at above 12d. per lb. Chl.'ory Is in less inquiry, and movcB off slowly, in small parcels, at 8Jd. nor lb.

Confectionery Is in moderate demand, at from lOJd. to lid. per lb. for assorted parcela ; but tho supplias cf local manufacturo materially interfere with the salo of imported sorts. Cordage Is In very moderato demand. Stocks aro not excessive, but the Inquiry Is of Insufficient amount to enhance prices. Twine continues in gocd demand, and is saloablo at 14d. per ib. Quotations aro ¡-Europe rope, £30 to £86 ; Manilla, assorted sizes, £47 ; Rus- sian, £88 to £40 ; Calcutta lines, £40 to £47 per ton ; «earning and roping twino, 14d. per lb.

Tho flour market has, during the last week, assumod a Dimer position, and although no extensivo pur. chases have been entored Into, small trade lots have been In good demand at improving prices. Holders ol Adelaide Hour declino selling any good silk-droned brands under £15 portón, and prices have a decided upward tendency. Wheat has partakon of tho im« Îirovcmcnt In value of flour, and U generally hold back or higher prices, 6s. (k1, to 6s. lOd. being about tho valuo ofgoodssmpleBof Viotoriangrowth, nndfls. to Ga. Cd. per bushel foi South Australian. Barley is dull, and in but very moderato domand. Oats of colonial groivtlin.ro somewhat scarce, and bting fuly quoted rates ; buk for forolgn sorts the demand is very light, and prioos unsettled. Considerable quantities of damaged haver bein forced off by auction sales, at low prices, and injured the sale and value of sound parcels ; whilst the advised shipments from forolgn ports provent any possible improvement in tho value of those descrip- tions. In the earlier part of the month, malt was in letter domand, and several newly-arrived pareólo were placed at from Ss. Od. to Os. por bushel, duty paid ; demand has, however, lessened, and thoso rates aro now scarcely attainable, tho prospo:t of heavy arrivals checking any tendency towards Improved prices.
