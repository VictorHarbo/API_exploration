QUEENSLAND. (FnoM ona own oobbespootesi.) BRISBANE, MAltcn 3. The " new brooms ' -the new Ministers aro very huey, and the receaa is for them a Beason of very hard work. Two of them, the Minister for Justice (Mr Thompson) and the Minister for Works and Mines (Mr MaccroBsan), have had to fight hard for re election. The former won his Beat by "the akin of his teeth , the latter has yet to win his, and will do bo, I think, but will bo hard run for it Both are estimable men, and, ob politicians go, aro honest, and the opposition to them boa very littlo foundation except in the fact that they havo earned the hostility of the Orango and other sectarian secret societies These societies aim at reducing our public men to the condition of mere tools, to carry out the behests of their lodges They aro numerous amongst the subordinate officials in our pubhc departments, notably in theRailway, Customs, and Postal departments, which were lately described m the press as " white ant-eaten with them To belong to them is in a great measure to secure immunity for shorlcom mgs or misconduct, not to belong to thom is to be exposed to much petty annoyance, and to be the object of constant espionage Of course all tina is very injurious to the service, but some of our public men are quite willing to make themselves subserv lent to the purposes of these societies for the sake of the help they can afford them at election times Ministers are either travelling about the country attending shows and inaugurations, and trying to make themselves generally agroeable, or are busy in their departments fossicking out the sins of their predecessors, or striving to cut down the aupornumorary staff to the smallest possible dimensions rive honra a week havo been added to tho working hourn of tho civil service, and there is much talk of reductions in Balanes, which will, I think, end in talk only A profound sensation has been caused amongst our bank managers by the Govern ment sending them circulars, intimating that tenders for the Government banking busi neaa would be received, and that the tender that would be approved of would come into operation on the 11th of March, the present contract with the Union Bank expiring on the 10th By the Union Bank directors it was in the first place objected that its con tract did not terminate till six months after that date, and that thej were entitled to six months notice from March 10 Hie actual words of the contract aro ' for a period of three )ears from 10th March 1870, and ahall thereafter be terminable by either party upon giving six months notice in writing to the other part) This the Government held to mean that the contract terminated absolutel) at the end of the three )ears at the will of either party, and without any notice the bank as stoutl) maintaining that six months notice was required Legal opinion was obtained in support of both views, and for a few da)s it looked as if a fat cauae was being manufic tured for the gentlemen of the long robe The other banka, with one exception, took Bidea with the Union, their principal gnev ance however being that time sulhcient to consider the terma on which they might tender was not given The exception was tlie local bank-the Queensland National The upshot is that the Union gets six months notice, and nil w ill get ample time to con aider on what terms the Government account is w orth hav ing All a vv eil that ends well Business generally continues very dull, and transactions, except at long credit, are almost uni novvn Insolvencies amongst small traders are very numerous, and meetings of creditors and compromises on easy terma are still more so but there is a growing opinion amongst business peoolo that we have almost, if not quite reached the turning point To make mattera worse just at pre- sent, by some unhappy mischance immi grants have been arriving in unuaual num- bers, and as they will not }et submit to less than what they were told wero current rates of wages in Queensland, many of them have left for New South Wales, and man) remain about our towns out of work and disgusted with the colon) This state of afiairs has had the effect of bringing Btrongl) into view the detecta of our unnu gration S)atem, and I expect that when Par liamcnt meets a general onslaught will be made on all connected with it In connexion with the German, Swedish, and Danish portion of tho s)stein especiaU), some very unpleasant facts will, it is said be disclosed, and I would not be surprised if the whole buainesa culminated m the lion Arthur Mac allister, our accent general, recen mg his congé Meantime orders have been sent to London to stop the German, and eaae off aa much as possible the British supply of immigrants If we acted wisel), we would for the next three )ears to come confine our operations to bunging out persons nominated in the colony by their friends, and to )oung men and women unmistakably of the labouring and domestic servant class Artisans w e hav e an ample suppl) of, and for the meanest clerkship there are scores of applicants ThiB subject reminds me very natu rall) of a protectionist movement recently commenced here It takes the shape of a ahilling aubscription league, and at per sent is confined chief!) to ironvv orkers, boot maleers, tailors, saddlers, cabinetmakers, and small tradesmen Ab ) et it is a sickly enough affair, and will hardly thrive in Queenslandi I think, where hitherto at least, free trade principles alone have found favour The Burplus stock difficulty, and what to do with it, absorbs columns of the daily paperB to such an extent that ev erybody that l8 not growing beef or mutton ia heartily Bick of the aubject The theories and suggestions advanced aro innumerable, and when, after reading the Courier I take my afternoon nap I dream of gigantic bullocks hemming me in on all sides and plaintively lowing " Will nobed) eat mo,' but when I awake it is to the contemplation of a butcher s bill m w Inch my share of a bullock of 7501b , purchased at sa) £5, figures at 4d per lb This seems to me a ver) w ide

coming International Exhibition m Sydney Mr Lukin, the commissioner appointed by the Queens land Government, is one of the moat active membera of our National Aaaocia tion, and has been the life and soul of our annual exhibitions at Bowen park The general verdict is that the appointment is the best that could be made, and this feeling ia encouraging exhibitora to come for- ward Our commiBBioner knows his work and haB bia heart in it, not entirely for lov e of it, but aa a meana to an end m which ho is an enthusiastic believer-that end is the federation of the Australasian colonies The recent!) elected ma)or of Brisbane is the first to receive a salary The vote to him of £100 a yetfr boa been matter of much con tcntion We intend if possible to have the honour of capturing the Kelly gang, and the Sydney steamer which left on last Saturday took Inspector O'Connor and some black troopers who have seen several years' service in Northern Queensland, protecting miners and squatters from the Myalla, and occas- sionally punishing the latter severely. He is a good officer, and discriminates between "niggers and "niggers," which not all native police officers do. He has had the hardihood to enter into conferences and treaties with the Myalls, and to tell them they should not be harmed by his "demons," whilo they spared the settlers and did not spear their cattle. For this he is by many accounted a visionary, but at any rate he has been the man selected at the desire of the New South Wales and Victorian Governments, to render help in running down theoutlawsa whose non capture for so long a time is a disgrace to Austrilia. His second in command is Constable King, a native of Queensland, and so skilled in bush craft as to be himself a match for a Mjall. Six black trackers accompany them, trained human sleuth hounds, who have served with O'Connor for years, and will do his bidding with as little hesitation as hand-reared mastiffs. They may be shot down, but they will scent the Kellys miles away, and while life lasts they will never leave the trail. Its bloody work and hazardous, but the peace and credit of the colonies demands that it shall be done, and thcse men will do it if not anticipated by the Victorian police, which looks unlikely. We have aboriginal reserves in various parts of this colony, all more or less failures, and we have commissioners or trustees for these reserves who cannot agree as to the best system for ameliorating the aborigines. The Anglican bishop, the Right Rev Dr Hale, is one of these, the Rev Duncan M'Nab is another The Rev Duncan is a Catholic missionary prieat, who believea the adult nigger can be Chistianised, and ago civilised Hie Rev Bishop Hale is not at all sanguine on that point, regarding it aa a barely poa Bible miracle, but he thinks that young niggers might bo caught and tamed The Rev Duncan seemingly believes that the way to reach a blackfellow s heart is to make him a landed proprietor, mid has been endeavouring to get his co commissioners to persuade the Government to make granta of land in fee simple to the blacks They failed to Bee the utility of the idea, and other w îse took exception to the views of the Rev Mr M'Nab Ho baa therefore cast them adrift, written to the papera that they havo thwarted him, that they are where they ought not to be, and altogether such an angry letter as }oa might suppose a M'Nab who hadn't got Ina own way would write The Bishop haB rejoined heavily, and once more the native difliculty baa not been solv ed Intensely hot and tr} ing weather has pre vailed here during the latter half of last month Tor da} s together tho thermometer registered in the shade DOdcg to lOldeg Deaths from sunstroke, aggrav ated or super induced by heivy drinking vvero becoming quite common Similir causea produced several suicides, and one way or other the record of the last two months will show more violent or Budden deaths than m six months would ordinanl} bo registered In some districts th¿ scorching heat has ut terly withered up the wheat and late maizo crops, and the yield will not pay for gather ing As a rule, however, there ia an ample supply of grass for stock, and in some places farmers have had such frequent rains that the} complain the} cannot work their land, it is always m such slopp} condition Alto gelber a most uneven season I had determined to end this letfei here, but ma} add that I have just heard of the discover} by the excise and police of a big thing in the way of manufacturing "Hen 11C6S} s three star from white spirit and worse poisons, and vending aame The scoundrel principals are and to number five or six, and hundreds of gallons of this stuff are believed to have been got rid of, and hundreds more are probabl} ni the market Some arrests have been made, and I only wish that 1 could say that there was a good prospect of all the principals in this trade being hanged
