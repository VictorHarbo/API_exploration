The Prime Minister, (Mr. tfisher) delivered the budget speech to-dayl. He said, 'In presenting tne la.si budget to Parliament, on October 26\. 1911,. the surplus of revenue over expenditure for .the year ended ' June .30, 1911, was stated at £1,829. 524\. When the Treasury books* were finally balanced this, amount ap peared as £1,837,175. . It was trans ferred for future expenditure to the '* construction of fleet fund and the invalid and old age pensions fund m equal amounts of £9io,5S7. In i framing the budget of 1911-12 it was estimated that £1,712,679 of that amount would be expended during the financial year. I am happy to say that, owjing to large receipts from the Customs and the savings on the estimated expenditure, it was \ ;,.-.-'? Not Necessary to Expend This Amount,; as. the revenue exceeded the expen .. diture of £424,336, of' which amount £278,2*42 was transferred to the con- j ttructaon of fleet fund and £146,124 to the invalid and old-age pensions fund. On June 30, 1912, there was ' in all at the credit of. the construc tion, of fleet fund and the invalid ! and '? old-age pensions fund, the j amount- of £2,261,541, This- amount | may be considered as the surplus balance brought forward from pre ceding years, and- is available for ex penditure in the present financial year. The - Revenue for the Year ended June 30 last amounted to \- '±,20,546,361.- Customs, and Excise reached the large ^amount of £14,710, 199,: being £1,729,755 in 'excess of the collections* of the previous year ,and £910,199 above he estimate.. # I attribute the present large receipts principally to the great prosperity which Australia is now enjoying, and which I hope will long con tinue. The .-...?? . j Post-Of&ces; Yielded £3,916,599, being*£46,499 over the estimate, and £10,584 in excess of the receipts of the preceding year. This was in . ?'? spite of the fact, that we had penny postage throughout the' Cotmmoinr wealth and British dominions dur ing the whole of 19 11-12, while it was in operation only for ? two months in the previous year. .'- The Land Tax Yielded .'£1,366,454,, . \- beinio- £63,546 under the estimate, a*ddlS3891 less than ? ? tbe receipts of 1910-11. The gross profits. from coin age amounted, to £156,489. being j £53,511 less than the estimate and j £42,404 less than those of the pre- j vious year. Some difficulty has been found in obtaining sufficient . quantities of .silver coin from Lon don in consequence of the pressure of business in the Royal Mint, ow ing to the gold requirements of the Bank of England, also in collecting British silver in conv.einieait denomi nations from the banks in .order to exchange it for Australian, coinage. I am hoping to make such arrange ments . that we shall be able in fu ture to regularly export £100,000 per annum in face value of British silver. It is, of course, difficult to collect small coins from, every part of Atistralia, but the /difficulty, will be overcome. Included in last year's revenue was' an amount of £113,340, 'being the balance of the Defeaice TnistFuaict Accounts. on 'June 30. The Defence Depart ment desired jii&t; ' ' tfeas. ? ammiat_ .t \ ''?'.'? . .-,.--. should remain in the respective trust i funds created for the convenient j working, of the various factories es- [ tablished by the department, but I j take the . view that, although trust funds may be used with advantage during the.. year in connection- with the -working, of the factories, the de partment should not be allowed to accumulate funds which could' be used, in future years without review by Parliament. The Expenditure for the Year ' | ended June 30 last was £2O,121,C95, j not including the amount of £424,366 which I have already referred to as having been charged to special ap- j propriations and credited to the fleet and old age pensions funds. The amounts paid to each State un der the . Surplus Revenue Act of 1910 are : —New South . Wales, £2,040.993 ; Victoria, £1,667,657; Queensland; £761,302; South Aus tralia, £511,719; West Australia, £599,991;. Tasmania, £236,761. Total, ? £5,824,423. Turning now . to the current year, the revenue is estimated as follows : — Customs and Excise, £14,511,000; land. tax, £l, 300,000; coinage, £150,000; defence, £45,000; patents, £20,000; trade marks, copyrights, and designs, £5000; quarantine, £10,000; capital territory, £2000; Northern Terri tory, £32,000; repayment. of propor tion of pensions due by States, £41,000; contribution of officers to pensions under State Acts, £30,000; ! miscellaneous, £100,000.

Total, £5,9S3,75O. j In co'nnecticn with the ixist' a'-nd I telegraph it will be seen that last j quarter the expenditure, not in- j eluding new works and buildings, j exceeded the revenue . by £385,954. i The expenditure for new works and! buildings was £1,442,475. It is es- j timated that during tbe. current \ year the expenditure, not including new works, will .exceed -.. the revenue by £440,275. The expenditure pro vided for new work is £1,152,275. | In addition to the amount,; £83.000, i provided this year- for telegraphs j and . telephones, and ;' for : wireless telegraphy, the department will probably expend £429,460, ..the bal ance unexpended of the £600,000 j specially . provided . last ! year i and paid, into; ? a ' .special! trust : account. Provision hais ! been made for a large increase in the permanent Staff of the Post Office. ' I It has been represented by the de- j partment that economy would final- ; ly result from such new , appoint- - ments, ' the present system' of em- ; ploying large numbers of temporary i hands ' being very unsatisfactory. I Provision has accordingly been! made for an additional. staff of 1733 j officers. The total number of per-1 ? manent' officers provided for in the estimates is 18,587. In 1906-7; bniy' 10,96] were provided for. In 1902-3 ? the revenue was £2,404,730, : being - 12/ per head. In 1912-13 the ' ? j Revenue is Estimated at ? ? ' £4,202,000, . ' ;..'?. I j or 17/lOf per head. In 1902r3 the ] expenditure, not including new j works,' was £2,433,147, or 13/3 per! head. In 1912-13 the expenditiire, not including new works, is esti mated at £4,674,715, or 19/11 per head. Provision has been made for the erection' during the year of ' Ten Wireless Telegraph Stations. It is estimated -that there will be an increase of £19,000 over the ex penditure of the previous year for conveyance- of mails due to- the ex tension of the existing f acilities, and to ? increased cost of existing services.. An increase of £14,000 has been pi-ovided to meet additicfiaal rates of paymemt to the State rail way departments from January . 1 last year, . under an agreement pro viding for a, re-weighting of the mails during November, 1911. The sum of £45,500 has been provided to allow of .remuaaje ration being given to non official postmasters on an increased scale. ' . ? Defence Departnnent. ~ The expenditure for .defence has largely increased during the last three years. . Tiie total expendi ture, iniohi ding -,- new works, etc, from July 1,. 1901, to June 30,-1910, wss £9,578,997. The expenditure ?'?'in 1910-11-12 and 1912-13- is estimated ft £12,524,429, of w,hich .£5,438,364 is . includeid in tbe estimates for ; the current finia-iicial ' year in , view of .? tji-e considerable increase '.in expenditure : for defence. The following jnfor ! mation, which . has been . furnished I by that department,, will be inter jesting to1 honourable members. It is \ the inteinition' tihis yea.r , to hold ? a I nine months s-ehool of in struction . for the purpose of training 60 candidates for . the histruction&L; ? staff, and provision has been made.. .Accordingly' it' is intended to establish ; a - ? school for the training of officers in aviation. Provision ?-». has been made for two pilot aviators and four mechanics, also, for the purpose of aviation stores, four machines have already been purchased. The : .?? Training- -of , Cadets ?? , at the Royal Military College is proceeding satisfactorily ; -79 cadets are in . residence, ? 15 oi which are from New Zealand. ^ The number of cadets ' will be largely 'increased during 'this year. Provision has been made accordingly. The cor dite factory is at present engaged i in . experimental and proof work. The cordite produced has passed the ballistic test,- but the chemical capability ' tests are not yet com ! pleted. .There is, however, no j reason to doubt that the cordite produced will be suitable ; for am munition, The plant of the ... .

The j clothing factory, which at present I employs 300 hands, began operations in: January last, and during the period January to June 1912 turned out garments to the value of £26, 795\. The clothing manufactured I was of a high quality, and was! turned out at a .-reasonable . cost. Itj is anticipated, however, that - the j. cost of production wills be con siderably loAvcred during this year. It .? has been found the present! capacity of the factory is not! sufficient for requirements, and pro- j vision has been made for the dupli- i cation of the plant. . . The .'. harness j and saddlery factory has been .in j full' working order for the last 11 J months, and during' '.that time '. aj large .quantity of high -.class; military equipment ?, has, as .Well I a-s mailbags,' . etc., been ??map- i foctured to ? the satisfaction I of the defence and the Postmaster- 1 General's, department, ' At present; 115, hands are employed,, and the re- j suits achieved by the factory are of | such -a satisfactory5 nature that_ it ; is intended to ? enlarge ? the premises i during this year,- when the number ; of 'hands will also most probably i increase.

Lately, however, several/ inquiries made by firaris ? iai ? ? the -. ?.

'unesploited, but sufficient has i now been . attained to show . that trawlers, . if carried out . on proper ! I lines., must be a; commercial suc I cess in Australia. ; Last year I .- an j nounced in respect^ of quarantine' j that the Government had sent Dr. 'Norris, the director of quarantine, abroad .to inquire into a report upon quarantine methods., and equip ! meiit in other ...countries. This I course had been decided upon owing | to the large prospective ex j penditu re which , had been recom mended by the.-.; director on ?account of the ' defective and starved condition of the quarantine ma '? cliin-ery ' handed over to the Com monw&alt-h.; Whilst this Govern ment - fullr- xsgokaiss tloat ik& :jim. . t tection of the public health should be the first consideration, it was hoped that it might be possible to '* avoid undue expense. The director, who was- absent six months, haa ;. ; now submitted. a report. The Go vernment is satisfied that large and careful expenditure is absolutely necessary for the due protection of the Commonwealth,, the cleanest country in the world as regards disease, from the pestilences which are found in every other continent,' and which threaten us more everv day owing to our increasing inter-* course and trade with the lowest continents. It may be mentioned that the ? Disease' Has Been Hampered in Australia with greater frequency during the last 12 months than, ever before. Fortunately it has in every instance been- detected, and prevented attain ing a footing. It is proposed to \ distribute the. expenditure over sev eral years, but during the present year it is intended to make good the. more serious' gaps in the first Ijne of sanitary defence in Australia. The results, it is believed, will be». not only greater security against the' entrance of disease, but also a reduc« tion of the delays -to. trade and com merce, which quarantine necessarily , - entails. The report on the Coastal Lighthouse Service ' . has been received, giving full de tails of the immediate require ments of Queensland, Tasmania, the south-east coast of Victoria, and Northern Territory. The coast of: South- Australia and 'West Aus tralia have' also been visited, and reports are now completed. The coast of New South Wales and then, west ? coast of Victoria, . a total o£, about 1000 miles, remain to be in-' spected. The work of thia department has greatly increas ed during the past year. The great increase in. immigration has been dealt with without adding materially to the expense of tho department. v Northern Territory.. The principal positions on tHe administrative sta-ff of the Northern Territory have been .filled, and an examination is being made of tha areas which it is proposed to make available for settlers. Separate : provision has. been made for the office of judge, as it is considered that the Dosition of a judge and Government Resident should be separated. Schools and agricul-, tu'ral stations are being providedh for the riatives, who number about 20,000. Progress is being made \ [ with demonstratiqn farms, and it is proposed to appoint, an entomologist in order to deal' with the insect nest. A director for mines and geologist have been appointed, it being de sired the mines shall be worked* more scientifically than in the past.' Provision is made for the erection of houses for Government em ployees, as it has been found that private enterprise has done .praofci' cally nothing to meeting this want. It is proposed to . purchase twa steamers— one to maintain communi cation along the coast and the^bthei* to act as auxiliary. The vote for the advancement; of the study of tropical diseases has been increased . from. £1350 to ' £4000, it being thought desirable* that the scope of the inyestigatioic1 made by the Tropical Disease Hos pital, at Townsville should be in creased.. # x Papua. The vote for the administration 'of Papua has been inor eased from £25,000 to,£30,000, as it is; intended to establish . a number of additional stations, the Lieutenant-Governor1 having reported that such are ab- ? solnteiy necessary. Ten thousand pounds is provided towards the cost of a new steamer, ?? estimated at' £25,000, the present vessel havingi^ ' been purchased 23 years ago, and-, being practically worn out. The .' wireless station at Port Moresby' will probably be finished within tha x next six weeks. . ;' Expenditure ob; New. Works/ Buildings, etc ? ..'.'. The expenditure to June .30 -was,. ' ' £4,100,754, and the Commonwealth' is to be congratulated on having ex pended this money from the re venue: instead of having raised a public debt for the purpose. -It will be observed that the . property taken over, from the' States amount ed to £9,591,588, so that the Com monwealth has since expended orie and a half times as much. It wil] also be noticed that during the threo years 1910-11, 1911-12. and 1912-13 ' ' it is estimated that £10,004,379 will be expended, whilst during the nine years ending June 30, 1909 only £69,245 was expended on works connected with the establish ment of the Federal Capital.

', '?''-? . . . . . sions.. . . . ' ? ? On June. 30, .1912, . there, were -^9,071 aid A-^e pensioners, being an, ?;;?'? Sncrease ? of 3569 in the 12 months. ? jThis increase .cannot be considered 1 -, . .large, ? because the nximber. of per , -7' (sons qualified by. age to receive old sage pensions, -but who do not draw old age- pensions, is great. There lare at' present about 105,000 men. in. (the Commonwealth over* the age of .,65 years, .and about 140.000 women / over the age of sixty years — '245,100. Of theses 79,000 are pen sioners and 166,000 are not pen : sioners. A considerable number jwould be debarred from obtaining pensions through their having pro jpe rty or income in excess of that al lowed \hy. the Act, or being aliens, tetc., biit.it is certain that the nurn ?..-. jber who, .' from independence, refrain ^.ixom planning old age pensions N is large. .From' these persons a regu ?' lar increase. in the . pension, , Hist ..may be expected, be icause 'the t reluctance, to accept ., old-age ; pensions is gradually be fcomin,* , Ipss. This is . jneAatable in ia syistem' which recognises that the : ipensipns. are a right and not a jcharitv. ?.. On the whole, it is &]aougb.V that ,the' increase of 3569 old age pensioners in the year is ionly a normal one. On June 30 . la,st the number of invalid penision |ets was 10,763, being an increase of ^312 on. the figures for the previous : ^ear. ' It may.be anticipated that. 1 the 'increase in future years will ?!not be so great, because at June '30, 1911, the invalid pensions' liad been payable by the.Common ?wealth for. a period of six months ionly, and. the first rush of pensioners *o take . advantage of' the ' Act bad ?not ceased. On. .that .daite the ex penditure on old age ' and. invalid pensions in the year just dosed' ^amounted to ?£2,148,134-, comipared' ? ? /with :£l,&68,648 .in' tbe previous year. These .figures, however, do not ' ^represent the true position, because &he; pension list was ; beinig added p) consideirably duiong each year. lEfoe proper comparison is on the annual, rate payable on the last day jof each financial year. On June 30, 2911\. the annual rate of payment was |B2,054?3.64i onVJnn« ,30, 1912, it was, ~ ,^2,224,666' -appToximately, being an Jincr&ase-; of £169,702 in the- year ? The amount actually payable to old; ' age and invalid pensioners in 1912 and 1913, is estimated at £2,405,000. This, includes provision for the in crease of payments which will- re-, suit if Parliament pass a bill (to 'be shortly submitted) for the pur- j pose of granting pensions to persons who are at' present disqualified by the ownership of homes. The cost of j ?administration of invalid and old age i pensions during 1911-12 was £41,794. j The cost bf administration in 1912-13 is estimated at £45,715. In' this con nection it may be mentioned that the cost of administration in New ?South Wales was, in 1908-9 (the last year of the State system) £25,141, and the total amount paid in pen sions was £602,208. The cost of ad ministration represented £436 for every £110 of pension paid. It should also be pointed out that the com parison is somewhat unfair to the Commonwealth administration, in that- ? the cost of the latter includes payments for some services which were * rendered free to the State ? pensions office. A comparison with the cost of New Zealand is not easily made because the published figures ap parently do not include the costs of services rendered by other depart ments. The low cost of Common i wealth administration as compared with that of New South Wales is largely accounted for by the fact iJhat the pensions in New South Wales were paid by the bank, which received £2 for every £100 of pen sions paid. Under the Commonwealth an improved method of payment and accounting has been established, and the work of payment costs, 12/6. for every £100' of pensions paid in allowance. A sum of £400,000 has been 'included in the estimates for The Maternity Allowance, and a bill will shortly be introduced for the purpose of making these grants. I feel confident that _ a ?wise step is being taken in initiat ing this policy. . The protection of the mother and the safety of the child are so important to the com munity, and so humanitarian, that; I feel sure that although the ad ministration will not be free from difficulties, suffering will be relieved, health promoted, and valuable lives spared to the Commonwealth. .'The Amending Notes Act of 1911 j provided that the Treasurer shall hold in gold coin a reserve of -not1 less than one-fourth '-of the . amount j of the Australian, notes issued. The amendment took , effect . on July 1, 1912, and until. - that' date the ; ?Treasurer1 was required' to keep in j gold coin one-fourth the amount up \ to £7,000,000, and pound for pound above £7,000,000: At Junie 30 the' circulation stood at £9,485,943, and1 the' gold in the Treasury amounted', to £4, 279,037,. being ' £43,084 above' the amount then legally I required. In July £3,400, 000- | in gold was . transferred from the . Treasury, vaults to the banks . in Melbourne and £5000 was received as interest, . being also available.; ; The amount of £400,000 was placed on^xfij:^ .deposit with the Treasurer ? |of:'New-S;6uth Wales, the 'rate , of in-, terest .being 3| per cent, per annum, it/being desirable that the position of the . notes fund should be streng-. thened .as far :as/ possible by the fre quent maturing on investments. It | was arranged . that the £400,000 should be paid in instalments of £1.00,000 the first instalment in July, 1913, and subsequent install ments, at intervals of one month. In all, the Treasury had invested out of the notes fund the amount of £4,685,000, . and the aranual amount of interest at present ?being earned is £199,300. The in terest earned hj the notes- invest ments is credited to' the Australian ?Notes Account,' so that the notes fund ^ is accumulating by coanpooincl interest. Up to July 29 the Trea sury had received interest 'aimouinit-: ing' to £188,594, - and the expenses aimounted to £31,714, lea-TOig £156, 880 as the met addition to th e notes 'accO'Unt.r On Moiiiday last the cir culation 'was £3,849,599, and the gold reserve. held in the, Treasury. against that circulation Avas £3,842,663. be ing:. 40.92 per cent, on the circula tidn,' and 15.92 per cent, more than the legal reserve. The Expert Steelplate Note - ? v Printer. The; intention is that not only will, the notes be printed in Australia, but that the working plates will be made here.' The. expert, now1 being imported, will train others, and it is hoped in future it will always be possible to find omen in Australia who can do the work. '..'?,.'?. . Commonwealth Investnients. . . ' ? *'S. ' ' ? At present the -Treasury is earning interest on £7,408,577, b'eing£5,685r 000 on account of the notes fund and £1.723,577 on account of, general ! trust funds. Of that total the an- !. ?rnual rate of interest is £252,124. j In addition, there are considerable funds in London which the ' High Commissioned lends to the market, j j These investments are usually made : for a few . days, or a few days at a time, and thus the unemployed bal-' ance in London is kept low. The repayment of the .loans is guaran- ! . teed by the Ba_nk of England, which j j receives commission on the interest j i earned. , The Commonwealth re-.. J venue benefited last year by the j amount of £2925 . interest earned in j London. . - Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie ~ Railway.' . j The Commonwealth Government bos now agreed with the two States,. South Australia- and West Austra- i lia,'as to the Crown land to be grant ed for i the workers of the railway. Although a formaJ- agreement has not yet been signed, deviation is proceeding which ; will have the ef fect of shortening the line at the Kalgooiriie end, and, if successful, will have the effect of bringing the materials closer in to Kalgoorlie than if situated atKurramia. , It is expected that this matter will be I determined in the course _ of a few days. In South Australia, at the, Port Augusta end, steps are being taken to acquire ; the private lands required within the township of Port Augusta, and a number of from 50 to 100 -men will shortly- be employed ?on -the- earth works. Arrangements are being -made for rails and sleepers '. for. . temporary . pur poses': at- each: end of the line, ? and tenders have been received .for . rails and sleepers for the main line. .As .soon as a sufiicdeiit quantity of these ?'rails and' 'sleepers have been' delivered \ a start will be made- to push on with the earthworks and the permanent way. The money re 'uiied for the present financial year is estimated to be £1,000,000. j Proceeding, Mr. Fislier said that he would introduce a bill to grant Tasmania a sum of £500,000. : In ten years the first payment would be i95;0O0| and this would be dimin-.' iiS;hed every year until the 'whole, amount was paid. : ? ? .. % ??: ,:. The British Association fpr. the ;. Pro-;, . ...motion of Science ? had accepted an invitation of the Commonwealth to visit Australia, and its meetings would be held here in 1914. About half as many mem bers would make the trip as had been expected, and it was intended to take steps to properly entertain the visitors. (Cheers.)

He hoped General Botha- would shortly visit Australia, and he bad also been in communication with the Go vernment of New Zealand on the question of reciprocation, and had the hope that this would 'be arrang ed. In many directions Mr. Bryce had remarked that the mother coun try had, protected the dominion un til she thought they could walk alone. That was true, and the time had come when the mother country had said to the Dominion, 'Go and manage your own affairs.' Then it had happened when at the Imperial Conference .the mother country had said, £fCqme back as equals.' No country had greater freedom to manage its own affairs than Aus tralia, ; and %*?$$ were glad to be as sociated with, the mother country in protecting the Empire against foreign foes. (Cheers.)
