She sailed from Galle on 2 rd January, and ex perienced moderate trades until the 3rd February, after which had strong 6. E. winds and heavy head sea to the Sound, where she arrived on the 8th February, at 6 a.m ; left tbe following day, and carricd variable winds with fine weather to Port Pbililp, where t»he anchored on the 14th ; sailed again on the 15th, and had dense fogs in the Straits, -when it was found necessary to heave the vessel to for three hours. After passing Wilson's Promontory, had strong N. E. winds, with heavy sea to Cape Howe, when she encountered a violent easterly gale, followed by a dense fog and high confused sea. The clipper ehlp Star of Peace, for London, was towed to sea on the 16tn instant* She takes a l*rge and valuable cargo, and has only oecupied fourteen days in loading. The Bombay, P. and O. steamship, arrived at King George's Sound on the 31st January, and eaiicd the following day for Galle. The various vessels in harbour bad their colours half-mast en the 18th, as a mark of respect to the memory of the officers and men of H M.S. Orpheus, wrecked at New Zealand. The Coetlogon reports the St, Anne as lying at Port de France, and also that the Governor, brig, sailed on the 11th for the South 6ca Islands. The following war vessels were also in port on the 13th instant Bonite, Gazelle, Fine, and €alcdonienne. The Kutosoff h&6 made o fair passage from Sao Franciso of fifty-five days, and wc have been favoured by Captain Swan&on; with lilcs to the 24th December, containing New York news to the 23rd same month. The schooner Salcomb Castle is now on Darley's patent slip being caulked, and re-coppered. This vessel was originally an English smack ; and, although net a modern ship, her planking appears as bound as when first placed in her. The De Swaan, fiom Amsterdam, 8th October, reports having spoken the ship Cordova from Liverpool to Sydney, a short dis tance south of the Equator. The Novelty Baeqie —This celebrated Auckland clipper, of which so much has been said'from time to time, arrived in port on the 18th ; and it is but justice to say that the high encomiums tbat bave been passed on her have not been misapplied. 6he not only being faithfully built, but her model is remarkably good, with this exception that there is apparently too much shear. Having been expressly built for the Sydney and Auckland trade, especial care has been bestowed on the passenger accommodation. Foremost of which is the maia saloon, containing enclosed cabins for thirty passengers ; the apartment throughout being fitted in a manner seldom seen on board a sail ing ship, and composed entirely of polished mottled kauri, rome, and cednr, which displays the beautiful grain of the woods in great Ecrfcction. The saloon, which is seven feet six inches in height, as two skylight* and aternports, which afford ample circulation, and is reached bv a well-arranged and commodious companion. Forward of tbe main saloon and on either side of the companion are two ladies' cabins, with detached closetB, and replete with every comfort ; while the quarter-deck, which is fifty-eight feet long, affords an nnintenuptcd promenade. The fore- cabin has also been specially constructed for the comfort of steerage passengers— in fact nothiug appears to have been left undone either in the hull oi interior fittings to render bir a first-eloss vessel Unfortunately, the light wtriable winds that have attended the pttsage from Auckland have prfcludcd the possibility of testing her sailing qualities, which, to judge by her tine lines, will be very good. The Novelty was built for Messrs, Henderson, M'Farland, and Co., of Auckland, bv Mr* Nicol, the builder of the pchuoners Atlantic and Pacific, and is a credit to tbe yard from which she was launched. She has arrived and will continue under the command of Captain P. Jones, late of tbe Breadalbane and Kate« to whom we wish every success. The Rainbow (&.), lately employed as a tug at Brisbane and for merly in the Marleay River trade,- was lately sold to the Clarence and Richmond River Steam Companv for the sum of £4000.

Crossed the bar at tbe cntiance. ol that channcl of the river in Upstart Bay, marked on the charts Wickbam River, at ten a.m, 8th January ; after proceeding about five miles up the river the further pro gress of thn fcteamcr was stopped by a sand bar extending across the whole channel, which dried at low water, excepting some four or five narrow channels containing from twelve to eighteen i tithes of water. Captain Till crossed the bar, which iB about half a mile wide, in his boat, and for above tbree miles above it found from two to three fat hums of water ; he did not proceed any higher up tho river, having decided, in conBcqucncc of the neap tides, on not taking the steamer up any further. On his re turn he crot-sed the bar at the meuth of the river at low water, with about seven feet six inches of water on the bar9 having a smooth tea; with E.N.E. oi N. winds, there would be a heavy sea on tbe bar nhich would prevent any vessel from either en tering or leaving- the river. The bankE of the river for the whole distance up are low and swampy.

We publish their report below, merely premising that, from the nature of the evidence (none of it on oatb) on which the decision is fonnded, we do not attach as much weight to it as wc should othcrwis^have done:— 91 Wc, the undersigned, at the request of Lis Honor the Superintendent, have held an inquiry into the circumstances connected with the loss ;of the barque Time and Truth ; and. from the written statement now before us of Captain Thompson, assistant harbour master, at the Bluff, and of Captain Slater, as also tho assistant pilot and signal-man's report to Captain Morris, taken in writing by him at the time, we are of opinion the cause ef the said vessel striking the reek was her not answering her port helm, being struck with a heavy sqoall on entering tbe harbour. We do not think Captain Slater is to blame, as he appears to have taken all nocessary pre cautions before running for the port. J. B.

Tbe barque Stafford, of New Bedford, Pierce, master, has brought to thie port six Chinamen, under the following circum stances :— It appears that they left Hongkong in the ship St* Paul, Captain Pennard. as passengers, bound to Sydney, in June, 1858, They were wrecked near Spittal's Reef, and out of 810 on hoard, only 10 escaped being massacred— these escaped to another island, name unknown. Two have since died, two are still sup JOFcd to be cn that island, and these six came to Woodlark eland, and have been living there these last two years. Captain Pierce states that he touched there on the 1st day of November, and took them off in a most wretched state, and brought them on here, having clothed and fed them from tbat time. They aro anxious to get to Sydney, where they have friends. Captain Pierce bas brought tnem to this place, and they are now under the charge of our Resident Magistrate, who, 1 believe, is waiting instructions from Auckland regarding them. Captain Pierce deserves great praise for hia conduct to these unfortunates,— Few Zea)at*der. TutlC.B.W, Sttauer Prince Alfred.— An accident occurred to this steamvcssel on the 10th of February, at Lyttelton, which accounts for the delay in her arrival at this port. It appears that, on leaving Peacock's Wharf, where she had been landing sheep and horses, the screw got foul of a buoy rope connected with a mooring chain, which kept winding around the screw at every evolution, until, suddenly, the engines were brought up without any power of moving, and the rudder bad also Become fixed. The Plince Alfred had immediately to bo lightened by the removal of all bulky articles stowed aft, and was then beached, where sho remained some forty houtB before all was cleared a way. Fortunately, a subsequent examination of the screw and rudder proved tbat no material damage had been 6U8taincd, and tho Prince Alfred then gleamed out for Nelson, and arrived here on Friday morning, at two o'clock, after a run of twenty-six hours, though she encountered a strong head wind the whole way,— XCehon Irarmnrr, February 14. ?

In fact, he is only waiting for Chfambers' backer, who Chambers says will call on Everson in a week or two to sign articles, make a deposit, and settle the date of rowins, which Chambers eays will be in the early part oi ApriL I am, sir, yours, fire,, W. Wall.' Teh Northern Whalihg Fleet.— Up to this date twenty three whaling vessels have arrived at all the ports of these islands. Their aggregate catches are 1410 barrels sperm oil, 19,030 barrels whale oil, snd vt-3,ObO lbs. bone. Of thiB fleet two were sperm whalers from a cruise south and west ; one was from the Codiak, and arotber was a trader in the Arctic, leaving nineteen others to show the true catch tbis season North. Of this fleet ef nineteen, twelve arc from the Arctic and seven from the Ocbotsk ; the aggiegate catches (excluding oil taken between seasons) being of the former 11,440 barrels whale, snd 1G4.5U0 lbs. bone, averaging 963 1-8 barrels whale, and 18,708 lbs. bone to each vessel; and of the latter, 7,250 barrels whale, find 90,000 lbs. bone, averaging 10SG barrels whale, and 12,637 lbs. lone ; or a general average of Arctic and Oohotsk of 983 2-* barrels oil, arid 13,400 IbB. bone. We know of no more vessels to arrive from the Arctic, unlesB some have gone there of which we have r.o notice. Three, the Sarah Warren, Thomas Dickason, anrt John Howlaud, recruit at San Francisco. Of the two latter, the first ii- reported full, and the other with 800 barrels. Two others, the Kohola and Zoc, will winter North, having sent their catches down here in freight (claeBcd as imports, and not inoludcd in tbe Ncrll.crn catch. Of the Ochotak fleet, we know of fourteen more- to airive (three of which will probably recruit at San Fran cisco), but their average catch will not be more than 620 barrels each, and the lucky ones orly four of tbis number,— Polynesian, November 14. LOSS OF THE NATAL STEAMER WALDENSIAN,— The follow ing particulars of the loss of the Natal mail steamer Waldensian. are abstracted from the East Province (Cape oi Good Hope) Herald. On October 16th Cape Town was put into a painful state of excitemcnt by the intelligence that the screw steamer Walden- sian had been lost off Struy's Point, near Cape Agulhas. The following letter, written by Captain Joss the morning after the catastrophe, gives a clear account of the occurrence :— 'I am sorry to inform you that the Waldensian is a total wreck on Struy's Point Reef. 1 passed Cape Infanta about half-past six last night, about seven to eight miles off the land, and steering my usual course from L'Agulhae Point Light. The night was very hazy, and about half-past nine I went off the deck, leaving the second mate in charge. I said to him, "Keep a good J look out for ships" It was dark, and a light south-east wind, with the square sails set. I did not leave the deck to turn in, but I went down to read, and about ten p.m. I fell asleep, and about eleven p.m. the ship ran on the reef, going about seven knots. I jumped on deck, and was for a minute quite taken back, as I thought we were so far off the land. I tried to back astern, but found ber so fast that she would not move, and the bottom soon got holed ; the water came in and put the fires out. By this time we had all the boats out and under the lee side of the ship, and I had by that time got a sight of the land, and knowing the place, I then sent the second officer with a boat to look for the landing-place, which I knew was there. He came back, saying that he had landed. I then got the ladles in the first two boats ashore— sixteen of them— under the charge of the first and second officers ; the other two boats, under the carpenter and boatswain, then took the old men. All the others we sent, as we could, in several trips, which took a long time, but by daylight I had them all on shore, and by that time two of the boats had been stove. A shore boat came off at 7 p.m , and I took the mails in her, and left the ship myself, all tbe others being safe on shore. The ship is now broken in two parts. I have been on again, but we can save nothing. All are well. Mr. Barry is down, and we have arranged to take the passengers to Struy's Bay, and you must send the Kadie or Albatross for us. The most perfect order was maintained by all on board, and it is | no doubt owing to this circumstance that no lives were lost. The vessell broke in halves about half-past 11 on the morning of the 14th, and, with the cargo, became a perfect wreck. The passen gers saved nothing, besides the clothes they wore. The loss of several has been considerable— in many instances large sums of money and valuable effects having gone down. The Christy Minstrels, who were on board, lost all their costumes and instru ments, besides £400 in cash. By far the heaviest loss, however, is that of Captain Bailey, who had with him on board four years' observations on tbe trigonometrical survey of the colony, the whole of which went down with the wreck On reaching the ; land the gentlemen lighted a large fire, and made the ladies as comfortable as possible, and on the following morn ing several neighbours who had been informed of the disaster came down to the beach and behaved very hospi- tably and liberally to the shipwrecked travellers. Tlie passen gers were conveyed overland in whatever vehicles were obtain able, and reached Cape Town on Thursday. A letter beariug testimony to Captain Joss's skilful conduct under the trying cir- cumstances has been sent to the Cape papers by the Christy Minstrals, and the passengers were arranging to present him with a testimonial for his admirable behaviour after the wreck, and his wonderful success of saving all the passengers. It is stated as being almost next to a miracle that any lives were saved. The water is scarcely ever so smooth at the sceneof the wreck as on this eventful night, and usually there is a terrific sea running there. Thanksgiving services took place on the folluwing Sun day in the Dutch churches, having special reference to the rescue of the passengers, and a commission had been appointed to in vestigate the losses of the passengers, with a view to opening a subscription list for their relief.
