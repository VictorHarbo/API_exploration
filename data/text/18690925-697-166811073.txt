On Chong and Co. The ehip Bnrrey, Captain Marshall, arrived on 22ndfnetantflrom London, having made she passage from the Dooks ia 93 d&ys.; It is now some years since any of Mr. Marshall's ships have visited this port, bat we understand that in future s ship will be dispatched monthly. The Surrey Is a fine wholesome looking Te*se], end fitted In the same elaborate manner that al ways marks the ships belonging to the firm Reipeoting the outward passage, Captain Marshall reports that he left the Docks on 20th and cleared the Channel on the 25th Jose. He had very bad N.E, trades, the Equator being orossed on 24th July, in longitude 27 80 W. The 6.E trades also proved very unfavourable, the eblp being driven over on the Brazilian coast, nnd many days were lost in working off. The meridian or the Cape of the Good Hope was passed on 18th August, and she r»n her easting down on a parallel of latitude 45 8., the winds proving very variable with sudden shifts. 6he came south of Tasmania, rounding the 8.W. Ope on the 14th instant, 81 days out. On this coast she has experienced very unsettled weather, and on Sunday encountered a terrific gale from the 6.W. The sea got up as it were lnstantaoeoualy, and the squalls were violent in the extreme, compelling Captain Marshall to reduce canvas to close-reefed topsails. The Surrey is to. the consignment of Messrs. Boott, Henderson, and Co. The clipper ship Ann Duthle, Captain Bcmie, whlcU arrived on 2lst instant, hasbeenjtraly usfortanate in herpassage out which has been prolonged to 90 days from the Start Point This is accounted for by the prevalence of light winds to the Equator, end being jammed down for several days on the Brazilian coa*t, &nd; again adverse weather prevailing eince roundiag the 6.W. , Cape of Van Diemen*s Land. She sailed from London on the 19th June, passed the Downs 20th, Start Point 29rd, and finally took her departure from the Lizard on the 24th : very bed N.E, trades were experienced. The Equator was crossed on 22nd July, in longitude 81*80 W. The 8.E, trades also proved equally variable, the ship being driven to the westward, and* as before stated, considerable time wae lost on the eastern coast of South America. 6ho passed the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope on the 19th August, and carried moderate winds in running down her longitude, which was effected on a mean parallel of latitude 44' 6., her highest southing being 46* 8. She came south of Van Diemen's Land, the 8.W, Cape being passed on the 12th instant. The Ann Duthie, as usual, brings a large general cargo, is in be&utlfnl; order, and is to the consignment of Messrs. Gil obris^ Watt, and Co. The fire which took place on hoard the steamer Platypus on her passage hence to the Maoleay River, did not, fortunately, occa sion very much damage. It appears that whe&ahe; was about 18 miles from Bmoky Cape, smoke was observed issuing from under neath the tarpaulin which covered the main hatch. The hatches were at .once removed, but nothing could bo done as the sea was too heavy, end the smoke too dense : Captain Creer Immediately replaced the hatches, and rah into Trial Bay, where they were again removed, and the cargo stowed in the starbsard wing was found to be on fire. The hose was at once got ready, and the fire speedily extinguished. The vessel is no way injured, and about £60 will cover ell the damage done to the cargo by the fire and water. The cause of the evident is unknown. Very heavy repairs are being effected to. the Frenoh despatch schooner Caledonienne, by Mr. J. Cuthbcrt. She has been stripped, and after beta? supplied with & new false keel aBd part of main keel, will be caulked throughout and re-coppered. Some of her planking that has been Xonnd defective will he alee renewed. The Gazelle, from Molucka (a small port near Nelson), arrived last evening, briuging a cargo of potatoes. Bhe sailed on the 8tb instant, and had very fine weather up to Saturday l&su; when she fell in, when off Wolloogong, with the late westerly gale. The new centreboard ketch, built by Meters Hayes and 6he&, in Woolloomooloo Bay, was launched last evening, at 8 o'clock, cihe has been bnllt to the order of Mr. Gittins, of this city, and is intended for the timber trade. As a faithfully- built craft, few can excel her ; the frame is of hardwood, and the planting of kauri pine— and, for model and finish, refleota great credit on the builders. 8be was named the White Cloud. Her dimensions are 56 feet keel, 16 feet 6 inches beam, 5 feet 6 inches depth of hold, and is expected to carry 60 tons on a draught of 4 feet 6 inches. . The German barque biwaarrived on 20th instant, from Bao Fran cisco, after a fair passage of58 days. Bhe brings a cargo of flour to the consignment of Messrs. Dangar, Danger, and Co., and reports the Faraway as the only vessel loading for Australia. The weather during the passage has bees very floe, until making this coast, and of course she has experienced the fall force of the late westerly gale. The Biwa tailed from 6an Francisco early in the mornl£gofthe28rd July, her latest date from that port being the 22od, files np to which date have been eourteously furnished us by her commander. H.M.6. Blanche left yesterday afternoon, bound to Wellington. She towed the New Zealand Government surveying schooner Rdlth dear of the Heads, and then proceeded on her voyage. On Tuesday evening, after the committee meeting nf the Prince Alfred Yacht Club, at Punch*s Hotel, King- street, a match was made by the owners of the Ixion, CUo, and Bronze wing to race on fi&turday;, the 27th November, tor a sweepstake of £20 each. The course will be from the red buoy off Fort Hecquarie, round the lightship and Bow and Pigs, back round a boat moored off Fort Macquarie, thence round 8hark Bland* and hack to the starting point. The Ixion has already been half-decked and fitted with a counter, and the Clio and Bronze wing will at onoe be taken up for the purpose of receiving a similar transformation. The Ixion will be sailed by the well known amateur, Mr. J. Graham ; the Broneewing by Mr, G. Ellis* and the Clio by her builders* the Messrs. Langford. A deposit of £5 aside has been made; The Margaret Falconer, from Newcastle dth instant, put into port yesterday in a leaky condition. Bhe sailed from Newcastle with a Cargo of coals bound for San Francisco, but fell in with the same heavy gale that disabled the Agra on the 7th instant. As the vessel strained .heavily, and made seven inches of water per hour* Captain JBeott deemed it prudent to bear np for Bydney. The following vessels were loading at Adelaide for Sydney on the I4th instant : Lady Franklin, City of 8t. Asaph* and William Tomer, When the cutter Wave left the Biver Loven, on Wednesday* the schooner Lismore was loading with potatoes for Sydney. Toe Leonidas was to take in a quantity of potatoes and finish loading at Emu Bay* for the same place.— Lawiceston JEzaminer. 8ep tenter U.

Caption Davie reports having had nothing hat hard galea and tempestuous weather eince leaving Sydney harbour, four weeks ago- In fact, the weather had been suoh that the boats had been lashed to the davite ever eince leaving port. Mo whalee had teen eigbted, nor doee Captain Davie report any vessels. — JBotart Totm Mercury, September 11. By the cutter Thames, from Barnes's Bay yesterday morning, -we had the pleasure of again receiving satisfactory intelligence of one of our whaling fleet. The master of the Thames reported that the whaling barque Emily Downing was at anchor tinder the 'Shepherds' as he paseed np the river on Saturday, trying out s whale. The master of the Thames saw Mr. Bleach, the pilot, who had teen on board the Emily Dawning, and he said that Captain Copping reported his catch as seventy tuns, and allblaeaaks VeingfoU he shonld clean ehip and oome to town. Bhe Balled from thia port on the 28th November lest year, and wee flret reported in January of the present year with 6 tans of sperm oil. A leng period of five or six months ensued without ' any word being heard of her, when aha was reported next In the beginning of this month with 68 tons or sperm. Bhe must, con sequently. have secured a very large whale, er two small ones, einoe her last report. The Emily Downing has, therefore, mide a meet excellent cruise of nine and a half months for all can- . cemed, and the general trade of the port and town will receive their eaare ef the benefits of the voyage.— Boiart Town Mercury, Beptsmber 16. The following telegrams from Hohsrt Town, dsted 11th end 13th September appear U last week's Auctralacian .-—The Bydney whaling barqne, Forward, out four vrecka, has put Into Spring River through stress of weather. The Emily Downing hae arrived from ajune months' cruise, with 70 tune sperm oil. The Colonist sailed from Mew Caledonia on the 13th instant. She reports the schooner Hannah Broomfield as bring in port, and bound for Lyttelton. The French war aohooner Quelle wtTtil from Sydney on the 49th tottfit, ftit Colonist had ttkboieraife 1Mb tobst 63 the 19th Instant*' and since that date hae had very heavy gales from W.8.W., daring which time Bhe was hove to, and drifted from abreast of Fort Stephen! to Wollongong; The smart whaling aohooner Zephyr came into port yesterlay after an unfortunate cruise olrnther less than throe monthn. The Zephyr came into port some time in the early pert af Jane, end discharged the 6)4 tuns of sperm oil she then had on board, end sailed again on the 18th Jnne. On the 3rd Angnet sperm whales were sighted, and the boats wets at ence lowered; the cap tain soon got fknt, and Mr. Edmonds, the chief effleer,also isc eeeding in getting fast. The whale Soon spouted blood, but worked awkwardly, and auddenly dipping, came op under th. mate's boat open monthed, and bit fire planks each side of the keel out of the boat, tearing the heat open from stern to stem, taking away portion of the garbosrd streak and keel. 'Have all' wu now the cry, and the captain's teat was at ones cut looes, end the hands of the mate's boat picked np. In the simple lin gnage as entered in the leg-book, 'No one was bnrt,' think God,' and the wreck and oars bring towed alongside theshlp, the captain again went in ehaae, but without seeing anything mere of the whale, whioh had two Irons in him and s quantity of lino attached. As the whale had been well lanced, he no doubt soon died.

Three passengers gave evidence ' to (he effect that they had not been snpplied with the quantity of flour, raisins, limcjuioe, sugar; oatmeal, vinegar, and water - specified in their contract flokets: that they had been sirred with bad meat, which they hid to throw overboard. In respact to the water, it was explained by the captain, purser, end ' a passenger, that on one day only the water was re duced to one quart, because the condenser had broken down, and throughout the remainder of the passage, for nearly ,two months, about a pint abort of the fun allowance was supplied, the reduction bring mads in order to provide sufficient for the voyage in case of the condenser again breaking down or . bkcoming uselesa. The complaints respecting the short supply of provisions appeared to arise from theuahlllty of the passengers to understand the.eystem of substituting one article for another, which is allowed by the Act. It wu denied that there was any deficiency in'the supply et Umejuioe, and that the tqeat referred te waa unfit for use, although it wu acknowledged that it was not so good as what had been previously and was subsequently .supplied, - The board of inquiry will report the reaolt of. their .

This favourite little veesri has been trading in Gippe Land waters for the last five years, and has been remarkable for the regularity of her trips and general good luck. 8be entered the lakes at half past 4 p m. on Monday, Cth September, without touching the bar; but after getting inside she got to a sandbank, and the cap tain immediately threw out an anchor to pull her off. In the meantime the tide was running strong, aed had the effect (fast ened as the vessel was by a warp) of swinging her right round to another sandbank. The captain then rut out a second anchor, and got the vessel into deep water, and was to all appearance clearing. Having occasion to go down into the cabin, the captain stepped into eighteen inches of water. This was the flret intl mavlun be bed of any accident having happened. All hands at once took to the pumps* bat the water gained so rapidly that they had to go ashore in the boat, only having time to secure a few personal effects from the wreck. The vessel went down at about ten or eleven o'clock. Her deck is four feet under water. If she continues to sink into the eosd, the probabilities of her being raised tgaln are very .remote.

Avoca, which was due in the bay on Saturday from Sydney, did not put in an appearance until yesteiday afternoon at 1 o'clock, just one hour berore her stated time for leaving Melbourne for Galle. It was known by tele gram, from Bydney that she had encountered unusually severe advene weather after leaving, and her late arrival therefore did not cause any uocasiness. The Avoca was Again under way for King George's Sound a few minutes after 4 o'oloek, or very little more than three hours after her arrival from Sydney. Of the passage from thence she reports having cleared the Sydney Heads at a quarter to 10 a.m. ou the 9th instant, and for thirty-six hours after leaving she had to battle against a heavy southerly gale and a tremendous head sea. The force of the gale may In some measure be estimated from the fact that the Avoca, notwithstanding her great steam power, had only got a distance of some ninety miles daring the flret twenty-four hours of the passage. Gabo Island was passed at a quarter-past six a.m. on the Uth, and Wilson's Promontory about half an hour after midnight, Port Phillip Heads being entered at ten &.m. yesterday. Fine weather was experienced after passing Cape Howe. The Avoca cleared out with over 111,000 onnces of gold, and £42,860 in specie. A large comber of visiters was on board prior to her soiling.
