It is the only cure known. Surgical' operations never cure, because the disi ease tuberculosis is a constitutional one. All forms of tuberculosis have been absolutely cured by Mr. Olson's remedy. Pulmonary, Hip, Neck, Foot, Arm, Leg. and Spinal Tuberculosis have aid to yield; Kidneys, Peritoneum, Bladder, Fistula ia Anus, Tuberculosis of the Ovaries, and also that most disfiguring ani distressing face of tubercu- losis-"Lupus"-together with scalp tuberculosis; in fact, aU tubercular swellings or ulcers, no muter what part of the bojy they occur, have been absolutely and permanently cured. The mode of Sale of the Medicine has now been al- tered, and is being sold with full directions as to diet, ic. at a very nominal cost per month's supply. It must not, however, be ex- pected that a disease like tuberculosis can bo cured in a few months, the time generally taken is from 9 montiis to, two years. Obtainable onlv from Mr».
