ROE. Perth, 9th Octr., 1879. -X Y- G-EN- :S-t-I FE Although the modern Materia Medics in cludes many valuable remedies, it is a mat ter of certainty that in all cases where the animal vitality is failing, Phosphorus is decidedly superior-to every-other remedy at present known. It will.work effects such as nothing else will produce, and it possesses the great advantage of not causing, when its use is relinquished, the slightest reaction or depression. Until the introduction of DR. BRIGHT'S Phosphodyne, Phosphorus was but seldom prescribed as a Medicine, owing to the diffl culty in so preparing it that its action could be kept under perfect control. It had" been used in Almond and Olive Oils, in Sulphuric Ether, in rectified Alcohol, in Chloroform, and in several other substances ; but how ever valuable it has been found in all the hitherto known methods of its preparation, eertain irregular results have been experi enced, which have led Physicians to neglect it for general purposes, and to employ it only in extreme cases. But in the form of Dr. Bright's Phosephodyne,- its---invaluable action on the human system is realized with out any of those drawbacks which previous modes of administration have invariably produced. CAUTION.-PHOSPHORUS is some times sold in the form of Pills andLozenges; it should be generally known that every form where solid particles of Phosphorus are in combination is highly dangerous. It is therefore necessary that the public should be cautioned against the use of any pre paration of Phosphorus not perfectly sol uble in water. Protectedby Royal Letters Patent Dated October 11th, 1859. \--UNDER ODISTINUIOIIED (OZONIC OXYGEN.) The New C'urative Agent, and only Reliable Remedy for Nervous and Liver Complaints, and all Functional Derangements. The remarkable efficacy of Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne is now well known, and is acknowledged by the first medical men in Europe, by whom it is recommended as the most efficacious medicine hitherto discovered for Weak and Shattered Constitutions, Nervous Debility, Aversion or Incapacity for Study, Trembling of the Limbs, Indiges tion, Female Complaints, Flatulence, Liver Complaints, Shbrtnesse of Breath, Drowsi ness, Pains in the Head, Pimples, Impover ished Blood, and all diseases forwhich iron mercury, iodide of potass, &c.;, are given in various forms, often to the destruction of the patieat's health. I I lhe beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are frequently shown from the first day of its administration, by. a remarkable increase of nervous power, with ---feeling of-vigou and comfort, entirely overcoming that dull inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience in their actions. DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE is Sold'by all Chemists and Medicine Vendors throughout the Globe, in cases at 10s. Gd., orin Family Cases, containing one dozen 10s. 6d. cases, at £5. 1DR. BRIGHT'S PEOSPHODIYNE IS PATRONISED BY THE Aristocracy and the Elite, Extensively used in the ARMY AND NAVY AND Highly recommended BY THE LEADING MEDICAL Practitioners. The high estimation in which Phosphor us is held, is unquestionably due to its administration in the form of Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne. Its extraordinary success has induced unscrupulous competition and worthless ime ations. THEREFORE, ASK FOR DR.
