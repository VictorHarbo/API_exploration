SUMMARY FOR ENGLAND. THE COLONY OF VICTORIA. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's steamer Benares will sail early to-morrow morning for Suez, with the mails for Europe and the East. The mails of last month were despatched hence,in the Company's steamer Columbian, on the morning of the 19th of May, but owing to a break- down in the machinery of this unlucky vessel, after the Adelaide mails had been shipped at Nepean Bay, they were detained at Adelaide until the 1st instant, while the necessary repairs were being effected. No surprise was expressed here at the accident. The Columbian has earned an unenviable name in the Australian waters. Her voyages have been uni- formly irregular and uncertain, and a very strong feeling of dis- satisfaction has been evoked by the fact of her retention in a service for which she is manifestly unfitted. As it is not impossible that the present mail may reach England at the same time as that despatched by the Columbian, we quote our previous statement :-" The Columbian has earned a reputation of a very unfavorable character. With one single exception, her voyages havo been prolonged ¡and unsatisfactory. In De- cember, 1857, the Melboune Chamber of Commerce protested against the em- ployment of this vessel under the con- tract with the European and Aus- tralian Mail Steamship Company, and since then , she has added to her notoriety for the length of time she hag invariably kept the colonists wait- ing for the mails." The punctual arrival on the 7th inst. of the Northam with the English April mails has done something towards re- assuring the Australian colonists that regularity and reliability aro not im- possibilities in conjunction with the Australian Postal Service. A very strong desire still prevails to become acquainted with the terms of the contract with the Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation Company It seems to be generally understood that important modifications in the terms as set forth in the form of tender lime been secured by the company, and the Australian colonists are naturally anxious, as parties to the contract, to be informed of the nature and extent of these modifications With these remarks, we resume our monthly history of the progress of the colony of Victoria POLITICAL The Parliament of Victoria, has been prorogued from the 7th inst, to which day it had previously stood prorogue I, until Tuesdtay, tho 12th of Inly In this sontonee is comprised all tlio political news of the past month Tho general elections will take place towards tho end of the ensuing month, but as yet not a single candidate has an nounced himself THE CHINESE In the last session of Parliament an Act was passed imposing an annual residence tax of 4/ per head upon the Chinese population of this colony, the object being partly to restrict the immigration of these Asiatics within moderate limits, and partly to defray the cost of maintain inga staff of officers charged with the duty of protecting these people, and of supervising the formation and arrangement of their camps, with a view to the preservation of public decency and the public health. Last month the proper autho rities commenced collecting the first quarterly instalment of the tax, and wherever the Chinese were massed together in great numbers- as in the mining districts of Sandhurst and Castlemaine a firm resistance was offered to the demands, of the tax gatherer, and it soon became evident that this was the result of a preconcerted plan, and of a widely spread organisation at Castlemaine about 1,000 Chinamen assembled and marched in procession, with a great display of banners, to the office of the Warden, to whom they presented memorial, setting forth that the residence tax was harsh and op pressive, and not consonant with the terms of the treaty recently concluded between the Go verntment of Her Britannic Majesty and that of China; and that the memorialists were willing to pay 2/ per annum The Warden replied that he would transmit the remonstrance to the Exe utile, and while complimenting the memorialists on their peaceable conduct, warned them against committing any breach of the Law . Th assem hlage then begun to disperse, but an interpreter named Jamies A Loy, who scorns to have incurred the animosity of his countrymen, was rushed at, apparently with a hostile purpose, but was res eucd by the police. Meanwhile the proceedings were watched with considerable interest by the European diggers, and a local paper adds that any manifestation of a disposition to resort to physical force by the Chinese, would have been followed up by a general melee, as the Europeans would have promptly availed themselves of a pretext to attack the Asiatics with bludgeons. For some days after this demonstration, the Chinese suspended all intercourse with the European population - would neither buy from nor sell to them, and even refrained from bestowing their patronage upon the public conveyances of the district, of which they had previously been the chief supporters. In and around Sandhurst the movement assumed a similarly constitutional character The Chinese assembled from th surrounding districts to the number of about 4,000, and hoist- ing a flag upon which was inscribed, in Chinese characters, "Ten Bendigo meeting against the new tax, proceeded to hold a public meeting after the british fashion, the chief speaker on the occasion being a Chinese patriarch, with a gray head, gold buttons on his dress, and finger-nails, an inch and upwards in length. A petition was prepared and adopted, and a determination ex- pressed to resist the tax by every lawful means, as unjust and oppressive. At Beechworth the resistance to the impost exhibited itself in a more menacing form. Pla- cards were circulated, warning the Chinese against paying the tax, and threatening punishment to those who did. The issue of these documents, which were printed in Chinese characters, occa- sioned great excitement among the Asiatics, who assembled to the number of several hundreds, and as a police sergeant apprehended a Chinaman who was engaged in distributing these inflamma- tory appeals, a rescue was attempted, and the sergeant assailed with a volloy of stones and other missiles. A strong body of police was de- tached to his aid, the prisoner secured, and the Chinainon repulsed. Subsequently a score or two were incarcerated for refusing to pay the tax. A few days afterwords a deputation, consisting of three Chinese merchants, a Chinese interpreter, and two British gentlemen, waited upon the Chief Secretary, for the purpose of presenting him with memorial from the Chinese merchants resident in Melbourne, praying that they might be ex- empted from the operation of the tax, inasmuch as they occasioned no expense to the Government for protectors, interpreters, and headmen, as the Chinese miners on the gold-fields did. Mr. O'Shanassy, in reply, reminded the memorialists that the repeal of the -impost rested with Parliament, and stated that in less than five years the Chinese had exported from this colony gold to the valuo of £2,000,000 sterling, while the amount received for licences during 1857 was 21,785l. ; in 1858, 26,980l. ; and during the first quarter of 1850, 6,092l. The sums received under the Chinese Passengers Act, were, in 1855, £90. ; in 1856, £9,050. ; in 1857, £4,990. ; in 1858, 9,452/l ; and to the 20th May, £3,210., giving a total of £27,302. The cost of the Chinese Protectorate during 1858 was £9,318. 8s., and the probable cost during the current year would be £10,275. The amount paid by the Chinese, therefore, was very small compared with tho pro- tection they enjoyed ; and when the £8,000. paid for compensation to those who suffered in the Buckland riots was considered, no advantage whatever had been gained by the Government ; and there was no saying how soon there might be a repetition of these disturbances, either in Melbourne or elsewhere, in consequence of which tho Government might be again called upon for compensation. It transpired in the course of the interview that, although the Chinese population in the colony numbered 45,000, only 108 protection tickets had been issued ; and the Chief Secretory produced a placard which, upon being translated by tho Chinese interpreter who was present, proved to be a proclamation from a united confederacy of the Chinese at the Ovens, Sandhurst, and Castlemaine, calling upon all Chinese diggers to cease work, and all storekeepers to close their places of business, and have no dealings with Europeans, they were to pay no tax of any kind, and if any attempt was made to enforce it by the police, the gong was to be beaten in the camp, and the Chinese assemble and follow the officers and their prisoner to the Government camp, and there hold a public meeting A reward was offered to any person giving information of any tax being paid, and a fine of £5 was to be I'm posed for every offence of this nature. Mr O'Shanassy also said that another proclamation had offered a reward of £200 to any one who would kill a certain officer of the Government. On the day following the Chief Secretary re- ceived a deputation presenting the petition agreed to at Sandhurst, to whom he intimated that he was not prepared to advise, or to take the responsibility of staying tho operation of the law. At a late period of the same week, about 70 of the Chinese resident in Melbourne marched up in procession to the Treasury and paid the tax Among the Chinese in the Ballaarat district, very little excitement appears to have occurred, and although the impost was not leas obnoxious to the Asiatics, it was submitted to with a better grace than elsewhere. On the Bendigo gold field, however, before the effervescence of public feeling on this sub ject had had time to subside, the antipathy en tertained towards the Chinese by a considerable portion of the European diggers was aroused into violent action by an outrage perpetrated by three Chinamen upon a storekeeper and his wife, named M'Elligott, residing at Iron bark. The assassins, it seems, entered the store about 10 o'clock at night to buy some goods, and on their leaving, M'Elligott closed the door, and had turned round to return, his back being thus towards the door, when he was struck a violent blow on the head by one of the Chinese with a sword, which inflicted a frightful wound on the skull. On hearing his cries, his wife ran to his assistance, but immediately received a severe cut on the head. The three villains then set again on the husband, cutting and hacking him about frightfully. His elbow joint was laid open, and the wrist bared to the bones for two inches in length, and the arteries severed. The unfortunate man put up his hand to save his head, and the murderous weapon descending between the fingers, split the hand up to the wrist M'Elligott lingered for a few days and then died; but his wife is in a fair way of recovery. This tragical event has power fully exasperated the minds of the European population of the district against the Chinese, and some of the latter have ben assaulted with out provocation by the former The Chinese appear to be divided among them selves, and a conflict between several hundreds who had assembled with hostile intentions at the Long Gully Camp, Sandhurst, on the 30th ult , was only prevented by the interposition of the police. According to a local paper, the cause of dispute was the installation of a new Joss house keeper, a " third district" man the one rejected being from the " fourth district " This change was taken as a deadly insult by the supporters of the latter, who instantly threatened annihilation, not only to the usurper but to the sacred build nig itself. It is added that, had not the police so opportunely arrived, a sanguinary conflict would inevitably have ensued. Matters appear to be subsiding into something like quietude among the Chinese recusants , and it is probable that the majority of them, finding then remonstrances ineffectual will pay the first instalment of the residence tax and appeal to the now Parliament to reduce the amount of the impost. THE GOLD FIELDS For a long time the miners had to wish in vain for water, and they have now too much. Rain has fallen heavily at different times during the last six weeks, filling all the creeks and reservoirs to overflowing, and causing much loss as well as benefit. Although the heaviest rains have been partial - and very heavy they have been in some districts, no part of the country is now without an abundant supply. With plenty of water, many places can be worked with profit at which nothing can be done for months together after this fails , and the first consequence of the rain was the better distribution of the population through the gold fields, many miners leaving the great rushes, where they were idly trusting to the chapter of accidents, and betaking themselves to familiar localities, known to con tain gold but only available as winter diggings. The puddling mills are now all at full work again, as are the crushing machines, many of the latter working night and day to clear away the accumulations of quartz and cement col acted during, the last few months, when several of the engines had to be stopped altogether, or only set in motion occasionally. This renewed activity has made money more plentiful on the gold fields, and has increased the escorts but not to the extent anticipated from the accumulation of wash dirt at Back Creek-the scene of the monster rush - at the Indigo, and elsewhere. The gold has now been realised from most of these, but the yield has fallen far short of what was expected-at least, if this is, to be judged of from the escort returns. Such is the general opinion among the miners, and there is no reason to suppose that gold is now hoarded, for there has lately been a brisk demand at a price higher than ordinary It always has happened that tho expectations engendered by unusual discoveries on the gold fields have ended in dis appointment to the majority. During tho lost few weeTts no remarkable dis covaries have been made. Movements there have been of greater or less importance, but none with more than local interest. Good patches of ground have ben opened up here and there, mostly of limited extent. Deep sinking is becoming more general, leads being now worked at depths varying between 100 and 300 feet, on fields where only shallow mining or surfacing was thought of for years after their first occupation. Surfacing on a large scale will also be carried on to a much greater extent than ever this winter. Many parties content lost year with horse-power have now steam engines- and ma chinery of proportionate and second capacity. Where gold is found in small quantities all through the earth, from the surface to what, in diggers par lance, is called the bottom, the plan is to wash away everything to the bedrock, leaving this bare, except where covered with stones, gravel, trunks of trees, and other insoluble substances and so many of the gullies and flats, famous in the early days of mining, and worked by fits and starts ever since, will he treated this winter. This final working will probably be much to the benefit of the miners ; but it will also much increase the sludge nuisance, and render still more urgent the necessity for some effectual plan on each of the gold-fields for the removal of the great outflow of mud from such a number of machines, each passing through it hundreds of loads of earth every day. The sludge has already destroyed much valuable pro- perty, and even caused the loss of life, and its volume this winter will be greater than ever. No enormous cake of amalgamated gold has been produced since the date of our last Summary, but cakes of moderate size have increased in number. The total yield of gold from the reefs is now very great and will be constantly increasing as additional machinery is erected, for the dis- covery of new reefs is a matter of daily occur- rence. The quartz raised now is much in excess of the crushing power, especially in the outlying districts, where steam-engines are yet but few in number. Even nearer to head-quarters, crushing power is not supplied as fast as it is required, plentiful as capital is in Melbourno. The Reedy Creek reefs, only 40 miles from town, have now been opened some time, are very numerous, and as for as they have been tried, are enormously rich ; yet a few days since there was, and we be lieve we might say there still is, only one small machine to crush the hundreds or tons of quartz already raised. And to prove that those are worthy of more consideration from capitalists than they have received, we need only mention a few of the yields obtained within the last week or two. Thus, 9 tons out of one claim gave 310½oz., or 34½¿oz, to the ton ; another lot of 5 tons gave 36oz.16dwt. to the ton ; and a third lot of 5 tons gave 207oz., or 41oz, 8dwt. to the ton- the largest yield ob- tained up to that time. The total yield from 17 tons from the one claim, crushed within four days, was 696oz. ; and ten times tho quantity might as well hove been crushed in the same space of time if the power had been there, for the quartz was lying by the mill. This group of reefs, discovered some months since, and from which only a few tons of quartz have yet been crushed, offers an instance of the wealth yet un- developed in Victoria, and of the slowness with which we avail ourselves of the advantages we so manifestly possess. AGRICULTURE The publication of the agricultural statistics foe the year ending on the 31st of March last has afforded an opportunity of judging with accuracy of the changes that have taken place during that period. The abstract now prepaired is but an approximate return, compiled m haste from the collectors' papers as they have been sent min, and without their being checked, still the totals are not likely to vary much, and those now given may be considered as sufficiently accurate for general purposes The past season has been most un favourable to the farmers, and the correctness of the prevalent opinion that the crops were much below the usual avenge is fully borne out by the figures before us. The breadth of land under wheat last year was also less than the extent sown with this grain in the year previous by 9,525 acres, and in the total produce there was a decrease of 257,434 bushels, the average yield having been scarcely 20 bushels to the acre, or less than that of the year before by more than three bushels. Amongst the cereals the great increase has been in oats, the quantity of land sown having been nearly doubled in the one season, and the total produco increased by 881,355 bushels An unfortunate year was chosen for extending so much the cultivation of this grain, for never before were the import ations so large. The relative value between oats and wheat has thus been altered from what it was so long, and the former grain has been fall ing in price, while wheat has risen. Barley is grown to such a limited extent, in comparison with the other species of grain, that a falling off min the yield is of but minor importance to the public, except in so far as it may tend to prevent the home production of the malt, and all the pre pirations there from, now so largely imported and consumed among us. Only 112 acres less than in the previous year were sown with barley, but the total yeild was reduced by as much as 42,020 bushels. This crop has never been a favourite wlth farmers here, from the uncertainty attending the growth of the varieties moat valuable to the maltster, and the experience of this j car will not t«nd to icmovo the bad feeling towards it Of ill the cere ils, this is tho most hablo to injury fiom ¿rub, md catcipillais of different kinds, and theso w oro more numerous last summer than for sovcial ¿cars past, in somo districts destrojmg entile fields of barley m a veiy few dajs, and thus bj then depredations reducing the gcncol ai ci agc yield of the wliolo colony to the low into of 21 \ bushels to tho acre Of mai/c, w Inch is not iñuch cultii i'ed ns yet, theie has beon a small mcicisc-3 110 bushels Hie hay crop has been deficient, the total Jiold being 2)198 tons less thin the quantity snved the j car before, although ')')J7 acres mole weio subjected to the scythe llio only lcmoik ablo increase m any ai ticlo of human food w as in potatoes, and these ai o unusually fine this ye ir i'ho total quantity grow n has beon moi o than doubled, although considerably lesa than one third moro land was planted with tin» root Never befoio, probibly, sinco thop'ou_hw is first introduced did so much ram fall (hu mg summer, and the effect of tins is shown in the greater j mid of potatoes Turnips, mangolds, and beet are grown hore, but to such a comparotivciv, model ite extent that tho alterations ana changes m regard to thoso el ops scarcely call for special rcmaik Although tho entire quantity of lund under permanent pasture and fodder crops is only 7,284 acres as j ct, these figures show a lor0o liicrctiso during tho twelvemonth, and will bo constantly added to, foi ni my of tile foi mers ai o turning then attention moro and moro each youl to btock finding that, in some ports of the.couutij, meit ind clan i pioduco are moio profitable to íoiso than gi am Among the miscellaneous ciops specified m the return, wo lind a column foi vines, showing that the numboi of acres so planted has mere iscd from 101 to 530 Much of the gre itoi part of the pioduco of oui v nicy uds is still Hold ns flint, but 1,88.) gallons of wmo and 132 "liions of blandy wcio mado this list \car As may bo supposed fiom the lccjuircments of the diffeicnt ports of the countiy, cultivation lins extended altogether in the direction of tho gold fields In tho county of Bourke there has boon an actual dccrenso ni tho quantity of land under cultivation, to the extent of 3,000 acres In Grant there has been an increase, hut in tho two counties togethei theio was a deficiency m tho number of acies mulei who it of noailj li,000 acics os compared with the j car before In one of the minnel count es, laluot, the quantity of land undci the plough wies ncaily doubled, the inercaso in the ono j cor being ne nly 18,000 nu es Somo of tho othci counties mid nil nul distiiets have m ide const eleiablo piogrchs m ngnetiltuio, but none so gi cat as this Iniespcctto the yield of gram theio li is beena falling off, still, avhon wo compuo oui avenges with those of tho neighboring colony of bouth Austiaha wo havo no leeson to coinplun There tho yield of illicit foi tho post season w is bhovvn ba the official lcturns to li ive bcenb tv con 11 and 12 bushels to the aeio, while ours vins close upon 20 Bailey is little (,iown by oin neighbors, ns tho cluniito of a great put of tint colony is unfavorable, io no niiy stipposo the aield to bo much less than our OH ti , and oats av ith us ^av o an average of £l\ bushels to tho aero , vv hilo in South Austi alni this was only l8 In potatoes also wo hail the oil vantage by more thun a ton to the acre It has been often taid that agi icultur ti produce cannot bo raised BO cheaply hero ns in South Austi ibu, but the annual returns vv ould go far to pi ov o the conti uy With the yield of all the prmcmil ei ops, so much m their f na or, ns vs oil as asiamg ni tho cost of eairingo, surely our fanners cm supply their own min leets with moie profit than can by any possibility accrue to the grow crs of the «maller ci ops ata distance of 500 miles nway A\ c are now in tho midst of tho ploughing bcoson, anti a considerable breadth of lanel has been olicady Bown Tho ram was lato in coming, but within the last week an abundance has fallen, and there is every indication of tho winter beni), a wet one Scarcely a week passes without a ti tal of skill between the ploughmen near town, though the matches in tho intonoi aro of moro frequent lccurionco, as this is a part of their bubtucss which oven the youngest society can manage Some of tlio prm cipnl prizes lim o been taken this year already with ploughs of colonial make.

LABOR. The labor market is still depressed ; but, although we are far advanced in winter, and things generally are so dull, there is nothing approaching to destitution now amongst the un- employed. All able-bodied men who require it can obtain work without difficulty on the railways or macadamised roods throughout the country. Few of the contractors are full-handed, and where they are, there are frequent changes, for agricul- tural laborers and men fitted for other employ- ment only work on the roads until they have an opportunity of getting into positions more like what they were previously accustomed to. Besides a constant demand for the railways, there is much road-making and repairing just now, so that men are rather in request, at the contractors' rate of pay, and the arrivals have not beon so numerous of late. Still many men are idling about town, and they complain, of a difficulty in finding em- ployment ; but town is not the place for those who really want work, and are inclined to accept moderate wages. Farmers and other persons up the country beldom think of coming to town for servants, knowing that they will find plenty to choose from in the nearest contractor's party, and that there, most probably, will be found a better and more useful class of men than are to be met with at the agents' offices in town. The abundance of water on the gold- fields is also creating on increased demand for hired labor, and wages for men of the stamp required are likely to rise before long. The number of miners without means, and unable to earn a living by working on their own account, is always greater in the summer than the winter, and it is in the latter season that the large parties and companies require most insistance. With the greater quantity of machi- nery used each season there is a want of more hands and less need for skill and experionce in mining. Altogether the market for what we may call rough labor is in a healthy and promising condition, although the scale of remuneration is rather low. Mechanics and tradesmen have a difficulty in finding employment, and many of each class are forced to remain idle or betake themselves to other work. Nor can domestic servants readily obtain engagements unless really fitted for their duties, and with good recommen- dations from their last employers. AMUSEMENTS. Undoubtedly the subject which has occupied public attention with reference to theatrical mat- ters during the past month is the disruption of that hitherto seemingly close bond of friendship which had existed between Mr. G. V. Brooke, the present lessee of the Theatre Royal, and the Honorable George Coppin, its former master. The latter gentleman some short timo ago took a serious faroavell of tho stage, both in tho capacity of manager and actor; and Mr. Brooke, upon assuming tho reins of government at our principal dramatic institution, believed himself at least secure from opposition at tho hands of his former associate lu tho comfort- able assurance of this immunity, ho consigned the conduct of his theatre to tho gentleman avho had for somo time noted as general superintendent of its internal working, mid himself undertook a tour this island and the neighbouring colonies. His return was brought about sooner than he hod anticipated, mid on finding himself again in Melbourne ho proved tho truth of what he had already learnt by report, that tho Olympic Theatre, long ago supposed to bo permanently disused for any pur- pose but that of a dancing-saloon, was about being opened in opposition to him, under the os- tensible management of Mr. P. Youngo, avho, however, was avell known to be little moro than on instrument in tho hands of a much more shrewd individual than himself. Some minor de- fections in the company of the Theatre Royal had taken place; and that establishment was closed for a few clays, its reopening being specialised by an address, in which the im trustworthineBs of some of Mr. Brooke's employés was rofcrrod to, though not directly, yet nono tho less significantly. An attempt was mudo to rebut these very grave imputotions, but the general impression has been that tho defonco ovas a failure.

High prices have been given on the gold fields by some of the bank agents, and reports of a coming use in the rate of exchange been induced some holders to keep out of the market. Prices are quoted at Melbourne as follow -For Living stone and Goulburn River, 67s 6d to 72s , Omeo, 68s to 71s Od , Pleasant Creek, 74s 3d to 70s 3d , Boggy Creek, Sandhurst, Castle maine, and Jim Crow, 73s 6d to 70s 6d , Maryborough, Dunolly, Avoca, Amherst, Fiery Creek, and Ararat 75s 6d to 77s 3d ; Ovens and Yackandandah, 76s 6d to 78s 6d , Bal- laarat, 78s to 79s per ounce. Those rices are estimated on the basis of £3 14s 6d per ounce for standard, or, including export duty, £3 17s per ounce Tho escorts for the current week will be some thing above the avenge, as we learn from the local papers that the deposits at the local gold offices have been heavy. The escorts for last week brought down a total of 44,442oz. The weekly average of the first quarter of the year was 41,982oz., and of the four quarters of 1858, 44,841 oz. Last week's return will therefore bear comparison with both these aver ages. Computing last week's yield of the gold- fields separately with that of the corresponding week of last year, the total of which was 41,397 oz , a marked falling off is observable in the returns from Castlemaine, Ballaarat, and Beech worth, while there is an increase in those from all the other old established mining districts. The quantities received from the Back Creek have been very considerable Name of Gold-field. 1859. 1853. Castlemaine Sandhurst Heathcote Rushworth Maryborough .. Amherst .

The copious rains which have fallen during the past four weeks have supplied all the gold-fields abundantly with water, and have set the miners to work passing the poorer descriptions of auri- ferous earth through the puddling- machines. In several instances the floods have been excessive, and have caused much loss and damage. In the following table the quantities brought by escort from all the gold- fields are given for 13 weeks.

By tho ond of tho current month, at leastSO tons of tho precious metal will have boen shipped. As regards tho futuro, the formation of companies on sound principles, nnd with officient ona- practical managers, will do much for tlio gold-fields. Such associations aro al ready beiiigiiwtiluted on the oldcrgold- lields, anil tho shares havo boon taken up ciiiofly, by local mon for investments. Tlio shares of tho few companies in operation^ havo risen rapidly in value, from tho actual improvement in tlio valuo of the proportion. Outsido speculators havo not toiic'heil these securities to any oxtent, and the trade carried on in them at present is of tho most legitimate character. Tho monoy markot has not been altogether quiet lately. " lu our last Summary wo reported two important changes,-the raising of exchange on England to lf¡ per cent, premium for 00 days' sight, and the reduction in the rato of dis- count on threo months' bills to 7 per cent. Sinco then an attempt lias boon mado in Sydney to raise tho rate of exchange to 'Z\ nor cent, premium for' CO days', but this rise not having boen called for by tho _ circumstances of the times, could not bo maintained, and lins been , practically aban- doned. The current rotes ot tho Melbourne banks are:-On England li premium for 00 days" sight for largo amounts, and'2i por cent, premium for 30 days' sight for bills under £50. Freight on gold hy sailing-vessels is from 2d. to 3d. por ounce, deliverable in London ; insurance, IA per cent. Hy the overland route the freight to tho Bank of England, including transit duty, is 1 per cent. ; insurance, li por cont. To Mauritius and Iildia, 1 per cent, pre- mium; insurance,'IA por cent. The Blackness in trade usual at this season of tho year has not led- to any diminution in the de- mand for discounts. At the banks tho rates continue at-For bills under 95 days' currency, 7 per cent. ; from 95 lo 125 days', 9 por cont. ; over 125 days' 10 per cent. ; and on overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent. Thero has boen an in- creasing demand for money on mortgago of city and country properties, but tho amount of actual transactions has not been large. Tho quoted rates aro from 10 to 12 per cent, for first-class city securities, with ampio margin ; rond from 12 to 15 per cent, for good country lauds with im- proving prospects. . - Sinco our last summary there has beon very little alteration in the prices of shares and deben- tures, o'general diilness having prevailed from the arrival of the last mail to tho present date, which fact is traceable in tho chief degreo to the avarliko appearance of matters in Europe Hol- bourne and Hobson's Bay Railway shaios, which were in great demand for rcmittanco to London by last mail, and avcro purchased as high as 83, havo receded to 81, and but very little business has -been transacted. A dividend of £3 10s. per share for the half- year ,is,in course of payment, and these securities aro now quoted 77 to 78 ex divi- dend. The Geelong and Melbourne Railway shaics aie in the samo position, tho quoted piico being £20.

This establishment sends its manager to England by this mail steamer, to open a branch in London. Shares aro quoted at from £37_ to £38_. In- surance shores have beon in better odour within the last two weeks,' owing to the nbsenco of lires and tho prospects of good dividends being paid on the half-year's business.

The Melbourne series of Crown Land Sales for tho current month terminated on the 14th inst. Throughout the sales the attendance was numer- ous, ond considerable competition evinced, tho prices obtained being generally satisfactory.

Mr, ¿'Beckett, tho chah man of the meeting, briefly referred to tho applications which had been inado with referoiice to reducing the fares at present charged on tho St. Kilda line, anti expressed his conviction that tho finances of the company would not admit of a re- duction. Ho, however, held out a prospect of somo modification as soon as tho Brighton line Bhoul'l be completed. Mr. S. K. Honty was elected a director in the place of Mr. Griee, re- cently resigned.

The great railway works are being steadily carriea on, and employment has been, afforded to large numbers of the people. Tho portions of tho line opened for traffic aro yielding a weekly average revenue of £1,400, but the expenses of working portions only of tho lino are, as a matter of course, dispro- portionately heavy. Although money is being circulated among all classes of the community by these works, trade has not improved to any appreciable extent. The heavy stocks of some goods, and the check given to the extended credit system by tho attitude assumed by the banks with reference to the discount of long dated paper, has kept country bilyera out of the market, excepting for the supply of pressing wants. On the other hand, importers havo been, firm in resisting all nttenipts_ to lower prices until a perfect standstill was arrived at. In another column wo havo given a detailed review of the markets. Wo may mention that the question of free trado or protection is boing rather frequently dis- cussed at public meotings and in the Press. The» feeling of the country is expressed with tolerable* decision in favor of tho principles of froe-trodc, but it is not improbable that some important fiscal changes will' have to be mado, for the pur- pose of meeting tho immediate demands on tho resources of the co^ny for the interest on th» railway loan. In this event, and in tho present; temper of tho constituencies, it. is probable that recourse will be had to some additional imposts oa tho commerce of the colony.
