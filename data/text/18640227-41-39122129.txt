Captain McDonald reports fine weather throughout, and when otf Cape JervU saw u biPjne which he supposed, from the proximity to the reef, to 1« on shore. On the arrival of the Active in the Gulf, although it was quite calm at the Pilot Stations, yet when otf the North-West Blufl a strong breeze rd wind was blowing, during which she was under ilo-.^ii'-reefed topsails. This' fact accounts for the fall in the meteorological instruments during the previous 12 hours. The force of thi wind was most felt in their immediate vicinity. The Eclaii: sailed for Wallaroo on Thursday, l-ut hail not proceeded far when a leak was dis covered, ami the vessel made so much water that Captain Heath was induced to return to the Port. It will In; necessary to discharge the cargo in order to repair the damage. S.vxitakt Keuui-atioxs.— A ca«e of some im portance to shipmaster* frequenting the Port was heard at the Police Court i m Friday. 1c appeared from the statement of the master, who was in formed against for pa^m1.: the Assistant Health Officer's boat in the -!ulf, thaf on the C'ustom Hnuse officer hoarding; that official stated there was no necessity to stop tin- steamer alongside the health lioat, as he wuui'i allow the vessel pratique. This induced the captain to proceed, especially as there was another steamer astern, and in con Hetiuence he was fined in the lowest penalty. It was a matter fnr astonishment that he proceeded without boarding as he i- reputeil for uniformly courteous behaviour to vessels in the Gulf.
