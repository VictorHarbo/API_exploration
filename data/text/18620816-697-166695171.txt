NOTICE TO MARINERS. ' The Rear- Admiral, commandant of H. M. naval forces in tho East Indies, and inspector of marine, informs navigators that oa Taudjoug-K&lcan;, near Muntokf on the island of lianka, a stand ing wbitc caladioptric lighthouse of the second class haB been put into working order, the light of which is placed on a stone tower fifty-two yards high, and may be seen at a distance of rive German geographical miles. ' The light burns every night from eunsct to sunrise, and is io be Been at sea from all quarters. The tower is white ; its sum mit and the lantern arc painted red. ' On the chart of Strait lianka, by Edcling (edition 1B60), this light ie marked io joi degrees 7 minutes 30 seconds £., and 2 de grees S minutes 6. ' The light serves— 11 1. In coming from the north, to enable the mariner to make in safety for the Strait at li to 2 German geographical miles to tbe west and north of the fralrik Hendrik Socks ; sighting the light, he con safely soil between these rocks and the shore of Banka : also, coming out of the Strait, and wanting to go north, he will be enabled, in sighting the light, to avoid all danger, and may at the same tune pass in safety, provided he use the lead between the Fredrik Ucndrik Hacks and the shore of Sumatra, i. ' The passage between the Kurraug-lladjic aud Taudjong Kalean is by this light made available, ' 3. The light serves as n mark for the passage along the sbnro of Banka from Tandjong-Knlean to Karrang- Brotn Brom on the one, and the Amalia Bank on the other side, whilst one ap proaches in safety the fourth point of Sumatra on sighting the light. And, ' 4. The light of Tandjong-Kalean will be scrricoaWc aa a beacon for ships bour.d to l'ulembang lo make for the river by Bight. 11 The Rcnr-Admiral aforenamed, (Signed) 'Mat,' Tlic bnro.uo Katr, Captain Siicrloek, arrived here last night, and came to inside the north head.

Since that time to the Kth have had a continuation of (jolts of wind from E.K,];, to N.X.E. On the 17ih experienced » tcrriOe storm which lotted in its full' strength for twelve hours. On the 18th, at 10 a.m , 340 milos S.W. of the Kings, while under reefed foresail and maintopsuil, and staysail, two seamen were unfortunately washed overboard from the bowsprit and drowned, all attempts to render Rny assistance to the poor fellotra being utterly impossible.

Mr, Bcott has already nil tlw starboard hydraulics fixed, and several on the port side of the, vessel. He has also hud down at different angloB four anchors. Irrespective of the muin anchor dropped ill tho bay aoiuc lime ago. As Mr. Scott's acquaintance with the locality is extended, be becomes more Bangufnc of success, and since he has been on the spot ho has had opportunities of judging in all descriptions ot weather. One very gratifying circumstance was the fact of the vessel partially floating lost week, and rolling in the bed whicU she had formed in the sand. On becoming still more buoyant, efforts wil he made to tow her head seawards, and that once etfeetod, the difficulties or tho position will in a great moosuro have hcra overcome.— Olago Daily Times, August 1.

Sho will return thence with all despatch in time to com mence running to the northern ports on or before the 1'Jih itistunt ; ?when she Millttait on regular triiis to.and from Maryborough and llockbampton. Tbc fares to those ports have been re.luceil to one-hnlf Uic original scale. We understand thai the Australasian Steam Navigation Company have determined upon running the Telegraph on this line, not out of any hostile fidtni' to tlie new Queensland Slc.im Na\igation Company, butbecaufc lhp Jirectors deem it their duty to protect the interests of the shairli.iMiT.* of the old company, who were the first to open up the trade heaven the northern po'rts and Brisbane Although the Telegrapli — ;bc mast regular steamer that ever traded between Brisbane an J Sydney — is to be taken oft' the southern line, we are glad to find that her captain, the most successful commander who has ever titled oti the same liue, is not to lie removed. V,'e arc informed Unit Captain O'Reilly will tike command of the Yarra Vaira, whoso increased powers we hope to em him exercise with the same ad vantages to the public and credit to himself that he has achieved in the Telegraph.— Qaetnilani Guardian, August 0, The Lady Lyttelton, after having been aground on the n:its for poinc days,* was, on Thursday morning, at flood tide, towed clear of the bar by the steamer Brcadalbane, and then takeu to sea by piiot iSousneid.— Queensland Oaariimi, August 9.

Tbc captain and crew managed to get on shore, but with the utmost difficulty, and tbe vessel breaking up in a few hours, the crew lost everything but what they had ou,— Wellington Itidepetidcnt. The Tasmanian Maid.— This steamer, so recently wrecked on tbe bar ol Lbe Wairau River, and which, having been condemned after a proper survey, was sold for £410, arrived in our harbour on Sunday last. It appears that she had bocn washed high uson a shingle bank, and had already become so considerably ijnbeddcd an it as io require a large nunibor of hundB to attempt her release from so perilous a position. A subsequent freshet in the Wairau River, however, washed away eo much of the shingle around her as to render the task of floating her a comparatively * asy one. After a few necessary repairs the Tasmanian Staid waa again brought round to Nelson. Eiacc her arrival she has been placed upon the cradle, and a thorough examination has only dis covered serious injury to ono paddle-box, but the other damage is eo slight that it Mill very speedily be repaired,— Wtilsott Etam iner July 1C. \ Wbeckr on iuk Noum-WEET Coast.— It is reported thatlon Monday week the Doscaroe was wrecked in attempting to enter the liivcr Inglis, and that the cutter Eliza, Coble, master, ie also on shore, but tbc place is uncertain, — Launccston Examiner, August 2.
