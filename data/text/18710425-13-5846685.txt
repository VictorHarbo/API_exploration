Money Wigram and Sons' fleet of Aus- tralian traders, and ono of the most comfortablo pas- senger BbipB of her Uno, has arrived In port or» her second voyage. The present run out has beon marked by exceedingly adverse woatber, and of! the Gape of Good Hopo abe was placed at considerable disad- vantage by badly springing her bowsprit Tbo ship, however, made Bomo fair progress in running down tho oastlng, having logged 030 miles In two consecutive days. Tho Hampshire bringa out a very largo general cargo, and between 80 and 00 passengers of all classes, who report moat favourably of the ebip and hor ac- commodation, and of tho courtesy and attention of Captain Ridgera and his officers. Tho sltlp Bailed from Plymouth on Sunday, January 29, with a light breeze from the southward, which on tho following day increased to a heavy gale from south to west. The gale continued with great sevority for a week (the ship then being only in Iat. 42dog. SOmln. N.), and waa Bucceeded by light easterly winds which were carried to lat 10do_. N. Tho N.E. trades, which wore vory light, wore then plokod up, and wore parted with in lat. .dog. N. Tho equator was crossed on the 29ih day out, In long. 24 deer.

Strong south-oaeterly winds then prevailed to tbo Capo of Good Hope, the meildiaa of wb Ich was passed on March 20. Off the Cape a very heavy N.E. gale sot in, accompanied with a hoad sea, and two days alterwards the bowsprit waa discovered to be vory badly sprung. The jibboom and flying jlbboom woro thou Bent in, and the foretop gallant mast sent down, to relievo the prosBure on tbo crippled spar, and this had to be done during another violent N.E. gale, and In rainy and squally weather. The longitude was run down in tho parallel of lat. 46dcg, SOmin. S., with moderate westerly winds ; and on April 0 tho ship mado 816 knots, and repeatod the performance on the following day. Tbe meridian of Capo Louwin was passed on the 15th lost., and from thence to Port Phillip Heads, which were ontered on tho afternoon of the 23rd hist., variable winds and woathor wero experienced. Tho Bhtp is in Uno order, and on her arrival In the bay bIio was taken alongside tbo railway pier, Sandridge, to diaohargo cargo and load again for London, lu« e.a Dandenong, Captain Wm.

Ohe Argus Office, Monday Evening. In tbe import markets to-day trade has not boon characterised by much activity ; there is ittle inquiry for goods in the opon market, and the auction-rooms still continue to hare tbo best show of business. Tho market for breadstuff s is vory slow indeed. Flour is steady at £14 lGs. to £15. There aro buyers at our quotations, but not over ; there is, however, vory little offering of Adelaide brands. The millors continuo to realiso up to £15 for bakers' parcels. Wheat is wanted, but, in the absence of any salos of Adelaide, quotations are in a mensuro nominal. For Port Mac DonnelL Gs. 3d. to Cs. 4d. is askod. A line of 1,000 bushels Tasmanian was takon up at 5s. Gd. Very little has transpired in regard to oats ; but we understand that the Janet's cargo of Now Zealand, about 6,000 bushels, will be offered under the hammer to- morrow forenoon. Maize ovincea greater Qrmness ; tho market has boon very active, and having beon cloarod of every thing to bo got under 3s. 10d,, holdors are now very .tiff, refusing to quote at lesa than the figure named. The aale of the Corinne'a cargo of Mauritius sugar, consisting of about 6,000 bags, was held this forenoon; 5,128 bogs were disposed of, at 24s. Cd. to 26s. for rations, 29s. to 30s. Cd. for browns, 33s. 9d to 34s. 6d, for Rood yellows, 37s. Cd. to 38s. Gd. for middling to fine yellows. The trade, though largely represented at the sale, showed little desire to operate, and great difficulty was in consequence experienced in getting rid of what Was Bold, and a slight re- duction had to bo conceded. Kerosene oil has been got rid of in small parcels for ship- ment at 2s. 3d. f.o.b. for Devoe's. There ia, however, no inquiry but for the supply of immediate wants. We observa that a thou ' sand cases will be offered for auction sale to- morrow. Amongst the arrivals reported this afternoon we notice the Carl Ludwig, from Foo-chow. She comes via Sydney, with her cargo of teas intact. The Eliza Firth, from Colombo, is also reported, her cargo consist- ing chiefly of coffeo, and is consignad to Messrs. J. F. M'Kenzio and Co. The following auctioneers' reports have been received : Messrs. J. Lyons and Co. held a sale of dress Btu-i, grey calleóos, woollens, clothing, linens, 'co., and disposed of the wbolo at vory satisfactory prices. Figurod pop lins. Persian cords, chintz Venotlan twills, &o.; latched fromCJd. to 13d. per yard; Aberdeen wlncoys, wool chsmbray.&c.;, from lOJd. tolSi). per yard ; 4>4groys, 4d. to 6Jd.¡ 8-4 do., 6}d. to7|d.; 7-8 Irish linens, lid. to lOd, per yard ; twoed trousers and vests, 149. Od. to 189\. Od.; bordered tweode, from 2s. 8_d. to 8i. Od. per yard. Thoro was a good attendance prosont, and a bottor disposition shown by tho purchasers. Mesera. Fraser and Go. offered to day, at their rooms, under instructions from Mesare. Joshua Broti ora, the sound portiouof tho ctrgo of tho Co- rinne, from Mauritius, consisting of about 0,000 bags, and Bold 6,128 hags, at 24s. 0d. to 263. for rations, 29i, to 80s. 0d. tor browns, 83s. 0d. to S4i. Od. for good yellows, 87b. 6d. to 38s. Oil. for middling to duo white. There was a large attendance of iho trade, but the biddings nero spiritless. Tho prices obtained aro some- what lower than lost sale. The Customs revenuo collected at the port of Melbourne to-day amounted to £2,911 ;. pilotage, £43 lGs. Cd. We report as follows of the stock and share market: I Business quiet, and but few transactions reported. Debentures firm, and Government sixes and Uves both wanted.
