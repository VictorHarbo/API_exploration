C. HORSBURGHITcO., Ltd., General Ironmongebs and Importers, KENT AND RICHMOND STREETS, MARYBOROUGH HOCKLEY 8l CO. THE NEW FACTORY AND SHOPS EARLY CLOSING ACT. IMPORTANT I READ THIS ! THE LATEST INVENTION FROM fTHE PARIS EXHIBITION,: The ' Selsodou,' ' A Perfect Mvat -r,' Purohaael by our junior while visiting the lute Exhibition. He Bays :—** I have struck a new ' Sparklet idea 1 that will become far more popular than those we have atocked. By a very ingenious patent you insert a button, with a shauk, into an opening on the top of Sparklet, and to liberate the carbonic gas press button down. A steel tube ruos down the middle of the glass one, and the g-ie goes to the bottom, so that it is unnecessary to turn it uf- aide down to mix, as with the ordinary Orator. The olever thing is this, 1 No matter how long you press the button, only enough carbooic gaa is liberated to saturate the water, when it U ready for immediate use.' To prevent any chance of explosion the glass is of best material, tested to 800 lbs. pressure* and as a further safeguard, a safety valve lets off the gas before half that p*esaure can result. This 'safety aod speed' should soon make the * SEL80D0N ' much more p^puLrthan the old-faabioned Seltzo gene. The patent attracted great attention at the Exhibition and large sales were madejl We are glad to annonoce that we have sccared the AGENCY f r the ' STATE OF QUEENSLAND,' and have just landed a Filter SHIPMENT, ex s.s. ' Pathan, in two sizes, viz 2 and 4 Pints. On and after 1st February Next oar Establishment will remain Open till 9 p.m. on Fridays and Olose at 1 p.m. Saturdays, in accordance with tbe new Act.
