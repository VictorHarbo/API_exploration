LATEST PARTICULARS. POSITION UNALTERED. LONDON, 31st May. j The position in connection with the j strike of transport workers'is unchanged. [ The Government is seeking to persuade the- employers to agree to adhere to the eorditions of the 1911 agreement if the men obey the oonditions fairly. The strike committee, at a meeting Last night, carried a resolution to seek the support of other unions, including skilled v.oikcrs in the trade, to -vindicate tho principles of trade unionism. The Bev. Father Hopkins, a trustee ot the Seamen's and Firemen's Association, says that tho vote of the latter at the conference will suffice to • prevent ■a, na tional strike. The White Star liner Athsnic, due to leave with 12,000 immigrants for New South Wales, is unable to depart, on ac count of the strike. The master lightermen and barge owxers have written to Mr. Buxton, pre sident of the Board of Trade, declaring that they yielded to pressure before, and they wor'j not now encouraged, to repeat the dose. The men r.ay that they will refuse to to discuss the agreement made last autumn, and that they arc prepared to tee the matter through in the interests of them selves, tho port, and the public. The Short Sea Traders' Association and the blaster Carmen decline to le repre sented at the conference. Colonial butter and cheese are at a standstill. Prices are nominally un changed. Goo# trade is being done in Danish and Siberian butter, which is be ing unloaded at Hay's wharf by clerks, salesmen, ai.o members of the nnporting firni. The majority of the strikers at Covent Garden have returned to y.'ork uncondi tionally. The "'Daily News" states that it is the inlention of the Government lo establish a board of arbitration,^ at which all par ties must- bo represented. If the masters refuse to recognise the board legislation will be passed to compel them to do so.
