'? -? \ American Built Clippers for the Brunch Government.— Several French naval officers are at present, in Boston, and are about-forming a contract ?with one of the shipbuilders there to build twelve clipr per ships of about 500 tons each, to be employed in the French colonial trade. That government intends colonising New .Caledonia, and these clippers are to be employed in' carrying passengers there from France ; these vessels having been preferred over steamers by a comparison of their passages with the steamers from England to Australia, in which' it is shown that th'eir average length of time has . been shorter, and also because they can be sailed much more economiaally than steamers.— Alia California. The Slave Vessel Glamorgan. — The late slave vessel Glamorgan, formerly of New York, recently sailed from Boston for Valparaiso, her name having bepn changed to the Wizard by Act of Congress.— Alia 'California. ? , - ?./ ? ?- .? ??? , ? Captain Sullivan, of the steamer Tllawa'rra,' which arrived yesterday from Wollongong, reports' having seen a vessel ashore on CurfanuHa beach, to the northward of Port Hacking.. She is described as a fore' and aft schooneiyof between 40 and 50 tons, ?anil, linvino- nil her canvas' furled. The vessel is lying broadside on' to the beach; she was probably blown ashore in the heavy southerly gale which sprang up'^on the evening of the 18th inst . — S.M.H.

The Emma. — This favourite brig' hns again made another rapid passage to Hobart Town and back; She leftthis port for Hobart Town on the 5th inst. with a full cargo ; there discharged and took on board another, and arrived yesterday morning, hav ing been absent fourteen days, being, we believe, one^ of tho fastest passages ever : made. Her last voyage to Hobart Town and back, was accomplished in fittoen ; days, and we think-provos that she has fairly established herself as one' of the fastest ves sels on this coast. The whole of her voyages hitherto have been made with the regularity of a steamer. Captain Brown reports having seen a steamer off the Dromedary on the ISth instant, at four p.m.— S. M. H. .???..

The Pacific.— This Splendid steamship, (the property, of the Sydney and Melbourne Steamship Company), was expected to leave Plymouth on the 25th November, and, may therefore, be expected to arrive before the end of the month. She has 60 pas- sengers in the saloon, amongst which are the fol- lowing old colonists— Mr Tom Ray, wife and family, Mr William Wright and lady, Miss Robertson, Mr J. R. Houlding, Mr George Wilkie, Mr Barber, of Jencken, Barber and Co, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Fair- fax, also, the Rev. Mr. Kent, late of Brauntan, Devonshire, who comes out under the auspices of the Colonial Missionary Society.— S.M.H. The Pacific. — We understand it is more than probable that this vessel will , be detained to bring tho mails of the 4th December, under the General Screw Company's contract.1 The dieectors of that company were negociating ^yith.the ngents of the Pacific, in consequence of the, Government having taken up tho Quean of the South and the Ci'tesus, for purposes connected with the' war. — S.-'M. H. We wero in error in stating that Mr. Barber, of the firm of .Tencken, Barber, und Co., would arrive hero by tho Pacific (s.) Tho gentleman alluded to is of the firm of Barber and Barker, of Mark-lane, London,1 and one of the. Directors of the United Guarantee:and Life Assurance Company,; as well as! of the Australian Direct Steam Navigation Com-1 pany.— S. M. 11. . ? The barque Faith, which .arrived yesterday from Hobart Town, reports having passed the Keindeor ?bound to this port, oil' .: Twofold; Bay. on , the ; 8th' instant;- also,1 the 'schooner, Lion, bound, for Newcastle, off Cape Pillar on the 12th instant.— S.M.H. ' ;.'.:'. '?''?.'? ''? ' Oakversus Pine.; — With regard to the loss of ithe Alrctic, our readers- will bo surprised -to learn that she is roported to have been planked with pine instead .of oak. Every one at. all conversant with 'shipbuilding is well aware that pine'is' exceedingly brittle, and has little or no. elasticity in it ; whereas there is a rebound in oak plank, which nearly fills up a hole made by. the passago of a cannon-ball through it. Besides, the strength of oak far ex ceeds that of pine. It is therefore probable that if the Arctic had besn planked with oak she might not have received such serious' inj nary ' from 1 ho col lision with the Vesta as to have caused her loss. At any rate, it is probablo that much more time would have been' afforded to the passengers to effect their, escape in the boats had the Arctic been planked with oak. We observe that the ship's boat which : arrived at Renews had: no. compass in it. Surely there was great neglect in not having a, small compass permanently attached to each of tho ship's boats, so that, in case of need, there should be no necessity for running about a sinking ship in search of compasses for the boats.— Shipping Gazette. The ship Courier, of New York, before reported wrecked on tho Falkland Islands,, struok on the rocks near the Bull Point, on the 1st of April and imme diately bilged. She was in ballast, and' some sails and provisions were saved and landed. 'The ship was sold by the captain (who' acted as auctioneer) for J41 sterling to a, person. from Stanley, and the sails and provisions saved wero given to Capt. Smiley, who had gone to the wreck with a brig, as payment for the passage of Capt. Burmese, .officers and crew to the settlement. On the arrival of Cupt. Burmese at Stanley, he was arrested by order of the Governor for an alleged' violation of the Auction Ordinance, and fined £100 or six months imprison ment, and was accordingly imprisoned on his re fusal to pay, and so remained when his mates and crew left on the 7th June for Montevideo where they arrived on the 20th. The fine was afterwards re duced by the Governor to £50, but Capt. B. still re fused to pay. The wreck had been resold for £170. Capt. Smiley, on his arrival at Montevideo, repre sented the whole matter to Capt, Lynch, of the U.S. ship Germantown, which vessel sailed June 23rd for Rio Janeiro. — Jilta Culifornin.
