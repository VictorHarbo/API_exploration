A MONTH TO FIND HUSBANDS. Much amusement, has been caused at the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, by the urgent petition oi two pretty blue-eyed Danish girls, AI lild Anderson and Ingeborg Jansen, of Copenhagen, for permisBion to depart ' immediately for Winona (Minnesota). They, the 'Mail' says, are the cheer ful victims of an eccentric will mada by their grandfather, who bequeathed . them^eacb a half share of 600 acres of Jine farm lands On the condition that they marry within thirty Says of .tneir arrival in New York. By the terms of the will, which the two cousins ex plained to an interpreter, title to the' ' lands will not be finally vested wi^h either of them until they become mo thers. . If. at the end of five years one of the cousins has a child and the. other: has not, the motherless one will lose half her land to the .other. If neither has children at the end of five .years the entire property is to revert to a male cousin in Denmark. Both girls - departed Â£01 Minnesota, ^confidently declaring in broken English . that * they '? would 'find good husbands within the stipulated ?term. ' ? -? ' ' '^. . r :
