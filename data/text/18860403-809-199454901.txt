A swelling in my daughter's neck, so very grodunl mat wo scarcely viticcd it coming, ut length became so largo ai!-'. uncomfortable thut medical nil vice wns called in. The child was tlion at a critical age, and tho dactor thought that when tho change became Bottled the neck would get well under treatment.

Ilo recommended nn immediate change to tho sett&ldo;, und certain treatment, all of which wtu persovcringly tried, hut without success. On tho return home of iny daughter wo had another medical attendant, who cndeiicd the fircvfons verdict— Lc., that tho disuuso was Goitre. As, however, lit did not effect improvement, my wife mentioned to hlin Clarke's Blood Mixture, and after ex amining a buttle ho assented to its being tried. I can ouly most thankfully say thut (under God) It was the of cJTecting n perfect cure and thut thee to r» tho ellghtest elgn of bwolling or anything to remind us of the disease. We used about equal to two lis. cases. Then my wife hud a bc'.tc attack of rheumatism (so the doctor calied ID at the hip joint. She was confined to bed for son time, and every kind of outward application kept at the Military hospital, besides other remedit, vera tried in rain. I cannot but look upon it ha wonderful that a few bottles, cer tainly nut morr fc'um four — I think only tltrcc— completely reiu'>v-.d every sign of tho affection, nnd there has been no return. 1 feof sure that it will be useful In an eminent; degree to make known the etllcacy of your xnedicluo in Goitre, and also hi the other eases, where,, fn both Instances, the usual medical treatment Jnul compleloiy failed.
