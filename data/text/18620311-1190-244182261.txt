' Tiie Mapco Polo.— This veasaL notwlfch- standing tar flavins on her last passage home from this struck against an iccbsrg, and thereby receiving each severe daraago that it was a matter of speculation if she would ever come out here again, arrived in Hobsnn's Bay during Suuday night, under tho command of Captain Arnold (lato of the Jnmcs Booth). Sho left Liverpool on the evening of tho I2th of De cember, mid was detained by head gales for fivo days in tho Channel, nnd ngain for ton days on' this const owing to light e&storly; winds. During tho timo of tho Marco Polo lying at Liverpool she underwent a thorough overhaul nnd nnd i« now nlmosb a now ship ngain ; and, if w a iuav judjo from tho expressions of the passengers, n groat n favourite ns ever. The Harry Bluff hns made a very good pnssnco from New York, having left that port on the 15th December. Nothing particular occurred during the passage, with the exception of the extraordinary continuance of light bafiling nirs experienced from tho time of passing Cape Leuwin, We nro indebted to Cnptnin Rcdrnnn for a copy of the JVeto York Herald of tho 14th of December. Tho South Australian Government schooner Yntftln arrived in Hobson's Bay yesterday at four p.m., having Sir Richard nnd Lady Mac- donncll and suite on board ; sho was immediately boarded bv Mr. Macfnrlanc, tho immigration officer, nnd Cap'.niu Boucroft, A.D.C. to His Excellency Sir Henry Barkly. Tho vessel anchored chsc to Sandridgo, and landed her distinguished pnsengers in Mr. Macfarlano's boat at tho Pandridgo Railway Pier. Captain Buick, of tho Glenslice, reports that tho bnrquo Time and Truth Icfc Manilla for this port in company witli him, and was again sighted in the straits of Sunda. The Danish brig, China, nnd the American ships James I.ittlefield .and Kathay, were loading at Manilla Ifor tltis port. . Tho Wonga Wonga left Sydney Heads at 4,10 p.m. on tho 8th inst., ard entered Port Phillip | Heads at 4.05 p.m. «yosterday. Shortly after 1 \ midnight on the 9th the vessel was Btruck by a whirlwind when about 50 miles east of the ' Promontory, Bince which time fresh W.N.W. r winds nnj fino weather has been experienced. The Telegraph reports tho schooners Volun- t.na ami T n'n \fftiitiw flfmttnff tllf "RfkV On TtlG — day. Eleven sailors of the emigrant Bhip Jesric Munn made their escnpoin the lifeboat on Mon day night, and wero seen going out to sea. Tho Rcbrcea, bnrquo, was lying nt the Pilot station. — J/, Herald, 7th Msroh. Narrow Escape from Fire of tiie Pilot Schookerat Newcastle. — Yesterday morning (Sunday), as the Water Police boat, with the Coroner, was proceeding towards the Pnlinottn, ship, for the purpose of holding an inquest oil tbc body of a Chinaman, who died somewhat suddenly, largo volumes of smoke wero observed issuing from the pilot schooner, when it was evident that pome portion of the vessel was on fire. Tho polico bont at once proceedod to thoppot; tho men lost no time in getting on hoard, and procuring buckets ot water, succeeded in extinguishing the flames. It appears the watch were aslocp below, and by some means the gftUcy bad caught fire. When tho police got on board tho flames had caught the fore mast, and a few minutos Uter the vessel would havo been all in 11 trues, as the wind was b'owing strong from tho S.E. nt the lime. There is little doubt that but for tho exertions of tin police, the vessel wruld have met with total dcstruoiioo. The Water Police deserve great praise for the prompt manner in which \ they rendered assistance, which, no doubt, will I meet with well merited reward. — S. Jlf. Herald , 3rd March.
