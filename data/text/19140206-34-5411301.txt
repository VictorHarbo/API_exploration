The earnest workers at experimental sets have been responsible for the greatest discoveries in modern times, and opportunities are greater now than ever for the man who begins by learn- ing all that is already done and known, and makes it his hobby from that point. ' Also, the rewards are great for operators throughout Australia, the Government paying high salaries, while there is also illimitable scope throughout the world, the educated wireless engineer being sure of the best of incomes anywhere.
