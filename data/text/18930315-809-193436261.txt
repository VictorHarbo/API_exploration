FINANCE AND TRADE . Tuesday Evening. At tho dato when the suspension of the Federal Bank was announced a suggestion was rpade in tho columns of The Aye that the course adopted horo by the Associated Banks would not meet with approval in London. Mail advices just to band confirm this view. They state that "there is much discussion in tho city as to whether the Associated Banks acted prudently in letting tho Federal Bank go into liquidation." It is suggested that it was to tho interest of tho \- former to havo arranged for one of their number to take the business over on something like the same lines as tho Union Bank adopted in the case of the Bank of South Australia. It b&8 already boon pointed out that euph An arrangement might have beon readily effeoted by the various batiks join- \ jng to guarantee the liquidating institu- tion against future loss. Tho ' British- Aus tralasian, commenting on the matter, says ' Tho stoppage of the Federal lias been a sail blow to public confidence on tills side, and tho drop in tho English, Scottish ami Australian Chartered Bank shares may bo taken as indicative of tho uneasy feeling which the Federal controtcmps has created in the case of Institutions which, ou thoir own merits, should bo abovo suspicion. Fairplay t discussing the matter, whilst depre ciating any scaro amongst the depositors in tho Associated Banks of Australia, points out that tho English depositors only amount to 24 per cent, of tho whole, and that existing difficulties boing surmounted, n steady improvement is likely to follow. The notion taken yestorday by tho Assooiatcd Banks boing unanimously endorsed in financial and commercial oircles, is regarded as likely to prove tho turning point, and tho unnecessary scaro onco allayed, a reaction will follow. In regard to the agreement among tho Asso ciated Banks for mutual assistance, roforrcd to in our yesterday's issue, the mattor has boon considered by Air. John Sawors, superintendent of the Bank of Australasia, who lias become a party to the understanding ; and this oppor tunity is taken, in viow of articles which appeared in yesterday's newspapers, to define accurately to what extent the Associated Banks accept tho obligation in quostion, namely : — That they will render finanoia! assistance to each other on suoh terms, and to suoh an extent as may seem justifiable to caoh of them, if, and when the occasion arises, "With regard to tho London freight market, Mr. "William Balcliin writes m follows : — During the past month stoara touiisgo to Ade laide, Molbournu ami Sydney has been much nue- mented, but notwithstanding this foot thu cargo offering for shipment has not similarly responded, and as a consequence quotations have a weakening tendency; although nominally they stand to 35s. for measurement, much lower rates have been, and are, accepted for good linos. Weight cargo has been particularly scarce, and extromely low figuros havo been obtainod. liy sail considerable difficulty is experienced in procuring the necessary cargoes for the ordinary berth vossels, and consequently thoirsaUhigriates havo been prolonged. Queensland: In nddition to tho usual monthly steam despatch, a sailing vessel for Brisbane lias been loaded, and It is expected that a vessel will shortly be fixed, taking goods for both liockliainpton and Townsvillo. Business generally does not show tho improvement which could bo desired. New Zealand : Tliero is no particular change to notice In these markets, trade keeping fairly brisk, and being enrrfod on almost exclusively by steAin. India and China : Competi tion still prornlls to India, consequent upon tho attitude of certain brokors who put on the berth at intervals an outside steamer taking cargo to the principal ports at cutting rate. Business to China still keeps dull. Tho Cape : Trade to these parts is now fairly brisk, and there is plenty of cargo offer ing for shipment. Our cable messages this morning rofer to tho operations of the International Navigation Com pany, a syndicate which have obtained a ohartor from the Government of tho Dominion of Canada to construct a canal to connect Lakes Erio And Ontario. A direct waterway oonncot- ing Montreal and New York with tho lakes will, it is asserted, develop a large amount of traffic. Indeed, basing their calculations on f<Soo" cannl, the proprietors say that 20,000,000 tons is not an extravagant estimate. According to the particulars furnished by Air. A Fergusson, Q.C., and published in the Government Gazette of Canada, between Lake Erie and Montreal there will be seven looks and 363 miles of navi gation, of which 45 miles will be canal. Between Lake Erio and Now York there will be seven locks and 706 miles of navigation, of which 131 will bo cannl. Between Montreal and New York will bo four locks.and 403 miles of navigation, of which 115 will bo canal. Tho time from Lake Erio to Montrcnl will be 32 hours ; from Lake Erio to New York, 60 hours. Between Montreal aud New York the time will be 38 hours. It is a somewhat noteworthy fact that whilst in Australia the various colonies look to their Governments to dovclop the transit busi ness, Canada, on the other hand, has Bliown a marked preference to private enterprise. The State thus avoids all risk as well as cxponse in construction or working, whilst at the same tiino the difficulties of making them a finan cial success aro shifted on to tho shoulders of private individuals. Tho January returns of tho Board of Trade again show a shrinkage, both in the value of imports and exports. The former are valued at £33,125,888 for the month, a decrease of £3,359.356, whilst tho latter havo declined £1,120,665. The chiof decline in exports was under the head of yarns aud textile fabrios, in cluding £362.000 under cotton manufactures exported, and a decrease of nearly £250,000 under woollen and worsted goods exported, but the declino in export trade is still more diatinot in values than iu the quantities sent abroad. The inorenso of linen piece goods exported last month was 20 per cent, in quan tity aud 11 per cent in value. In all metnls and metal manufactures there was an increaso of £81,317 in value, compared with January, 1892. The quantity of iron and steoi exported is maintained this year, but tho value shows a decrease of £105,000 oompared with the valuation of January, 1892. The chief decreaso on the imports is in raw materials for textile manufactures, including a decline of £2,540,000 under cotton, chiefly for tho United States, while the imports of wheat show a diminution of £558,000, ohiefiy from British East Iudies. There is a decided increase under tho head of woo), the imports being 119,720,000 lb. for January, 1893, against 110,850,000 lb. in Janu ary, 1892, and 93,093,000 lb. in January 1891\. The exports of woollen yarns aro larger than in corresponding months of 1892 and 1CJ1, but woollen goods and worsteds show a consider able falling off. The annual general meeting of the Now Zea land Loan and Mercantile Agency Limited was held in London on 3rd February. Mr. H. J. Briatow, chairman, in moviug the adoption of tho report, stated j— Tho past year had been a very crucial one for tho Australian colonies, which had experienced not only a commercial depression, ami labor and financial difficulties, but also a collapse in the values of town and suburban property. The colonists had been taught a sharp lesson, hut ho believed it would he beneficial to them, as tending to make them economise both in their public ami private expenditure. With respect to New Zealand, it was satisfactory to find that that colony continued to make progress in her exports of pastoral anil agricultural produce. The tendency of legislation was still advorso to the introduction of frosli capital into the colony, the financial position of which, however, was more assured now than it was during the period of exces sive borrowing and lavish expenditure. Tho revenue returns for New Zealand for the nine months ended 31st December last showed receipts amounting to £2,940,000, or £80,000 in excess of those of tho corresponding period of 1891. The .surplus for tho financial year ended on 31st March last was £168,000, and a substantial surplus was again expected for the year ending on thu 3lst prox. Population was also being at tracted to the colony, as was shown by the immigration returns. Lower prices had ruled in this country lust year for the chief Australasian products, but towards the end of the year better prices prevailed, and it was hoped that there would ho a furlhor improvement during the current year. Development was still boing made in tho frozen meat trade. Tho company had overy prospect of enjoying a good year. With regard to the 'future they ontertained no doubt that their business would continue to grow. Sir John Gorst. Q.C., seconded the luutlon, which was adopted, aud a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum was afterwards declared. Messrs. Turubull, Hotson and Go. bavo received cable advices of the sale of the Eldorslie shipment of mutton aud lamb as being sold at tho following average prices. This shipment was entirely from Riverina, being merino sheep and lambs : — Lambs, 4d. per lb.; hoggots, 3jjd. per lb.; wethers, 3Jd. per lb.; ewes, 3d. per lb. These prices not the shippers — For lambs, 7s. 6d,; wethers, 461b., 6s. 6d.; ewes, 44 lb., 5s. 9d. Similar ewes sold in Melbourne and netted the graziers 2s. 4d.: hoggets, 37 lb., 5s. 3d. Tradors aro disposed to take & more hopeful view of the business outlook. Reports from tho country distriotsare fairly enoournging, whilst the position in our miuing centres as reflected in lleitdigo and Rallarat indicate an unusual de gree of prosperity when compared with Mel bourne. Our trade, both town and suburban, it has already been pointed out, is absolutely far in excess of the requirements for consumption. Enforced economy has induced a large restric tion in purchases, specialty under the lioad of luxuries, and yet our system of distribution is as large and as costly as ever. Trade cannot under existing conditions be foroed in the capital simply because it is already overdone, and hence if it is to be conducted on a paying basis it must ho narrowed down to meet our more limited requirements, and until this occurs a lasting improvement cannot bo expeetcd. Our wheat market is without material change, and though there is a fair demand at current quotations, tho disposition to sell is still some what restricted, The mail advices wo published this morning from London, as well as private letters, do not speak with muoh hope, under ordinary conditions, of prices rallying much. Bad weather in Europo or America during tho next few months may influence prices, whilst war alarms would doubtless affect the market. Both of these contingencies are however re mote, and, dealing with the immediate outlook, taken with the good accounts of European and American crops and a largo surplus in India, the prospect of prices for wheat advanoing are not bright. At ' the looal auction sales to-day 1173 bags of wheat, consisting of small parcels, were offered, of which 760 bags sold to sample at the following prices Fowia' feed, 13 bags 2s. 5d., and 14 bags 2s. 10d.; wheut, inferior to good milling, 73 bngs 2s. lid., 11 bags 2s. lld., 117 hags 3a.i 166 bags 3s.

The uncertainty of the silver quostion, whioh is refloated in tho cxchnngo, and the low prices offering from England, Imparts a oortniu dcgrceof uncertainty to the futuro of this mar ket. Small sales of bran hags. Candles firm, and tho advnnco is maintained. With regard to oils, London advices of tho 10th ult. report as follows : — Value for llnsvod have hardened. On the spot.

Locally, our sales are not oxtoneive. Tho sugar market remains quiet. With limited supplies of both Mauritius and Queensland it is clear that the local rofincries must now be largely absorb ing oven tbo business in manufacturing sorts. At the auction salo £21 10b. was paid for medium whiteB, but the bulk of the catalogue was passed. After the sale 1000 bags of Qitoemdand whitos sold to £22 10k., and 5 tons of Mauritius brewers' crystals. Teas are steady. London advices report that "a depressed feeling is gradually coming ovor the market, and values are oheaper. China descriptions are flat and rates easier. Ceylon is iu slow demand at lower priocs. Indian sorts aro dull, and values show a decline." It must not bo overlooked that tho imports of tea Into thu United Kingdom this season havo been sonsibly increased by shipments from Ceylon, which woroovor 3,000,000 lb.in excess of the pre vious year. The total oxporfc of tea to the United Kingdom from Ceylon amounted to 65,824,822 lb., against 62,693,676 lb. in 1891\. Tho increase of the shipment to Australia from Ceylon show a largo increase, being roturned for 1892 at 5,042,608 lb., Against 3,085,962 lb. in 1891. To a largo oxtent this increaso has been counterbalanced by a roduction in shipments from India nnd China.
