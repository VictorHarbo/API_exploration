COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Saturday evening. Export entries were passed at the Customs to-day for 61 ounces of gold for shipment to England. A complete lull has taken place in the gold market in Melbourne. This is attributed by some of the diggings papers to the combined action of the banks in retaining in their coffers on the gold-fields all parcels purchased, instead of forwarding them to Melbourne. The bullion brokers quote the following rates for the day, but there has not been any business doing For Bendigo, Castlemaine, and Pleasant Creek, 75s. 6d. per ounce; Avoca Dunolly, Fiery Creek, and Maryborough, 77s. Ararat, 76s. 6d. ; Ovens, 77s. to 75s. ; Ballaarat, 76s. 6d. per ounce. The escorts for the week were very low, amounting to 34,004 ounces only. The total of the corresponding week of last year amounted to 37,494 ounces, showing a deficiency of 3,430 ounces. The total was also below the average of the first quarter of the year by 7,861 ounces, and below that of the previous year by 13,606 ounces.

There is only one more week to come to complete the six months, and that will, in all probability, bring the totals still more nearly equal. The shipments for the week have been 29,338 ounces in the royal mail steamship Australasian, for Suez, and 265 ounces in the Zuleika, for Oak cattle. The previous shipments for the year, corrected by comparison with the entries passed at the Customs, amount to 1,127,320 ounces, making the total shipments of the year 1,166,923 ozs., or 48 tons 4 cwt. 101bs.3oz3, the value of which, at SA per ounce, amounts to £4,627,692. Up to the same period of last year the shipments amounted to 1,236,428 ozs" or 51 tons 10 cwt. 1 qr. 10 lbs. 8 ozs., which amounted, valued at the same rate, to ¡84,946,712. The tone of the news from the gold-fields is not very encouraging. Although the weather has been everything that can be desired. there is still a scarcity of water in many localities, and the quantities produced have given indications of a falling off. Without doubt the recent fall in price has produced some effect on the returns The Maryborough Advertiser says on this sub- ject: The gold market requires the most delicate handling; the less it is interfered with the better. But we are suffering the banks to acquire a power (which they do not hesitate to use), by which they can twist and turn the gold market as it suits their pleasure, regardless of the injury they inflict by their vagaries. Who shall say how injurious to the colony may be the intelligence carried some of the immense falling off of the yield of gold the two weeks previous to the departure of the mail? and who shall estimate the amount of injury done to our own town by the escort therefrom this week, being less than even its neighbors of Avoca and Am- herst?" Ballaarat has contributed comparatively but very little to the escorts lately, but great activity prevails on all hands. A report of the Mining Surveyor is published in the local journals of this morning, which appears to give some excellent information with regard to the principal leads. The quartz reefs are thus treated of: There are only two quartz reefs in this district on which mining is being carried on, one extending from Golden Point to White Horse, and the other from Bakery Hill down Specimen Gully. On these reefs 348 men are engaged : 183 of this number are receiving gold, which is principally obtained by washing the debris, the quartz in many instances being sold to contractors to be used as metal for the roads. The want of efficient quartz crushing machinery is universally felt. There is only one machine, and that is of an inferior description, in the district. It is the general opinion of quartz miners, and others who have had experience in quartz mining, that if the same description of machinery that is used on other gold-fields was in operation on Ballaarat, her < quartz veins would be the most permanent and remunerative branch of mining." The Prospecting Association has 17 men at work in various parts of the district. There is nothing now from Ararat and Pleasant Creek, but the quantities received thence have been well maintained. Maryborough exhibits a remarkable falling off, but this is accounted for by the fact that large parcels are held by the banks ) in that district. At the Clunes great preparations are being made for the erection of new * machinery, upwards of 100 tons of which have \- left Melbourne during the last few days for that locality. It is stated that a waggon, conveying a boiler of eight tons wer gut, has been prevented by the authorities from crossing Keilor bridge, doubts being entertained of the capacity of that structure to undergo the ordeal , of having so heavy a weight taken across It. The Bendigo and Forest Creek gold districts are contributing tolerably steady quantities to the escorts. Beechworth is very quiet, and at the Omeo the chief occupation now is the repairing of the races, in preparation for the winter's work. Great interest is felt and expressed on all the gold-fields, with reference to the promised new regulations for the granting of leases of auriferous lands for mining purposes. Much difference of opinion prevails, many of the miners appearing to think that the issue of leases to companies will more or less interfere with their interest as individuals. 223 persons have landed at the port of Melbourne in the last seven days, consisting of 183 from the Australian colonies, 87 from the United States, and three from Ceylon. The departures are computed at 100. The net addition to the population of the colony by the seaboard, during the current year, has been 9,444; Arrived. Departed. January ."

This is, as a matter of course, set down as the first fruits of the financial undertaking into which the six banks have entered with the Government for the railway loan, It is more probable, assuming the fact to be true, that the paper thrown out has been that evolved by some of the speculations of a few weeks ago. In presenting obstacles to wild speculation, the banks have consulted their own interests, and at the same time have done good service to the commercial character of the colony. During the three or four days of excitement which followed the arrival of the English February mails, many large parcels of butter candles, and other goods, changed hands at two or three months', six or seven times over, and paper to as many times the value of the parcels was thrown into the discount market. Much valuable experience on this matter has been gained during former years. In the local stock and share market there has been very little doing. The sales reported have been-Colonial Bank shares, at £6 per share ; Bank of Victoria, at £89; Hobson's Bay Railway at 72 ex div. Colonial Insurance at £2 8s, ; Australasia!. Insurance at 12s. 6d. ; Melbourne Insurance at 18s. to 14s per share ; Melbourne Gas and Coke Company at 40 per cent, premium. The Provisional Committee of the National Bank of Australasia have made arrangements for: allotting the shares of this Institution at at early day, The current rates of discount a the banks are: For bills under 95 days' our rency, 8 per cent. ; from 95 to 126 days', per cent. ; over 125 days', 10 per cent. and 61 overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent. Exchange on England is at par for GO day; Bight, and at 4 percent, premium for amount under £50, for 30 days' eight. Freight on gold by direct steamers or sailing vessels, 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London ; insurance, 1 per cent, by the overland route, 5 per cent, that is 7d. per ounce as nearly as possible insurance, had. to 13d. per cent Trade has not been brisk this week, but fair quantity of legitimate business has "been: done. The tables of imports and exports in the year, as compared with the same period c 1857, still give the balance of trade in favor,' of the colony. Imports. Exports. Week ending, 1857. 1858. 1367. 185!

Messrs. Wm. asey and Co. disposed of the cargo of sugars, ex Jemmy, from the Mauritius, about 6,000 bags in all.

Subjoined are the latest market reports: LAUSWBSIOX.-Most of the oats remaining [ in this colony appear to have got into the , bales of large holders, who can afford to hold until the market comes round to something ""near their own figure. They are certainly not disposed to do business at the present noon nal rate on the spot, 7s. to 7s. 6d. per bushel ; so would they be likely to accept Melbourne ] rates of 8s. to 8s. 6d. Notwithstanding the reports of heavy shipments to arrive there, the general impression is that oats will go up, and all who can will hold for higher rates. Wheat is quoted at 7s. to 7s. 3d. per bushel, and flour £17 per ton. Cornwall Chronicle, June 16. HOBART TOWN, 16th June.

HAT MARKETS-The supply at market during the week has been in excess of the demand, and prices have consequently declined. Inferior hay has been very dull in price and difficult of sale. Best sorts of hay have been in fair demand, but without change in value. The number of loads at market was 106, being an excess of 81 loads above the previous week. Best hay is worth 83. ; second class, 11. ', inferior and stained, 66. ; straw, 83. 8s. to 5s. per ton. Wool, TALLOW, AOF-The advanced season of the year almost precludes the necessity of reporting this market, as the last year's clip has been shipped, and any transactions that may occur In Skin wool are un- important to shippers. Messrs. Clough and Co., however, report sales of a few small lots of greasy wool at from 8d. to 10d. per lb, and Blipo at from 10d, to 10d. per lb. follows-The prices paying by motors for local consumption completely shut out purchasers for export, and prices are consequently nominal. Hides The quantity requisite for the loading of the Abyssinian being completed, there is no amount of business doing in the market, and prices are wholly nominal. LIVE STOCK. Fat Cattle The market has been well supplied during the week, chiefly, however, with bat indifferent quality. Really prime stock sold readily, at from 30s. to 32s. 6d. per 100 lb., equivalent to 100. 10s. to 15. per head. Messrs. Ryan and Hammond report sales of 107 head of middling qua- lity bullocks at an average of 92. 2s. 6d. Messrs. Dalmahoy Campbell and Co. announce having sold 119 head good quality, nearly all cows an average of 6. 10s. each ; 82 head middling sorts bullocks, from 616. to 71. 16s.; cows, from. to 7!. 5s. each; and a small lot of cows, at an average price of 71. Mr W. W. Treacy also informs us of sales of 60 steers, at Oakleigh, at from 99 to 126. each Store cattle continue in brisk; inquiry. Few really good lots are, however, offering, and buyers are, consequently, holding back for selection from expected overland arrivals. Messrs. P. Campbell and Co. have sold 200 head all over two years old at 82 10s. per head. Working bullocks have been in considerable demand, but the supply being far below requirements long prices have been procured for those at market. Mr. W. W. Treacy disposed of 62 head at from 10! to 22. per pair. Calves were supplied short of demand, and high prices were consequently procured for those at market Messrs. Dalmahoy Campbell and Co. sold 60 head at from 57s, 6d to 92s, Ou, web, and Messrs. Ryan and Hammond report sales at from 50s. to 55s. per head Fat Sheep The market was more fully supplied that during the previous week, and prices were conse- quently a trifle easier. We quote prime wethers, 23s I to 26s. ; owes, 10s. to 18s. Number at market abDU I 0,000. Store sheep are much inquired for, but owing! to the dry season none are to be purchased on their side the Murray River. HOUSE MARKET. Owing to the short supply of stock at market, there has not been a large amount of business doing ; j prices have, however, been well supported, and for any description of really sound staunch, useful horses full rates are readily procurable MOSSM. J. L. Lober and Co. report sales of first class draught horses from 802. to 1262. per head medium-class at from 172 to 682. ; first-class light harness horses at from 362. to 672. and medium sorts 172\. to 522. Mr. W. W. Treacy sold some imports heavy draught Sydney horses at from 102. to 30! each. Messrs. Dougharty and Co. also report sales of a few heavy draught horses in good condition n from 502. to 612. The second draft from the story of John Hore, Esq., of the Murray, consisting c I unbroken colts and Allies in fair order, adapted for light harness, and hacks, with a few of a heavier de scription, sold from 72 to 82. 10s., averaging about 162\. per head. LABOR MARKETS-The has been little or no change in the labor market during the past week. The demand for farming men has been Blight, and principally confined to rouen farm laborers. Malo domestic servants are in fair inquiry. Married couples, without children, have been in more demand. Good female servants are sought for, though inferior domestics without testimonials and colonial ox poisoned And difficulty in procuring situations. The following continue to be the nominal rates of wages : - Wkb, rations, married couples, without families, 70. to 300. per annum ; ditto with families, (difficult to obtain employ), 650, to 700. ditto ; gardeners, 602\. to 752. ditto; grooms, 20s to 30s. per week; shepherds, 35. to 102. per annum; hut keepers, 202. to 252. ditto ; general farm-servants, 20s. per week ; first-class ploughmen, 25s. per week ; bullock-drivers, on road, 25s. ditto on stations, 20s. ditto ; men cooks, 20s. to 60s. ditto and professed cooks, 82. ditto ; female ditto, from. 852. to 462. per annum ; general servants, 802. to 362. ditto ; nurse. maids, '26, to 252. ditto. SEAMEN'S WAGES The demand for men continues brisk ; hands are, however, freely offering, and there is no change in rates of wages to report. The following are the rates paying India or China and back, in.; China, India, or West coast of America and England, 41\. ; coasting voyages, 52. and England direct, it. to 5. 10s. a month, OAIWAOB EBI-OM.-We have again to report a very dull week.

Since the departure of the mail for Europe the lad port markets generally have remained in a state of in- activity : the business transacted has, however, been of the most legitimate kind. The country orders have been excessively light In amount, and the purchases made have been confined, in nearly all cases, to small parcels of goods for immediate use. Holders are, however, generally firm, and evince no apparent desire to force their goods on the market, or to accept other than late rates. Buyers seem, notwithstanding, disinclined to purchase, knowing that most descriptions of imported goods are heavy in stock, and the reputation this colony has borne of being unaffected by the late crisis, which has been so general in Europe and America, induces belief that more than usual shipments will be attracted to Melbourne. Liquors. There is no alteration to report in value of either bulk or bottled beers. The demand is steady, but by no means extensive. Sales are confined to parcels, chiefly of best brands, whlcb,|ln moderatojparcoli, bring quoted rates. Most preferred brands of Burton ales are not worth above 02. per had and Interior sorts dull of sale. For bottled beer inquiry is light, and small parcels only are saleable at quoted rates. In spirits very little business is doing. Case Brandies, of good medium brand!, are in fair request, but not to any extent. United Vineyard Co.'s are held for 37s. per dozen, at which rates sales have been effected during the week. By auction, good second-class brandies have realised 22s. per case, but lower descriptions are is but little demand, and prices unchanged. There has been some inquiry during the week for colorless old tom, which is rather scarce, and holders of this description are asking 4s. per gallon ; but for discoloured sorts there is no demand whatever. Hams of high strength are rather more saleable, but in small quart titles only, without change in value Gouovi ii in ICES inquiry, and for whiskey there is r little or no demand whatever. Good medium ports and sherries are saleable in small lots, but no extant of business is doing In these or any other class of wines. I Flour, Grain, c-The flour market continues very steady, and a disposition to speculate In this article has given a firm tone to the market. There has been a rather improved demand for country use, and buyers have paid from 212, to 222 10s. per ton for Adelaide, country, and town brands for small parcels. Tasmanian flour is held for 102 to 102. portion. Arno Tlcan barrel flour is in few hands, and held for advanced rates. Small parcels of this description have been parted with at from 222 to 232. per ton, but holders generally are looking for higher rates. Wheat is is rather better demand, and for prime samples 8s. 3d. to 8s. 6d. can be obtained ; Inferior sorts are being readily bought up for feeding purposes at from 7s. 6d. to 8s. Barley, The value of this grain has been much affected by the decline in the value of oats. Cape is nominally worth 7s. to 7s. 3d. ; English 7s. 6d. to 8s. Some imported parcels of the latter description, of quality unsalted for malting purpo CB, have been sold at from 6s. 2d. to Os.Sd. forcruuhlng for both food. Oats. Strenuous endeavors have been made during the LUt week to give an apparently improved value and apostle i to this, article; holders, however, appear ' more anxious to effect sales than to await further results, and the feeling generally appears, that even proton t quoted rates can hardly be sustained. Scotch and Irish can be purchased at from 6s. 6d. to 7s ; South Australian, 7s. to 7s. 6d. ; Tasmania, 7s. 8d. to 3s. Tai supply of Danish is chiefly In the hands of speculators, and are held at prices above currency of other descriptions. Branches Adelaide sorts are saleable at 2s. 7d. per bushel, and are in fair request. Both stocks and imports are light In amount, and although mill prices are below those of Imported sorts, advanced rates on present prices are looked for. Grass Is is very limited demand, and prices nominally rule from 162 to 174. per ton. Maize is very dull of sale, and cannot be quoted at above 8s. to 8s. 6d. per bushel. Provisions have been in but little (demand during the week, prime sorts alone being saleable. Hams and bacon have been In lighter demand, and prices somewhat easier. Really prime English cheese is scarce, 'and of ready sale at full quoted prices. Butter Imported sorts) has been in much loss inquiry. Considerable supplies of colonial make have come to hand, and beinggonorally of good quality, have much interfered with the sale of imported sorts, which have consequently been in less demand, even at reduced prices. Inferior qualities of provisions of all kinds, are still abundant, and unsaleable except at prices which afford no- market quotation. Candies. The demand continues brisk, large quantities of "spotted and injured sorts have been disposed of during the week by auc ' tion, which has affected the sale of sound parcels, and tended somewhat to reduce their value. Oilmen's Stores. Inquiry during the week has been light, and no sales of any amount are reported. Salad oil, mustard, and sauces are largely overstocked, and the chief sorts saleable consist of bottled fruits, jams, and pickles. Starch of boat matters is still inquired If or, and prices quite sustained. Soda crystals are in good inquiry; 182. Is offering for sound parcels in small casks, holders, however, refusing to sell under Crt7 naming. Groceries. Teas continue in very steady demand, and being in few hands are unlikely to decline in value; indeed, the sales by auction during the week of low qualities at very full rates have rather tended to on banco the value of really good teas. Interior to ordinary Congou kind have brought from 32. 7s. 6d. to 42. per half-chest, and 82 to 82 7s, 6d. per chest, and inferior gunpowder, 2s. 6d. per lb. Sugars remain very firm. The cargo of the Jemmy, from Mauritius, has been disposed of during the week at full market rates. The qualities consisted of good to And crystals, and from good brown to fine bright yellows, the former sorts bringing from 522. to 642. 10s., and the latter from 442. to 502. per ton ; a few lots of low dingy soft brown bringing from 852 15s. to 72. 17s, 6d. per ton. Large shipments of Manilla sugars have been made to Sydney, which will tend to give former rates for lower class sugars in this market. Oolloo.-Tho demand for this article has continued steady both for consumption and export, and its value has as yet been unaffected by the arrival of the cargo per Marion, from Ceylon. The consumption of this article usually increases at this season of the year, and the supply to hand being brought by a regular trader, and consequently looked for, is unlikely to affect the present market value. Echo-The transactions in this article have been very limited during the week; boldon? are, however, firm, and best samples of Patna are held for still advancing rates. Fruits. -> Raisins continue in good Inquiry, Muscatels, bloom, and other table sorts, Doing wanted, as well as inferior sorts, A portion of the arrival of Cape fruit has been disposed of by auction at 9d per lb. at invoice weights. Barcelona nuts, almonds, and walnuts, are of ready sale at full quoted rates. Timber There is a good demand for timber of all sorts suited for building purposes, and prices are fully supported. For timber in log the demand is considerable, and sales by auction have been effected during the week as high as 8s. 6d. per oubiofoot. Motors, offing to OXCCBSIVO stocks, are dull of sale, and although selections of any peculiar sort or she may bring advanced rates on invoice cost, any amount of sales is difficult to effect, even at Invoice prices.
