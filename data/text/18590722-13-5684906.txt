Fraser and Cohen, and, with the exception of some unimportant articles, was disposed of at full prices. 6,000 cases geneva, anchor and key brands, were placed at 14s. 6d. and half-costs at from 10s. to 10s. 4d. per case; 15,000 bushels Danish oats, a fine parcel, brought 4s. 6d. per bushel ; 2,300 boxes Gouda cheese, 10d. to 10d. ; 100 cases Edam cheese, 8d. to 8d. ; and do. loaf cheese, 9d. per lb. ; maccaroni and vermicelli, 6d, per lb. ; Bologna sausages, packed in lard, Is. 5d. per lb. ; ISLE matches, 5s. 2d per gross ; carraway seed, 5d. to 5d. j canary seed, 3d. per lb. ; Dutch firebricks, £9 5s. per 1,000 ; Portland cement, 27s. 6d. per barrel ; window glass, assorted size, 21s. 6d. per box.

The lots to be offered consist entirely of country lands, and comprise 10 sections at the Tyabb Waterholes, on the shores of Western Port Bay ; G lots near Messrs. Corbett and Jennings's pre-emptive sections, about five miles south-east of the township of Cranbourne ; 4 sections, of about 170 acres each, at Moorooduc, between four and five miles south of Frankston and 22 lots, varying in dimensions from 60 to 183 acres, situate near Robertson's pre-emp- tive purchase, west of the Cardinia Creek, and on the road to the Emerald Diggings. The annual general meeting of the Geale i{ Chamber of Commerce was held yesterday, who a the report of the Standing Committee was adopted. Messrs. Stephen Ibbotson and Balfour were re-elected members of the Committee, and Messrs. De Little and Dunn were elected in the room of Messrs. Buchanan and Hill. We sub- join extracts from the report : ' "WHARVES AND APPROACHES. " During the past year your Committee have frequently communicated with the Government In return came to the necessity of placing the approaches to the vharvcshiaslale of efficient repair, and have urged that the whole of the unexpended moneys be appropriated, first to the extension of the platform of the Yarra-street wharf as far as the metalled road away, a a J the remainder in lengthening the wharf itself, a 11 suggesting that if the funds in hand were insufficient to complete this important work on both side? of t so wharf, that the west side only should for provost be done and your Committee are happy to state in; the Board of Land and Works have complied with their recommendation in this respect. Tenders have aGO been invited for expending a sum of £4,000 votes in the Estimates for this year, for making further a Witton's to the Yarra-street wharf and iniproYeinsnU | thereto. I rosTAii service. I " 'ikjdospatcli, mo Queenscliffe, of a supplementary overland mail for embarkation on outward-bound I steamers, has also had the attention of your Committee, and they are happy to report that in this respect every advantage is now possessed by residents here, in a regard both to the receipt and despatch of the over- land mail via Marseilles. " The alterations which were made in July in the time of departure of railway trains from here to the ' metropolis deranged completely the postal service be tween Geelong and Melbourne, and your Committal corresponded with the Postmaster-General, with a ie how to secure more frequent and prompt delivery o.' I The mails, and they have now to report that letters p stock here up to 0 p.m. are delivered in Melbourne next morning at 9 o'clock. Your Committee have i Is been in communication with the Postmaster-Gene ; al, requesting that a later mail than the present ? 3.45 1 unsought be despatched, say at 7 p.m. fromMul 1 once, but they very much regret that at present, at Government plead inability to accede to their -uses'. Your Committee do not, however, intend to let the matter rest here, as they consider that the town and district are entitled to the same facilities in I t our postal arrangements as are enjoyed by the metropolis, ( and have secured the co- operation of the HU laarat Chamber of Commerce to carry out this desirable object. " Representations having been made to your Oj n mitten respecting the closing at Ararat of the mails Dr Geelong at an earlier hour than those for Melbourne, your Committee brought the subject under the notice of the Postmaster-General, by whom instruction were issued which have removed that cause of co a plaint. " The question of the detention of the English mail, caused by the delivery of the Ocoloi g portion at the Heads, having been frequently brought prominently before the public in the commercial article! in the) Melbourne papers, your Committee placed themselves in communication with the Collector of Customs, and have ascertained that the statements so made has been without foundation. " REMOVAL OF THE HALL. "The dredging operations on the bar have 33s attentively Watched by your Committee, and a correspondence has been constantly maintained with the Government upon this subject; and your Committee are happy to be enabled to state that there is every' reason to hope that the new dredge (now completely will be very shortly at work on the bar, and tim the Cutting will be carried on with vigor and all clancy. DIRECT IMMIGRATION TO GEELONG. " The discontinuance of direct immigration to this port was a subject very much dwelt upon by your Committee, and several appeals made to the Cover i mont to reconsider their decision and although they have not succeeded to the extent they could have wished, yet the Government have promised that upon the arrival of immigrants, the claims of Geelong to its fair share will not be overlooked, and, further, that the necessary accommodation at the depot will be still afforded. '. COAL FIELD AT HEIiMMNE. "Again the subject has been under the consideration of your Committee, and they have endeavored to impress on the Government the importance the discovery of a payable coal-field in the district would be to the colony, and requesting that the suggestions of Mr. Selwyn, the Government Geologist, might be carried out, and that a further search be made, in order that the question might be set at rest. A reply has been received from the Chief Secretary fully re- cognising the advantages that would be derived from such discovery, but regretting that there were no funds at the disposal of the Government for searching for coal in this district. Your Committee again requested that when the Estimates for the next year were preparing a sum would be placed upon them for this purpose. To this communication a reply has been received, that the request of the Chamber shall receive due consideration." The Advertiser reports the following solo which took place yesterday in Geelong : a " Messrs, W. M. Tennent and Co. hold a clearing sale by auction yesterday, at the stores of Mr. E, R.

The Mercury of the 18th inst. reports of the Hobart Town markets : - "The only arrival this week has been the Orkney Lass, from London, bringing a miscellaneous cargo, principally to order. A considerable portion of the cargo of sugar per June, from Mauritius, will be offered at auction on Tuesday. The India, from China, is daily expected with teas. The departure of the mail for England occupied chief attention in the early part of the week, but in the import market 1 generally business has been exceedingly dull. "Grain, Co-The upward tendency in wheat was checked on Monday by the telegraphic news from Melbourne, principal buyers not being disposed to go beyond 10s. per bushel after the receipt of our telegram, and, with two or three exceptions, that In been the outside figure till this morning, when an advance took place consequent on the firmness in the Melbourne and Adelaide markets, and sales have been made at 10s. to 10s. 8d., many holders refusing to take less than the latter figure. Oats have undergone no change, being still quoted at 8s. 6d. to 8s. 0d,, with scarcely anything doing. Barley is not much in re- quest-English fetches 6s., and Cape 4s. to 4s, 3d. Hay has not altered either in demand or value, loose and country pressed hay still ranging from £4 to £0 per ton, according to quality. Potatoes have been in light demand, the quantity taken away being inconsiderable ; best samples are quoted at £2 5s. to £2 15s. per ton. " Flour The flour market has been in an unless calls and unsettled state throughout the week, and the only sales made have been of small quantities just sufficient to satisfy immediate requirements, until this morning no quotations were fixed, millers asking £20, with no buyers; to-day, however, £20 per ton is given as the market figure for fine flour. Bran Ins continued steady at Is. 6d, to 1s. 6d. per bushel." The Marion has supplied us with later news from India and Ceylon. The following article, with reference to the proposal of the introduction of a gold currency into India, is taken from the Phoenix "The Englishman of yesterday, after stating that the Chamber of Commerce is proposing to address the Government in recommendation of a gold coinage for India, makes the following remarks : " ' There cannot be a double standard ; it is impossible for a Government to fix the relative value of two i metals, so as to compel people to take debased coin at the same weight as if it were metal of full weight and fineness. If gold were to be substituted for our present currency, an age or batta would soon be established proportionate to the demand for silver, just as there is now in all the markets of the interior upon bank notes. If the remitter of gold paid his money in a single bag to the country merchant, he would be charged with this in the price of the goods he purchased, for the nat) *e merchant who has to collect the produce from a thousand growers must settle with them in silver. If the Government took gold in all revenue payments to the i Mofussil treasuries, they would find it easier to soul to Calcutta than silver, but when it arrived here they could not pay it to the public creditor with whom their contract 16 in silver. In short, we do not see any way in which gold could be advantageously substituted for silver In a country where there are millions of small payments for one large one.' " The above is a summary, and a very excellent one, of all the disadvantages connected with the project of introducing age of currency Into India one of the save FrltoBchemes of the present Governor of Madras, Thus objections may be very shortly stated as follows t(I.) The present industrial condition of the people of Hin- costs will not admit of a gold currency for ordinary use. (2.) The Government has contracted with the public creditor In silver. " With respect to the statement that there canny, be a double standard, we at once admit its correctness, but the writer seems therefore to jump to the conclusion that we cannot have the use of both metals in tin mine country at once unless indeed, under the systems long adopted in many States on the Continent of Emopo-Government issuing a gold currency at a certain fixed rate as compared to silver, and publicly announcing that it reserved the right to alter the proportion at certain intervals, for instance, every three or six months, should the prices of precious metals have fluctuated in the meantime.' We would ask any of our readers who may see this assorted have they been so long in India that they have for- gotten that there are such things as sovereigns, shillings, and pence in England ; or have they ever handled rupees in pace since their arrival in the Hooghly? The sovereign is as much the standard of value in England as the rupee in India, and yet we see silver crowns, half-crowns, florins, shillings, and sixpences in plenty. Why should not this be done in India, and how was it my ringed A very tyro lil monetary matters knows well that nothing can be conceived simpler that the plan which was adopted for this end in the year 1840. Silver then ceased to be a standard of value in England, and now, an M'Culloch states in his Commercial Dictionary, forms merely a subordinate or subsidiary species of currency or change, occupying the same place in relation to gold that copper occupies in relation to itself. This was effected by coasting that gold coins only should be legal tender in all my mentS of more than 40s.' The pound of silver has lion which had been previously coined into 02s, war than, also comes into DO., the additional 4s. both: in cashed by Government as a seignorage or duty amounting to about 25 per cent. on the coinage. To prevent any depression by extra issues, Government has retained the power to issue in its on hands. Pray could not this system, which has: worked satisfactorily in England for more than 40 years, be introduced also into this country? We Box that to secure all the advantages of a silver currency, we have only to impose a moderate seignorage on this metal, taking care that no sewerage is demanded on gold. We must, too, impose a limitation oMlio amount for which these silver coins shall be legal tender, a id we must place the Issue solely in the hauls of Government. All this might be done in India as well 83 in England, if it were found advisable to introduce a gold currency and gold standard of value Into tin country. " Itisncodlcssforttsto describe the advantages of a mixed currency every person knows and feels the income essence of having to pay away a few areas, are finding no smaller cost than a rupee in the house Most people, too, are well aware how Inconvoiilo it a silver urgency is shortages payments are required A perfect currency, therefore, would make use of the cattle three under some such system as is open to! abuse It is indeed too true that in some districts large gold coins, especially if refused at the Treasury, would be always at a discount, but what business men have the gold coins in such a district, is here they are not wanted, and where they are always in disgrace I Depend upon it they would soon find their way to th j large towns and seats of commerce, where they would be in large demand We do not want to force a gold currency upon the people If the names of any day to let will have none of it and find it useless for their milk trade and petty transactions, let them remove it The only difficulty, however, would be this-how will the payment of the revenue be managed Î We believe this to be an almost fatal objection to any scheme for introducing a gold currency The zemindar must be paid in sill or, hut if this silver were issued, with a seignorage of duty exact Government would apparently be a loser by the scheme, if it should pay its own debts in (gold on which no seignorage had been, taken We have not, how over time to consider this at present, nor the question as to whether Government could arrange in any way the payment of Its debt in gold. We shall, however, rouen our remarks at as early a date as possible " By the Marion, from Ceylon, no have Colombo papers to June 9th, being 32 days' later date than the man also by the mail From the Colombo Obsci re, ii of extract the following items of con." j men curl intelligence - ' Colombo Export Prices Current - Cinnamon, per lb , 8d' to 11d , colite, native, lost contracts 47s per cat, as delivered by contractors, do plantation, none, coir rope por cut, 10s 6d to 11s 6d Junk, per cwt, none , j in 11s to 20s per out, all, cocoanut, per leaguer of 125 Imperial gallons, without casks, £13 10s , plumbago, po- ton, 60s to 120s dust and lumps, sugar, per cwt, 10s to 25s ; woods ebony, none in the market, Sapan, per candy, 'Is " Freights to England -Coffee in casks, per ton, £2 5s to 20s , do in bags, per ton, £2 to £2 2s. 6d, cocoanut oil per ton, of, junk in yarn in rolls, per ton, £1, cinnamon, none offering, plumbago, per ton, £1 5s deer hours, per ton, 15s , ebony, per ton, 15s to £1, cotton from Tutucoreon, no train motions ' Scale of Pi eights -The ton is reckoned as fol- 10s s -Arrack, 280 gallons, cinnamon, 8000 , cocoanut oil, 100 gallons, coffee, in bags, 18cwt , coffee, in casks. lOewt , coir and carnations 12cwt "cotton, 50 cubicles ebony and Japan wood 30cwt horns and copper, Kent , measurement goods, 50 cubic foot, plumbing, 30cwt Weights and measure) generally are British standard , arrack and cocoanut oil are sold by the leagues, or Butch measure of 1 5 gallons each and a good (dye and obonj)bytho candy of 545 The candy is occasionally reckoned at SOUth so that in bargains the equivalent of the candy in imperial should all as s be stated Timber is sold per ton of 50 cubic feet ' STOCK AND SHARE LIST.
