COMMERCIAL. ? +? ? Age Office, Saturday Evening. There wore no export entries passed at the Customs to-day for gold. The past wook has not been characterised by any largo amount of trade in tho import market, nor any marked improvement in prices. It will, however, comparo favorably with many previous weeks ; while the agreeable change in tho weather induces tho belief that the dulnoss and inactivity pervading the markots has reached tho turn in;; point ; and tho fact that, as the season advances, business must in creaso has imparted a cheerful aspect to tilings generally, tho want of which has hitherto had a most depressing effect. Tho demand from Now Zea land, we are glad to observe, is also better; and wo trust this will again prove tho commencement of an oxtonsive and profitable trade with that young but important colony. In our more detailed report it will bo seen that bulk ales havo not improved. Bulk stout is rather casior ; bottled, however, is firmer, and tends upwards, though prices are yet un altered. Cornsacka havo boon more in quired for, and are, consequently, stiffer. Candles roinain heavy. Coffee is steady. Currants aro still weak. Pudding raisins aro somewhat firmer. Flour has boon languid, but lelieved by tho purchaso of about four hundred tons in one line. Wheat hardly maintains previous ratos. Oats have been in request for shipmont. Maize is rather better. Gram is lower. Mult is vory dull. Hops have not fluctuated. Savo in castor, which has submitted to a reduction, there is no change in oils. Bottled fruits aro again scarce, and command higher rates. Butter and cheese do not look so healthy. Hams and bacon have not moved. In rice there havo been no transactions. Sugar has received no attontion. An ordinary trade has been done in tea. Tho finer sorts of tobacco aro well snpportod. Fine salt has boon largely dealt in, and advanced considerably in consequence. Fine brandies havo declined. A speculative purchaso iu geneva has taken place. The Foreign and British arrivals comprise one vessel from South Auierica, two from France, and one from England. Ale and Stout. — Holders of bulk ale do not re port any improved demand for that article ; for shipment to Now Zealand, Homo few orders havo been on tho market ; but, notwithstanding that, tho business dono lias only been moderate. Bass's No. 3, soils at £7. Allsop's is unaltered at £6 15s to £7 ; No. 4 realising £7. Marrian's finds trade buyers at £7 12s Od to £7 15s. Tho Carlislo Com pany's has been disposed of at £7 12s Od, a slight concession having boon mudo on one parcol of a hundred hhds for shipment. Tho Colonial Com pany's can bo bought at £G. Joule's is held for £7 15s. Iud, Coopc and Co.'s boing offered at £7. Scotch ales aro valued at £5 10s to £6. Bulk stout is difficult to quit, and prices aro a shade easier. Wo quote Taylor, Walker and Co.'s £0 15s ; Whit bread's, £0 15s ; and Allsopp'B, £G 10s. Bottled alo is not in any increased inquiry ; Muir's and Preston, for Scotch brands, command 10s Cd ; while Buss and Allsopp's do not bring over 9s Gd to 9s 9d. Salt's has boon sold at 9s 3d ; and tho Oolonial Company's at 8s Gd. Heavy Scotch bcera, fit only for winter consumptiou, havo changed hands at 7s to 7s Gd. Bottled stout is comparatively quiet, sales, however, huvo been effected during the weuk at 10s Gd to 10s 9d for Edmond's pig brand ; 10a to 10s 3d for Henry, White and Co.'s ; 9s Gd for Guinness and Blood's ; 9s for Dunphy's ; 8s 9d to 9s for Byass's ; 8s 3d for tho Colonial Company's ; and 83 Gd for Hibbert's. Since tho weather has assumed n inoro settled appearance, tiicro is u firmer tone evident in tho market for bottled beer. Baqoino. — There lias boon some inqniry for corn sacks, and soles havo been inado at 13s9dto 14s. As however, at these rates money is lost, holdors aro not anxious to soil. Woolpacks attract no notico : they aro valued at £5 ljd. Candles. — Tho auction sales have not been so oxtonsivo, and, privately, few parcels have been dis posed of. Bolmont'u, in sound condition have been placed at lid; damaged lota have brought 9Jd to 10^d ; The Nova Stearino Company's sell at lljd ; aud English and fino foreign can bo bought at 10^d to lOJd ; Brandon's light weights h ivc roaluud 8\i to 8Ad ; and other brands 7jd to 8d per packet. Coffee. — Sales aro on a moderate scale, Plan tution Ceylon being sold ut 10^d ; Native, at 9Jd ; and Java, at 10.|d. CmcoiiY is unaltered ; good brands caunot be obtained under 3Jd. CoNi'EOTioNisitY moots with fair trade atton tion, at lO.Vd to lid for nssorlod ; Is for Jujubes, aud la Id for candied peel. . Coudaoe. — Assorted invoices of Manilla aud Europe Manilla aro offered at £4G ; small sizes alone cannot bn got under £50 ; Bengal linos arc valued at £14 ; Europe bolt ropo has been sold at £G0 ; soauiing twino coininunds Is 2Ad to la 2Jd. Cement. — Portland is quiot at IGs, and American planter at 153. Stocks iu first bauds are, however, getting rapidly absorbed, and pricos aro shortly es pected to improve. Coals. — A cargo of Hetton Company, ex Erelina Ratter, was disposed of at auction, at 27s. 50 tons English steam coal, ex Hero, sold for 23s. The market is freely supplied, and the demand is not active. Chemicals. — Soda crystals arc worth £8 15s to £9 ; sales having been made at the latter rate. Caustic soda brings £18. Flower of sulphur, £18 to £20. Tartaric acid has been sold at 2s 2d por lb. Opium is held for £200 per chest. Rosin has realised 42s Gd to 45s per cwt. Fish. — Herrings continue without change — other than for trado wants thero is little or no inquiry ; 2fis Gd to 27s is got for half-barrels, and 10s for firkins. Supplies of- ling do not meet tho demand, which readily carries off all that is offered at 5Jd. Fruits. — Currants have declined to 4Jd, with a slow sale. Loose Muscatel pudding raisins have sold so freely at 5d, that an advance to fljd is con templated by holders ; layers rsII at Gd to 7d. Capers hare been disposed of at 7d to 7£d. Dried apples, Gd to GJd ; figs, 5.Jd to Gd. 550 bags dates, iu faulty condition, were quitted at ljd per lb. Flour and Grain. — During tho most of the week, the flour market has beon very inanimate, business having been limited to inoro trade pur chases, with the exception of ono sale of four hundred tons of a mixed lot of Adelaide town and country brands. On Hart's and Magaroy's a reduc tion of 10s is reported, thoso being now offered at £15 ; for ordinary Adelaides town brands we quoto £14 15s, and country make £14 5s. Moyne and Merri mills boing £13 5s to £13 103. Adelaido wheat, though held at Gs Gd, cannot realise this figure — a parcel was placed at less money ; for Vic torian os 9d to 6s is askod. Feeding barley, though scarce, and bringing 4s 9d to 5s, does not com mand a largo sale ; malting sells for 6s. For fine colonial oats, for feeding purposes, a brisk inquiry for shipment has been experienced, but supplies aro very short, 6s to 6s 3d is obtained for tho best sorts, and 5s 7d to Gs for secondary quality ; for milling 6s Gd can be got. Danish are valued at 5s, and good Scotch 4s 3d. A parcel of gram has be:'n sold for shipment also at £10 10s. Maize is in improved sale and firmer, 4s 5d to 4s Cd being freely paid. Bran, not coming forward very readily, has advanced to Is 7d. Colonial oatmeal and poarl barley sell for £30 to £31 ; for Scotch not more than £24 can be quoted. Gunpowdf.r. — For blasting, best brands, 7Jd is asked — buyers, however, do not caro to invest at over 7d to 7Jd. Hops. — G2's, in faulty condition, sold for Is Id, and damaged American, at 5^d to 8Jd ; for sound and well conditioned parcels of Kent, Is 4d to Is 8d is asked, and Is 3d for American. As yet tho demand is not largo. Malt continue languid, the few sales making being for trado purposes, ut 8s 3d to 8s Gd ; for bins there is no inquiry. Metals. — As no sal«sof pirj iron have como under our notice, our quotation of £3 15s must still be con sidered nominal. Corrugated has not been active, ive quote £33 to £35 for good to best English brands, and £26 to £29 for Scotch. High hauibers black fencing wire, say 6 and 7, aro wanted and valued at £16 to £17; No. 4 is worth £14. Shoot load is firm at £27, and zinc is worth £30 to £31. Oils. — Linseed, iu trade lots, brings Gs 3d to 6s Gd. Castor, since recent arrivals, has fallen to 4s 9d and 5s, and buyers, expecting a further de cline, refuso to operate at those rates. Keroseno is. quiet at 2s lOd to 2s lid for Couzzens's and Dow ner's ; and 2s 8-1 for second rate brands. Colza is worth Gs. Of Chinese, which is wanted, the market is very bare. Oilmen's Stores. — Prices continuing vory low, importers have found no inducement in offering at auction, where only what is actually wanted will bring anything like a fair rate. Bottled fruits are again scarce, and valued at 12s Gd ; 1 lb jams have declined to 10s 9d ; Whybrow's pickles have been sold at Gs Gd ; Joyce's at*7s ; Hill and Co.'s 7s 9d ; Feast's, damaged, 4s 9d ; red cabbage, 7s Gd ; Col man's- blue, 9Jd to lOd; starch, 4Jd to 4|d; salad oil, half-pints, Gs 6d ; pints, lls ; and quarts, 23s ; Lea and Perrin's sauce, 12s ; vinegar, 8s ; patent groats, 8s ; oysters, 1 lb, 12s to 12s Gd ; lobsters, 7s 3d ; half-pints castor oil, Gs to Gs 3d ; 1 lb salmon, 16s 9d to 17s ; quarters sardines, Gs 3d, and halves, 9s 3d; cloves, 4§d; black pepper, 4d; arrow-root, at auction, brought 5d ; Chinese preserves, 14s Gd per case ; pearl sago, 3Jd. Provisions.— On Monday, 500 firkins butter, ex White Star, offered at auction, averaged 8ijd. During the week several parcels bavo been quitted at 9d to 9Jd for now ; old lias been sold at 7d to 8d, the latter iiguro having been got for a lot of su perior. Hams and bacon aro firmer though not in much roquest; Sinclair's we still quoto Is Id and Is.; Compton's and Coey's, Is all round. Eng lish hams bavo been quitted at lOJd, and bacon at 10£d. North Wilts cheese, fair averago quality, has been placed at Is, showing a decline of Id. Quicksilvek presents no chango. Sales aro limited, at Is 9d to Is lOd for California and Spanish. Rice. — Holders of Patna are firm in thoir de mands, but as buyers refuse to pay £22, no sales havo been effected ; and, in the mean timo, whilo carriage remains as at present, and country orders cannot be executed, thero is no desire to buy. Salt. — Coarse looks stronger. At tho prices of fering no stored parcels can be obtained ; whilo, for some time past, thero havo beon inoro buyers than sellers, and shipments as they arrive havo boon readily picked up at £2 15s. Yesterday, £2 17s Gd was paid for a small lot. This article would appear thus to have soen its lowest. In fino, a speculative movement has taken place — tho whole of that on tho spot, as well as all that is to arrive, having boon bought up at £3 7s Gd to £3 10s, on which a very considerable advance is now demanded. Sugar.— Tho quantity offered last week, has, for the timo, sufficiently supplied dealers' wants, and vory little business has, in consequonc, been dono during tho present, fino white crystals at £3G being tho only description which obtained any notico. Wo quoto rations £21 to £22 10s ; medium counters, £23 10s ; good, £24 to £24 10s ; fine, £26 5s to £20 10s; brewing sorts, £27 15s to £28 10s; yollow crystals, £31 to £33 ; grey to white, £34 to £30. Tea. — A fair amount of trade bas been done in this staple, tho cheapest descriptions of congous baring gone off well. These havo realised Is lOd to 2s. Medium, 2a to 2s 2d ; and fine, 2s 3d to 2s Gd and 2s 8d ; boxes, 29s to 30s. Orange pokoes have met with trade buyers at 2s 4d to 2s 5d, and gunpowder at similar rates. Toiiacoo. On Tuesday a large sale of aromatic sorts took place, whon the following prices wero ob tained : — For half-pounds, Peter Oluis, Is to 4s OAd ; Imperial, 4s ; Sir Francis Drake, 4s ; Pippin, 4s Id ; do, all faults, 3s 8d per lb. For pound lumps : Prido of Havannah, 4s ; Jones, 4s ; Watson's Pioneer, 4s ; Wobb and Whitbed, 4s 2d ; Garratt's, 4s ; Barrett's, 4s por lb. For fancy kinds, Atlantic cable, 4s 4d ; Rose twists, 4s OAd to 4s Id ; Planter's Prido, 4s Oid ; Bouquet Twist, 4s Id per lb. About 200 packages were disposed of. Though tho mar ket is largely supplied with Northern and inferior, the stock of Virginian und Southern leaf tobaccoea has become very circumscribed. Dealers aro quite conscious of this fact, as well ns tho difficulty in replacing theso, hence tho reason of tho high rates now obtained. Wo observo tho market will again be tested on Tuesdaj' next, another sale being advertisod for that day. Wo quoto Northern tons, Is Gd to 2s ; halves, 2s Gd to 8s ; Southern tens, 2s Gd to 3s ; and halves, 3s 3d to 4s ; aroraatics, 4s 3d to 4s Gd ; twist, 3s Gd to Is and 4s Gd to 5s. TisiuKit. — Little business has transpired this week. Tho market continues heavy, nnd presents no uppcaranco of an immedioto improvement. Tho only Rale reported is 90,000 feet redwood flooring boards, ex Royal Visitor, at 12s 3d per 100 foot. Wines and Spirits. — Wo cannot report more favorably of ports and sherries, which remain do pressed. Common ports, at £30, havo been sold ; aud sherries, at £10, in bond, aro saleable A re duction bos taken place in the price of fino brandies, Martell's dark having been sold at 10s ; pale is Rcarcc, and valued at IO3 9d to lls. ; Honnessy's dark, 10s to 10s Od.

Go 'veva is rather easier, JDKZ low duties, selling at 10s 3d ; and higher, at 10s. A parcel of 4500 cases clmngod hands yesterday, and this will tend to stiffen tho market, the price did not transpire. V. H. & Co., in trade lots, sells at 10s to 10a 3i. Common brands remain unsaleable. Thero is no demand for rum, 10 o.p. is valued at 2s 9d ; a small lot of Lemon Hart's was placed at 2s 10di ; 30 o.p. is worth 3s Gd to 33 9d. Whiskey is dull, Islay in bulk has been sold at 4s, and other brands we quote at 3s Gd to 3s 9d for caso ; there is no inquiry at 10s Gd to lls Gd. Old Tom is worth 13s 3d.

The quantity of gold dust imported into tho same establishment during the week, for the purpose of coinage, bus been 4816 ounces. There has been a little more doing in our markets during tho week, but prices aro no better. The principal sales at auction have been in damaged teas, which have brought good prices, but that can not be tuken as a fair test of tho market. Since our monthly summary, there has been no material alter ation in the rates ruling for articles of general con sumption ; it is unnecessary, therefore, to give our usual weekly report. Ou Wednesday, Messrs L. E. Threlkel and Co. held a large sale of groceries aud oil men's stores, when the shipment of teas ox AngloIn dian was offered, and a largo portion disposed of at tho following prices : For congou, in chests, £7 ; in half-chests, £3 12s 6d ; and boxes, 26s.
