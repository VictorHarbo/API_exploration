'A reply to this effect was 'received by the manager of the Company, Mr. 'Grant.iri re sporise'tp his inquiries as to the, cause of the unusual delay in the settlement of the quar ter's account. Mr. Grant immediately Com mukicate'd with the Chief Secretary, point ing out the great incdnveriience to 'which he was being put1 by the action of the; Government, and the injustice of with holding payment of the account in the existing position of affairs. ' The matter has since been discussed by the Cabinet,1 when the reasonableness of Mr. Grant's arguments , was recognised,, , and |it was. agreed, £hat the Government :wpre hardly, warranted,, in the, absence oi the expected, report, in ; withholding the ; whole ? .of , the ? quarter's account. . The result is . that a.' compromise has been , arrived at;; whereby, the, ; account )has been, paid over to. 'the. Company, less the sum of JJ1500, ;which is still withheld by the Olovernment as a set-, off against the,, 'items- in .dispute.', The balance has,.. been paid, over- to the.Con^T. pany under, a, special. ,r.cceipt.;: '^e, under-' stand that'thebus^ness of . the Company |br the last half-year- showed.. a prQfit of 4400. Tasjianian 'Snobbery^— The', ..writer of 'Echoes ;and;Iie.;echoes-.-iin ,the Adelaide Observer of January. .24 says::— The las manian Club ieel hurt that,their motives in rejecting Graham Berry because he kept a shop shouldthaye been miBContrued. It was politics, not. cabbages, that influenced, them. The. shop ..suggestion- was only a mild subterfuge,.,- ? ,The lastnanian Club is like that indigenous animal/the Tasmanian Devil— very tenacibus'bf what it takes hold of, and ; what 'if grips it gnaws.- It is- disi, posed to' gnaw--— or, rather.igriore— Graham Betry, but (that wiis, not' an inventive genius who raked up the shop: .They might lave; objected to the shape (of | Graham's head, the cut-of ? his' clothes;' his style of s'peeph, or-.his'mqde, of wea'ririg his beard.' Probably' the Tasmanian: Club ' will publish its 'politics, and 'then Graham Berry might i find inconvenient td'cut'his;bwn '.to fit. ' It is top 'utterly iitter is. thatTasmanian Club,' andnp dbiibt there. will:be a riish of aristo crats^, to' join1 it; 'We' have' lots ? of them', here. -After the rejection of 'Graham Berry '. there will be' no chau'ee for ttio' Marquis' of Lbrnej because1 he has a relative who went into the mercantile lincvrhich is shopkeep- ; ing of nrhigher'degree. Prince Alfred was a cabinetmaker, and had he lived' might haye: sighed in vain for admission into the Tasmanian Club. Even a pedigree :traced back to William the Conqueror would be , useless, because 'William's grandfather was : ' weny 'umble.'; Give the Tasmanian Club, a, chance, .and they would want a1 character with the Prince of Wales. ? ?-. '? : , The RECiPRpciTT Treaty.— The New Now South Wales Press does riot favour the treaty . recently , drafted between the! Victorian and Tasiiariiau delegates, aiid a'pppai;sVtp regard it as an aggressive union against the, pareritcolony. The SM. Herald' :says:4-In itself a differential tariff agree-, 'ment between Victoria and Tasmania may riot'mean much. The significance of the ?thirig.lies.inthe'.fact that' it may be the Tjeginnirig of a iriovemerit for the establish ment of an intercolonial protective league against New South Wales. The agreement with .Tasmania once , completed will open the , .way. to a similar agreement with Queensland, 'and afterwards with South Australia. Queensland, with her sugar industry, and .South Australia, with her wines, have special reasons for seeking access to wider markets; and' by joining in such agreement's whilst New South. Wales, stands, outside^ ^hey, would look for wider ;markets, protected against ' competition from New South Wales, as well as from the rest of the world. ,The original agreement, 'between. Victoria .would 'be, if not the basis,' ' the jtype of the rest. And ' we, because we did Vndt join' in, seeking tliis protection,' 'should findthe force -of it directed.' against ourselves.' The S.A. Advertiser regards 'thejjirbp'osals favourably, and remarks.that, ',' itVcarinot fail-to.be seen that the outcome of the, conference is a decided ' step ' in the' 1 direction of free trade between the colonies, ' rior can it be . doubted that' it is only a question of time, as to when this shall have become an accomplished fact, although, it is only reasonable to suppose that when free trade is -established1 between the different provinces of JAustralasia it will be : oh' the basis ofa'protective tariff as against the rest of the world: This ;idea, indeed, is already - being ? realised ? in England, and events in these: colonies appear 'to be rapidly tending towards such;a commercial .federation. ? The people both of , Victoria and Tasmania may be congratulated on the result of the Hobart conference; The pro posed arrangement cannot be regarded as 'other than an excellent one, and . it will doubtless prove advantageous to both colonies. The only regret which it suggests is that instead of covering the two colonies ? .which are smallest in area it does not apply to the whole of the . Australasian group. Unquestionably the establishment of such commercial relatkns.wpuldsoon be followed ,by,that political federation, the desirable ,'ness of which, is, daily becoming more apparent,. The voice of Australia would then bo the. voice of , an Undivided dominion instead of that of a number of separate provinces,. ' the 'united, , opinion of which , is, now difficult' to express with 'sufficient 'emphasis.'
