LITERATURE. PUBLICATIONS RECEIVED. "IN SEVEN LANDS." "In Seven Lands," by Ernest Alfred Vizetelly (Chatto and Windus).—This book forms the third volume of Mr. Vizetelly's reminiscences of his earlier years. After telling in . two previous; works—"My Days pf Adventure," and "My Adventures in the Cbmmune"-rhi9 French experiences during the. war and the insurrection of 1870-1871, he in the third book reeallu his impressions of men and' things in other European countries during tlie years that followed.- Iho seven lands'of Mr. Vizetelly's .wanderings, • are Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. The book is certainly a valuable commentary on the, . Jifq of the period in each of the countries mentioned. The'author has a delightful;' "narrative style, and has the journalistic in* stinct of being able to see interesting things, and to present them in an iu terestinjjf way. Though his book deals -with things as they were in the seventies,, every incident or story-is sograpdricully 1 told', every picture so clean-cut, and so charged with life and interest, that one reads it almost with the avidity that one would bring to a book dealing with these countries since the war ;broke out. Especially interesting are the, clear sketches of notable persons, their foibles, and follies, with historical and biographi cal details, .and also the curious dnd queer manners and customs of the peoples visited. •In his preface the author tells us that ho travelled in,, all. the countries named (excepting Italy) in company with his father, and that this book is based in part on his own recollections and notes, and in part on many memoranda which his ..', father cent him before his deathi "The present volume," 'he says, "will epeak for ■ itself. While it is founded on the-joint experi ences of my father and myself,, I have now and again ' interpolated excursions into matters of legend and history. For instance, in the.section allotted to Ger many, I have given some account of.the. •saintly 'ancestor* of t"he Hohenzollerne, , and have referred to the latest • views respecting the identity of the .'White liady'., of- Berlin," - (This ghostly:.visitant is 'supposed to. warn "members ; of; x; tlie \- Kaisers", family of. impending disaster.

'■?'■: About Alsace, and Lorraine, aftsr the German annexation, Mr. A'izetelly has somethiiig to say which has in it food for reflection:—"At the time when I visited the-pi'ovirices witlr-my-'father, in 1872 the situation- was painfully interesting;: There were_ still many traces : of the, recent great coiifliet, •. and - the., people were depressed ■-■and . apprehensive.

The(economic situation was bad, moreover, by reason of the substitution of the German for the, French coinage. .When; I'was again in the.provinces a, few years later, the sub stitution of the mark for the franc-as a standard coin had. tended to make every thing proportionately dearer. The pro vinces were ceded to Germany! free., of.all public'debts. Eight years later, however! an average of £2 per annum was imposed on each inhabitant to meet.debts incurred by the German administration.. The French language was not finally abolished in legal proceedings until 1888, but German at once became obligatory for all public bodies', municipal councils,: and so forth; and even although for some years an ad vocate . might be allowed to plead in., Frericlr in' a- court of law, he found the-; Code Napoleon, with which he was familiar, abolished, and German enact ments substituted .in f! its,- place.,' The French Code, such as it still existed under Napoleon 111., was by ho means perfect, oh,, which'; account; it.has been bo pro-, foundry modified by the Third Republic that, its first' authors.-would 'nowadays'1 fail to recognise it. .Nevertheless it -was; far more just and liberal:than the legisla tion which the Prussians' brought intps Alsace-Lorraine.. ...'■.■.-. : . ..-'■'; ..-. ,'• ■ • ■■'■'All ■'•"signs' of ■ sympathy with France were severely rpimislied, by the masters of. the' ~ provinces. .The most trivial offenoos were visited^'1 with r hard,, labour- or solitary confinements No .paven'tv , Vv-as -cllowed to give a French 'Christian name to a newly-born child. ,A .father' who desired to call- his boy Rene (a r' familiar name., in Lorraine) ,' was severely . -creprimonded, .but a110wed.....t0- have the child christened Renatus, ■ it being graci-; ously conceded that there /was no pbjec-. tion to Latin.

"With the Anzacs in Egypt," by Lieut. David Doull, has been issued by J. A. Packer, Sydney. It is a series of sketches descriptive of life and scenes in the land of the Pharaohs, as seen through Aus- tralian spectacles. It might have been left to the reader to discover that the writer was "one of the Gallipoli heroes"; but for fear it should not be apparent to the dull minded, and that thus the writer should be allowed to go lacking his due share of public hero- worship, the title-page shouts out in capital letter, "by Lieut. David Doull, one of the Gallipoli heroes, who was with the 17th Battalion." Apart from its shock- ing lack of modesty, this an- noun cement has its interest because of the eccentric way in which the word "battalion" is spelt. The book is well printed; and has twenty excellent illus- trations. The writer, in his introduction, says, "Scsrcely any apology, it is felt, is necessary for sending out into the crowd- ed world of literature another volume dealing with life and scenes in the his- torical land of the Pharaohs. For over two years (sic!) that country has been, especially to the Australians, of peculiar interest from the fact of its forming the principal, if not the only, base for mili- tary operations against the Turkish and German forces on the Gallipoli Penin- sula. Australia's soldiers fill its busy streets and bivouac on its deserts ; Aus- tralian money flows into its treasury and industries ; the fame of Australian soldiers echoes throughout the length and breadth of its populous regions. . . . . Many of the scenes which it is the prig- liege of our soldiers to gaze upon have remained unchanged throughout the long ages of the past. Such of these as the writer feels will prove of interest to those good Australians whose duties lie in the quet paths of peach he has endeavoured to depict, and invites the reader to wander with him for a while through quaint villages where the fellahin toil in the sun-glare beside the slow-moving Nile, to linger in the gloom of the tombs of the mighty dead, or to rest in the quiet shade of the date palms." This suf- ficiently describes the scheme of the book, which is interestingly and at times brightly written.
