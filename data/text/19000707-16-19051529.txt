It is a well-known fact that Agents hold- ing appointments in the service of a good, ?sound, Life Assurance Society, transacting both ordinary and industrial busints,, posteas many advantpges over thoEie i Agatnts em- ployed in the procuration of life proposals for oidinary life nssurance offices. The following are a lew of the advan- tages : 1\. The special feature of Industrial Life Assurance is the easy mode of payment of premium-viz.. by weekly or monthly instalments. Thus the benefits of life as- surance are within the reach of all classes oÇ the community. 2\. The issue of whole-life policies is not limited to a,di\lts|, «as; Js usually the case .with offices confined solely to the transac- tion of " ordinary" business. Children from any age are eligible for " industrial" life policies ; consequently a practically in- exhaustible field for the cultivation of now assuranco is opened to the " industrial" life nssurance agent. 3\. In Great Britain one out of every two and a-half of the entire population is as- sured in the various industrial Ufo offices. Before the same proportion is reached in Australia thousands of additional ." indus- trial" policies will require to be issued. This means an enormous lousiness etlll re- mains lo be done Jn every centre of popu- lation throughout Australia. 4\. Agents working for au office such as the Temperance and General Mutual Life Assurance Society, which is the only mutual, the oldest " industrial" life office In Aus- tralasia, the first to admit " industrial" policy-holders to participate in profits, and transacting both "ordinary" and " indus- trial" llfo assurance business, possess a great advantage over those agents working for an office confined to the transaction of ordinary business alone. 5\. An Agent employed In the service of the Temperance and General Life Office will not only earn for himself a liberal remunera- tion cn the introduction of new case3, but a continuing commission for the collection of premiums on «such " Industrial" cases as may be intrusted to him. By patience; pluck, and perseverance on Ibis part the agency must become from week to week more remunerative, important, aud per- manent. Previous Experience Unnecessary, References Required.
