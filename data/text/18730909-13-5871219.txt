SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. INTRODUCTION. The political events of the past month have been to some extent of an exciting character. In our last summary for England it was stated that the length of the session would greatly depend upon the manner in which the Legislative Council dealt with the Electoral Act Amendment Bill which had then just passed the Legislative Assembly. Any doubt that there may have been on the subject has been determined. The bill his been rejected in the most emphatic manner, and cannot be again brought for ward during the present session of Parlia ment. The Legislative Council took time to consider the course it would pursue with regard to the measure, After the first reading, the second reading was post poned foir14 days, and did not come on for consideration until the 20th of August. Led by Mr. O'Shanassy the Council then, by a majority of 16 to 10, carried an amendment on the second reading to the effect that the bill be laid aside. This course was avowedly adopted because it was considered more courteous to the Legislative Assembly than actually re jecting the second reading, or carrying the ordinary amendment in such cases—that the bill be read a second time that day six months. A large number of members of the Legislative Assembly, however, took in opposite view, and, when the matter was brought before them, argued that the conduct of the Council was most insulting. According to precedent bills are laid aside only when the priveleges of the House taking that step are affected, and the objection is more to the manner than the matter of the measure, so that the chamber adopting such a course may pro tect its priveleges, and at the same time by bringing in a similar bill in another manner not interfere with the practical legislation of the country. The bill in question however, did not in the slightest degree touch the Legislative Council, it simply dealt with the repre sentation of the people in the Legislative Assembly. A lengthy debate upon the action of the Legislative Council took place in the Assembly, during which it was very warmly asserted that some steps must be taken to bring the two branches of the Legislative more into accord with each other, though how this desirable end was to be attained was not very plainly indicated. One hon. member suggested that the Imperial Government should be appealed to with the view of an alteration in our Constitu tion ; but this proposition was received with a perfect storm of "noes," a large numbei of lepiesentatn es being ev tdently of opinion that it would be belter to suffer any mconv einenco th in to inv oko the interference of the Impenal au tho nties with our local aflairs Ultimately, in order that there should be no doubt as to tho intention of the Couucil in laying the bill aside, tho Government resolv ed that their lepresent itive in the Ippei House should re introduce the bill Mi Ti asor, accoi dingly, on tho 2nd September gave notice that on tho follow- ing day ho would mov o that the measure be restoied to the notice papoi Tho Pro , «dent ruled that this course could not be taken, and Mr. Fraser immediately asked leave to introduce a now bill with a simi- lar title, admitting that it was identical nith the measure that had been laid aside. Some doubts were then expressed as to whether oven that course could be- taken, but on the succeeding day the President, guided by precedents of tho Imperial Parliament, ruled in tho ailirnia tiie. Several membors, howe vor, dis- agreed with him, and tho first reading of the new bill was rejected by a majority oí 12 to 7, a few members declining to vote. Tho bill is thus lost for the session, and tlie question remains what will tho Government do? A tack, and another deadlock, has been hinted at, but that is out of the question. Such a proceeding ltould only bo tolerated by a foyv turbulent spirits who are never at peace -ave when they are at war. The Governor might prorogue for a short timo in order to allow the bill .to bo introduced in a now session, and if there was any ex- pectation that such' a course would lead to a settlement of the differences between the two Houses, it would no doubt be a desirablo one, but there is icasonable hopo that tho Legislativo Council would in such a caso alter its decision. Then, again, it must bo re- membered that tho present Parliament is a moribund one. In February next if «pires by eflluxion of time, and the country will thon have a fair opportunity of expressing its opinion both upon the till in question and upon another measure of a comprehensive nature providing for the reform of the Legislativo Council, which, as the Chief Secretary lias already indicated, it is tlio intention of tho Go temment to place before the consti- tuencies. ino action ot tho Legislative council | wth icspect to the Mining on Private Propel ty Bill is of a far more question- able character than that with regard to the Electoral Bill. In two succeeding «ssioiiB this bill passed the Legislativo A-sembly by overwhelming majorities. List session the Upper House mado such amendments in it a3 to alter it into a bill for preventing all mining on privato pro- perty. This session tho Council referred i' to a select committee, and when tho recommendations of that committee wero brought up, hold that thoy wore imprac- ticable, and again shelved the bill. Tho pcoplo of the mining districts affected aro greatly irritated by this treatmont of a measure which is of very considerable im- portance to them. There is no doubt but that thu report of tho committee was ono Mich could not havo boen adopted ; but «ia felt that the Council should have / >do some reasonable effort to moot tho ihcsof the miners and tho viows of the .Assembly upon so important a question. Somo progress has been mado with tho weasurea of law reform introduced by "J0 Attorney-General. The proposed '»bohuon of the County Courts, and tho contingent increase in tho number of JMges of the Suprome Court has, how «c. been abandoned, and tho bills, if 'ney become law, will bo limited to pro- dding for tho hearing of issues of law T« equity at the samo time, and to «iMcasmg tho jurisdiction of tho police courts m civil matters. the Victorian Government have thrown len tho postal servico uicí Gallo, for nen a contract hits been entered into Mill the P, and o. Company, to all tho other colonies, upon tho simplo condition that they pay the postages on the letters, newspapors, and packages sent by tho route, and undertake thou own branch services South Australia, however, does not need a branch service, and, there- fore, ni addition to the postages, will haxo to pay £5,000, half tho cost of tho tíeíw» tho mail steameis will havo to mako to land the mails for that colony at Glenelg These terms havo been accepted by all the colonies, and it seems certain that for ono or two yeal s at least Victoria will have tho carrying of all the mails, in which case the receipts aro expected to cover tho wholo cost of tlie service. Now South Wales, it is saul, will not attempt to establish tho San Francisco line until tho new steamors, which are to secure a tw eh o-knot service throughout, aie ready. SOCIAL hi social matters events of a widely differ- ing character have occupied public attention, but amongst those of a pleasurable nature the most prominent was the fancy dress ball given by the Mayor of Melbourne, Mr Thomas O Grady, m the Town hall, on Wed- nesday, 27th August The entertainment did not equal those of a similar sort given in honoui of the Duke of ..dmbuigh's visit and in celebration of the opening of the Town hall, but it was, nevertheless, a very successful affair, and waa a worthy example of the generous hospitalities dispensed by the niajois of Melbourne About 1,500 guests weie present, including His Kxcel lency the Oovemor and Lady Bowen It has been resolved to give a return ball to the mayoi, but the date has not jet been fixed.

An alarming accident occurred on the 20th August on the Government line of railway about a mile and a half from Geelong. As the goods train for Ballarat, leaving at 11 o'clock, was passing under the bridge leading to Kildare, a terrific explosion was heard, and volumes of smoke and steam were ob- served to ascend from the engine. It was found when the steam had cleared away that the boiler of the engine had burst, and that the engine itself had been pitched over on its side and partially buried in the ground The tender was thrown across the rails, and its wheels imbedded in the ballast metal, one of the wheels of the engine being driven into the side The engine driver, named Auguste De Parjanan, and the stokei, Thomas Mac- namara, sustained painful injuries, and had an almost miraculous escape with their lives. A number of trucks were overturned, and altogeth the damage was done to tho extent of £900 The accident, according to the report of the locomotive overseer of railways, arose from a defect in one of the boiler plates, which could never have been in a sound state. The engine was built by Messrs | Slaughter Grunning, and Co, of Bristol, in 1861 A sudden death has occurred under pe- ' culiar circumstances Mi.

At the inquest it was show u that the deceased was generally in good health, although he some- times was known to have suffered from liver disease The cause of death was con- ¡ gestion of the brain and lungs, arising, m the opinion of the medical men wlio ex- amino- the body, probably from over-fatigue or exhaustion or from want of proper food Elizabeth Shannon, the woman who killed her infant at Hotham by the administration ¡ of laudanum, and attempted to take tho lives of her three other children by similar means, endcav ounng subsequently to commit suicide by cutting bel throat with a bieid knife, has been brought to tnal It was urged by counsel for the defence tint the poison was giv en accidentally to the infant, or, if it was dono intentionally that the act being without a motive, showed that the pn soner must have been insane Mr Justice 1 ellows told the jury that theie was no evi dence of insanity, that the mere commission of a cume w as no proof that the poison w ho committed it was insane, but he consented to leserve the question for the full Comt Ihejurv, after deliberating three hours, an nounced that they had agreed on a veidiet of "(juilty, ' but were not unanimous as to the prisoners state of mmd His Honoui told them he could not accept that verdict and repeated that theie was no evidence of insanity , if the jury did not choose to t ike the law from linn he coidd not help it 1 lie jury deliberated again till neaily midin-dit, when, as they could not agree they weie dis cbaiged, and the prisoner was lemanded A savage and cowardly attempt to murder has been made on a woman named Ann Jones, at Ellis Thomas's Temperance Hotel, 101 A\ ilium street, Melbourne, by a yoting man named John Casey The woman Ann Jones, who is said to be well known it Ballarat, was employed as cook at Thomas's Hotel and Casey was also emplojed theie as " washer up ' No one saw the offence com nutted, and theie appears to have been no adequate cause to piovoke the act, but fiom the statements of the inmates of the house and the wounds found on the woman the en cumstantial evidence is very strong that Casey attacked her with a sledge hammer on slight provocation in a most determined and savage manner 'The woman was found lying senseless on the ground, and Casey had the hammer in his hand He was asked, What have you done ?

THE HPW ELECTORAL BILL The second reading of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was moved by the Commis- sioner of Publie Works, who represents tho Gov ernment in the Upper House, on August 2b. Mr 0'Shana8sj, the leader of the Oppo sitien, proposed, as an amendment, that the bill be laid isidc He denied that it had been shown that any increase m the number of members of the Legislative Assembly was neeessarj Tlio legislative business which members of til it Chamber li id to undertake had not mci eased to such au extent that an assembly containing 78 members vyos not able to Jeal with it The bill had been in- troduced simply because the Government, in consequence of their action when m Opposi- tion, were logically compelled to bring it m In a house oí78 members it was diflicult for a Government to correct inequalities of representation, but it was easy to get out of that difliculty by increasing the number of members The fact that it was easier to add 12 new seats than to equally redistribute the 78 already in existence no doubt furnished the Government with a strong motive for introducing the bill Observ ation and expe- rience had shown that in this country, the momenta Ministry was changed, there was practically no Opposition, m the Lnghsh sense of the temi Under those circum- stances, the Administration m power were tempted to nilroduco many measures with- out suflicient consideration, the result being that tlie responsibility of dealing with them was cast upon the Cotincd So fur from doing away with all anomalies and inequalities in the representation of the country the bill proposed to continue them in a highly objec tionable form Tor examplo, though in -Mel- bourne the population had increased abovo 50 per cent Bince the present

tho adjournment of the House, m order to allow lion members to expiesa their opinions Ho said he had hoped that tho Chief Secietarj would havo been able to stato i to tlie House, not oniy w nat steps

without a division, but contiaiy to the condition of things in England, tho piedoniiiiant Cliambei in this colony was not the lepiesentative Cliambei It was a disgrace to the Assembly that tins should

entoted into a con- test with tho Uppei House it would bo on much better gi omuls than those which at present existed It was well known that many members of the Assembly were do lighted that the Llectoral Bill was laid asido He believ ed that the Legislativo Council had taken the course it had with tho view of meeting the Assembly m confeiencc, so that the billmight be flamed more in

August 2S, Mr Francis rose to make a Ministerial statement with respect to the action it was proposed to take in consequence of the Electoral Bill being laid aside After briefly recapitulating the circumstances under which the bill was introduced, aàid dwelling upon the inconveniences that would result if the ques- tion of electoral reform were remitted to the countrj, and thus left tobe settled hythe succeeding Parliament, winch, if it passed the measure, would virtually bo subjecting itself to the disadvantage of a penal dissolution Mr. Francis stated that the Government considered it so im- portant to obtain a distmct and un- equivocal expression of the views of the Legislative Council with respect to the pro Sosal to reform the Assembly, that they had ecided to request then representative in the Upper House to take the usual steps to hav o the billrcpl iced upon the notice paper What ev ei might be the course the Council might take with reference to tlie bill-whether thej chose to reject it at once, and thus definitely accept the responsibility of their action whether they chose to reject it after a full consideration of it m detail, or whether they chose to amend it m certain particulars, it vv as important, aa an appeal to the country was about to bo made, that there should bo some distmct dealing with the measure no wished it to be understood, though ho did not say it m a spirit of anger or rev enge, that it was the intention of the Government to make the question of the reform of the Upper House the first and fore- most and chief portion of the appeal to the country at the general election Of course no threat w aa held out, that unless the bill were passed or leconsulered, the ulterior course to which he had alluded would be held in terrotemovei the Council as a punishment for delinquencies in the post or in the future, but it was the intention of the Gov ernment to submit to the country in unqualified terms, tho fact that legislation j had not only been practically impeded m the post but that it would bo equally I futile m the future, unless the other branch of the Legislature waa made j moro amenablo than it was at present to the best and soundest public opinion Su C G Duffy considered that unloss tho I Chief Secretary was prepared to take somo practical course to make the legislation of tho Assembly more fruitful than at prosent ni case the step lie now pioposod waa unsue cessful to take it would only expose the House to additional humiliation Hie ie jection of the 1 lectoial Bill and also the rejection of other bills vv as

MELBOURNE MONTHLY STATION j PRODUCE REPORT. Messrs. R. GOUJECROUUII and Co. report :-" Wool. The business transacted during ti.o month has been limited, the Bales having been confined chiefly to Email odd lots, tho larger parcels being held over for the regular sales of the season, which will commence i early in October, We havo received several ins-d ' ments of tho new clip into our warehouses, and tho ' lots furnish evidence of the favourable season, the wool being well grown and Bound. From all we can learn the clip generally will be unusually good, the Bhccp in most of the country districts having continued in excellent condition throughout tho year, grass and water having been abundant, even during the summer months. Tlie lambing has given a full average per cent age of increase, and the young stock aro thriving well. Growers arc looking forward to tho disposal of the new clip, and inquiries aro already being moelc about tho probable range of prices. It Is, of course, premature to give a decided opinion, but Judging from the pre- sent aspect of the home market, there Is every proba- bility of spirited competition and .atlsiactory rates. Considerable orders havo already arrived, and these will no doubt bo largely augmented before tho sales commence, ns there is a growing desire to purchaso in this market, not only on English, and Scotch account, but nlso for tho continent of Europo and America. Tlie operations for tho latter country are, we aro led to understand, likely to be rcnowed this 6cason, as there arc indications that the long-continued depres- sion of tho manufacturing interest will soon bo suc- ceeded by a revival of trade. Next mail w 111 no doubt bring particulars of further orders to execute, and wo expect that the direct shipments dnring the season will bo considerable. Tlie only ship that has cleared with wool on board Is, August 25. Truo Briton, for London, with 1,384 bales.
