The Dairy Industry. TO TUB EDITOR OV THE CHRONICLE. Sin,— Mr. Allen in his letter In your issuo of Saturday say that by tlio timo wo will bo abio to export butter and cliccso tho most of us will liavo passod over to tho great majority. Now, sir, I do not ogreo witli tills, as 1 hold that wo ought to put our shouldora to tho whuot and commonco exporting as saou >a poasiblo. Wcstbrook EBtato Is soon to bo cut up anil sold, and I would suggest that oucouragonicnt bo given to bring out small farmer with papital from my nativo country— Denmark. It is woll known that tho Danish butter is tlio best in tha world, and if theso farmers camo out thoy would do much to start this groat Industry and make it progress. It would be, in my ouinion, a very good Id 00 if agonls wore sent to Douraark to oxplain to tiio people tlioro tlio easy terms on which land can bo obtained In Queensland. If proper publicity was givon to this fact T am corlain that wo would havo soon sotting in a stream of most dosirablo immigrants. In my nativo country tlio factory system of dairying was introducod about 1883 or 188-1, and has since modo such enormous progress that at present, I loarn from letters from homo, that It is universally adopted. In 188-1 tlio export 0! butter from Denmark was 19,000,000 lbs., and now, in consequenco of tho adoption uf thA factory system, it has rison to i5,000,0001bn. From my cxpcrionco in Denmark and here 1 am perfectly convinced that tho factory system is tho only ono bv which tho Quoonslnnd farmers wJH La enabled io oxnort butter at a nroflt. Your, &Ot; F.
