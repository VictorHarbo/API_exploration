THE SHIP ZEBRA. , From J. P. Eckers, Peters Hill:— 'In reply to your correspondent regarding the landing of the ship Zebra in South Australia, following data are taken from 'Mittheilungen' by the late Rev. J. M. R. Ey, Lobethal:— The Zebra, a Danish ship, in command of Capt. Hahn, sailed from Altonta with 197 souls— 106 adults and 91 children— on August 21, 1838. Cape of Good Hope was rounded on 15th and 16th November same year. On December 19 the vessel made 42 deg. south. On December 27, at 11 a.m., the coast of Kangaroo Island was sighted. The entrance to Port Adelaide was reached on Sunday, December 29, 1838, but, owing to low water an anchorage in the Port was not effected before January 1, 1839; the landing of the passengers was accomplished on January 2\. The immigrants were all exiled Lutherans from Prussia.
