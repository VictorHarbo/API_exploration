BISMARCK. I [from an occasional correspondent.] On Friday evening 17th inst., our quiet settlement was enlivened by a meeting of the foreign colonists here, to listen to a lecture delivered by the inspector of the National Mutual Life Association. The Bismarck Brass Band turned out and made the hills resound with the strains of " Wacht on Rhein " and others, which drew the settlers from their quiet homes, extend- ing from the foot of Colin's Bonnet down to the chapel, which was kindly lent for the occasion by the trustees, a gathering hall quite a feature for such an out-of-the-way place. Mr. Buck took the chair,' and introduced Mr. Sly, who delivered a clever and interesting lecture on the benefits of life insurance, which rivetted the attention of the farmers, their wives, sons, and daughters. Those who had not gone in for insurance yet, declared their intention of doing so without delay. At the conclusion of the lecture a vote of thanks was moved by the chairman, seconded by Mr. Carl Fehlberg who, in an able speech, endorsed the views pro- pounded by the lecturer, which vote was carried enthusiastically. The Bismarck Band then discoursed some sweet music in the shape of- Lutheran hymns, etc., and the chairman took the opportunity to read out to his compatriots an attack that had been made on them by a Launceston paper calling them doubtful waifs," and " the worst class of immigrants that could have been Introduced," against which they joined in signing a protest already signed by 92 Danish and German settlers. Mr. Sly expressed himself highly pleased with the progress of the settlement, and spoke laudably of the indomitable pers- France exhibited by the people as evidenced by the vast improvements shown in the district, proving that the inhabitants are a most industrious and persevering class of colonists. A vote of thanks to the chairman, and another performance of the band closed the proceedings. September 20.
