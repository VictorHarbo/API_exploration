The Frowning Beauty was Luien last Wednes day night, but there was not sufficient water lor her to leave the wharf, consequently her detention will most probably be extended till to-day (Mon The Balder has also suffered detention through the low tides, which prevented her moving when laden. In consequence of this Captain bjoberg will not make as satisfactory a voyage as he other wise would have done had his vessel sufficient water to leave the port as soon as the caigo was The Northumberland hauled out of the stream tiers on Saturday, and took up a berth at the Loin CyTg Wharf, where she is to receive on board ses for India. The Cooroni: sailed from Hobson s Bay at 3 p.m. on the 4th, and during the passage ex perienced very tine weather. The Shipping Re porter boarded her when 15 hour* out, conse queutly she has made another rapid trip. Captain McLean reports a barmie, two brigs, and thxee schooners at anchor under Cape Jervis. The Mart Stewart grounded on the .worth Bank in proceeding out on Saturday night, and remained ashore till last evening's tide. The Ellen Lewis is an old colonial trader, having frequently visited the Port under command of her present master, who has made an admirable passage from Puget Sound of tiS days. Captain Helon reports passing the port of St. Angelos and loading lumber at Ludlaw, and on returning to the port to clear out, the whole place had suffered very severely from floods during his absence. Several lives were lost, and much serious damage sustained, and in consequence, the vessel was subjected to a detention of two days before she could procure the usual papers of clearance. She took her final departure on the 24th December, and had a continuation of fine weather during the course across the Pacific, but on running down the Australian land boisterous winds became pre valent. In addition to a full cargo below hatches, the deck load of the Ellen Lewis is rather an ex tensive affair, being flush with the poop and top gallant forecastle, but notwithstanding this she has made very fair weather throughout, without any heavy labouring, even when ina sea-way. The master desires to draw attention to an error which occurs in the charts, of which he is possessed re lative to the position of Slaver's Island, in the South Pacific It is on Imray's laid down 35 miles to the westward of its actual locality. Thb Tipara Reef. — There has just been launched from the Port Dockyard a new buoy, to be moored on the above dangerous obstacle to the navigation of the course to Port Wallaroo. It is of extremely novel construction, and with who soever the idea originated, credit is due for the scheme, especially if it proves as effectual m its position as it appears to be at its moorings in the Fort Creek. It consists of a buoy shaped similar to a ponderous cheese, ballasted so as to float end up, and on it is placed a mast properly stayed by jron wire guys. On the top of the mast is a small pyramid, on each face of which is secured a square of silvered plate-glass, and whenever there is any sunshine the movement of the buoy will be sufficient to throw a very bngni reflection all round the horizon. As it appeared on Saturday from the Port Bridge the glare from the mirror was remarkably brilliant, and if it presents a similar feature when on the Tipara Reef it will prove of an infinite service by day, though the advent of a light-vessel m its locality will be a greater preventative at night When on the subject of buoys it has been ittggested that some improvement might be judiciously made in the one moored on the Wongiiftink. off the Semaphore Jetty, for beinj directly in the fairway of vessels arriving,, as we! as of boats trafficking in the anchorage, it is, from its colour and form, but a very, indifferent mark at night especially as the sea-birds have altered tne bright red paint to a dusky white, but imperfectly visible after nightfall. Doubtless die same ingenuity displayed in the construction of the buoy above alluded to might be extended to the introduction of a bell on the one complained of, so that its benefits might be as apparent to the ear at night as it is to the eye by day. ... THB Rtvkb Trade.— We have been favored with, the following by a correspondent:— The steamer Lady Daly left Echuca at noon on beb tuary 20, and arrived at Swan Hill on the 22nd. Left at noon on the 23rd. and took in tow the frarge Darling. On the 25th passed the Wakool Junction, and took in tow the barge Mitta Mitta. Arrived at Meilmam Station on the 2b'th. and on the 27th passed Eustou, arriving at tyentworta on tie 2-th. On the 1 ttter day passed the steamer Lady Augusta 10 miles below Mildura Station, bound up ; »lso, a short distance above Wentworth, the steamer Albury, bound to Swan Hill. Left Wentworth 'March 1st at noon, and passed the Steamer Moolgewanke a little below the Bunyip ?wreck, bound up. While lying at Bookmark, was passed by the steamer GundagaL bound down. On the 4th, at S a.m.. arrived at Blanche town, where she discharged her wool, and started for Goolwa. arriving there on the 5th. TheTijrar above the Wakool Junction is very low and falling fast Below Wentworth the river Is falling at the rate of Jive inches a day. The steamer Bogan was reported as having entered the Murrumbidgee on the 24th ¥-Ha uary. The Lady Daly left Goolwa January 20th. with two barges and a larjre cargo forWangunyah; she had on leaving Blanchetown 230 tons on board, but was unable to reach Wah gunyah, and landed the bulk of her cargo a Echuca. She was obliged to leave her barges, am had to make two trips between St~Q Hill and Echuca, to take up the whole of her cargo. VESSELS IN HARBOUR. ACTIVE, brigantine (British), 136 tons, M.
