G. OSBORN, C.S. ELECTOBAL NOTICES O THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGIS LATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen — As one of the candidates tor the honour of representing you in the Legislative Council I respectfully place before you an epitome of my views on some of the most important questions of the day which will shortly engross the attention of Parliament. One of the first will be the Reform of the Legislative Council, and the scheme brought forward by the present Government, though not perfect in detail, is I consider sound in prin ciple, as in the event of a deadlock or serious dispute between the two Houses of Parliament the voice of the people should ultimately prevail. I am also of opinion that considering the large increase of population that the present number of members in the Council is inadequate. EDCCATIOIf. The present Education Act has, I think, scarcely been a sufficient time in operation to fulfil all the anticipations formed of it, but con sidering that the old system had to be sup planted, and the great undertaking of erecting schoolhouses accomplished, which must have occupied a large amount of the attention of the Council, I feel reluctant to amend the Act, except in direction of enforcing the Compulsory Clauses in the thickly- settled districts, but with iJiscretionary powers to the Minister of Educa tion. TAXATION. The remission of Customs Duties upon all articles of consumption except Wine, Spirits, and Beer, and upon all other articles that cannot be profitably made in the Colony, having regard to existing Industries, this I consider necessary, as I believe that the middle and poorer classes are paying more than their fair share towards . the government of the country. The present state of the Revenue alone without these remissions will require that some other system of Taxation be found, and I am in favour of a Tax upon Property. This is preferable to the increase of Customs Duties. The withdrawal of the Government Grant in Aid to District Councils and Corpo rations is entirely out of question, as I con sider they encourage enterprise and progress of the local bodies. LAXD QtrESTIOIf. I would give every encouragement to the settlement of the country by the squatter by extending the leases of the runs in the interior and those lands unfitted for agriculture at a distance from the seaboard to say 30 years, at the termination of which the runs to be offered to competition at public auction, the Govern ment retaining the right of resumption by giving two years' notice ; improvemeats of a substantial and useful nature to be allowed for at a fair valuation either on resumption or termination of lease. I am in favour of reserving land for forest culture, education, and other necessary purposes^ to an extent that will not interfere with the demands of the agriculturist. The object of land legislation should be to disburse the hind among the people, rather than in the direction (as in past legislation) of making a small class of large landholders and a dependant tenantry. RAILWAT8. The opening up of the country necessitating the construction of roads, I would prefer railways where practicable to main lines of roads, as lessening the cost of produce. Tae proposal of railway construction from Adelaide to Mount Barker, from Saddle worth to Clare, and the connection of the Northern lines with the Port Augusta line, is, I consider, necessary. Though anxious to connect this colony with our neighbours, yet there must be a delay uatil we are sure of the route taken by other colonies to meet us. POET ASBLAIDB, OUTPORTS, JETTIES, ETC. I would advocate the erection of an Oater Harbour at the Semaphore, so as to afford facilities to the large class of vessels which are now trading with us. Looking at the impor tance of our principal outporte, such as Ports Augusta, Pirie, Wakefield, Kingston, Rivoli, Lincoln, Victor Harbour, &c;, I view any attempt to divert the natural trade as suicidal to the best interests of the country, as by their development the cost of production is lessened, and a national gain must accrue. The deepening of Port Adelaide and other shipping- place* should be pushed on vigorously, also the erection of Jetties of a larger and more useful description. nanoBATiox. The introduction of Immigrants I consider necessary while we are constructinj railway* and other useful public works, but great dis cretion should be used by the Government so that the labour market does not become glutted thereby ; but at all times I should prefer assisted to free immigration. I remain, yours respectfully, RICHARD VAUGHAN. VOTE FOR VAU6HO.

Gentlemea — I have on more occasions than one felt it necessary to decline being Nominited for the House of Assembly from a fear th it 1 might not be able to give sufficient attentioa to pnblic matters; but having now rather morr leisure, and believing that I can devote such thought and attention as the responsible posi tion of a member of the Legislative Council demands, I beg to offer my humble services to tbe Electors. My intimate knowledge of nearly all parts of the colony, and a tolerably extensive acquain tance with the inhabitants and their wants, may possibly be useful in assisting to mature useful *chemeri for the advancement of the colony. I firmly believe that the steps which are being taken for opening up the boundless resources of the count./ will be attended with the happiest results, and that a great and glorious future it before us, and I shall be proud to take some part in bringing them to perfection. We none of as like taxation, but I am con vinced that ths rapid development of our rtsources by the judicious prosecution o£ public works will so increase the prosperity of all classes that we shall be able to bear without inconvenience the necessary burden which a large present expenditure will involve. I believe that the chief burden 'of taxation should, however, fall oa those best able bear it. I shall take such opportunity as may be afforded of expressing my views on things io general. .

HODGKISS, Mayor. Brighton, August 2«, 1878. a2401 TO THB ELECTORS OF THB LEGIS LATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen— At the request of numerous Electors I have consented to seek your votes at the forthcoming Election. I am in favour of a Property Tax, and of such a revision of tbe tariff as will more equitably distribute the burthen of taxation; but I am opposed to an Income Tax. In order to make the Legislative Council more amenable to public opinion the term of member ship should, I think, be shortened. I would also give the Governor power to send a half or a third of the Council to the country whenever a deid lock arises. In my opinion the Council of Education has done good service in inaugurating our Education system, but I admit the time has arrived wnen the department should be placed under the direct control of a responsible Minister. Whilst in favour of liberal concessions to encourage pastoral settlement of unoccupied lands, I am opposed to any measure which will prevent their being made available for agri culture whenever required for that purpose. I am also opposed to the repeal of Nock's Act. Every well-devised measure for Pnblic Works, Law Reform, and tbe advancement of the colony will receive my earnest support. 235mwfzcv ALLAN CAMPBELL. TO THE ELECTORS OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA. Gentlemen — As a Candidate for the honour of representing you in the Legislative Council I consider it my duty to state my opinion on several leading questions now engaging public attention. Reform of tub CossTmrTtos Act. — Provi- sion should be made for a portion of the Legis lative Council to retire whenever in consequence of an important difference of opinion between both Houses of Parliament the Ministry are pre pared to dissolve the House of Assembly, and a portion of the House of Assembly should be elected by manhood suffrage of the whol* colony in one or more large districts, by which means both branches of the Legislature would be amenable to public opinion. Taxation. — I am in favour of a tax on freehold land and house property, thus procuring » revenue from absentees as well as resident pro prietors, but consider an incone tax premature. iiansa Reqtxatioxb should b» simplified, and offer facilities for persons with limited means developing mineral country advanta geously. : Laud Laws. — I disapprove of granting 42 years' pastoral leases oa the terms suggested by Government, preferring a shorter term subject to resumption with compensation for value of the leases, with a right of renewal at increased assessment subject to resumption ou payment of value of improvements only. Selectors of AowcrnTRAt La*dj should have power to mortgage their lands to enable tiem to borrow money at low rate of interest, mdshould be entitled to vote for the Legislative Council. Raixwats should be gradually extended, and connect the principal producing Districts with each other and the nearest Shipping Ports. Fkdebatioi! of thb Colokies I consider pre rrature, as South Australians are not suffi ciently numerous to secure their fair share of public expenditure. Rabbits should be exterminated by Land owners on their own lands, while the Govern ment should destroy them on Crown Lands. If my views meet with your approval I willingly place my services at your disposal, having sufficient time and energy available not withstanding my present duties as Mayor of Adelaide. 235cv36-60z HENRY SCOTT. TO THE ELECTORS OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA. Gentlemen— In response to numerous re quests, I Jnow offer myself as a Candidate for \- our suffrages at the coming Election for the Legislative Council. If elected I will do my best to represent you, and forward such a measure of Reform in the Constitution as may make the Council fairly represent matured public opinion. : My engagements for the last 20 years have precluded my taking any prominent part in political movements, which, however, have always commanded my earnest attention aad study, the results of which I now feel it my duty to place at your disposal. Should any Revision of Taxation come before me I am opposed to an income tax, but am favourable to a tax on property, the value of which the large expenditure on public works so very materially enhances. a233zcv36-43 JOHN B.
