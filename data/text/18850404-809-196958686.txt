As tho whole of these stocks have been gaining interest siuto February, tho actual, market value' of tho drop lmora thaji at first sight appears, whilst it indicates how those in England' re gard tho possibility of oqy interests being inter fered with by the war troubles' of tho motive country. There nre Indications of- a stlffcr market for money lnf London. The open ret© of discount has advanced -J per cent., being uov> qpotcd at 3 per cent,, or I per cent, below Iho bank minimum. The Conk of England reserve shows a decrease far the week or £400,000. Notwithstanding tho reported excitement on the London Stock 'Exchange, aud the full in prices. Australasian securities, as yet, arc little changed. The moment, however, is not deemed favorable for floating our new loan for the redemption cf our 6 per cent, de bentures. Dur local money market is steady. Discount charges arc wow quoted at 6,7 and 8 per cent, respec tively for, three, four and fivo months paper. The asso ciated banks allow 3 per cent, per annum on dcposh'sXor three months, 4 per cent for 6 months, nnd 5pcr cent, ft.r twelve raoutha.
