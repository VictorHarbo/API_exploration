In the case of tbe Alardus, the insuffi ciency of our colonial passenger laws was severely felt, showing the necessity for supplementing the Imperial Act — the only one in force here — by a local enact ment similar to the Victorian Passengers, Harbors, and Navigation Statute, 1865. We therefore beg to suggest — Secondly, the adoption of sections 19 to 38, and parts VI. and VII. of the Victorian Act referred to. In our opinion it appears a most neces oorr ^nhonmifonf f.n a fAMiorn UTimuyTft— tion on foreign ships, that the Govern ment should have some control over the shipper in the way of security. We beg therefore to suggest this — Thirdly ; but the mode in which this can be effected we do not feel compe tent to speak upon, merely expressing the desire that the security should, if possible, be subject to local jurisdiction, at least to some extent, for the enforce ment of penalties. We were informed by the Immigra tion Agent that under existing contracts the shippers are not responsible for overcrowding and had ventilation, the whole blame for such occurrences rest ing on the Queensland Agent. This arransement. we beg to suggest — Fourthly, should be radically changed, and the shipper directly responsible — in fact, if the Victorian Act be adonted. he would be indirectly through the master. The functions of the Immigration Board are at present by law confined to mere inquiry into complaints. Evi dence is taken not by oath, as before a judicial tribunal, but as voluntary assertions, the truth of which must be gathered from circumstances; We would therefore beg to suggest — Fifthly. That the Board should be invested with some judicial authority in cases of this kind, and be competent by summary jurisdiction to inflict fines where the Queensland Immigration Regulations have been sinned against. Sixthly. As a guarantee to the Ger man ana Scandinavian population of this colony that immigrants of their nationalities shall not be neglected, we would beg to suggest that a German colonist become a member of the Immi gration Board. Seventhly. It was found, notably on board the Alardus, that the blankets and other ship atensils sold to the emi grants in Hamburg were of a wretched quality. We beg to suggest enquiry into this, matter, and an arrangement by tbe Government with a respectable firm at the shipping port to prevent similar occurrences in future. On no account should a sub-agent be entrusted with a commission of this kind. Eighthly. We have come across several very bard cases where immi grants, having been informed in Hamburg that- German coin readilv circulated hero, had taken considerable sums in German specie to this colony, and here suffered severe loss in ex change. We would suggest that the Government make some arrangement with a local bank for the purchase of such coin from immigrants at the lowest possible rate. Placards in large type should be hung up in the Immi gration -office, indicating where exchange can Le effected. As a preventive mea sure, similar placards in the - Shipping office in Hamburg should inform emi grants that British coin only is current here. In conclusion, we beg to state that we 'have received the heartiest coopesa linn from the German and SnnnfUnairion population of Queensland, and enclose a report in the German and Danish languages, circulated by us throughout the colony. While expressing our hope for a speedy amendment of tbe griev ances now accompanying the Continen tal immigration, we must draw atten tion to the proportion of passengers (848) to the tonnage (810) of the Alar due, and regret to find this proportion not improved in the ships now on tbe way from Hamburg. The Eugene, 697 tons, carries 323, and the Humboldt, 762 tons, 385 passengers. These ships left in June last, about two months after the overcrowding and bad state of the Alardus was known here. — We have the honor to be, Sir, your most humble and obedient servants, For the Committee, H. Ruthning. The Honorable the Colonial Secre tary, Brisbane.
