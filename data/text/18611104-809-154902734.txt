COMMERCIAL. Age Office, Saturday Evening. There were no export entries passed for gold at i the Cutftuir.s to- day. .Business has been if anythiug slightly better ?? during th 3 p'i«t week. The stocks both of' town and country retailers have grown so small that fresh purchasers have become absolutely neces sary, and although their operations are as limited -13 possible, still there has been a better inquiry Mid-new arrivals of goods have moved off better than for some time past. The proposed new tariff of the Government has caused some excitemcnt during the week. Prior to the financial state ment being made, it was rumored that cigars and spirits would be affected by the alterations, and on Tuesday last duties to the amount of over £14,000 were paid ir.to the Custom house in con sequence. The shipping interest is, of course, opposed to the levying of wharfage dues ; but taking into consideration ihe enormous sums that ha* e been expended upon our wharves, it is gene rally admitted that no reasonable objection can be made to them. By them the foreign is placed j upon'; precisely the same footing as the home producer, since the latter has to pay market dues, tolls, &c.;, and also to contribute to the maintenance of the very wharves erected for the importers' convenience and accommodation. The differential duty upon colonial manufactured spirits is also generally 'approved ol. nnd, in fact, tho whole of the alterations propuad by the Ministry in the existing tariff are allowed to be calculated to produce a [more equitable system of taxation. But few arkie les have as yet been affected by the Ministerial policy. Cigars are hold for more money, but pending tho decision of tho House on the budget, no transactions at increased rates have taken place. Candles also have improvod, the proposed duty of 10s per cwt. and the wharfage rates will be equ il to about l^d per lb., an amount which, to the consumer, will prove very inconsiderable, whilst a considerable revenue will be derived I from it. The corn and flour market continues I steady, but with a very limited demand. Flour, Victorian, town made, is worth from £10 10s to £11 I0s. Adelaide sorts, from £11 to £12, and I Hart's and Magarey's fine, £12 10s per ton. Bran has declined, and is now plentifully offered at Is 3d. In oats there has been some speculation at improved rates, and there is a good demand at full quotations. At auction Tasmanian has been quoted at -Is Gd ; Californian at 4s ; and Irish and Scotch at irom 3s od to 3s 6d. Privately, a large parcel of Colonial has been placed at 4s fid, and prime Danish at 4s per bushel, nett cash. There is a fair demand for both bulk and bottled ale, but no better prices have been obtained than we re ported last week. Bass's No. 3, sells readily at £8 lOsper hhd. Byass's bottled' is held firmly at S)s Gd. Barclay's stout, Friend's bottling, at 9« 9d, and Tennent's, at from 8s 9d to 0s per dozen. In spirits there is no alteration, and c:i3 y is very limited. Martell's dark brandy has changed hands privately its low as from 9s 6d to 9s 9d, though 10s is the price generally demand ed, and by first class houses it is held firmly at that figure. Geneva is rather better ; JDKZ has been quoted at 12s ; and a few sales of small parcels have been done at a trifle over that figure. Provisions are still dull. The stocks of butter are enormous, and if shipments continue most serious losses must ensue to the importers. At present new butter, best brands, cannot be quoted higher than from 8d to 9d. Cheese has been rather more inquired for, at last week's quotations. Hams and bacon are in but very little request. Sinclair's hams have declined to from lid to 11 jd, and bacon may be placed at about the same rate. A slight im provement has taken place in sugar, especially in low ration, and a slight advance upon previous rates was effected at the sale of the cargo ex Confer ence. Rice continues about the same. During the la3t lew days three cargoes have coinc to hand, namely, the China, Eli Whitney, and the Queen of India. Quotations are from £14 to £15 per ton. £13 was realised at auction for 4000 bags ex La tona. Tea and coffee remain about the same. There is a moderate inquiry for geod teas, and the salo of the damaged portion ex Latona re alised fair prices.

From the Insolvency Circular for the month of October, which lias just been published, we find that during the month 110 schedules were filed in the Melbourne, and 41 in the Geelong, Court. The several insolvent estates sequestrated in the Melbourne Court may be thus classified: — 1 ac countant, 2 agents, 3 bakers, 3 blacksmiths, 1 bookseller, 1 bookkeeper, 1 baardinghouse- keeper, 3 butchers, 1 builder, 1 bullock-driver, 3 carpen ters, 1 cabinetmaker, 1 cab- driver, 3 carters, 1 chemist, 1 clerk, 1 clergyman, 1 contractor, 1 commission- agent, 1 customs agent, 4 farmers, 1 fruiterer, 3 gardeners, 1 gentleman, 1 hawker, 9 laborers, 1 law clerk, 1G miners, 1 poundkoeper, 6 publicans, 1 photographer, 4 restaurant-keepers, 15 storekeepers, 1 schoolmistress, 2 solicitors, 1 squat ter, 2 stonemasons, 2 tailors, 1 tinsmith, 1 timber dealer, I toy dealer, 1 watchmaker, 1 wheel wright. The liabilities and assets are not stated in many of the schedules filed in Geelong, but with three exceptions the liabilities involved arc small. The trades und callings of tho insolvents may be thus classified : — 1 boardingliouse-keeper, 5 butchers, 1 builder, 1 cabinetmaker, 1 carrier, 1 clerk, 2 coaclidrivers, I chemist, 1 draper, 3 farmers, 1 fruiterer, 2 labourers, 5 miners, 1 newspaper pro prietor, 1 quarryman, 6 publicans, 1 restaurant keeper, 1 saddler, 2 storekeepers, 2 timber dealers, 1 wheelwright. The liabilities of the 110 sche dules filed in Melbourne amounted to £19,700, and the nominal assets, so far as they are stated, to about one-half that sum. The estates generally were small, 84 under £100, and 32 between £100 and £300. In eleven estates the liabilities were above £1000. During the month there were 18 assignments for the benefit of the creditors. Plans of distribution were declared in 32, and dividends in nine estates. Certificates were granted to 24 insolvents, refused to one, and suspended to two. We have our Sydney papers to the 30th inst., but the commercial intelligence contained in them is of no importance. Immigration. — Tlie number of persons arrived at the port of Melbourne by way of scaboai d for the last week is 659, specified as follows : — Neigh- bouring colonies, 598 ; Hamburg, 55 ; London, 5 ; Calcutta, 1. ? ? Stock ano Share Market. — Although no great diversity of stocks has been dealt in this week, a better feeling pervades the share market. From the severe losses sustained through previous over speculation, we may assume improvement, when it now takes place, to be of a more solid and per manent character than heretofore. Several mines are now making good progress, as for instance, the Albion, with £1000 reserve fund, and steady yields, promising early dividends ; the Beehive, extricating itself from debt slowly but surely ; the Buninyong obt lining its largo and regular yields, and paying dividends at least monthly ; the Clunes with its immense unfailing lodes of quartz ; the Linscott's, making constant profits and commencing [to pay ^dividends with regularity j the Cathenne United with £2000 reserved prohts ; the United Brown's, showing over 400 ounces for its fortnightly yield ; the Hustler's Reef Com pany with £1000 reserve acquired within the last few weeks ; the Johnson's Roof Company with about £2400 realised profits ; 'the St. Mungo which has discharged £1000 of debt from the late returns, and is now in full swing for a pros perous career ; the Ajax, of whose prosperity G7J per cent in dividends in four months, besides pro fits eapitilised and cash in hand, is the best test ; and the Hercules, which in twelve months has repaid £173 for every £230 invested as a share. .With such examples before us, there is no need lor despondency ; and careful examination of tho en tire list of mines leads irresistibly to t he conclu sion that bad finance and lax management — not lack of gold in the mines — have been the causes of want of general success hitherto. This evil, although serious, is fortunately not irremediable, so far as the future is concerned, and despite the obloquy which inevitably follows want of success, and the consequent disinclination toTollow so un popular a pursuit, we by no means despair of an early turn of ihe tide succeeding the present ebb in mining adventures. Banks. — Colonial have been sold daily at £3 5s, and up to £5 6s in small lots. There does not appear any probability of alteration in value until after the call has been paid up nt the end of this month. There are large buyers ready at par, hut holders, do not seem disposed to recede below £5 5s. National Bank have aot been much affected in price by the publication of the balance sheet, which we gave in full on Thurs day. That document is encouraging, and indica tive of steady progress. Sales this week have been of small lots at £3 10s. Bank of Victoria are firm at £33 5s buyers, holders asking £34. Gas Companies. — Sales of Bendigo Gas at £3 10b cash, and at £3 15s three months' accept ance. Collingwood are in request at £4 12s 6d, and -for one parcel £4 17s Gd would be accepted. Geelong have been sold locally at £3 153. There are buyers at £3 13s, and £3 17s was this day demanded. Melbourne show some improvement in quotations. Insurance Companies. — Sales of a few Aus tralasian at 20s, at which price then; is a steady demand. Dealers in Colonial Insurance rather widely apart in their ideas of value. Sales of a fair parcel of Melbourne at (is, buyers still offering the same. Victoria Life would bo taken in quantity at 40s, ur a little over ; holders look for 47s °d. Miscellaneous Companies. — Bendigo Water works were sold in limited quantity at b'os ; nt the close prices were a long way upart. Filtered water is now ready for delivery. There i3 a steady request for Provident Institute shares at 12s. ' Railways. — Hobson's Bay Railway have advanced; prices realised, £12 5i and £42 103, ending with sellers at £42 03 for a small parcel — larger holders looking for £13. The advance is attributed to the con clusion of the financial half-year on 31st ultin.o, and speculation i3 upon the probability of di vidend at rate of ten per cent per annum' Sub urban offered nt 12s and there are buyers at 6s. No declared buyers of St. Kilda and Brighton. Iiotliing very decided is known about '.lie amal gamation schem:;, but rumor declares its comple tion to be improbablo. Essendon IUiiway are offered at £4 10a, and to-day £2 was bid, being the first offer for a long period. Debentures. — Since the announcement of the issue of a further £100.000 instalments of the Government Rail -*05 Loan at a fixed premium oif 4 per cent., there have been sellers at that figure of small parcels. At tke same time we venture to predict that within a week after tho period when the bonds are available for dis tribution at the Sub-Treasurers', they will be all taken up at the limit. Buyers offer 103. There is a strong inclination to buy up the Suburban Railway bonds at about 60. Melbourne Gas 7 per cents offered at 103. Dividend Mines. — The Ajax Company con tinues its successful progress. There was no crush ing this week, the men being engaged timbering the mine and replacing the stamp boxes. Inclu sive of specimens, gold taken frcm the old stamp boxes, and pyrites sent to town for separation, last week's return falls little short of six hun dred ounces. Tha Castlemaine people seem much disappointed at the tributers them selves taking up the additional shares ad vertised at £300 each, and the local paperB say that as much as £500 and the lt'.bor of an experienced miner was offered for a thirtieth share of the tributers' interest. The Albion mine is now in a first-rate position, having £1000 re serve fund, and excellent work before them. Sales at 20s. The Beehive Company is making good progress, as will be seen by subjoined report. Once out of debt, dividends would be immediately resumed. Sales ut 30s and 31s. Buninyong offered at £100. Eaglehawk Association have been done at 4s. The Eaglehawk Specimen Hill Company is to be wou.id up. It is proposed to form a new company with £10,000 capital, in £50 shares, to buy the plant and claim for a sum which would suffice to discharge all the debts of the old company, and still leave a small working capital. The ready assumption of the liabilities by tha shareholders — although considerable doubts were expressed of their legal re sponsibility — is highly honorable to them, and sets at rnst the parrot cry of repu diation which it has been attempted to raise against them. They are satisfied that, whether judiciously or not, the directors incurred the debts with the best intentions, and believing that they were thereby doing the company a service. The Linscott's Reel Co., is reported to be doing very well. Sale3 of Nelson Reef, at 2s 3d and 2s 6d. United Biown's Co's shares offered at £60. A splendid return is noted below. Re membering the continuous large yields, and the absence of dividends since December, 1860, it suggests itself as possible that the system of operations is too costly. Vaughan offered at 203. A meeting is close at hand, at which u favorable report may be anticipated. Victoria Clunes are not on the market. Some very good offers have been refused. Progressive Mines. — Clunes Alliance were on Friday offered at £100 ; buyers at £70. The re port from the agent of the Ferron's Reef Com pany is more encouraging than of lute. Hustler's Reef are making progress, and the company is expected to take its place in the dividend list be fore long. Sales at 6s G:l. Sales of Long Gully at Is Gd. The Maryborough meeting called for 31st October, had to be adjourned in consequence of only 10,000 shares being represented instead o 14,000— the number required to make an altera tion in the deed of association. Such neglect of their own interests by shareholders is unpardon able, and must withdraw from them any sympathy when they complain of the mismanagement of directors. M'lvor offered at 30s. Buyers of New Chum at 5s. Sandy Creek unsupported at 6s. Star Reef marked Is 6d sellers, and Gd buyers. The Steiglitz Company is to be wound up in the Court of Mines. St. Mungo are in favor, and deservedly so; sales at 21s, ending buyers at 20s, with 2os asked. We hear nothing of the progress of the Victoria Reef Gold Mines Company. United Brown's Diggings Company. — H. S. Smith, secretary, thus reporls to the Stock Ex change secretary : — ' 1st November. The yield for the fortnight ending 30th ult. at the company's works is 413 oz of gold.' Eagle Hawk Association. — The tributers (says tlie 'Times ) have discovered a new and very promising source of revenue to themselves and the company in the surface ground, which they are now' sluicing, and from which they this week obtained several pennyweight pieces of gold, and some twice that weight. We ore informed that last week tlie company derived a prutit ol thirty pounds sterling. Union Association. — A good week's return was expected on Saturday, as the amount of amalgam on the tables is considerably more than any seen lately; one table shows a ependid lot, the quartz producing it having been taken from the extreme southern portion of the ground and in the claim formerly known as Polsue and Co.'s, which was purchased by the company for £95, nnd which purchase was grumbled at greatly by a few short-sighted shareholders at one of the monthly meetings. — Tarranrjower Times, 1st November. Beehive Association. — The following is an epitome of the results obtained by this company during the past four weeks : — The firBt week owing to the delay incident on the initiation of an entirely new system of working, the stamps were going only about three days and a half, the partial cleaning up producing 43 ox of retorted gold. Errly in the second week it was found that two of the coovers were knocked through, but as they were bedded on solid blocks of granite it was not thought necessary to stop to change them till the end of the month, as 110 gold could by any possibility be lost. The second week pro duced 61 oz ; the third week 66 oz ; the fourth concluded on Saturday, which was made a day of general cleaning up. The solid bottoms ol batteries No. 5 and 6 were taken up, and showed that nearly forty ounces of gold had been lying there — the ripples and boxes gave about SO more, and on removing the coover nearly sixty ounces of gold were found beneath them. frhe yield for the month in re torted gold was 352 oz. 15 dwts., which, however, was'very black und diity, and contained a great deal of iron and other base metal. In smelting it lost 30 oz. 5{ dwt., so that there remain in refined gold 322 oz. 9 dwt. 18 grs., which after assay will leave about £1207 as the value of the month's yield. This, after deducting £18G Gs, the amount paid as tribute wages during the month, and £260 allowed for stores, wear and tear, &c.;, will leave £7G0 14s to beequally divided be tween the men and the company. This shows a nett profit to the company of£380 7s for the month's operations, and wili leave the workmen about £2 4s per week each besides the subsist money. As a proof of the value of this system of working we may state that fewer men are now eniDloved 011 the Beehive than ever, but that there is rather an increase than a diminution in the amount of work performed. This may be expected, as wlie/e men know that the amount of their wages depends on their own exertions they will be sure to work better than where their pay is the same whether they work more or liss. New coovers are now being put in, and from the appearance of tho ground we may hope for a continuance of good yields from this mine. Cookman's Reef Association. — A meeting called for 30th October, was adjourned for a fort night, in consequence of an objection to the pre sence of a gentleman whose right to certain shares on which he relied as qualification as a shareholder being disputed. Ajax Association. — In Melbourne we are given to understand, the accuracy of our reports res pecting the Bolivia Reef ha 4 been doubted. It has been alleged there that the yields of the Ajar Company have been greatly exaggerated, and even that the same lot of gold lias been re turned several times in succession. The history of many defunct companies has justly thrown a certain shade of sus picion on every mining scheme, but there has been nothing in the career of the Ajax company to warrant distrust. The twenty working share holder j are plain, honest men, who have not the remotest intention of dabbling in th ? share market, and their only object in taking ad. ditional partners, is to render the supply of quartz adequate to the demand of the batteries. Last week two gentlemen from Melbourne, anxious to purchase one or two of the new shares, but in credulous of the glowing accounts they had heard of tho mine, personally inspected it. Both were forced to admit that the reality far exceeded their expectations, and before they left they tendered £4U0 and even £500 for shares. They were in formed that no premium on the fixed price of £300 was required, and that the bids of only practical miners would be acceptcd. In fact the ter. new shares will nearly be all absorbed by friends and relations of tho present partners. — ACmmt Alex, under Mail, 1st November. Linscott's Reei' Qu.ua/.
