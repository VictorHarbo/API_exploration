DANISH ENGINEER LIKES AUSTRALIA PLEADS TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY. Kaj Jensen, a Danish engineer, charged at Central Court Sydney, on Monday with being a prohibited im-<*> migrant, pleaded to be allowed to main in Australia. Jensen appeared with five other young seamen â€”four Danes and one Norwegian. Mr G. Francis (for Jensen) said he had been in Australia before, and had become engaged to an Australian girl. "In common with the other young men, Jensen has only two months of his articles to serve. They all fear that if they return' 'to Europe they will be interned in Iceland," said Mr Francis. "They believe that their service in the ship is affecting the treatment of their relatives in their countries, which have been occupied by the enemy, and that if they cease to serve as seamen, that treatment will be less severe." The men pleaded guilty, and were sentenced to six months' imprison ment, pending deportation.
