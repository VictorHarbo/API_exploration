The stomach, the bowels and ;he liter, cannot be in a healthy condition while the ungs and the air passage* leading to them are ob itructed, and in all diseases of the respiratory organs ;he effect of the Pills is highly salutary. As an out irard application for sore throat, croup, asthma and ironchitis, Hollowny's Ointment is invaluable. It soon 'elieves the irritation of the mucous membrane of the Tichea and the bronchial tubes, and removes that shoking sensation so ulaiming ii» croup and asthma. Agent, F. COOPER, Chemist, 42 Collins street west ^ 46 611 J USrttral. - ? I ' For want of timely care, millions hava died of medicable woundi.' Dr. L. L.~TM I T H'S VEGETABLE PILLS. ,. These Pills cure — ' , Bilious complaints Pain* in the head II Disease* of the stomaoh Lowness of spirit* and bowels Nervous affections * Sick headache Spasms Scurvy Palpitation* Gravel Dyspepsia r Costivenes* Feverishnes* b Heartburn Blotches on the faw Flatulence Skin eruption* Giddiness Piles i Tho curative power of these celebrated Pills is now i generally recognised. After «? severo struggle with tho prejudices of the uninformed on the one band, and the interested views of professional men on the other, Dr L. L. Smith has established the reputation of his Pills as tho best domestic medicino known in the colony. Even medical men at length acknowledge the peculiar efficacy of this wonderful medicino in the diseases most common to this colony. TESTIMONIALS DAILY ARRIVING FROM ALL .-PARTS ef the eolonies, prove that Dr. L. L. Smith's Vegetable Pills are at onco the safest, best, and most powerful remedial agent ever offered to the public. UVERY CLIMATE PRODUCES PECULIAR FORMS OP DISEASE, And requires a specific medicine to alleviate suffering and prolong life. In following this idea to its legiti mate conclusion, Dr. L. L. Smith has incurred the ran corous opposition of his professional brethren, as a dan gerous innovator on their ancieut usages ; but heedless of their senseless clamor he appealed to the masses, and their verdict — tho voice of the people — has proclaimed the triumph of modern science over mere routino and formal old fogyism. DR. L. L. SMITH'S CONSULTING ROOMS ARE CROWDED. His extensive and varied practice, tho large number of cases daily passing under his observation, give him an immense advantage over Surgeons of less repute. DR. L. L. SMITH'S VEGETABLE PILLS Have now been advertised and sold throughout the colonies during more than five years, f»id not a single eomplaint of their inefficacy has been heard during that period. The general public will perceive the pow erful though silent testimony thus borne, — the worth of Dr. Smith's invaluable medicine. These Pills may be obtained of every respectable Chemist and Storekeeper in town and country, in boxes at 2s. 6d., 5s., and 10s. A considerable saving is ef fected by taking the larger sizo. No Fills are genuine unless they have the signature Louis L. Smith, on a red cover surrounding each box, aud on the lid, inside a portrait of the Doctor. DR. L. L. SMITH can be consulted daily, gratia, bsfcr* ?leven in the morning, and between six and nino at night, at 197 Boukxb acAEBT East, Meldournb. 6 03 nov 18 MR BAMFORD, Surgeon-Dentist, 8 Lonsdale street, opposite the Catholic Church.
