SUMMARY. GENERAL. The parliamentary history of the past month includes an incident which will finds no parallel in the records of any other British colony. Mr Ireland, tho Attorney Geneiijlj,inti'oduced a Bill" into the Assembly, ' to!," cbhsolidato and amend the law relating to' newspapers. His obect,:he, , said; was! to assimilate., those Laws! to, English- enactments. A brief explanation of the principle of't'his Bill-will enhble' our honie readers to form "aniaeuor wliaf sort'of assimilation JHr.Treland : intended. No porson was to bo allowed to edit; print, , or;, publish; a newspaper, unless, certain affidavits' were 'previously- registered,' 'disclosing tthe names of ithe'intehdod editor, 'j Sprinter, pub lisher and .proprietpr.each irndnfl bfwhom Wfre rerjfuired to enter into a recognizance', in'.tjie spm of £500, and was to lind two sureties in a like sum, voonji,tio,ued. .to insecure tho.-puj'ment) of damages! and! costs bo recoverej-iii actions for libels published 'in'' such ndwspaper,"as well' as ' to secure, the, pay inent, of fines(and penalties to. Her Majesty upon11' convictions' 'for lib«.',!Tlie' posi tive immediate effect of such provisions as thpse would have bo'en the closing Uiree-fourths of the newspapers, in . this colony, for the proprietors would have found it? iimpossible?- to' 'obtain sijch enormous sureties, -whilo tho cditorial prqfession would'liavo "been limited5 to tfie veiy lew mem bers -whose pecuniary 'position was- -sufficiently sound as to' satisfy the Crbw'h Solicitor that'tlieir recognizance was good. - 'Practically ;,,thp' effect of this-proyision would have been to confer -on the Gbvcrnmentitho power of licensing the press. If theCrown-Solicitor "saw occasion to 'object to the. sufficiency of the, sureties, ", no further' steps? could b'o taken, 'and' newspaper senterprjze would have been confined to very narrow limits indeed.-! -It'- was ! proposed falso, that the editing of a libel " shall bq a substantive offence, distinct from'tho printing' and publishing thereof,, but shall bp'1, 'attended; .with, the -samo co'nso- quences. both'civil and criminal,- as such. prints ing.nnd- publishing !" The "motive "for ' the insertion 'of such jan extrndrdinary clause was, th'at. th'o'abtaal writers of alleged libclloiis mattor might bo got'at.oTho-'ehtirepressof the colony, with 'one small oxcoption) immediately denounced the Bill, and its.viramcr,was.iiltimately.induced, to. strike out tho'clauscs- irolatingUo 3 editors and . their sureties, and' 'to 'reduce tlib' amount 'of surctygenerally, but, even inits amended condition the Bill is' repugnah't to' tho community. / '.The day for tho. second reading, us, /twice. been ap pointed,! but Mr. Ireland hits, .us o/ien, postponed , the . trial, and the beli'ef ;is entertained that he will drop it altogether.' - Tlie oilier members 'of the, Ministry have-not disowned; participation -in the Bill, and oho of the, members for, Castle- mpine,y -iffy his placeyiffstho ; Assembly, spoke ea/nVstfybn' 'favour Of itf' Dr Macadam, the. Secretary of the .Yictorian, Itoyul Society, Score-; taryto the Exploring) Go'nimittee,, momber ;of' lots of ' learned 'societies, ' andi/who' ; is;.' himself ; a' very learned man, vehemently 'Contended for, the Binin 'its'first sh'ap'oi'declaringtliat it'was quite consjstont.with.tbelullest freedom of the Press ! There was real!y hb:exclise':,for tho' intrbdiiotion of such a tyrannical measure. The Press of this colony is1 remark'aUy 'free .'from tlie faults which disgrace Americaffjburndlism)dnd Dr. Macadam had, just ' before - the Bill appeared, proved the efficacy of the existing state of the law by ob taining a verdict in' an' action which lie fia.d him self instituted' for libeh \Vo have referred to this 'matter at greater length than it perhaps deserves, but tho, home. 'pubbo will rlcarri with,. astonish ment that; an' attempt has beqi jaeriqusly mado in the "colony of Victoria,) to '''assimilate its press! to th'o'condit ion of the 'press ofFrance. V For .one inensuro of legislation that will shortly jjecpme'ldw, the:Ministry_ deserve credit. The capitatioii'tax on Chinese is'repealed.ahd China- meu may now enter the colony as freely, as. the liiitiyes of any. other country. It is not likely that an inconveniently largo influx from the jFlowery- land will occur; but there :are many Chinese in Victoria who desire ,tho society of friends or relations now in Ohiua.' The' capita-, tioii tax, £10) 'was an obstacle to tho indulgence of their wish'. Now thbt.is' removed fqmily re unions will1 take place, and wo are informed that Kong Mong and Co.,: large Chinese , mer chants in Melbourne, have £1000 .'deposited with, them -for the purpose1 of " assisting family immigration " from -China. ' Tho promised amendment -of the Land Act haB not yet been effected, and as the. session will . probably como loan end/about. the- middlo of ; .Juno, and Ministers are fertile in excuses for . procrastinating' the subjeot, Mr Duffy's pam- phletinay continue to bo jeg 'ia' -cbtreotly'1 descnp$veofi?our landy/systefii.'.

One very important change, however, is almost certain to -happen., bofore a -..new:-- session- -brings—on the consideration of tho Land Law. Sir Henry i; , Barkly pull have ;; given/ .-placo,- to his. . .successor, who, being . necessarily unvorsed in. colonial politics, will be very much at ,tho riiercy- of tho Government ho finds in office ; so it is not. improbable, as one of bur contemporaries suggests, that in tho event of a defeat on tho amendment of the Land Act, or upon any other important question, a dissolution will be asked for, and, as tho constitutional ter mination of the existence of the present As- sembly. .will . then .not., bo ; far distant, Her Majesty's representative; yoting in office and new to tlie colony, may doom it tho wisest course to i,'accb de to the request. . .Whether the result of a federal election would bo' favourable to., the linistry dopends very much upon tho'charaoter. and ability of- tho members of the Opposition At .present the "O'Shanassy Administration liri" eludes prety nearly "all., tho talents" . available swithin, the walls of the Assembly; butthere are "abler, and wo believe better, men outside',, who 'inav 'be -included amonir the 'successful .qandi- idates at the next' general election, in which case ..the., impudent . definnce of. public opinion ooca-/ sionally manifested in by tho, present; occupants- ..of bfficoas witness the Press Bill),. -will bo in- t dulged in at the imminent risk of displiice- ment. .... ...... _ ! ; - The Maories .have;- we- regret ;to say, com- mittcd an outrage vrhich rendsrsa. renewal- of '.the war unavoidable.

MINING. There is nothing new to report in alluvial operations, and the number of diggers proper has varied little since last month. Accountss from the Blue Mountain or Clowes Forest Rush, as it is sometimes called have not been favorable enough to attract many more form this gold- fleld.

[At the request of many persons who failed to obtain copies of our report of the festivities in Castlemaine and neighbourhood, on Tuesday last, we reproduce a portion of it in our present issue, for transmission by the mail.] Preparations had been made by the public bodies of the district, and by the inhabitants generally, for celebration with due eclat the mar- riage of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales with the Princess Alexandra, but merciless rain, which continued nearly through the entire day, did its best to defeat their intentions.

This, as many may remember, was invented by Mr Angus several years ago, and consists of steel plates screwed together at the edges. It is a breech loader, and has a square instead of a round bore. Whatever may be its merits or defects, on this occasion it answered tis intended purpose admirably, viz., that of making the greatest possible noise. The weapon was drawn- "up 'iii iront of thd/Uocl iTillliotoI, and fired repeated sulvoes in the morniyig and evening. - Tnb' weather, of coiirso, prevented many demonstrations ot.. pioiemg uiat n puiu otherwise have been seeu. but tlio inhabitants testified their loyalty by . g. general suspension of busino'sis.

The children of Hie 'various schools, the Band .bf;Hpp'e,- 'etc!, were also invited, to form part of the nrocessiou; but weve .prevented by, the raiu from joining! tho! ruijks.
