Jobnsnn, of *ip I'nirer sity of Pennsylvania, in thf» American Bureau of Shippmp. the traffic through tie Panama Canal has exceeded two mil lion tone (net tons, vessel measurement) per month, and the tolls collected have averaged about two million dollars per month. The number -of vessels Trass^mr the Canal each month pincr; March 1 has been in excess of 400; in July there were 474 transite. One reason for the very rapid srowth. in the j/tnnasc of thr- Panama Canal has been the larja? traffic between ibe two seaboards of the United States made possible by the great amocnt of idle tonnage of vessels that were bni;t durilK the war and that are owned -oy the G-- vermncnt. An evrn &imn;%er reason ac counting for the very rapid crowth in Uie tonnace of the Oanal has been the lar^e «hipmeut of oil from ^onthern CU'fornia -«atbcund tjvroufdi the Canal. Ihrrin? the month of Octolber. for instance, tie daily trausita throajdi tbe Canal averaeed 13 8-10. Of tins number five vessels on. the average were tankers. AMERICAN TROS ANT- STEEL. ^llesBTs.

At the annual meeting of the Natioiwil ?? onCgsui''* ?Sufi A jiciicv ^^ooi r-a.ny -'*f Xew Zealand in I--ondon last month, '.i)r chair man (Mr. K. Losan*. after referring u- the oscellpnt returns-- from wool, frozcu meat, end dairy produce, stated that mar ket prospects for the current year were good .particularly for growers of crossbred wool. The striking feature of the past year had been ihe trend in valno of the coarser sorts of woo). Experience of the past showed that a note of warning was not uncalled for. Very high prices for products i-erp usually followed by high prices of, and speculation in, land. With rejaird to frozen meat, the past, year had been a difficult one from London impor ters ;.oiat of view. Values at the !,ejriu rsing 01 the season undoubtedly were too liipn in New Zealand, and liad resulted in some losses bein2 sustaineil by buyers in J^ondon. Jhis season opening prices in the iJomimon had been more reason able, out the position of the English mar ket was still somewhat obscure, althou~h pnees in New Zealand for prime faf sheep and iambs for ejeport had been satisfactory to growers. Th- board, in its report, ex ?pressad the i~\r that, owinc to the drought, especially in the South Island, there might be a rather serious shrinkage in production and exports. 'WHBVT AND PRODUCE.

A^rasiCiN wiiEiT. '?Broomhall,' in the Liverpool '?forn Irade^ews,' of IMarch 18, remarked:— 'Somewhat smaller shipments have been made by- XbrtJi Amcria ^of -a-hich the »u& h of Canadian origin), but we are sure that a lai^e movement will develop as soon as tlie spring sbippii!^ soasoD opeus at Montreal. Mr. Sandford Svans, a good Canadian authority, rockoiis tie remain ing Canadian surplus ou %ranm 1 at 157,080,000 bashels, or roundly 20.-«0,0a0 luarjcrs. This «juanlitv is sufficient v- furnish all the wheat wehare alloxod for Xorih America between March. I and July 31, witliout any coniribation from the Cnited States, but the last- mentioned ex porter is not going out of 'ausincss yet, and we shall be surprised if her shipments hi the coming sprins and snnrmer do not average around 10,000.000 busuele monthly. \Ve must still report that the supply posi tion looks qaite favorable for buyers, bat as we said last ti-eiik, the present price level is relatively moderate, and evidently the demand is still large enough to make its influence felt. The osrtlooi for the nex crops can be described as fairly good, bat it cannot be considered 'bearish.* Ame rica continues to mention hessian fly and frr»st damage; probably the loss is not greater than nsaal, but. then, the area soirn is smaller this season bv some 6,000.000 acres. The bill to aid 4lrers-iSrt farming in the C J-. has been rejected, but, even so. we do not expect American farmers to put in a big aoTeage of spring wheat, although the import dutj. has been raised. It seems to us there is no doubt the land, lias been over cropped; and we may well ask, will not the same methods pruduoe in doe time the same results in Oanadaf RETAIL DAIRY PRICES.
