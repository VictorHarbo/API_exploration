AFRICAN EMIGRATION AND IMMIGRATION. A Mu Hi MIX J HOOD writes as follows to the Daily Telegraph - His proper adjust ment of supply to demand is a process which appears to present difficulties just where they would Be an puma face least likely to miss Given i cattle numbered workers, are given in certain amounted work, what can be more simple than to apply the one to the other, to the advantage of both? And yet the more obvious useful such an application may be, the greater the obstacles which are encountered If such obstacles me not in height they are reared artificially by the per verso course of human nature Of this latter distortion our own country is now affording a most unfortunate instance I here is plenty of work to do and plenty of laborers to do it, but the trades' unions step in and overthrow the balance, leaving to continental industry an op poll mitty of beating out home manufacturers in the very branches in which we have the power of taking the last place with the greatest case " But a more complicated problem is presented by the relation of laborers to labor in tropical climates In northern countries a man must work more or less An inhospitable soil brings forth in hardy, thrifty, and intellectual men A mob and abundant country encourages sloth and perpetuates bird bal ism ' Whoso bounteous nature only fills the willing soil,' it is excessively hard to induce the native hear' to put his hand to the plough And yet this is the problem which it is most important to solve for the sake of home and soil equally "No one who is at all acquainted with the present state of the African men and of the West Indian colonies can fail to be struck with the obvious connection that might be formed between the two In Africa there is a super abundance of laborers, and in the West Indies there is a daily accusing need of labor Whether, therefore, the motive of philanthropy 01 of ceremonial utility be considered the more important to urge, it is evident that these two facts might be brought into relation with one another Let the negro, in short, be shipped oil to supply the want india which hospital America is suffering nun ' A discussion of the advantages and pinch ability of a eil considered scheme which should fulfil this object is beyond my present purpose It will be sufficient to indicate roughly one or two of points that seem to be worthy of notice

Africa itself it is impossible to make the people work they are indolent, and they would have con kunai opportunities of escape It seems to be absolutely necessary, then, to supply work which they cannot avoid, but which at the same time should bring to them by way of encouragement a substantial benefit It will, of course, be very kind to persuade negroes of the advantages of civilisation and
