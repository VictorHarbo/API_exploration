Again, as often before . the war, the quality of German goods has come into question in several of the oversea markets in India, China, South America, and elsewhere. A re cent Instance is mentioned by the Royal Bank of Canada in its February trado review. It states that "after deserting Cana dian for German newsprint, Argen tina ha again come to buy In the Canadian market. Canada has com peted with Germany, and. secured come of the business. We note here that, in other lines besides newsprint, German products are not being found satisfactory, and importers are turning to other markets,, provided that prices are not out of proportion. It is realised that Germany must continue to export in quantity;, but the idea that she would capture all foreign markets, with her low cost goods, is gradually being relegated to tho background." In spite of severe temporary de pression — greater than anything of the kind yet experienced in Austra lia — the Canadians have adjusted the balance of their external trade. They aro now on the right 1 sido by 3.000,000 dol. The Royal Bank pre dicts (and the condition is worth not ing in Australia) that the return to general prosperity in the Dominion will be rapid/ "provided that immigra tion comes back to tho figures of 1913, when over 400,000 new settlers entered this country. At that time, instead of having to look for them abroad, Canadian business, men had between . three and four hundred thousand fresh customers brought to their doors each year." THE WOOL ALLOCATIONS Tho 150,000 bales of wool to bo sub mitted to auction in Australia next Month have been allocated by the National Council of selling follows: New South Wales, 75,000 bates; Victoria, 56,000 bales; South Australia, 15,000 bales; W«st Austra lia, 4000 bales. i FRIGHTENED INVESTORS How business, is being hit in .New South "Wales by political turmoil, the prospect of still higher taxation, ana the general state of apprehension among investors, is discussed in unusu- ally frank terms in R. G. Dun and Co. s weekly trade report. . __ , "Rarely, or . never previously, in New Goutli Wales," the report states, has bo much business been left utterly de pendent upon political happenings. RiKht throughout Sydney business-and radiating thence throughout tho coun try— mere hand-to-mouth trading is the rule. Spending casfh grows less Plen tiful. tho while money for investment almost threatens to become a drug upon tho market. "Call", money, or very short loans— say, six months— aro unwelcome in every financial institu tion. Hence a rush of buyers fr £llt" edged securities on 'Change. All Com monwealth securities are quoted at top, or i hereabouts. . "Promoters of first-class trading and industrial ventures' find it utterly im possible to obtain adequate financial support. Wait, till after the elections' in the invariable response to appeals r funds for practically any commer cial enterprise. Thd general .attitutde perhaps, over-cautious — 'Caution run riot.' as one disappointed applicant for bank assistance ' bitterly, commented— hut it is not unnatural in existing cir cumstances. Increased taxation is the bogey; and, at the moment, at least, It looks a very real peril — if: Labor re turns to power after atf appeal to the lectors.

DEMAND FOR FINE WOOLS There . Is little ground for anticipating any seribus decline ln the value of fine -wools. They are too scarce. A recog nition of - this is distinctly apparent from-, the course of prices at Thurs day's'- London auctions. ' 1 In a general comment on the results of the sales, "The Times" (quoted by our London representative) states that the keen competition of foreign buyers indicated fears of a coming shortage of -merino tops of 64's quality. It is added that spinners and cloth .manufacturers complain that move ments in the tops market are making the recovery of the worsteds' trade diffi cult. Sixty-fours are now. quoted at 52d to 53d, 56's at 28d,'and 403, prepared, at 12%d. WHEAT POSITION EASIER Cable advices .received this -morning report the wheat market as distinctly weaker.
