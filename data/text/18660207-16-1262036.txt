PROSPECTUS. O ON SATURDAY, the 3rd of FEBRUARY, 1866, was PUBLISHED the First Number of THE QUEENSLANDES, a new Weekly Journal, to be issued in Brisbane every Saturday Morning. THE QUEENSLANDER is intended to supply the acknowledged necessity which exists for a Weekly Newspaper of a size and character which will render it suitable to the wants of readers of all classes throughout the Colony. The number of Newspapers published in Queensland is sufficient evidence of the general demand existing throughout the colony for this class of reading. But those who wish to be supplied with information of what ¡s passing beyond the boundaries of the district in which they reside aro at present without the means of obtaining it in any one Newspaper. It will bo tho object of the proprietor of TUE QUEENSLANDES to endeavor to (upply this want fully j and tho moans at his command being so much moro oxlonsive than aro to be found olsowherc, ho will be enabled to give each week Buch a mass of information collected from all parts of the colony as can- not fail to eccuroalargo circulation. As the paper will be published in Brisbane, tho largest centro of population, a considerable portion of its contents "will noccssarily be devoted to ovents occurring in that neighbor- hood ; but great caro will bo taken that a sufficient portion of sp&co; be devoted to each of the other districts, so that a fair history may bo given of tho week's proceedings of the whole colony, principally obtained through special and trustworthy correspondents. CDho greatest caro will bo taken to admit nothing of a doubtful charaotor ¡ and in order to reuder tho papor welcome as a family newspaper, interesting reading of a literary »haractcr will bo Buppliod"from week to week. With tho advautago of boiug published in the capital of tho colony, THE QUEENS- LANDER will contain the oarlicst and most rolittblo information of all Legislativo and Governmental action, affecting the welfare of the general body of tho peoplo or that of any of the various interests which flourish among us. A full epitomo of tho Parliamentary Debates will be given during tho Session ; and all important bills or public documents which aro of sufficient interest will be produced at tho oarlicst possiblo dato. Full reports will bo given of the proceedings in the Suproino Court Brisbane, in tho various Circuit Courts, and also in tho District Conrts-in all cases fur- nished by porjons competent to undertake this description of «¡porting. lu politics, THE QUEENSLANDES will bo free from anything approaching to party spirit. Its chief object in discussing political questions will bo tho material advance- ment of tho country, and the enforcement of a wiso economy on the part of tho Govern- ment. At tho same time the activo promo- tion of public worl:s of a reproductivo oharaoter will be advocated. "While the 'proprietor will »Tail himself of all tho resources at his disposal for the purpo«o of giving the News of tho Week as fully na possible, tho leading columns of TUE QUEENSLANDES, as well as tho comments on passing ovonts, will be written specially for its pages ; and tho principles of progress and economy in govornmont will be constantly maintained. The main object of the paper boing to promoto focial and material progress, tho principal industrial interests of the colony will bo carofully watched, with a view to record everything which may tend to develop its resources. Thus tho improvements will bo noted which nre effected from timo to time in tho older portions of this or any other Aus- tralian colony, whereby tho country is im- proved and its productive powor is increased ; and full accounts of tho progrosB made in pro- moting an improvement in tho breed of stock Vill be regularly published. Special attention will bo dovotedtoAgriculture, which, although now in its infancy, will doubt less before long be one of tho most valuable sources of wealth to tho colony. Nothing can tend moro to produco this desirable result than a full interchange of information among all those engaged in farming pursuits in tho different districts. To assist in attaining this object, no pains will be spared to obtain the most reliable statements as to what is actually taking place around us j and as the large circulation which TÏÏE QUEENSLANDES will command among residents in the country, will render it the best medium for this purpose, it is hoped that the farmers will freely use its open column for giving to, or eliciting from, ono another, much valuablo information of a character which nothing but experience can supply. The Markets will bo carefully reported, and 1feuUn" rric°3 wm bc given for all produco as c" «s the principe articles of consumption. For the former the quotations in tho neighboring «olonies w11 bo extracted from tho best sources, w all cases whero they materially affect the prices here. lull catalogues of Wool Sales, both in Sydney and in London will bo published, and great care will be taken to render the market reports as full ana reliable as possible. THE QUEENSLANDER will contain twelve pages, the same size as the monthly summary of the Brisbane Courier, and will be published every Saturday morning, in time for the country mails. SUBSCRIPTION, 6s. 6d. per quarter, or 21s. per annum ¡ payable in advance in all cases. . hooh "i" bo kept for subscribers, and no deviation made from the rule of all subscriptions being paid in advance. to ° JrnefU °f thÍS arranSement will be given "m r a .SUbäcribers> aä tno "»mount saved w 'eduction of expenses and avoidance of losses piper deVOted to th0 imPr°vcment of the SINGLE COPIES 6d. each, may be obtained of all the Agents of tho Courier, both in town and country.

In tho first Season, when the Theatre carno into my possession from causes to which it is unnecessary to alludo, the losses were very heavy, the engagements with tho then Company woro fully carried out, and their fulfilment was recog- nised by thora, both publicly and privately. During the present Season, a now course of policy was pursuod, the priées of admission were reduced, tho entertainments were moro varied, and it may bo doubted whether on any colonial atago a Company of equally limited number has presented an equal amount of talent. Some approhoneion was oxpressed as to tho roduction in the priées, Btill I am glad to congratulate the Company that in no case has any noticeable indecorum oc- curred in any audience before whom you havo performed oqually in tho low priced and in the high-priced sittings, the ordi- nary usages of society have been observed. If, in your appreciation, the ovory-day course of my private life has in any way contributed to this, I am repaid for much abuse and much mis- representation. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I very gratefully receivo tho testimonial you aro so good as to tender mo. I am, ladies and gentlemen, Very faithfully youre, WILLIAM COOTE.
