Quebec-street, Port Adelaide. — The Association having been established twenty four years has proved eminently successful in securing permanent homes for the careful artisan and workman. It differs from most Societies in separating the purchased shares from the invested. No Shareholder is compelled to be a borrower, and purchased shares do net in any way depend upon the maturity of an invested share. Shares are sold by auction monthly, purchasers having the option of redeeming them at a fixetl time, either in Fice or Seccn years ; that is, they pay for one Share, including all expanses excepting re conveyance or discharge, eight shillings per week for the full term of Zik years, or six shillings per week for the full term of Seven years ; consequently they always know the extent of their liability, and their property is always marketable. Shares can be taken np, and payments made, every Thursday evening, at 7.30, at the Office, and any further information obtained, at any reasonable honr, of the Secretary. 117ths20 6 ~ THE IMPERIAL BUHLDIXG SOCIETY IS THB BEST for BORROWERS.
