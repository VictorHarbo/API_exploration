THE DORUNDA RELIEF BUND. A meeting of the Dorunda Relief Fund Com- mittee was held at the Town Hall yesterday morning, under the presidency of his worship the Mayor. The other members present were Alderman Hipwood, Messrs. C. H. Buzacott, J. M. Myers, J. Hardgrave, G. Woolnough, Innes, and the Rev. J. Stewart (secretary). The object of the meeting was to report on the present position of the fund to the members, and to decide upon what action should be taken on the arrival of the immigrants. It was an- nounced that the only communication received from the island was to the effect that every- thing was going on satisfactorily. The minutes of the previous meeting having been read and confirmed, the Secretary read a letter from Mr. G. B. Radcliffe, dated Peel Island, 8th January, enclosing full particulars of each case requiring relief, and remarking that the fund was indeed assuming noble proportions. The secretary added that the particulars furnished were the same as those already published, with the exception of the lost paragraph, which con- tained information respecting two Danish men who had lost their wives, one being left with eleven children and the other with six. Mr. Buzacott stated that the donations re- ceived at the Courier office had been paid into the Q.N. Bank, where an account had been opened by Mr. Radcliffe. The SECRETARY read a letter which had been received by the mayor from Mr. F. Sanderson, business manager of the Courier, to the effect that he had paid into the Dorunda Widow and Orphans' Fund, in the Queensland National Bank, the sum of £144 2s.; £21 of that amount was subscribed by Major Des Voeux and his friends at Southport, specially for the widows and orphans of the late Colour- sergeants Hewett and Westwood. Mr. Buzacott stated that a further sum of £40 had been received since the £144 2s. had been paid into the bank, and this it was proposed to pay into the mayor's fund. It was stated that the immigrants would arrive in Brisbane on Saturday, the 16th instant, and that the fund would be closed on the following Monday. On the motion of Mr. Buzacott it was decided that the mayor, Mr. Myers, and Mr. Stewart should form a sub-committee to meet the im- migrants on their arrival at the depot, and ascertain the requirements of each family, and recommend to the committee the best method of disbursing the fnnd.
