MILITARY DESERTERS. STRANDED AT COPENHAGEN. ? London. December 21. Thousands of able-bodied Russians, who fled from their country to escape military service in the Far East, are stranded at Copenhagen,' where they are in a pitiful plight. Dishonest Russian Bopping agents cheated nutnv of them bv orovidine them only with tickets for the journey to Copen hagen in lieu of tickets for America, which were paid for. The Danish shipping agents are giving the poorest 'of the refugees free passages to New York. A number of the deserters are suffering' from trachomaâ€” a specie? of granular ophthalmia. As these poor fellows are prevented by the Unde sirable Immigrants Exclusion Law from' entering the United States, they will prob ably seek an asylum in Eaglaml.
