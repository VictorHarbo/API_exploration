FINANCE AND TRADE. Tuesday Evening. In reviewing the past condition of our trade, and comparing it with the present, it is impos sible to iguoro tho fact that our crodit system had been worked up to danger point. It was, perhaps/only a natural frequence that " boom ing" in various directions should result in the extension of credit, with tho result that crodit has been permitted to assumo tho position of capital in business doalinge. It may be admitted that without credit trade would bo reduced to such limited bounds that enterprise would bo checked, if not stifled. But there is a limit to credit, and thcro always must he danger where this is ignored. Riore than ono important seotion of traders have alroady recognised this danger and have adopted oertniu roforms which ensure on tho oue hand that customers are not unduly restricted, and on tho other the retailer and distributor arc not left dependent on the importer or wholesale house for CApital , to work their business. The remark is suggested by tho long terms given in one leading branch of our import trade, and tho diffi culties which firms who dociro to do a safe and legitimate business have to contend with from the absence of unanimity. Of course there are thoso who will contend that they know their own bnsiuoss best, and crodit manipulation' is just ouo of those factors by which the largest turnovers are to be secured. Wo admit tho power of credit to inflate business, but when the c lei credere account is looked to it will often bo found that more satisfactory financial results would have been obtained from a ainallor business conducted on a safer footing. I " Empty "West Australia," as it was .desig nated by the editor of tho Investors i2c- view in November last, is offering a 4 per cent, loan in the London market', amounting to £540,000, at a minimum of £102. There can be no doubt that the rich discoveries of gold of late in West Australia have necessitated the construction of moans of communication between the fields and tho metropolis, and this fact will be fully appreciated by the British public. Mr. Wilson even admits that, poor as West Australia has been in the past, still it has a future. "Should any of the gold fields, numbers of which have been recently discovered within tho country, turn out any thing like as rich as predicted and yield large amounts of the metal, poople will flock in from other countries where labor is disor ganised and a living difficult to get, and a certain proportion of these immigrants will in the usual manner drift aside to take up agricul ture and sheep farming and gardeuiug, horse breeding aud coping, or some of the various occupations which have now made the State of California — once a mere gold hunting plaoe — one of the wealthiest and most progressive of tho American Union." This is possible, and per haps not improbable. Whether this Bomowhat cheering outlook will bo realised in West Australia remains to bo seen, but at all events thoro is a very fair opening for the British investor to embark his money in opening up a country acknowledged now to hnvo such a prospect. The indebted ness of West Australia on 20th July, 1892, is shown in the followiug tabic, with the due dates of tho various loans and tho rates of interest pay able : — Hate of Repayable. Interest.

(b) This loan is inscribed at tho offlco of the Crown Agents for tho Colonics, having boon issued prior to the colony of West Australia having self- governing powers. (c) These debentures are redeemable by annual drawings or purchase, such being operative on and ufter 1st April. 1834, a sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum on the accumulative principal being devoted for the purpose of redemption so long as any debentures remain current. (d) Redeemable in same mannar as (c), tho sink ing fund commencing on the 15th July, 1886. (e) Redeemable in saiuo manner as (c), sinking fund commencing on the 15th July, 1889. (f) A sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum on inscribed stock, commencing 4 years from date of Issue, is provided for its redemption. Iu ovont of such inscribed stock being converted from existing debenture stock, tho sinking fund com mences to run from date of issue, 'flic accumula ted sinking fund on the various loans mentioned on tho 30th June, 1892, amounted to £107,160. This sum is hold l>y trustees for the purpose of redemp tion, and by them invested in various Government securities. Tho above figuros show that the annual interest on the debt is as under:— 6 per cent, on . . . . £33,400 is £2,004 5 ,, - .. 87,400 „ 4,370 4-i ,, .... 115,900 ,, b,211 4 „ .... 1,625,061 „ 65,002 £L86L761 £76,587 Deduct accrued sinking fund 107,160 ' Net indebtedness .. £1,764,601 Which gives an average rate of 4.11 per cent, on tho wboie. To this amount must bo added tho £400,000 borrowed in November, 1892, which brings up the indebtedness to £2,154,601, with a total of interest charges amounting to £32,557.

October, 1893 436,000 \ 4 per cent. Tho last loan, that of October, 1893, was offered at a minimum of £97 10s., and realised £98 5s. 2d. Tho total subscription for tho £436,000 asked for amounted to £686,000. The present application is for £540,000, whilst the minimum has been raised to £102 10s. Tho subscriptions close on the 12th in3t., paymonta to be inudo as follows : — 5 per cent, on applica tion, 15 per oont. on tho 19th of Juno, 40 per cent, on the 19th of July, and tho balanoo in August. Taking into account the present posi tion of tho London market, it may bo expected that tho loan will provo a great succes s, not withstanding the high minimum paid for tho 133uo. Our cablo messages to-day st&to; that the Union Bank of Australia has decided to apply to the English law courts to settle its position in connection with the excepted assets of tho Bank of South Australia. It will be recollected that in March, 1892, under the arrangement then made between tho two banks, assets amounting to £569,448 15s. 3d. were excepted for tho bonefit of the shareholders in the Bank of South Australia. Tho realisation of the other asBots has, it seorns, left a liability of .£302,000 to be met by tbo shareholders of tho Bank of South Australia, which is indebted in this amount to tho Union Bauk. It is proposed to make a call to meet this claim, but this is strongly opposed by those interested, who, it would appear, suggest that tho assets excepted under tho arrungement for liquidation should be m&do; available to raeot the claims of tho Union Bank. It is to sottlo this question that the decision of tho Law Courts is to be asked. The only point whioli seehis clear is that tho jUnion Bank's claim will havo to bo paid either fiy a direct call on tho shareholders or by passing over tho excepted assets to meet tho doflcicnoy under tho liquidation. An interesting communication 1ms heon re ceived from tho Foreign Office by the Board of Trade drawing special attention to the Attitude of leading British steamship linos trading to China. According to tho statements mado by tho British consular assistant at Shanghai 11 tho absurd tactics of the companies in regard to froights " is threatening to drivo the trade into tho hands of foreigners. The German lines of 'steamers, it seoms, aro charging rates nearly 50 per cent, undor thoso quoted by tho British, and, concludos tho roport, " treat ment of this kind is, in these days of fluoly calculated profits, not fair to the British shipper, and cannot fail injuriously to affect British trade." Iu tho past attention has been called in our columns to the condition of tho Australian trade, aud it is now almost certain that within a very short time Gorman steamers will bo competing, and competing successfully, for the carriage of perishable produce, not only to Bromen and Hamburg, but diroot to British ports. It is gratifying to lean that Inrgo consign ments of oranges, lemons, dried and canned fruits and jams aro now coming forward freely from Mildura. It is also stated that tho pro ducts of tho irrigation colony find a ready sale. Trade is quiet, and salon reported to-day are not of an extensive character. Tf7j.cat is de pressed. Our Adelaide correspondent wires that shipping prico there has heon reduced to 2s. Id. Tho British Empire, after taking, on board 873 plete her cargo. As staled this morning, this has boon purchased.

The " considerable quantity " credited to this vessel resolves itself iuto 500 tons for Adelaide and 500 tons of refin- ery sorts tor Melbourne, which goc3 direct to the factory. It is evident therefore that thia cannot have a disturbing influeucc ou the market, anil it is a matter for regrot that statements prejudicial to individual interests should find their way into print without being properly verified. At the auction sales to-day no business was done, tho catalogue consisting of qualities evidently not Huitabio to immediate trade wauta ; 15 tons cf . Mauritius manufacturing sorts sold privately.
