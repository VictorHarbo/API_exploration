TnE DISTRESS TN LANOAsnran.-CENTRAL Ii B LIEF FOND - The weekly meotÍDc of tho Exa- ct! ti va Committee, hold at Manchester, WM¡ Misided over by Sir J. Kay Shuttleworth. The lion, secretary reported lhnttho week's receipts' amounted to £0366 Os. 9d. ; balance in tho, liiink, X8Í8.800 l63. 7d. The hon. secrotarv cli-o presented the monthly report, which feinted that the very great Inoreaso of employ- ment which had been ailorded in the mills > ti tiring tho past month had enabled no loss than forty-ssven local committees to suspend ot orations for tho present. From this causer ' Le had not been able to obtain returns from ' tbo;o districts i but ho was led to believe that out of 55,802 operatives resident in tho dis- tricts in it hieb, committees acted about _5,G90,woro working fulísimo, and 10,801 wera ou short timo. Ho was also happy to state« that in tho districts in which local committees uri' still continuing their labours, there wera _ S74 moro operatives working full time than ti 1 ero wero last month. It must not be for fiutten that this WJS in addition to tho 18,451 operatives repotted to have obtained full work in May ; so that of the persons usually « mplcyed in mills, nbout 234,012 wore in fuhV ve ric. 125,097 were working short time, anti' ISO^-Owerooutof woilc. Thi-ro was no doubt tliiit oil the fundB available would ha absorbed te "oro tho closo of winter; for however tlui> committee might husband tboir resources dining summor, the priSsuro os winter ap-^ vrr-Achrd would be sever«*, portly owing to tho' !. «liiood leRources both of the operatives and small sbopkeopers. No fuithergreut improvd ment could b3 anticipated before this timo next year, as alrcatly it had reached the equivalent of on average of threo days pjr tvtek employruout for the opotative popula- tion.; and os at present there are 250,2-10 persons in receipt of reite*, there «asreason- able ground for apprehension that at least an additional 100,000 would havo to bo supportai «hen tho season arrives during which out licor labour will bo coiiBideiably reducid. 'Í he cotton operati ve population, it » d9 found, contained about 224,010 lualtB aboTo Qftcon, t.4,100 nmrik'd women, and 175 700 uti mairicd,wemen and giris. Mr. Commissioner -"nrnall read Ids weekly npoll, by which it appears that on the 27th Juno tuero was a further'dcoroaso of persons receiving relief in twenty-Boven union?, as compared witli the previous week, of 3,601; making a total decrease Bin co the 6th December ot 112,761 pei sonn. Tho committeo then made grant* to the amount of £410 from tho employmoat and school fund, and of £3,010 to thirteen plíices from tho general fund.-English Paper. A NEW RAILWAY SIGNAI..-Travellers oa the Midland Hallway, passingIiogworth. mair have observed at that placo a now signal, vhieh is likely to cause a revolution in rall-' w*y signals. It consists of a clock, with a fuce four feet in diameter, placed on tho top of a column Alteen fett high. Only a quarter of tho clock i« shown, which is formed of K ound glnsp, with red figures 0.6.1O.15, ami l,ns only one hand. Attached to the clock ii a long rod connected with a treadle about sixteen feet long, which liol alonç the In- side of one of the rails. On the train passlag over the trcadlo it is depressed slightly by the wheel flinp,c. and the clcck baud is set at lil orly, and is so adjuf ted by a counterpoise that it turnB to the figure 0, Immediately ti e train lins puffed over, the hand begins again to mark the timo up to fiftfen mlnutoi. vi hen it is stopped, thus indicating to the nest (tain exactly how long np to tifteen minuto» fie prcccdiug train has passed tho signtl. 1 ho Fame clcck works two faccE-one for the np and ono for the down line. Tho signal h illuminated at night. Tho simplicity of tills pif-nal is buch that it ia almost an imposil 1 ility for it to get out of order, and it U s> 8rr»nged that a passing train takes off all pjcspuro from, ino clock, EO that th» gi « at difficulty hitherto experienced in 8>U working signtlj is successfully overcome. Tua Midland Rodway Company, who havo er«ot3it the one abovii th'scrlbed, hate every reasout> 1 e ratisfied with the îeeult of the experiuwuc. It Is calculated that when adopted double the number of night trains may hu safely pa"cd ov« rtholinothatcunbepasäcd over now. Therj can be little doubt that it will prevent hgï&t;â number of accidents from {rünä ninnlng into each other, and placed at mouths of tunnels »».11 be of great service.
