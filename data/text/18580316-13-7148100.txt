COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Monday Evening. . Export entries were passed at the Customs to-day for 17,762 ounces of gold, the whole of which was for shipment to England via Suez, with the exception of 69 ounces for London, in the Maidstone. The demand for gold for remittances having increased during the month, a rise has taken place in the value of this article of produce of nearly 1 per cent. and prices may now be quoted at-£3143.91. to £3 163, for Castlemaine and Sandhurst; ¡C316a. 3d. to 63 16s. 6d. for Mount Korong 3 £8 63, to 63 16s. 6d. for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Creek, and Avoca ; £3 loss. to £3 17s. 6d. for Ararat and Pleasant Greek; £3 17s. to £3 17s. 6d. for the Ovens; and £8 17s. 9d. to £3 18s. 3d. for Ballaarat. The: quantities brought down by escort this week bear favorable comparison with (those of the corresponding week of the past year, and with the average of the past three months. Another week will determine what 1 her the recent rise in prices, which may be roundly stated at 6d. per ounce, will have the effect of bringing forward larger quantities. It appears to be admitted on all hands that hoarding had become almost a habit of the Successful miner during the reign of low prices, but we should hesitate before computing the quantity BO held at any very large amount.

The Royal mail steamship Emeu will sail to-morrow night for Suez, the mails closing to-morrow afternoon for letters and newspapers at the usual hours. The inhabitants of Victoria are fortunately able to reply to the London January mail by this opportunity, but this convenience is not shared in by the neighboring colonies. The dates of departure from Sydney are Used it too short a time from those at which the incoming steamers are due, and hence it has risen that nearly every mail has beeumUaod by a few days. When this has been rectiiUJ, there will be ICES practical cause to come 1 lain of the facts of the European and Australian Royal Mail Company. There have been few movements in the money market to call for remark since the date of our last summary. Capital has been abundant for all purposes, except for speculation in the import market, and at rates uninfluenced by the monetary crises which 1 ever desolated other lands. Large quartz Ks of land have been purchased at full rates, and owners of improved property I have found no difficulty in securing by mortgage the means of proceeding with their improvements. Money has been right for 1 commercial purposes, because the banks and capitalists have felt that speculation 1913 table while a heavy market was daily receiving and warehousing additional articles. The banks charge for bills under 95 days' currency, 8 per cent. from 95 to 126 days', 9 per cent.; and over 125 days', i Oper cent. and on overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent Exchange on England is, at all the banks, at 1 per cent, for 60 days' sight for amounts under £50, at 12 per cent. premium for 30 days sight. Freight on gold, by direct steamers or sailing vessels 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London ; insurance l| 1 recent by the overland route '7 per cent. that is, 7d. per ounce as nearly as possible; insurance 11 to 13 per cent. Among the questions which are being discussed in public and in private circles, that of the way by which the funds are to be raised for carrying on the great railway works sanctioned by the Legislature, is becoming prominent. The Ministry which has just retired from the management of af ours has handed over to its successor a well filled treasury and a thriving revenue under such circumstances, nothing short of gross mismanagement will stand in the way of the procuring from time to time such monies for the due prosecution of these works as cannot be supplied at once from the revenue of the colony. The February series of Crown land sales for the district around Melbourne commenced on the 15th of that month, and extended over nVP days. The total quantity of land alienated from the Crown amounted to 5,225. 2r. 36p., and produced to the territorial revenue the sum of £32,360. The follow! og are the particulars. On the first days' lots at North Melbourne, consisting of Mr. lap., brought £075, or £2,000 per acre; 10 lots at South Melbourne, containing la. 2r. 37p., sold for £2004, equal to £1,350 1s. 4d. per acre; 13 lots at Sandridge, measuring 2a. 3r. 25p., produced £2,957, or £1,016 6s. 6d. per acre ; 3 lots at Northcote, comprising 3r., brought £71 103., equal to £96 6s. 8d per acre; lots at Cranbourne, consisting of 219" sold for £78, or at the rate of £31 4s. per acre : 3 lots at Osborne, on the eastern shore of Port Phillip Bay, containing la. 34p" produced 281 equal to £60 15s. per acre. The second day's sale comprised 13 town lots at Osborne, on the eastern shore of Port Phillip Bay, consisting of on. 2r. 4p., which realised £330 103., being at the rate of £59 10s. 4d. per acre. One suburban lot at Main- bourne, adjoining the township of Wyndham, on the Werribee River, 2a. 1r. 22p., was disposed of at the rate of £33 per acre. Twenty eight suburban lots at Prahran, comprising together 279a. 23p" realised £4,135 93., equivalent to £14 16s. 6d. per acre. The third day's sale consisted of 43 suburban lots at Prahran, containing in all 61 Ga. 2r. 11p., the sum produced being £11,746, or £22 14s. 9d. per acre. The fourth day's sale consisted of 27 lots of country land, at distances varying from about 20 to 55 miles from Melbourne. The quantity of land comprised 4,368. 2r. 30p,, and produced the sum of £8,370, being at an average of £1 183.4. per acre. The fifth and concluding day's sale consisted entirely of town lots at Heidelberg, comprising together 46 acres, which realised £1,109 10s., equivalent to £24 2s. 6d. per acre. The number of persons who arrived by sea at Melbourne during the week, amounted to 859; of which 642 were from the united Kingdom, 47 from the United States, 31 from Suez, s from Rotterdam, and 266 from the neighboring colonies.

N. CÁMPUBIV-I, Registrar-General. The state of the Australian import markets is still anything but satisfactory. Trade, so far as it goes, is sound, being conducted rather on a retail than on a wholesale system. But the report from all the colonies is to the like effect, that stores are overcrowded and stocks increasing. With accumulating stocks, trade must necessarily remain dull. Country storekeepers will prefer making their purchases cautiously, and the speculator will not come forward. The suddenness with which money has become cheap in England cannot fail in having some effect on the disposition which, appeared to be growing in London, Liverpool, and the Clyde to reduce shipments. It is on the extent of this effect that the stability of the Australian markets mainly depends. If the comparative ease with which capital can be obtained lead to the miscellaneous ventures of former years, and to the return of that numerous class of small shippers whom the account sales which reached England in November and December appear to have frightened, no hope can be fitted out of any improvement in trade or in prices. It must also be borne in mind that the pros pects of immigration duringthecurrentiyear are not treat. The reports sent home by those who have arrived here during the last six months have been anything but favorable. Employ- ment has not been so readily procured, and the surface mining on the gold-fields has not been so profitable as in former times and the repetition of these facts, mail after mail, by recent settlers, has not been without insomuch, as the falling off in the arrivals from England during the current year bears evidence. The net immigration in January and February has not amounted to one-half of the monthly and weekly averages of 1857, and while employment is not abundant, and while the yield of the gold-fields at per head of the population is lower than it ever has been before, there is decidedly less consumption of other articles than those generally classed as necessaries. When the railways afford that general and steady employment which has been so long looked for, the requirements will keep pace with increased means ; but these works are as yet only completed on paper. The imports and exports at the port of Melbourne during the current year, as compared with the corresponding period of 18-57, are subjoined. It will be seen that the aggregate varies little in both periods. A great falling off is the only thing that can give life to the markets as they are Imports In the year 1858, up to 30th March. .¡82,727,456 Exports In the year 1858, up to 30th March.. 2,424,018 Balance of imports over exports in the current year. 802,843 The following are the weekly returns of the current year and 1857 respectively : Imports.

Transactions in the import market have continued of very limited amount, 'there has been no speculative feeling whatever evinced. The purchases recently made have been for direct consumption, but the' amount, (divided amongst so many, has scarcely been felt, and no improvement in prices has arisen. The advices received by the English January mail rather kid to the supposition that 1.0 decrease in shipments to this port is likely to take place, and our overstocked stores are consequently groaning under their load.. mines is, however, generally in a healthy state, and If transactions are not large in amount, nor pro while as regards prices, they are steady and legitimate and wife in the result. The up-country trade has assumed a much improved appearance, credits are heartened. the population more settled, and a steady and) improving business Isjcvldontly resulting. . liquor. The unsettled season and extreme and sudden variation of temperature have proved very lr) ing for all descriptions of light beers, and caused an improved demand and consequent advance in value for most preferred brand-.

Both ale and porter, bottled in pints, have been scarce stating that summer, and are still much inquired for, but none being in the market quotations cannot be the. ' . i Spirits. This market, owing to excessive supplies, as heavy as it possibly can be, Sales of brandy she been of very limited amount, and confined to the "'yard the lowest descriptions, medium sorts being Pilcmglectcd.

Geneva of best brands is dull of sale, except In moderate parcels, JDKZ not being worth more than 15s. 3d. to 16s. per case. old tom and whiskey are in so little Inquiry as scarcely to afford quotations. There is a small steady trade in arms, at quoted rates. Wines are still very dull, and sales can booffoetîu only for direct use, at prices which certainly show no upward tendency. Considerable parcels of Inferior light wines have been sold at auction, at about 14s, to 16s. 6d. per doz., but offering no criterion as to the value of superior sorts, which are, however, dull of sale. Flour, Grain, ate. Flour has been in steady request, with improving prices, for actual use, which has tended to give a very firm tone to the market, although no speculative feeling has been evinced. J Stocks are fast lessening the Imports from the neighboring colonies are as yet light, and our own growers seem indisposed to accept present prices. There are still considerable stocks on hand of Adelaide flour, which is sailing in lots from 5 to 10 tons, at 182. to 102 per ton. A parcel from the new crop, Just arrived, has been placed at 102. 6s. per ton. Boxall has advanced in value, and sales have been effected at 202. per ton. The large supplies close at hand are likely to affect the market, if they are thrown on at any time whenever prices are doomed sufficiently remunerative and as there exists no reliable information as to the prospect of coining supplies from either the United States or West Coast of America, there is great uncertainty pro vailing as to the prospects ofprlcoslorthocomlngsoassn. The low rates at which calls for some time stood at length attracted attention, and purchasers having come forward freely, a steady gradual advance in value to present quotations has taken place, at which a fair amount of business has been done. Good Irish oats have been sold at 6s. 6d to 7s., and Scotch at On. 0 J,, and a cargo of Danish changed hands at 6s. 8d. per bushel. During the last few days, however, the Lomond has rather declined, and prices are somewhat easier. Colonial grown are held, the few lots offering in the market readily bringing 7s. 6d. to 8s. 6d. Grain has been influenced in value by the improved prices of other sorts of horse feed, and is in brisk demand!, holders asking 352. to 361. 16s. per ton. Maize is very scarce, and prices consequently nominal. Soo! barley is in request, and being scarce, sells readily, Cape at 7s. to 7s. 6d,, and English at 8s. to 8s. Bl. per bushel. Wheat comes forward very slowly, the supplies from the neighboring colonies Loving hold back in hopes of augmented prices resulting and as the erection of mills in various corn-growing districts of this colony absorbs the greater portions grown in these neighborhoods, prices for supplies on hand have advanced, and we quote 7s. to 7s. 6d. per bushel for good samples. Drugs and chemicals are hold In very large quantities, and nothing but a cessation of shipments can affect prices for the better.
