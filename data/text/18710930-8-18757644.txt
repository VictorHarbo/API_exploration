THE PORT OF NEWCASTLE. iTrom Thurtdatfs Eerala.) The foUowing statistics of the Port of Newcastle (collated and compiled from the most authentic sources) have been carofully brought np to the present time, and will be studied with interest by a large number of our readers desirous of becoming more thoroughly acquainted with the past and present commerce of the principal northern harbour of this colony, _We begin with some particulars re- lative to the coal exports from Newcastle during the ' last sixte enyears ; tne-figurea being such as serve to manifest the-'very great importance of the trade in coal-the main staple of the Hunter Biver district. The details aye such as go, ta show that this trade has gradually increased in magnitude, notwithstanding those occasional fluctuations of* prosperity, which seem to be inevitable in all mercantile and industrial affairs.'" , ' COAL EXPOBT AT THE POST OP TEWCASTLE PB05I THE ÎKAB 18o4 TO 1870 Intercol. .v- _ Coastwis» and Total Tear Foreign m Tons Tons.

At this first decrease, recorded in our table, the coal exported was, net ertheless, as much as 139,938 tons. In 1869, the increase of the coal ex- ported over that of the previous year amounted to 101,433 tons. In 1860, the like increase (still ascending) was 42,610 tons. In 1861, there was another decrease-irrespect of the high total of the previous year-the amount of decrease being- 27,896 tons ; that is to say, 255,940 tons, instead of 283,836 tons. Tjuringtheneztfiveyearstherewasanannual increase of coal exports, the least increase being that shown by the returns for 1865. Thus, in 1862, the increase of exported coal was 101,683 tons ; very closely approximating to that which was exported in 1859. In 1883, the increase was 12,820 tons ; in 1864,SO-oirtons; in 1865,2142 tons; and in 1866, 183,613 toni In 1867, there was a third decrease the amount of that decrease being 53,582 tons; that is to say, 592,033 tons, instead of 845,615 tons. In 1868, -the increase of the coal exported over that of the previous year amounted to 95,187 tons-656" tons (m the annual increase alone) more than was exported from the port of Newcastle alto- gether nr the year 1854. In 1869, the increase of coal exported over that of 1868 was 18,368 tons. Last year (1870), there was a fourth occasional decrease on the antecedent year ; the amount of such decrease being 13,889 tons-692,099 tons instead of the 705,488 tons of coal exported in 1869. From this it may be seen that the coal exported annually through the port of Newcastle, induding the trade coastwise, intercolonial, and foreign, may be fairly estimated at seven hundred thousand tons, represent- ing, even in its present-stage of imperfect develop- ment, a commercial and industrial interest of which the colony may-justly be proud. All these figures may be depended upon, as they are derived from an official source. CHABOTS OX VESSELS.

All the vessels belonging to Newcastle are now re* quired to be registered in the Custom-house, at the corner of Scott and Bolton streets, in that city ; the sub-collector of the port (Mr. W. B. Logan) furnish- ing in every case a certificate of such registration. The number of vessels belonging to the port of New- castle on the 2nd of September, 1871, thus registered. with their tonnage,in pursuance of Acts of Parliament, was as follows :-Nineteen vessels, whose tonnage is under 50 tons, the total tonnage of which was re- turned as 502 ton3. Also thirty-three vessels, whose tonnage is over 50 tons, the total tonnage of which was returned as 7107 tons. Grand total of tonnage of the fifty-two vessels belonging to Newcastle seven thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine tons. From returns compiled from shipping registrars up to the 1st of January, 1871 (completed with much core, and published in the Merald of April last, by Mr. Frederick C. Jarrett).- it is an ascertained i fact that Newcastle has the highett average tonnage ' of any port in Australasia-namely, 180} per vessel. Ancluand, in New Zealand, has the lowest-only 502 per vessel. The like average for Melbourne is 155* tons j and that for Sydney, 135£tona, The average tonnage of the Sydney vessels is greatly reduced by the river steamers and ferries.
