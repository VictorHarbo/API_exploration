Melehior and Co., of this city, we learn that the brig Hiram, from .Shanghai, bound to this port with a cargo of tea, has been wrecked oil' Lima Islands, on a reef about seventy miles to the S.E. The letter, which is dated Batavia, 11th November, does little more than chronicle the event. It appears that the Good Success, also on her way to this ]-ort from China, ob fcerved and visited the wreck on the 9th October last, when it was found with the stump of the foremast only standing, and with the sea washing over the deck, the bulwark and the hatches having been swept away.
