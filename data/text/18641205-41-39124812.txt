The Clara Novella from Liverpool, is com manded by Captain Hingstou, a gentleman who successfully sailed the Queen of '.Sheba when the tint furor of the Victorian gold-fields broke out, and caused the exodus of South Australians somo years hock. His present charp1 is a fine hanjue, though from u 'constant succession of unfavourable weatner rIio ha* been unable to make any exhibi tion of sailing qualities, from the Crozcts to the Lcuwin being the only portion of the passage satisfactorily pcrfunned. She left Liverpool on AugUHt 9, and was 42 days to the Line, losing the northeast tnde in hit. 17', and experiencing southerly breczos to three degrees south of the equator. On arrival nt the anchorage, the pilot was under the impression that there would be sufficient water on the bar next morning, but the easterly wind cut lh« tide, and after towing past the Lightship, be witi compelltd to return to anchor, where it is jnore than probable the vessel will remain till next springs. She has on board a lawe consignment of gunpowder, which will be landed in due course at the North Arm. The S00THE3N Cboss. with a full cargo of Mauritius sugar, called for orders on Saturday, and her destination being Hobart Town, she received on board supplies of fresh provisions, and Captain Lulham intended Sailing on Sunday evening. By jjjs courtesy we have later papers from Port Louis, extracts from which are made elsewhere, lie lapcriln having experienced a perfect hurricane on Jfove^iber 1, and when off King George's Sound on the 2iUi, it blew a violent gule from the east ward. Thb Ja2TE Bell.— Captain Oshornc is still an invalid from the affects of the lute savage assault on him. and in consequence the brig was detained at the Lightship, but will sail immediately in I'barjpi of Captain Stevenson (late of the Kxonia.) The Precio^a is a smart three-moated schooner, wiieh touched for orders, with a cargo of tea from Foochow. The Scsaxne, from Hamburg. L-ings 49 pas' stagers and the usual description of carjjo. par liciaiW of which will be given when she enters ^n wards at the Custom House. During the passage nothing of importance orairred.
