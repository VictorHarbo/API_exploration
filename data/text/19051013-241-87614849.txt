'IJI.fMIGIATION AND SETTLE MfENT. During the course of his Budget speech in the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday, the Treasurer, MIr Bent said: .--The Cabinet has under consideration a bill providing for the establishing and controlling of small improved holdings of land. The bill is chiefly founded on the Danish system, "and un der it probationary .tenants receive as sistance, under supervision, until the land is sufficiently improved to enable the tenants to become self-supporting and obtain a lease. It is my intention to introduce this bill, so that, if pos sible, it may become law before the termination of tile .ession. It pro poses to supply .t£200 worth of land to each tenant, and to assist him to the extent of £2100. lie will be given £1 a week for the first six months, 15/ a week for the second six montlis, and .10/ a week for the third six months. Experts will be appointed to teach these men how to carry out the work, and the amounts advanced will be chlarge:l to the mien, who, will be al lowed 33 years in which to repay themnn., The bill applies to both purchased and Government land. The remarks which I wish to make in regard to innmigra tion are from the lirst to the last 9nly suggestive. It is readily admitted that we want more agriculturists "':people who will become producers; not C' those who are idling in town and mak ing matters wors e. Where will they come fromn? Statistics showing thile .total population and the agricultural plopulation of the principal European countries have been submittcd to the Canadian Parliament. These show that Canada has taken immigrants from all these countries, provided each of them ihad 100 dollars. and has given them 154" acres of land, in addition. Canada, with its vast unoccupied areas, may be able to afford this sys term. Since 1S73 the total area set apart for settlement is 101,S19,015 acres, giving 655,230 larmers 160 acres each. Last year 12,700,000 acres were cut up into 160-acre farms, to the number of 79,435.: Froth 1S99 to 1904, durinig which period the :immigration propaganda' has been active, the nunm ber' of 'imiigrint' is as follows 189, "'44,000? 1900: 23,000; h1901, 49,00 -102, 67,( 000i 3003, 12S.000; 19104;, 30,000:: 'In lihe past six years Canada haNs added 443 ,651 souls to its piiipulatioi.
