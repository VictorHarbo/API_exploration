Many attribute this to the climata; and, in faofc, tbe climate i* responsible-very slightly, however. If you feol WB4BT and lack energy, you may rest assured that your blood la thin, week, and Impure; if it wsre rioh and pare it would impait vitality and energy to every nerve and orgsn in the body, and tba whole system would be robust: and healthy. When the flj stem is ran down from weasnees of the blood, you bsooma tired end WORN-OUT and yoa are only able to do & very slight amount of work without feeling great fatigua. You have a constant desire to lie down, and at the e&d; of the day feel utterly worn ont and dispirited Yon mty, by force of will, overcome that worn-out FEELING or a time, but this coarse acts on the fnerves, &adexults; eventually in "nervous prostration" the blood only becomes impure when the stomaoh, liver, and bowala are not in good working order, and the digestion is poor. The liver fails to perform its {emotions in cleansing the blood, and the Byefeetn becomea "run down." BILE BE&IS; ere the best romedy for complaints of this sort. They enable the stomach to do its work quickly and thoroughly, help the liver to help itself, ana do away with Constipation and Iadigestion, rich blood ie the resale and with a stream of red, pure blood flowing through your veinc, you will bo freo from disease, and look of energy wi 1 be a thins of the past.

THE TRIAL Ego SHIPMENT.-The London correspondent of T/ie Advertiser, writing on December 21, said Major Norton has experienced a great disappointment in con nection with the shipment of eggs from South Australia, concerning which I wrote briefly last week. As you already know some of the cases realised the splendid price of 12s. per long hundred, and others the highly satisfactory figure of 10s. for six score. But the balance turned out much less satisfactory, for not only did some of the oaspp prove tP contain a number of eggs that would sparsely pas's rflustpr as f con fectioner's eggs,' but the contents of a num ber of the oases had a fine fruity flavor, which suggested that the diet of the respon sible hens had consisted to a large extent of lemons. Tbe reason for this entirely . un eggy' flavor is probably to be found in the fact that the eggs were packed in discarded lemon caae^ by tfye producers. There are few things tliat so readjly tajce up the flavor of strong scented goods that may be in close proximity to them as eggs. 1 am told, in deed, that they ap eypn t^ore susceptible in tnis respect than butter, and that, as most of us know, is very sensitive stuff. Major Norton, I understand, disposed of the balance of the shipment at 8a. per case, but from information received to-day I learn that pne of the bjjyara hap thrown his lot back on the jjajora hancjs, ow|ng to the ' fruitiness? aforementioned," .
