J Young German men and women would make excellent migrants for Australia, according to Perth Modern School languages teacher John €. GreenhiU, who has just returned from Ger many. The young Germans he saw were 'fine types,' Mr. Greenhill said. With two other teachers — on© torn Melbourne and one from Sydney — Mr. Greenhill was chosen by the Commonwealth Education Department to do a job for the Immigration Department. Last May they went to Germany. Their duty was to meet prospective migrants, return on a migrant ship and help 'Australianise the new Australians.' They worked with German staffs In Displaced Persons camps, found the Germans to have 'a keen hatred of war and all it brought in its train.' 'We were besieged with Inquiries from Germans into the possibilities of emigration to Australia.' Mr. Greenhill said. 'It is my personal opi nion that we could do a good deal worse than ad mit quite a number of these young Germans. 'My opinion is shared by numerous other Austra lians engaged in various branches of the work of the armies of occupation in Berlin, Hanover, and north to Flensburg on the Danish border.' Germans appreciated the work of the British and Americans, who had not subjected them to a harsh occupation but had sought to help them.
