Much amusement has been caused at the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, by the urgent petition of two p:'etty blue- eyed Danish girls, Alfild Anderson and Igeborg Jansen, of Copenhagen, for permission to de part imunediately for Wiona (Minne sota). They are the cheerful victims of an eccentric will made by their Rrand father, who bequeathed them each a' half-sholre of 600 acres of' fine farm lands, on condition that they marry within 30 days of their arrival in New York. By the terms of the will, which the two cousins explained to an inter preter, title to the lands wil not be finally vested with either of them until they become mothers. If at the oend of five vears one of cousins has a child and the other has not, the motherless one will lose half her land to the other. If neither has children *at the end of five years the entire property is to revert to a male cousin in Denmark. Both girls departed for Minnesota, confidently declarinng, in broken English that they would find gocd husbands within the stipulated term.--'"Daily Mail."
