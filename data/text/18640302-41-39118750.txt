She remained hove-to for a considerable time when abreast the Semaphore Jetty in order to receive on board a pilot, for whom it was necessary to make a signal, as there were none in attendance at the station. The delay, however, caused no incon venience to the brig, as she sailed into harbour on the nest tide. ._ The Daphne, from Venus and Streaky Bajs, returned to port on Tuesday, having lost her jib lwom the previous night during a heavy squall. The Hippocampe, from Sydney has on ward portion of a cargo, consisting of coals and sundries, and her touching here is merely to nil up with cereals for Port Louis. The Amkie Beaton ai rived on Tuesday morning from Port Wallaroo, where she discharged a cargo of timber which was laden in the Don. t The Atrevtda has been taken on lletchers Patent Slip for repairs. The steamer Young Australian, when about three miles from the Lightship on her return from Port Arthur, between 9 and 10 o'clock on Monday evening, became disabled through the sudden breaking of the shaft. As soon ^s the nature of the injury was ascertained. Captain Creer found it would be impossible to proceed further. He accordingly sent the mail on shore in a boat and ?procured the services of the steamer Letty, by which she was towed up to the Port on Tuesday morning. The repairs will probably necessitate a delay of two or three weeks. The Analgista reports that the Summer Cloud and three other vessels bound to the eastward were wind-bound at Cape Jervis on Monday last. VESSELS IN HARBOUR.
