Stock and Sn.un; Maiiket. — There has been rather more business done in this market during the lasL few days, but transactions havo been chiefly confined to bank, railway, nnd insurance stocks. Government debentures nro frequently asked for by investors, who are not disposed to put very largo sums of money into the shares of public companies, aud for this class of securities, a ready sale would bo found, were any put 011 the market. In bank slocks, Colonial, Nntionnl, nnd Yielori-', are most in quired for, nnd buyers are keeping pace with the stead:,y advancing demands of sellers. Colonials have sold at LG 5s to LG Gs Gd ; Nationals, nt L2 15s Od nnd L2 16s Oil. Vic torias, nt L34 10s lo L35 10s. Insurance shares were iu belter demand until Friday, when Ihe news of tlio Bnllanrat firo operated ill deterring buyers unlil tho extent of lors en tailed on tho different companies should be ascertained, previously Life and General had sold readily at 47s Gd, anil Australasian nf 27s Gd, and Colonials were coming into better favour. For railway shares Ihc sale is slow, though suburbans have bcon improving, and buyers at LS5 were in tlio market Hobson's Bay barely commanded par. Mining Companies shares have been o little dealt ic, tliat a. report of tlicm can scarcely bo made. AVith the ex ception of one or two companies, tlio shares of which aro firmly held, tho list is little bet ter llian n succession of blanks. M'Nnirs havo sold at LSDs and S7s 6d; Nelsons Reefs, at 20s nnd 17s Gd, having lost ground during the week, from rumours of mis-manage- meat, and tlio prospect of a new issue of shares. Among other sales wo may just nolice Cathe rines, 12s ; Mnryboroughs, 83 Gd and 10s ; Steiglilz, 17s Od ; Sandy Creeks, 23s Gd to 25s ; Star Reef, lis Gd to 12s ; and A'ietorians, 10s to 12s. Import Markets. — A steady and improv ing business lias been doing during the past week, and in some directions a tendency to speculative operations iu view of The incoming mail lias been apparent. Purchases of this latter kind liavo not, however, met with much encouragement, liolders being for tlio most part disposed to await with confidence their next advices. Tho business lias been chiefly for trade supply, and thero lias been a good demand for Hour, rice, butter, candles, bottled beers, nnd a few other nrticles of regular con sumption. - For bulk nlo (iio inquiry has bcon rather slack; sales of Bass No 3, nt L8 2s Gd nro reported, though few are disposed to sell at that rato. Bottled ale nnd porter have sold freely nt advanced rates : Byass's porter at 10s, and ales nt 9s to 9s 9(1. Thero is also a slight improvement noticeable in brandy — Martcll's dark has sold at lis, pale at 12s ; Hcnncssy's, in ease, 35s. Best brands of old torn and geneva nro ill better demand ; mid rum 10 0. p. sells more freely at 3s to 0s 3d. Good ports are selling .bettor, and for light summer wines there is n fair inquiry. In the provision market, butter has been in somewhat better doinmd at lid and llftd.': Priino bacon and linms soil freely — tlie former at 9ftd to lOd, and the latter at 12ftd. Sound good quality cheese readily brings 1 4d, but tho supply is scarce. Tilers has boon nn not-ivo inquiry for vice at L19. Our stock of cofiVo this week lias been increased by tho arrival of the Express, but in it is not thrown 011 tlio uinrkct prices aro firm at 10)d for native and Is for plantation. Teas nnd sugars continu'o very firm notwitstnnding fresh arrivals. Con siderable sales of three-bushel bags nrereported at from lis 3d to 12s. . Tho timber trado con tinues firm. Sootch flooring lias advanced, nnd. quotations now oro, for 6x1, ld, and G x lft, lftd. American liinbor at L14 to L14 10s. Candles aro firmer. Belmonts liavo been bought, to arrive, at lGftd. Nevas nro held nt 17d. Of the flour nnd graiii market Mr. AY. Lawran'eo". reports as follows : — The closing of past, .and . during tho currency of tlio' present weok, the corn market has exhibited considerable activity, sales of flour boing mndo to a large extent, Fkowise wheat, both at slightly advanced rates, while some' descriptions, of horse ..feeding stuffs hiive partukon of samo feeling. Flour : Tlio imports are moderalo in' extent, and principally' from South Australia, . which found a ready sale from ship's side. As the various brands carao forward from tliat .colony, tlio markod improvement in tho dressing in some of them is apparent. AVIiilo tlio superior . productions of the first-elass mills cannot be surpassed, the initiation of such a movement will now bo deemed im perative upon nil our flour producing colonio3, as thoy will havo to compote with our im proved milL power, and .supqrior quality of wheat grown here. The first flour, tbo pro- iducp.oftho present crop, manufactured by John Hart nnd Co., at- their mills, Port Ade laide, reached diera in - tlio course of this week, tlio quality of which created marked attention, andufinding an immediate sale at extreme rates. Over 100 tons'Chiliau flour havo beon quitted at auction at L15 5s ;' 2600 barrels of Unitod States, with all faults, and !on account of. 'whom it may concern, Bold nt auotion, realising nbout 30s. Town millers quote L18. Sales of Adelaido. sorts range from L17 IO3 to L18 ; Mngarcy's and'Hart's superfine, L18 15s por ton. The supplies of theso- two . brands fall- short of . tho demand very considerably. United States, 40s por- barrel. ' AVheat.— - Supplies .'havo cbiri'o. forward from I South Australia, which ' luivo. realised 7s to 7s 3d; Chilian and Californirin Gs' 9(1. New wheat in small quantities, tlio growth of this colony,' will likely reach -the country mills in tho. course of next week, soon to be followed by full supplies : of -first- clh9s grain. Oats— The im ports, fall 'off in colonial, sort's, which has crentdd a rather better fooling -in this "descrip tion, strengthened, 110 doubt, - by a rise in' the value of maize,, and scarcity of bran. Somo largo 'parcels of llriali, - .Scotch, ..Dutch,- and Danish, have beou quitted at low rates.' Now oats come very sparingly- to hand, ' farmers being generally -too busy to throsh'out'and pre pare them fdr" tho'miivkct" Closing quofntiona oro as follows i—rlrish : and .Seotoh u2a :t0' 3s ; Dutch and Daiush; 3s ; Russian' arid Calcutta, 2i,Gd 1 to 3s j California!), 33 Id to' 3s 4d ; .colonial) 3s SI to 3s iBdper. bushel. Barley. — No transactions to note. Maize. — Owing to 601110 awkwnrdncssjii tho season, fostered by a speeulotivo feoiing, prices have run up to n high figure in Sydney, nnd, following here, holders now demand 4s per bushel. Gram remains unchanged. Bran is in better request, and nn advance has been established, closing prices boing Is 4d to Is 4ftd per bushel. Oatmeal may bo quoted nt LIS to L21 ; Bencraft's colonial, L25 per ton. Malt sti'l maintains its position ; sales of colonial lake place at 7s Gd to 9s, English, 13s per bushel. Potatoes arc easier, as supplies como mora plentifully to hand, and L4 10s to L5 par ton may now bo given as n quotation. Estimated imports of flour and grain at tho port of Melbourne, from Sth lo lllli January, inclusive : — Flour, South Australian, 4G0 tons ; wheat, South Australian, 7900 bushels; oats, Tasmania!), 1 100 bushels ; maize, from New South AAAilcs, 2800 bushels; bran, South Australian, 2000 bushels ; Tnsniuninn, 850 bushels ; Now .South A Yules, 75 bushels. Deliniquin Stock Market. — The follow ing is from tlio Southern Courier ol Friday : — The past week has been singularly unpro- duelive of business of any kind iu the local stock market, nnd our report is in consequenco meagre in tlio extreme. Tlie quantity of store entile in the neighbourhood lias neither been increased nor lessened since our last summary. AVith the exception of Home's caltle — 130 liend — which our Hay correspondent alludes to in his letter, 110 fat stock lias crossed tlio Edward. This correspondent, however, says that mustering is going 011 at Ninnuio and Boiuhick. The only sale of cattle tliat we can report is tliat of 170 head (fat cows) oil tho AVarbrcecnn run, to Hyde, the price being L4 17s Gd. A draught of ISO head of fat ! cattlo linve moved lowmvnrds from AVar- brcccan. Another mob is also reported to havo left AVerrni. Nothing has been done in horses or sheop. Feed and water continue to be abundant. Tlie river is rapidly fading. Live Stock. — The following is the quarterly return of cattle, sheep, and lambs received and sold at the Melbourne cattle yards, from 1st October to 31st Deeombor, 18G0, compiled by Messrs. Power, Rutherford, and Co. : — Cattle. — Totnl quantity, 1G,0SG ; sent hack unsold, 221 ; town trade, 12,3-lG ; country, 2943 ; shipping, 57G ; totnl, 15,8G5. Calves. — Total quantity sold, 812.

First half-year to 30th June, 18G0: liend cattle, 37,523. Second half-year to 31st December, 18G0 : Head callle, 32,078.

Total consumption of sheep during 1800, 150,204. Tbo abovo is the usual qunrtorly statement, showing what stock lias been re ceived into tlio yards nt Flemington, and how tlie same lias been disposed of, and the figures will bo found js nearly approximate lo the truth as can bo ascertained. The Inst half of tlio past , year shows little alteration in tlio average numbers sold, except in the case of lambs, the consumption of which has much increased. Cape or Good Hope. — AAro havo received Cape papers to tlio 22nd Octobor. The fol lowing is the latest commercial news : — Business lind ns3umod an improved aspect at Cape town. AYool was coining freely to town, and tlie clip promised to be a heavy one and of good quality. AVine was a drug in tho market, exporters boing unwiliing to purchase iu prcscnco of tho unfavourable re ports of the English market. Tho following is from tlio Mail and Adver tiser of the 20th October : — Tlie railway works are now being pushed 011 in earnest, nnd tho breakwater works are also making progress. These undertakings will be tho means of circulating money, and give an impetus to tlio trado of the town. The immigrants lust arrived, a great portion of whom were out of employment for somo time, have all been engnged. The patent slip nt Simon's Bay is in con stant request, niul is likely to ba a prosperous undertaking. Tho London and South African Bank, will in a short time commence operations in tlio colony. It was expected that a charter would be obtained iu a few days after the Celt sailed. Tlio money market has been easier 011 tho whole, and discounts have been mora readily obtained. There isa largo amount of commer cial bills offering nt from ft to 1 per cent dis count. Treasury bills are at par, and tlio banks are drawing, so flint there is overy facility ottered for remitting.
