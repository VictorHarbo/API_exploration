DANISH AND SWEDISH IMMIGRANTS. "K.L." foola indignant about It:— In correspondence on tho above Dr. Arthur intimates that Count Mnrner Is In error, and that n Swedish journalist Is In n position to prove it. While most people here do not tuko Dr. Arthur or his literature on immigra- tion seriously. It Is apparent that the gentlc- mnn from Sweden has yet to peruse tho series of "oouleur de rose" letters from tho doctor, which have done much to dnmaQo our good name In other countries. Apart from this, however, the inhabitants of Sweden nnd Denmark would be surprised If they knew how the resources of this country, particularly tho land, are locked up by mono polists, and for those without plenty ot money arc nothing hut a snare and delu sion. It Is putting the cart before the horse to attempt to bring people in numbers he». before the land question Ih dealt with, and to continue doing so must result In tho lowering of our standard of life. Tlu-so facts, are doubtless as apparent to Count -Morner as they arc to many others, and, as I have no doubt, thoy will become so to tho Swedish gentleman referred to.
