It. is a pure: and nourishing vegetable oil, white in color, and very palatable. "Hitherto,!' writes the British consul at Marseilles, "the quality made hero could not bo used as. a substitute for table butter, oxying to the fact that it. would melt at a temperature of 25deg. C.- It was preserveil and shipped te the Uiiited Kingdom in barrels, and, like a similar product made in tho United Kingdom, was used there wholesale. , My notes on tlie subject Inst year wore wrilten'sololy to draw attention to a now departure on the port of a Marseilles firm. This firm, having suc ceeded in preparing a cocoanut oil that would remain 'solid up to 31deg 0-, began to setl it 'as a substitute for butter for tlie breakfast table, but , under the namo of vegetal mo. it is cms nexv rorm ot cocoa- nut oil tliat is being placed on the British market through a Glasgow and London firm. Tho publicity given to my remarks has resulted in bringing an increased num ber of orders to the Marseilles firm., I an i told tliat tlio reason why the United King dom cannot compete with Marseilles- on even terms is that the alcohol at a high . strength required in the process of f reczing tho oil of all color aiid taste cannot bo used in tlie United Kingdom as "it is in France, except duty. paid,, although not a particle of tlie spirit remains in the result ing product." The feature of the Danish Agricultural Congress at Odenseo was the butter exhi bition, which was not only the largest ever seen in Denmark; but in the whole world. Of the 718 exhibitors who entered 675 were co-operative creameries. These 675 cream eries represented 100,000 Danish agricul turists, who thus showed their products in directly. Tho quality ' o-f the butter Was very high, as was evidenced by the fact tliat 76; per cent, of the .exhibits .wore awarded prizes. Tho State .inspector reported that tlie greater number of, butters , passed over left very little to be desired. . There can be no doubt that the superior duality of the butter' was duo in great measure to the high, pasteurisation of thi crean as well as, to the use of lactic ferments. : For some time, post the Argentine farm- ' ers have been tiying to establish an export butter trade, and it now looks as if they have succeeded. The shipment .of butter from that countiy for the first three months of the present year falls not far short of 1000 tons, which is almost double ilie cor- respondng quantity of a year ago. The ex pansion of this trade needs to be carefully watched 1>3' Australiasian butter-farmers, to whom the Argentine dairy farmers may in time become strong rivals upon the Bri- tish markets. Australasia and Argentina, being both south of the equator, their but ter seasons are tlie same, whilst the latter is only half as far from England as the form er.
