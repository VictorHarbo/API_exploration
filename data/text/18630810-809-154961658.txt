COMMERCIAL. I \----- Age Office, Saturday Evening. Export entries were passed at the Customs to-day on 8G1 07. gold, all for shipment per Istanboul, for Hong Kong. Business during the past week has been charac terised by great dulness and general inactivity. Tho town demand has been languid in the extreme. Country orders come very sparingly forward ; aud ouo or two failures which havo takon place, though small aud in themselves really of no account, havo tonded to check operations by creating a want of confidence that nover fails to act injuriously to trade ; we have, consequently, to draw attention to few or no changes in tho import market. In bulk ales, Bass's No. 3 shows somo improvement. Wool packs liavo boon in full request at full rates. Damaged parcels of candles are still offering at auction. In coffee there is no change. Currants are a triflo lowor. Flour, stimulated by largo sales in Ade laide, ha3 been moro dealt in. Blasting powder has advanced a little. Considerable trans actions havo taken placo in malt, and the market presents a rather better appearance. In provisions, butter is quite unsettled. Hams and bacon nre, however, steadier. Rico receives more trado atten tion, but is void of any speculative feeling. Salt obtains no notice. Sugar is very heavy and pressed by continued heavy arrivals. Tea is quiet, but firm. Tobacco is inactive. Timber is drooping. Wines and spirits call for no remarks. Messrs William Harrison and Co., iu connection with tlie.Now Zea land trade, held a meeting of creditors, at which it was decided to assign the estate to Messrj E. Cohen and Charles Watson, with power to sell the same for an amount that will realise to tho creditors 15s per pound. Tho liabilities were stated at £8972, and tho assets estimated nt £9396, showing £900 in favor of tho estate. Tho temporary suspension of another small firm is also referred to; but a3 tho ono in question shows 30s in tho pound, no loss is expected to bo suffered in consequence. Tho firm's transactions aro also statod to be in connection with New Zoaland. Tlio British and foreign arrivals ' compriso ono vessel from Calcutta, ouo from Singa pore, one from Capo Town, two from America, threo from London, four from Mauritius. Ale and Stout. — Bulk alo continues without attracting much notico. Sales are confined to sup plying trado wants, no alteration being noticeablo on tho relative position of the different brands, with tho sole exception of Bu3s's No. 3, which, in conse quence of most of the parcels hitherto pushed on tho market, at a low figuro, having bcon cleared off, has stiffened somewhat, as wo understand £7 5s to havo been offered and refused for 50 hhds, nud thero lias, in cousequonce, been more anxiety to purchnso evinced by dealers. Allsopp's is offered at £7, but sales have not boon numerous. Joule's commands £8, in trade lots. Marian's finds buyers nt £7 7s 6d to £7 12s Od, at which figures somo businoss has been done.

Bottled stout is not active, and to effect sales a reduction has to bo submitted to. On Honry Whito and Co.'s there is a doclino of 3d — 10s to 10s 3d being tho present quotation. Blood's is held for 10s. Sales of Machon's aro offocted at 9s 6d to 10s. Dunphy s, though quoted at Us oil, has ueeu quitted nt 9a.

Dealers realised 25s for bost brauds, and a like figure for American plaster. For Roman there is no trado. Chemicals. — There is more inquiry for soda crystals at £8 15s to £9.

Sultanas aro in fair request at 74d ; and figs at 6Jd. Pears havo been sold nt Is. Flour and Grain. — In tho early part of the week tho flour market was very quiet. Telegraphic advices from Adelaide of tho sale of about 1000 tons thero, however, imparted some degree of firmness to it here, aud sales of upwards of 200 tons of Hart's have since been mado at £14 ; and to-day 50 tons of Moyna Mills havo been placed at £12 7s 6d ; but with these exceptions, tho amount of business dono has been small, and liniitod to trade purposes, at £14 for Duffield's and otlior Adelaide flour, and £13 10s for country silk dressed brands ; Victorian, Moyne and Merri mills having been disposed of at £13. Wheat does not coino forward freely. Ade laide meets a ready sale at 6s, and Victorian 53 3d to 6d. Feeding realised 4s 9d. Feeding barley is languid and without much inquiry at 4s 3d.

Malt has experienced some attention, several bins having br-on placed at 8s 6d. Tho market is firmer, and there is'au evident desire on tho part of im porters to obtain an advauco. Ono biu is reported as having been placed to-day at 8s 9d, delivered in Geelong. There has nlso been a l'air trado demand, parcels having been disposed of at 9s.

Oils. — Linseed is slow of salo at 6s Gd ; castor realises in trado lots 6s ; kerosene is heavy, and parcels can only be placed at a decline. Couzzens and Downer's we quote 2s 10d, and Oriental 2s 7d to 2s 8d for large quantities ; however, those rates could not be got. Colza and olive oil are quite neglected. Oilmen's Stores. — Bottled fruits bring 13s to 13s Gd; 1-lb jams are offering at lis 6d to 12s, showing n slight reduction ; pickles bring 8s to Vs 3d ; Butty's red cabbage sold for 9s 4Jil to 9s Cd ; Lea and Perrins' Worcester sauce, half pints, brought 12s ; Wood's half-pint salad oil, 6s 9d ; Peat's, lis 9d ; Copland's, jj, 5s ; Bayno's, half pints, Gs 3d por dozen; Column's mustard, 7Jd per lb; 1-lb salmon, 16s 3d. Sundries havo been in request ; holders and importers ask 6s Gd and 9s Gd, which large buyers lefuso to give. Provisions continue in a very unsatisfactory position. Tho price of butter is nominal, 13d to 13 £d, and that rate might bo realised for whatever is wanted. This, however, docs not suit importers, and resort to auction is tho cousequonce, when as low as 7id lias been accopted. Tho demand at present is small, and, uuless at auction, no sales of any consequence can bo effected. Sinclair's hams havo been sold nt Is lid, nnd bolly bacon at Is Id. Cooy's liavo been sold at Is, but tho market is sinco firmer, and Is Id is now asked. Cheese: North Wilts brings Is l^d to Is 2d; Dunlop's, Is 0 d to Is Id. Quicksilver is unaltored, at Is lOd for California, and Is lid for Spanish. Rice lias experienced an improved country domand, at £20 for twenty-two lots. It is likely, howover, a small trado will now bo done pending tho arrival of tho mail. Salt, notwithstanding holders boing inclined to accept reasonable rates, has not attracted much notico. Buyers' viows, liowevor, aro at present too low to lead to much business. Coarse is valued at £3 to £3 5s, and lino at £4 15s. Sugar. — T his markei remains languid ; large sales have boon effected at nuction, but at a decline, and tho imports continue on so largo a scale as to destroy any hopo of an early improvement. Tho cargoes of tho Cassina and Bospliorus were offered on Wed nesday ; tho first named was withdrawn, in order that it might bo landod and sorted prior to salo, as thero was a probability of a portion being damaged ; but tho most of the latter, consisting of 4700 bags, was disposed of at £19 10s to £23 for good and ra tions, £28 for fino groy ami brown, and £33 for grey crystals ; wo hoar of tho latter having since been sold in trado parcols at an advance of £2.

Two additional cargoes, tho Santiago and tho Minna, havo sinco come in. Tea. — A fair demand exists for all qualities. Fine has boen sold as high as 2s lOd to 3s, and mediums at 2s 3Jd, but a moro active inquiry is folt for qualitios ruling at 2s to 2s Id. Tobacco has been very quiot, few sales of any consequence having transpired. Wo quoto ton's in trado lots, at 2s Gd to 3s, und halves at 3s to /ifl. Timber. — Tho cargo of lumber per Fouelon was was offered on Friday. Tho lumbo.v sold at £8 12s Gd to £8 15', and tho clear pino, all faults, at slightly reduced rates. Tho deals wero withdrawn ut 4jjd. A portion of tho Game Cock's, which was withdrawn from Friday's sale, has since been placed at au advauco of £1. Wines and Spirits. — Both ports and sherries are without improvement, and sales of either descrip tion aro very limited. Palo Martoll's brandy, in bulls, is scarco, and much short of requirements ; lis 9d ie readily paid, but holders scruple to part witli pale without an equal quantity of dark, which latter can be got at 11b 3d. Renault's is valued at 10s to 10s 6d ; U.V.P., 10s 3d to 10s 9d ; Otard, 10s to 10s 6d ; C.V.P., 10s to 10s 6d ; Clozenu, 10s to 10s 3d ; Leger Freres', 9s Od to 10a for dark and palo.

Whisky in bulk has boon sold at 3s Gd, aud iu caso is offering nt lis to 12s. 10 por cent, o.p. rum sells slowly at 3s to 3s 3d, and 30 o.p. at 3s 9d to 4s. Old torn is valued at 13s to 14s Gd. Colonial Produce. — Thero are no transactions in wool to record. Thero is still a good inquiry' for fiuo mutton tallow ut £42 to £46, but for commoner sorts thoro is no demand; quotations aro £28 to £32 for beef, aud £33 to £37 for mixed. SheopsMus havo been sold at 5.Jd to 6Jd. Several lots of liidos havo boon placed at 6s 9d to 9s. Good averago hidos, in shipping order, command lis to 13s.

Immigration. — Tlhe number of passengers arrived at the port of Melbourne during the past week, by way of seaboard, was 786, specified as under : — Colonies, 396, of which number 251 are return pas- sengers from Otago ; United Kingdom, 372 ; Mauri tius, 8 ; Boston, 10. New South Wales. — Wo havo our files from Now South Wales to tho 5th inst. The following is from the Sydney Morning Herald of tho 4tli : — The customs revcuuo collected at tho port of Sydney during tho month of July amounted to £37,423 4s 5d. For tho corresponding month of 18G2 tlio receipts wero £49,428 15s. Thero is, therefore, a docrease iu the month of £12,005 10s 7d, or 24 per cent. This doclino in tho customs revenue is not to bo wondered at, considering the large amounts that were recoived in Juno and July on the speculation that somo alterations would bo made in tho tariff on tho meeting of Parliament. During tho first soven months of tho year 1862, the amount of customs rovonue collected was £376,824 lGs 7d. For the same period of tho prosont year tho receipts havo reachod £131,647 14s lOd, which is an increase of £54,822 8s 3d, or 14J per cent. Gkeat Bbitain. — Wo aro in receipt by the Nor folk of ono day's lator news from England, namely, to the 27tli May. Tho following is tho latest report of tho markets : — If anything, money is a shade easier in tho dis count market, nud the price in Lombard street is 3^, aud in soma instances 3j, but thoso nre exceptional. It is very evident, howover, that the money market can bear no further pressuro in tho sbapo of either now loans or new schemes, having for their object the emi-loymont of capital abroad. Thoro soeins also a disposition to question whether three companies of tho Credit Mobilier class are requisite. Doubtless, thoso companies aro looked upon with very consider able joalousy by thoso who have realised colossal fortunes by tlio command of colossal capital ; but they say nothing a^niust tho success of the new system if prudently and ably conducted. At all eveuts. tho premium the shares of the new Financial companies maintained in tho market are a proof that the public regard them with considerable favor. Perlinps tho jealousy with which their pro ceedings will be watched by those of great power and capital will bu tho best safeguard for their being prudently' managed. It is more than probable also, if tho intorests of threo financial associations aro found to clash, that tlicy may bo amalgamated. That many of tho now banks thut havo been formed will find it tlieir interest to adopt this course we lmvo uo doubt whatever, for thero is not business for them all — in fact wo hear of many negociations going on having this object in view. It is abso lutely tho duty of tho directors of a new bank, if they find they cannot obtain sufficient business to carry it on, to amalgainato with somo of tho esta blished banks, who would always be ready to do so on equitable terms. By this judicious courso any loss may be avoided. Letters from Paris still favor tho idea that a riso will shortly take place in tho rate of discount of tlio Bonk of Franco, and they request their correspondents iu London not to send them any but short-dated paper.
