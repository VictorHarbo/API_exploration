THE fwloitg 50iTO'fei:r, [ESTABLISHED L-SAOJ MONDAY, OCTOBER 7TII, 1S7S. A NOTION prevails that to advocate an increase to the population of this colony by any oi-ganised system of immigra tion, is little less than treason to the interests of the industrial classes, en tailing unpopularity upon the jour nalist, and upon the candidate for par liamentary honors certain exclusion from political power. We have suffi cient faitli, however, in the intel ligence of the average working man in this country to believe that he is neither afraid to have this nor any other question discussed upon its merits. Nor'is there any occasion why he should be. He is the control ling power of the State, and without his sanction at the ballot-box no great ques tion of public policy can be decided. So far, it will be allowed that he has exercised this power moderately, and with excellent judgment, and, believing in his practical wisdom, we have no hesitation in demanding Ms attention to a few important facts that we shall put before him. According to the poli tical economists, there are three well defined stages in the progress of a country, the pastoral, the agricultural, and the manufacturing, each marking a certain degree of advancement as re gards population, wealth, and refine ment. It took the United States a hundred years to get through the first two epochs,, and arrive at the third. Favored by circumstances, this colony has travelled more rapidly, and within fifty years, with less to-day than a mil lion of people, we have arrived at a stage that enables us to supply with wool the markets of the world, to grow more corn than we need for our own consumption, and to supply ourselves with a vast variety of manufactured necessaries that at the age of 50 America was con tinuing to import from the old world. We have, in the matter of production, indeed,, already reached a point that suggests the necessity of finding either markets abroad, or more consumers at home. Wool-growers realise this neces sity, and are endeavoring to find new markets in the East, and we may look forward at no distant date to Victorian woollen yarns being exported from this country in lieu of wool in the raw state, thereby opening up here a new and vast field for employment, and enor mously enhancing the value of our export trade. Land settlement, again, by its rapid .extension, promises to give us, ere long, a large surplus of cereal produce for export, but culti vation cannot be profitably extended unless the farmers obtain an abundant supply of labor at- a price that will enable them 'to get a fair return for their operations; and with the exten sive public works that we are about to undertake, we may well be appre hensive that such labor will' not be available. Lastly, as regards manu factures, there is scarcely an important trade carried on in the country xipon a' large scale in which production is not getting rapidly in excess of demand, and our "manufacturers are therefore look-, ing anxiously about them for new out lets for the disposal of their merchan dise. : Now the question naturally arises, where are these to be found? i It' is true that we have markets to .some'extent in the other colonies, and' that as those colonies augment their < population by immigration, we shall in ' some slight degree feel the benefit. J But it is to be remembered that. in the neighboring colonies we have not only to meet a local manufacturing 1 competition,' but the still keener com petition also of imported British wares, ; so that trade wifcH our neighbors must for a long time be necessarily upon a limited and not very lucrative' scale. Now, it is not to be believed for a moment, if the United States during the last twenty-five years had not attracted to its shores the skilled* and unskilled labor of the old world, that it would occupy the high industrial status it does to-day. Instead of finding it sup plying breadstuffs to nearly the whole European world, and establishing a manufacturing rivalry with England in all the markets of Europe, it would, even at a hundred years old, be yet in the pastoral and agricultural stages of its history. It is quite true that America has not purchased her vast population by giving free passages across the Atlantic, but her geo graphical position has favored an almost nominal passage rate, and it lias been this, and the shortness of the passage, which have kept mov ing a living stream from Europe to America for the last twenty-five years. Since 1847 no fewer than five and a half millions of people have arrived and per manently settled in the States, or an average of about 185,000 per annum exclusivo of transient travellers. It is . estimated that four millions of these are German and Irish, and it is of some interest to learn from an American source the immediate value which this immi gration was to the States. A trade jour nal, published in Philadelphia,' writes " It is estimated that the German' emi " grants alone carry away from tlieir " native country 15,000.000 dols. an " nually, and in-proportion as other " lands are made poorer by this drain, " so is America made richer. Part of " this sum, however, is expended for " outward passage, and cannot bo con " sidered as added to the wealth of " their new country; but it is believed " that each immigrant possesses an average of 50 dols. on landing on our " shores, which wotild add 9,250,000 " dols. annuallyto the resources of our " country. Whatever these settlers " send back to tlieir relations in. the " old world is amply offset, by their " share in the development of the far " west, and its immense harvests, and " in their aid to our manufacturing in " dustries, in which their skill, acquired " from the more thorough apprentice " ships of Europe, is of great value." Now,"we quote this to demonstrate the common sense view that is taken of immigration in a protectionist country, under a democratic government, and where political power is quite as much controlled by the working classes as in Victoria. It is quite true that the United States government could' not have forbidden this five and a half mil lions of people to land on its shores, but it could, had its interests trended in that direction, have imposed a heavy poll-tax on immigrants, or have placed ships under such statute obligationsas se riously to restrict their passenger trade. But as we have shown, the interests of the country suggested rather the giving of every inducement to skilled and un skilled labor to abandon Europe for America until, to-day, some of the largest capitalist manufacturers of Great Britain are located in the States, which they have chosen ;ls a more pro 1 fitable field of operations ? than the old country. Let us apply the American illustration then to our own case. We have enough land wisely con served to attract the same class of capitalist favmers that New Zealand is beginning to draw to her shores; we have abundance of wool, to find employment for a hundred additional mills; and our fame as a manufacturing country is . already exciting attentiou in the great industrial centres of England, where neither capital nor labor are at present profitably em ployed. Now, in these circumstances, where would be the disastrous effect of a resumption of immigration ? Let the farmer, the builder, the butcher, the baker, the tailor, the bootmaker, and* a host of other producers and suppliers, answer this question by the measurement even of their own ex clusive interests. Would it be such an unqualified misfortune to introduce a few thousand people annually to these shores, bringing with them an average of fifty dollars, or about £10 per head. Let it be remembered that these people would want honsing, feeding, and clothing; that some would find their way to the agricultural districts to increase our supply of corn for ex portation ; that others would be ready with their skilled labor to induce capitalists to begin the manufacture of woollen yarns, carpet weaving, and various other new trades ; and that in a variety of ways a stimu lus would be given to the development of new industries/ Putting against this the possibly slight competition it would create in already established branches of labor, the gain to the working classes of the country by the creation of tiew fields of employment, the investment of new capital, and increased consumption of' products, would he something enormous. We have said nothing of the vast results to be looked for from the International Exhibition in connection with a revival of immigration to these shores, but we will discuss that very important phase of the question in another article. In the meantime we leave the question we have been dealing with to the serious consideration of the working classes. We may add that the question of immgration has ' nob, that we are aware, the most remote connection with ministerial intentions or policy. It is the people's question, and their's solely, and we simply ask them to give it that earnest consideration it deserves for its great importance to the country and to themselves.
