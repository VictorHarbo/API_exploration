Much amusement has been caused at the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, by the urgent petition of , two pretty blue-eyed Danish girls, Alfild Anderson and Ipgeborg Jansen, of Copenhagen, for permission to de part immediately for Wiona (Minne sota). -> i Tliey are the cheerful victims of an eccentric will made by their grand- father, who bequeathed them each a j half-share of 600 acres of fine farm lands, on condition that they marry within 30 days of their arrival in New York. By the terms of the will, which the two cousins explained to an .inter preter, title to the lands will not be finally vested with either of them until tliey become mothers. If at the end of five years one of cousins has a child and the other has not, the motherless one will lose half her land to the other. If neither has children at the end of five years the entire property is to revert to a male cousin in Denmark. Both girls departed for Minnesota, confidently declaring in broken English that they would find good husbands within the stipulated term. — "Daily Mail." ; I . |
