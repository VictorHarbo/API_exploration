"When you consult an ordinary doctor you have to tell him what is the matter witlr you, whereas Mr. Kugelmann possesses tlio powor to tell patients the causo of their disease or ailment without being informed by thorn. All his consultations (unless by appointment) are free, end aftof consultation the patient can either go on with the treatment or not qb ho pleases. Pationts living at a distance, or in England or foreign countries, can be cured by him without seeing them, by sending to him a full descrip tion of their Bymptoms, &c.;, to his Chief Office, 14-16 Queen street, Melbourne, Victoria. Numbers of such cases have been cured by him, sworn evidence of which ho will furnish to anyone requiring it. If preferred, a legal agreement is entered into for a lump Bum for each case.

Tho following extracts of SWORN CERTIFICATES are merely specimens of thousands of similar ones, and conclusively prove tho vast superiority of Mr. Kugolmann's system of HERBAL TREATMENT over that of doctors 8WORN BEFORE A JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT, DECEMBER 1899\. At thirteim years of ago I began to bo afflicted with Epileptio Fits, and was a grout sufferer for over 25 years 25 Years' Epileptic Fits Cured- When I had tho attaoks I used to froth at Many Doctors Failed. the mouth, and sometimes bite tho _ tongue, also lips. I tried numbers of doctors, and tried also medicine from London, but daring all those long weary 25 years I got no good from any of them. I paasod a most wretched and miscrablo existence, and was worn to a skeleton, when I heard of Mr. Kugolmann, and consulted him, on ono of bis visits to Murtoa. Ho at onoe told mo the cause of tho fits, and said he could euro mc. I there and then agreed and went under his treatment, and I have not had ono singlo Fit since, but have over Binco enjoyed the best of health. I hope this will bo well published. (Signed) (Mrs.) D. MoLEAN, Goyura, Victoria. NOTE. â The proof of the permanent nature of thin remarkable ouro is in tho fact that the Fits have not returned during the past 13 years. Doctors cannot ouro Epilepsy at all, and the Bromides and other Drugs and Poisons which they prescribe to try and prevent tho attaoks only ruin the system. (Signed) Hebkan Enit, Kuqki.mann. Mb. H. E. Kuseluans. Moyhu, Victoria, 22nd August, 1895. Dear Sir, â 1 wish to place on record my testimony to the wonderful oure by you of my distressingoaaoof Epilepsy or Fits. I wish to let Chronic Epileptic Fits Cured, everyono know about it, so that, sufferers from Doctors and Drugs Failed. that complaint may know where to go for effectivo treatment, as you completely cored mo ovor nine years ago. (Signed) WALTER ALFRED i'ORGE. Swown this 22nd day of August, 1895, at Wangaratta, before mc, (Signed) A. PINKERTON, J.P. Thomas J. Lamble, Esq., Ptozessor of Music, rosiding at Ivor, St. James's Pork, Haw thorn, Victoria, declared on oath, December 13, 1899 ; About seven years ago I found that my eyesight was gradually leaving 7 Years' Chronic Cataract me ; at last I could not read the large print of Eyes Cured ; Eyesight of the " Argus " in the leading articles.' Restored after Doctors I consulted an optician aud had glasses Had Failed; no Operation. made specially. In six or eight months my oyesight got so bad that the glasses were of 110 use. I consulted another optician, and he tested my sight and found that I had oataract in both eyes, and found that I would go totally blind first in one eye and then in tho other, and this was also tho verdict of a third optiofun. I then consulted several well known doctors for tho eyes, both skilled oculists. They confirmed tho opticians' opinions us to the cataract, aud said that nothing could bo done but to operate, and that if the operation was a success. I would regain my sight, but. if not, I would he blind for life. After this, Ihuardof Mr. Kuuclmaim. I consulted him, and ho tested my sight and examined the eyes, and he agreed as to the catarnot, but said he could effect a oure without, operating, and would do it by removing the cause which produced it, and said that he had found out what causes cataract to form, and explained to me fully, and in a most logical way, the cause and cure of tho whole trouble. I began his treatment, with tho result that not only have I regained my sight complotely nnd permanently, and can now read tho smallest print without glasses, but my general health improved wonderfully.
