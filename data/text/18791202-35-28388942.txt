""Gentlemen,-The seat of Alexander Stuart, Esq., shay-feteta declared vacant by reason of his acceptance or the office ol' Agent-General, I have the honour to offer myself as a Candidat* for vour suffrages. My opinions on the principal political questions of the tima have already heen expressed, and are generally well known. It ia* my intention to address you fully on these subjects hereafter, bul I consider it proper to recapitulate, as succinctly as possible, my. views on the more important of these matters. ' The question of water snpply for the principal centres of ipopih» lation. and more especially to the metropolis, as well as the pro« vision of a proper system of sewerage, are subject» which.Icon« eider of the highest social importance. I »m an advocate for the extension of railways throughout thr length and breadth of tbe land, as I believe that ultimately thii form of highway will supersede all others. I have always been f supporter of the extension of the railway to the Circular Quay, with one proviso, vis., that the already too limitedTeserves of tu city shall not be interfered with. I am opposed to the present system of immigration. While I believe that a constant stream of immigration is necessary for til« well-being of the country, I consider that proper-elaeses of bnmi grants should be selected, and that proper arrangements for theil distribution on arrival should be made. Having been intimately connected with the management of many of our leading charities, I shall be glad to have the oppor» -tunitv of employing my experience in making better arrangements . in tegard to the disposal of the largo grants now voted for their sdpport. In particular, I shall be glad to see the boarding-out and cottage-home systems tentatively introduced for the benefit of the children maintained by the State. While the Land Bill now before the House* of Parliament con- tains some excellent points, it can never be regarded as a settle* ment of the question. I believe-that no satisfactory solution al this most important question will occur till the country has been divided into agricultural and pastoral areas. In the»« latter longer and surer tenures, with higher and adjusted rentals, ought to be adopted. This system would prevent the rivalry ano other injurious effects originating under the present law. It would also put a stop to the alienation of large tract» of land (often unwillingly taken up) into the possession of a few persons. For the prevention of this growing evil-one fraught with danger to the future welfare of the country-sales by auction ought te cease till a new general land law is passed. The necessity for an amendment of the existing electoral law it admitted bv all. and I shall be glad to support such alterations at shall make representation more uniform and more equitable. The burning question of the hour-that of primary education will. I tru*t, be settled by the Legislative Assembly before youl seat is filled, by the passing of the Act introduced bv the present Government. Like the present Education Bill, this Act is a com- promise, but I believe it to be, in the main, a compromise whieb may well be accepted as suitable to the wants of the country at the present juncture. I need scarcely add that, should yon honour me by electing ra« to the vacant seat in your representation, my beat efforts shall be used for the benefit of the country. _ARTHUR BENAVICK. R.

Ä PRELIMINARY MEETING of the Friends and Supportera if Dr. ARTHUR KENWICK will be held at Mr. Hodge's Hotel, comer of Pitt and Harket street», THIS EVENING, at 8 o'clock, for the purpose of forming a Committee to make arrangements to secure the return of Dr. KENWICK for EAB1 SYDNEY.

The Hon. JOHN SUTHERLAND will take the chair at 8 o'clock. ANDREW ALLAN. Hon. Sec. mo THE ELECTORS OF EAST SYDNEY. Gentlemen,-Immediately upon the seat for this electorate being declared vacant I placed my services at your disposal. 1 did so in answer to inquiries on behalf of over 400 etectorsywho, in anticipation of the passing of the new Electoral Bill daring the past session, honouied me with a requisition to allow myself to b* nominated for the next vacancy for East Sydney ; and I ventors to ask your suffrages on the assurance that many hsadreds oj other voters, though declining to sign, expressed themselves al favourable to my election. My opinions respecting Railways, Immigration, and amend- ments of the Land and Electoral laws obtained, during my recení candidature for Windsor, the approval of the leading Journali and of large bodies of electors within and without that electorate aa evidenced by the present and other réquisitions. And ] observe that, in common with others, my opponent endorses inj long-since expressed opinion that no Land Bill can be accepted as final which does not próvido for a division of the country inU agricultural and pastoral arcas. Assured that the prosperity of a country depends largely upon facility of transit, I have always been un earnest advocate of rail, ways in this und sister colonies ; and while I may take credit te myself for having done much to defeat a monopoly of tramway* by an irresponsible body of shareholders, I have for over twenty years persistently advocated steam tramways in town« and subur- ban roads, and I trust to see them constructed and maintained by the State aa economical and profitable feeders of our railways. I do not, however, share with my opponent the opinion that the " burning question of the hour*'-the Education Bul-will ba settled before your seat is filled. Upon this; question, when, addressing the electors at Windsor, I said : " With regard to public Education,lam compelled to admit that instruction by the State in a country where no State religion is acknowledged must be secular. I am of opinion our Publio School Act makes ampio provision for religious instruction where the minister of any Church can make it convenient to avail him- self of its regulations. On the other hand the circumstances which surround this question demand a compromise, and in deference to the religious convictions of a large number of my felton colonists I should not therefore be disposed to interfere with Denominational schools, leaving them to that process of ex« haustion to which (as the educational statistics of this and our t.l»tcr colonies show) they will probably succumb. Subject te this compromise, being fully sensible of its necessity, I BhaU sup- port free and (as regards children resident within one mile of a Public school) compulsory education." I adhere to these sentiments, and I am not disposed to hasten, tile closing of Denominational schools, merely because the head of one Church has wrongfully and intemperately expressed him- self upon the question of our Public schools. I cannot for such . person ignore the religious convictions of thousands, and punish them for the immoderate denunciations of ono partirán. To de so would be to legislate in a spirit equally Intemperate and un- becoming of any one who aspires to the distinguished posilion of a legislator. I have the honour to be, gentlemen.
