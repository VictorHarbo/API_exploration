TOTAL LOBS OF THE DANISH BARQUE JUItGKN LOR12NT2EN. Wshave been favoured by Captain Limract, late commander of the llirondelle, with tho following parlioalurs respecting the loss of the abovenamod vessel, in whioh ho was a passenger from Ben Franoisco. 'jho Danish barque Jurgen Lorentzen, of 380 tone, only eighteen months old, was chartered by Mesirs. George A. Lloyd end Co. to proceed to Ban Francisco and relarn wilh a cargo of grain to bydnty. bhe left Sydney on the 18lh Ootober, and reaobed Ban Fraucieco on the £2nd Dcocmbcr, wbero rhc look on board & caigu of giain, und left on her return voyago on tiio fllh January. Bhe had luir winds and fine weather, and every pros pect of making a rapid paepuge, until J&nuarv; 25th, at 1 a.m., when she unfortunately ran aahoro on Christmas Island nnd became a total wuck. Captain Roirncr, her commander, hud gone hclow, leaving instructions with the chief officer to call him at midnight when tbe watch was changed; he tbeu told the chlcf-otiiccr to order the &ooond; officer to keep a good look out, At 1 a,m, he went on deck himself, and immediately htard the roar of the surf, and a few moments ufiorwards observed the break on a reel right ahead, lie ordered the helm to be put down, and when tho vessel was half way round, sup posing thut she would 6hoot ashore, be countermanded the order ttnd endeavoured to wear Bhlp, but when almost before tho wind, tho ship struck with such force that she became immovable. The boats were got out, a few provisions hastily thrown in, and about two hours after the vessel struck ; when she was full of wator, Captain lieimrr, with his wife and child, together with Captain Limmox und the crew, left her. They tried to keep in sight of the vessel till daylight, but the current drifted them away until 10 a.m., when they succeeded in effecting a landing on the west side of Chrislnihs Island, being the opposite from that where the ebip wob lost, and sixteen miles distant. A party of them walked over to the vckscl in the hope of getting some Water, but found this could not be accomplished from the land side. Tho next day they took one of the boats round, and boarded her from outside the reef, when they succeeded in gcttiug one ctrek of water. Tbe vessel had by that time broken in two. Finding neither food nor water on Christmas Island, they left it In two small boats at noon on the 27th January, wim the intention of making the Navigator Islands ; the company couBistcd of four teen souIb, including Sirs. Reimcr and her child, both of whom left the vessel in their nightdress, On calculating tho possibles length of postage— the distance being 1400 miles— it was found that there wae only sufficient food and water to allow of each in dividual having half of one of Wilkic's biscuits and a quarter of a pint of water per day of twenty-four hours, which was accord ingly served out. The boats met with nothing in the shape of a sail during the passage to the Navigators, and on one occasion, iii a heavy tea, one of the bouts capsized, and was with difficulty got afloat again. They reached tbe Navigator* in twemy-ono days, and were very bospitably'received by the British consul at Apia, J. C. Williams, Esq., and by the Hamburgh consul, Mr. A. tinpelm. They were extremely exhausted on landing, and could scarcely support themselves, but after a week or ten days they recovered strength, and became tolerably welL Captain Rcimer and Captain Limmcx havo lost all their pi ivatc property, but the vessel was insured in Ham burgh, and the cargo in the General Assurance Company here. Mrs. Rcimer, the captain's wire, bore her trials with amazing fortitude, but w as not able to walk ashore. Captain Liinmex has leturncd to Sydney by tbe Native Lass, whioh arrived yesterday, and Captain ltcimer, with bis wifo and child, are remaining at the Navigator's, with the intention of going on to Hamburgh in the CtDtar Goddefroy. The crew aro being cmployod about the Islands. Tun Dutch Cosvette Djambi,— The Dutch e. s. corvette Djambi came to her anchorage at sundown on the 26th, and im mediately bred a royal salute, which was returned from Port Macqu&rif;, She lb luet from Melbourne, where 6hc was the object of general interest, Bhe is built on n modern model, and measures 1400 tons. Her length is 276 feet, and differs considerably iu ap pearance from those vessels of war that have from time* to timo visited Pert Jackson, having considerable stem and a bold rise from the fore-rigging forward, partaking of the style of the American clipper ships. Bhe is very heavily rigged, but all aloft appears particularly neat. The deck is flush, showing a broadside of eight guns ; bcr armament consisting of thirty pounder nuooih bores, and sixty-pounders, rifled. ' The captain's cabins are situated between decks, right aft ; next to them are tbe officers' quarters and tbe midshipmen's room. Right forward the men are berthed, being separated from the officers' portion of the vessel by the machinery compartment. The accommodation below is commodious, and in some iastanccs the Ltiings aro elegant, but nowhere does comfort appear to have been sacrificed to ornament. Indeed, while everything about the vessel seems substantial and ' ship-shape,' there is very little display to be noticed. The sailors are a tine body of men, and although differing in many particulars from the British manof war's men, tbey still show most of the hearty and popular charac teristics of the tar. A company of marines, thirty in cumber, are on board, and mount guard the sameas in vessels of her Majesty's navy. The marines are dressed in white ducks, tight fitting coats, and glazed hats. Altogether, there are 228 men on board the corvette. The officers are most urbane in manners, many of them converse familiarly in English, and, judging from present experience, both they and their vessel are sure to obtain a good name in the port. The Djambi, ns has been 6aid, is of recent construction. She was bailt at Amsterdam some eighteen months ago ; and her engines, which are of 25i'-horee power, were constructed at the Nether lands Government works, at Rotterdam. The corvette is stated to be one of the fastest vessels in tbe Netherlands service. Under eteam, she can attain a 6pced of ten knots per hour, and her sailing qualities arc equally good. On her voyage out, che ran from the English Channel to Rio Janeiro in twenty-eight days, and from Rio to King George's Sound in forty-two days The ultimate destination of tbe vessel is Batavia. The following is a list of the appointments and names of the officers on board Commander, P. A. Van Rees ; first lieutenant, T. S. O. Von Schmidt ; second lieutenant, P. T. Rosenwald ; third lieu tenant, P. T. Van Drenjnen; fourth lieutenant, T. L. Dakar; surgeon, T. F. Kluge; adjutant, H. D. Brceader? purser, T. C. Coops ; midshipmen, Messrs. W. Blaauw, H. J. Haodalee, C. A. Woldringh, R. 11. Weide, C. J. D. Yong, W. Hudig, W. C. Bothtingk, and T. Zeegers Hcckens ; assistant paymaster, Mr. J. GallaB.' The Mtdway.— Mr. Cutbbert having been instructed by the underwriters to raise the abovenamed vessel, commenced opera tions on tbe 22nd instant, so as to have all prepared for Saturday evening's tide. The scuttle-bole was properly secured by Mr. M'Nab, the diver, together with the hawser and scupper holes, and every precaution taken to exclude the water by building up the combings of tbe hatchways. Nine powerful pumps were rigged, and some two hundred men in readiness to work tbem. At 5 p.m., on Saturday, the pumps were set in motion, and so successfully that within two hours the vessel bad been freed of water below the deck. At this stage of the pro ceedings, and when all seemed secure, she gradually took a list s-port, which increased to such a degree that sho at last heeled over, until the water again flowed into her over the hatchways, and the fcbjp settled down to her original position ; work was necessarily again stopped until yesterday afternoon, when the pumps were again set in motion, and tbe water a second time gained on. Suddenly tbe water com menced to iucreaee, when it wbb discovered that a portion of the stern lockers had given way, and that the water was flowing in. This was slopped, and a third time an attempt was made to pump her out, and was partially successfu 1, when some other portion of tbe hull ravst have given way, as she again settled down ; it is therefore evident that *be' fire must have done some serious injury teyond what was anticipated, but Mr. Cuthbert is confi dent that witbin a few hours she will be again afloat. Every precaution that bnman foresight could conceive was adopted to make all secure, nor was any lack of assistance withheld. Cap tain Jenkins furnished gangs of men from H.M.S. Miranda, Captain Munro sent a number of the A. 8. N. Co, 'a workmen, who, in addition to the shipwrights employed on Mr. Cuthbert's e6iabliehtn-nte, furnished on ample force to keep all the pumps going; but it is evident that some considerable portion of the hull must bavc given way, or the 6bip would now be safely afloat. Tbe work of floating tho Mcdway has been a matter of no email difficulty, many annoying delays baviag occurred from leaks breaking out at' the very moment that all seemed secure. The pumps were ect in motion at aboat eight o'clock on the morning of 2Gth, and by nine o'clock she was afloat. To prevent the possibility of her again heeling over, bulks were placed on cither side, and the vessel firmly secured to them, and by this means 6he was kept upright. Mr. Cuthbert is anxious to express his thanks to Mr. M'Nab, the diver, for his indefatigable zeal and attention, in carrying out the work entrusted to him. The securing the ecuttle-holo was a matter of no small difficulty, but the planking was as well put on, although so far under water, as though the ship had been afloat. The gangs of men employed on her were also untiring in their exertions, working night and day with unflagging spirit. It is doubtful from the appearance of the hold whether any of the sugar will be saved. The Mohawk left Liverpool on the 3rd February, crossed the Equator on 12th March, and passed the meridian of the Cape on tbe 18ih April ; she ran down her easting in latitude 43 S,, carrying N.W. and 6.W. winds, blowing strong, and passed Cape Otway on the 17th instant. In running down her casting sac encountered a heavy southerly gale, in which she stove long boat, gig, and lost pari of her bulwarks The Fiats at Shoalhaveh.— Captain Langlcy, of the schooner Centurion, states that he crossed the Fiats at fihoalhavcn, draw ing 6 feet 6 inches over a distance of 700 yards, where formerly there was only 4 feet 6 inches to 5 iect water. This, he says, is owing to Mr. Fr&ser;, the engineer of the dredge, who has suc ceeded in making a decided improvement to.the river ; and, if allowed to continue with the work, in a short time vessels of large tonnage can go np to the wharf at Tcrrara without lightering . The Centurion is the largest vessel up to the present time that ever went up the river, and will probably be the means of in ducing others of a similar class to follow her example. The Diamantina (s.) crossed the Manning River bar at 0.15 p.m. on the 22nd, and arrived hero the following day, at 6 a.m. ; she had light westerly winds and fine weather throughout the passage, fihe brings the following passengers— Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, Rev. Mr. Cockl&n;, Mrs. Allan, Mrs. Jelly, Mrs. Williams, Master Allen, and 6 in the steerage. Cargo— 1423 bags maize, 18 bags oysters, 6 coops fowls, 33 pigs, 17 cases eggs. Tbe Agnes Irving left Grafton on Friday, the 32nd, at 3.29 a.m. ; crossed tbe bar same day at 9.15 &.m.f and entered Sydney Heads on 8&turday.; 23rd, at 0.45 p.m. Experienced light variable winds with fine weather daring passage. Her cargo consists of 1709 bags maize, 86 casks tallow, 24 bales wool, 85 boxe6 soap, 139 hides, 5 coops poultry, 6 boxes eggs, 1 horse, 280 ounces gold, and 6undricfl, The steamer Eagle was passed on Friday, at 10 a.m., off tho Clarence Peak; also the Rainbow and schooner Perseverance, seventeen miles south of Clarence Heads. The Rainbow (fl.), from Clarence River, crossed the bar on the 25th, at C p.m., ana arrived here at 6 80 a.m. 28th inetant. She had 6. VI , and westerly winds the whole of tho passage. Passed the Agnes Irving (s.), on Tuesday, at 1 p.m. off Smoky Capo. The Rainbow (b7), brings up 46 balCB wool, 509 bags maize. The Briton's Queen, from Hobart Town, 23rd instant, hod fresh northerly breezes during the first two days, and strong 6.W, to westerly weather the remainder of the passage. The Star of Australia (».), from Brisbane, 23rd instant, experienced fresh westerly winds the greater part of the passage. She put into Newcastle on Tuesday to coal, and left the following day. The Lord Mac&ulay; arrived off tbe Heads on tbe evening of 28th, bat was onablo to get in, the wind falling calm. Bhe left tbe Downs on the 2nd February, and was detained in the English Channel fourteen days by strong gales, and passed through Bass' Straits on the 18th instant In latitude 3T2 S., longitude 29*3 IV, spoke the Queen of the Mersey, from Now Zealand to London, fifty-six days out, uud on the 21st instant spoke the Sir J. Moore, from this port to Ot&go.; Tho Rangatira (s.) left Melbourne Heads at 5 p.m. on Mon day, 25th instant, rounded. Wileon'B Promontory 2.15 a.m. the following day, and Capo Howe at 5.90 p.m. same day, and arrived at this pott on the 27tb, at 2.80 p.m., after a splendid run of 49 hours from wharf to wharf.

Yesterday, being the day appointed to celebrate the marriage of bis Royal Highness the Prince of Wales with the Princess Alex andra of Denmark, the fine fleet of merchant ships riding at anchor in the hay, as well as those berthed alongside tho several piers, seemed to vie with each other to do honour to the occasion. At an early hour they dressed their vessels with their national flag6, while from truck to water-line floated in gay colours the several codes of signals. It was s melancholy sight to observe the noble ships Anglesey and Roxburgh Castle, in their deep mourn ing, debarred, by the recent death of Mr. Richard Green, from joining in the general festivity. The White Star ship Blue Jacket dressed sbip at eight o'clock, and at noon fired a royal salute. At eight p.m. the Red Jacket fired a royal salute and illuminated snip, while a salvo of rockets and blue lights was fired. Altogether, considering the inclemency of the weather, the bay presented a holiday appearance very effective ana pleasing. The royal salute which was fired at noon yesterday by H.M.C.8.

(From the Times , March 2. ) One ef those events which gain for ihemaclves by their acknow ledged importance and success a di&ticct; and prominent, posLtion in ibe history of the subject to which they belong took place, on the Thames, on Saturday, is the trial of the double screw steam rbip Kate. In November last, the Flora, a vessel of 400 tons, was launched l-y the same firm that has constructed the Kate— Messrs. Dudgeon, Brothers, of Limchou6c,— and was the first instance of the double screw being successfully applied to a vessel of any size, each screw being worked by independent engines. So much im portance was attached to the disposition of the propelling power of the Flora by tbe Admiralty, that Mr. John Dinnen, the inspect ing officer to the Board in the steam department, was appointed specially to watch and report upon the ship's progress and outfit, and to attend the trial trip of the vessel, and draw up a report of the results for tho information of their lordships. Tho trial proved to be & great success, for by the working of the two screws on each side of the dead wood a perfect steering power was obtained with the ship going either ahead or astern without any assistance from or use of tbe rudder, and by reversing the screws- that is, working them in opposite directions— the Flora turned round upon her centre as upon a pivot, after the manner of a turntable. She was also very fast under eteam, with engines of little more than one-fourth horse power per tonnage, great capacity of hold, and light draught of water. It will at once be seen that here arc properties the want of which constitutes the chief defects of our war ships under eteam. The Warrior and Black Piince each requires from eight to twelve minutes to com plete a circle when under full eteam, and would therefore be unable to perform such on evolution in narrow waters, so that they aro noth to a great extent useless for inshore work, in the mouth of an enemy's river or at the entrance to & port ; while a vessel of moderate draught of water, carrying a heavy arma ment, with large engine power and a power of turning upon bcr centre, would always be ready for any service inshore or ont at sea, while more stately but unweildy vessels with their single screw could but look on and admire, but could never hope to emulate, the performance of their more agile sister. In addition to the advantages which the double screw offers to ships of war, tbcrc arc others of on almost equally important character which a ship would possess fitted on the principle. No apertures arc needed as 'screw wells' in the stern, which would therefore resume its normal strength. There would be no outer stern posts to knock away, and thus depriving the ship at one blow ef tbe services of both rudder aud screw, and even if one screw should be disabled in action— a contingency not very likely to ensue from their peculiar position,— one would still remain to propel the ehip, and if the rodder itself wae carried away, tbe chip's steering poweriwould remain perfect in her screws. In fact, the whole question has 6uch an important bearing, look at it in whatever light we may, whether as e power of steering ships of commcroc under steam when threading tortuous rivers, or ships of war when engaged with tbe enemy's ships or forts, that tbe great interest which has been displayed by tho Admiralty and many naval and scientific men in tue trials of tbe two vessels, the Flora In November last, and the Kate on Saturday, is fully accounted for. The Kate is an iron vessel of 600 tons' capacity of hold, and 80 tons' capacity of coal bunkers. She is 165 feet in length between perpendiculars, 32 feet 6 inches in breadth, and 18 feet 6 inches depth of hold. Jlot estimated displacement is 500 tons, On Saturday she drew 7 feet 2 inches aft aud 5 feci 4 iuches forward, with an area of midship section in square feet, at her present draught of water, of 135 feeu 6bc is perfectly flat in her floor at the midship section and without kecL On deck she is fitted with a hurricane-house, three-fourths of the deck's length, affording amplo cabin passenger accommodation. 6ho carries two masts, lightly rigged, for foro and aft sails, each mast of wood, and fit ting in an iion socket just above tbe level of the burric&ao-housc; and with parting joints. The funnel is also telescopic, so that the masts and funnel could be lowered on deck, and the Kate, if a war vessel, could He In under tbo land almost invisible in wait ing for her prey. 6hc is filled with two engines with 26in* cylinders and a 21in. stroke, supplied with steam by two tubular boilers at 201b. pressure, a blast pipe leading from tho boilers to tho funnel Euch engine works independently of the other and drives a thrce-bladcd screw of 7ft. 6ia. diameter, and lift. 6in pitcb, the centres of the two shafts being 9ft, 6in. apart. The Kate weighed her anchor off Grovesend at noon on Satur day, and come alongside Tilbury- picr, to take in the officials and visitors for the trip, lying alongside tho pier with her bead up the river. UpwardB of sixty gcBtiemcn arrived by train from town, and went down the river In the ship, to witness hcrcapa bllitlcs. Mr. John Dlnncn, inspecting officer to the Admiralty, attended by order of tho Controller of the Navy, to conduct the day's experiments aud report officially upon them. Among the visitors present were Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Belcher, C B., Rear-Admiral Horatio T. Austin, C.B«. Captain Marin H. Jansen, of the Dutch Royal Navy, and attached to the Ministry of Marine at Amsterdam. Caplaina Jasper Sclwyn and Howes, R.N., and Commundcr Symonds, R.N., Mr. Kinncar, C.K., superintendent of machinery to tbe Anglo-Chinese squadron, and a number of other officers and gentlemen whose names aro well known in their profession and in the scientific world. At a quarter-past twelve the Kate started on her trip, in charge of Mr. Lee, Trinity pilot, ond in leaving the pier strikingly demonstrated ber power of turning by bringing tar head round at once down tbe river in less than her own length from the pier, while at the same time another screw steamer off in tho stream was taking up tho entire width of the rivdr iu attempts to get hsr head down, and bad not accomplished the feat until the Kato was a good mile on her way* A light easterly brocso prevailed, with a good deal of fog hanging about the river, which rendered it for some considerable time doubtful whether the intended experi D'tnts could be carried out. A* the* ship reared tbe Nons light vessel, however, the sun came out brighter, aud partially -dls- pmcrt the fog, to as to admit of the experiments, ro far as related (o lotlllarv purposes, being carried out in their uitiirly. The speed trial wns, however, without any certain value, lor the reason that no giveo mark could be seen to steer upon in the run to and from (he Moufce nnd the Norr Lights, mid the ship's course Icing thoufiuv moic terpentine limn otherwise. The run back from l he Montr to the Noic. which was tho fuirrst run or tho two, occupud 35mmi-tcs. 1 he Kale i* 10l- tons larger than the Flora, but, although f-bc has only the same engine power as the latter, (here ie no doubt that 6bc is nearly, if not Quite, ber equal in speed. The chief intuvcht, however, lay in liiu capabilities of the sbip in manwuvrJiig and rapidly shifting her position under t-tcatn, nnd tbe experiments under Ibis head were curried out in tbo following otui r, the vessel being placed in a position for the purjKiec dear of tbe Mouse Light vessel : 1\. Both engines going ahead at full speed, three circles {were first made to port, the mean time of the ship cutnpleliog each circle bring 3 minutes 46 seconds, and the first half of tbe first circle Ik lug completed iu 2 minutes 49 seconds. The diameter of tbe circle was about three times the ship's length. 2\. With tbe starboard engines going ahead and the port engine stoppid, the itducr was put over hard to starboard, and one circle completed in 3 minutes 57 seconds, and tbe second lu 4 tx.inuUH, the diameter of the circle* being twice tbe ship's length* 3\. With one engine going ahead, and the other astern at full speed, tbo tuddcr'was put over to starboard and two circles thus Ci'xnpbtr.d— one in 8 minutes 44 seconds, and the other ia 3 rninutrs 55 seconds. In this experiment tbe ship revolved upon brr own crime as the Flora did in November last ; and, if she had been a sbip of war attacking en enemy's ship or tort, could have illechargi'd the guns on each broad^de as tbey oamc to hear in turn upon the object. V'bilo tbo shfp was thus revolving, a pitcc oi wood thrown overboard remained alongside the ship uns il the conclusion of tbe experiment, 4 Willi the rudder fixed amidships, the foregoing experiment, wilL the screws working opposite ways, was repeated, the first curie being made in 7 minutes and 20 seconds, and tbe second in 6 minute* 40 seconds. The diameter of the circle was lire same us the lust, tbe sbip revolving in a precisely similar manner. b. With tbe i udder over to port, and the screws still working opposite ways, ibe ship turned round In 4 minutes 17 second*, lu all other respects this experiment was precisely similar in its mnlis to the last two. C. Tbevuddi r was now fixed amldsblpE and both screws set going astern, tbe object being to asceitdin whether the ship could be slotted 6it-rn first on any given object by the action of the screws aloue* This was, perhaps the most Important experiment of the day, for, as it had already txtn proved that tbe Kate possessed every requisite power of steeling in her two screws when going ahead, should *hc only be found to possess the stime power when going astern there could be no possible position which a double screw ship might not take up or extricate hertclf from at her pleasure. The result in this instance was quite aa satisfactory as in the former experiment*, and the sbip was steered wilh tbe greatest ruse and facility to the pilot's order by merely increasing or dimi nishing tbe revolutions of the screws as required. It vas now drawing towards five o'clock, aud the vessel being thirty miles below Tilbury, the experiments were brought to s coDcIiuion and tbe ship's head laid homewards. The Kate arrived alongside Tilbury Tier at the conclusion of bcr day's work, about duek, and the company on board returned to town by train, delighted with their trip aad tbo successful result of the day's proceedings. Tbo machinery worked perfectly throughout, without hot bearings or other unpleasant accidcuts, which so frequently hap pen when first setting new engines to work* The mean of the revolutions of the engines was 121; pressure of steam, 2hlb, ; vacuum, 25. ? ? ' ? Moat Tbkabubb pbou tux Wreck op the Golobk Gate.— The steamship Golden Age, which arrived on B&tarday; evening, brought up from the ebip Golden Gate wrecking party, Ave boxes of treasure, which were said to contain about 80,000 dollar*, This treasure was consigned to the firm of Parrott and Co., iu whore specie vaults it has been placed on Bpeclal deposit. From members of ibe wrecking party who came upon Golden Age as passengers, we learn that there was a very large amount of re covered treasure still on board the schooner William Irelan, which had been recovered piecemeal from the wreck, and would coma up with the wiecking party. The total amount recovered from the wreck of tbe Golden Gato by the William Irelan party is said to be over 700,000 dollars. On the voyage up tho rctumiug wreckers were quite communicative. Bince their arrival they and the agcntB of the wrecking party have, strange to say, become equally reticent.^ -'Bulletin, February 25. Banes in thk 1'acii'IC. — The Journal de Reuife give6 the following important intelligence Three new banks have been discovered in tbe Pacific Ocean. The first is situated at 21- 52*15 latitude S., and 178*48 longitude -V.t Paris meridian. The lead sounds here six fathoms. The second lies at 21*43 S. and 173*12*10 E., Paris. They are situated iu the Ponga or Friend ship Archipelago, and were first noticed by H.B M. sloop-of war Polanus, Commodore Leymour, The third bank lies at 22*44*5 S. and 179 31*10 W., raria.
