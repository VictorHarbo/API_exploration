Of the 15-0 persons bitten :il died, a gross fatality rate equivalent to 10.:! per cent. The highest fatality was after death adder bites, 50 per cent. (10 cases, five deaths), but this was closely ap proached by the fatality after tiger snake bites, 45.4 per cent. (:W cases, 15 deaths. Brown snakes wrought death to 18.7 pel cent, of the persons bitten (:!2 cases, six deaths). Bites by snakes whose species are not mentioned gave a fatality of 17.8 per cent. (28 cases, five deaths). Fin ally, bites by black snakes were un attended by fatality, notwithstanding that of the 190 cases considered 87 came under this heading.' The latter statement will cause consider able surprise in these districts, where the black: snake lias for long been popularly supposed to rank next to the death-adder aud tigor snake in point' of deadliness. * * * ' * * A batch of five men, who will bo in charge of Mr. M'Donahl Stuart, supervising engineer, arrived at West Maitland on Tuesday week to assist in the survey of the routo o: the pro posed North Coast railway.
