In the course of an interesting interview, lie gave some in formation concerning the gasoline en gine which is manufactured by the company, and turned out at the rate of about 90. per day. and forwarded to all parts of the civilised world. 4.11 the engines are carefully tested before they leave the factory, and for this work alone anything from 1000 to 1500 gallons pf oil is used daily. .

'How do the crops compare with other places that you have visited? — Well, 1 guess I have no Jiiesitation in saying that Australia is the 'daddy of tlii© lot' , for growing crops. The qual ity of, wheat and corn is excellent, and could not be surpassed anywhere. ^ As. far as preparing the land is con cerned; are tlie conditions different ? YeS.; in Australia the farmer has to thoroughly phosphate the land, while in America the ordinary farmyard ma nure is sufficient. ' What class of immigrant outside the An^o-Saxon would you consider desu; able : for Aiistralia? ? I have seen a 'good many different cla'ises in my- irjayels, but I don't think tbe Norwegian, German, and Danish settlers can ; bp' bfeaten - -by much. They iare haid' workers, and generally carry' out their work in a systematic mari ner. V. £he Southern Europeans are not suitable.,' * . What inducements are . held out to settlers -in the States? v Well, in that respect the States are a! trifle ahead of. the (Australians. A settler in the former country can take uk 160 acres' aaid the same amount for his wife, and two children. All they pay is a few dollars io the Land Office, and at the end of three years the title is -handed over. Of course they base to improve it? Most decidedly, but as long as a man lives on the property three months out of. every year lie is alright; but that is the only condition they are bouud to. I have known' cases o;f young men taking up land, working on it for three months, -and then going hack to their usual calling in the cities. What is your opinion of the Aus tralian people generally? Well, I can't say enough in praise of jyH them. They make a stranger feel at r home, and a spirit of good fellowship seems .to exist right through. I 'will be very sorry to leave, but hope at some future date to pay another visit. Mr Macartney procee'ded tp Hobart last night, and returns here on Tues- ! day. when he joins the llotomahana for Melbourne. tie has been in the Com monwealth since. January List, and ex pects to return to the United States about October.
