JAMES SIMMONDS has groat pleasure . in an nouncing to the public that ho has EFFECTED in ENGAGEMENT for THIRTEEN PERFORMANCES, (Under Distinguished Patronage), ' With MR GEORGE COPPIN, SVI10 will appear- in a round of his celebrated cha racters that have been so long and favorably asso siated with THE DRAMA OF AUSTRALIA. FIRST APPEARANCE, SATURDAY, I9th SEPTEMBER. At tho expiration of Mr Coppin's Engagement, the Theatre will bo closed for one week, to prepare Eor THE GRAND DRAMATIC FESTIVAL Of MR and MRS CHARLES KEAN. EXTRACT FFOII TI1E LONDON TIMES. MR AND MRS' KEAN AT THE PRINCESS'S. The brief fortnight is over, and Mr and Mrs C. Kenn havo terminated their farewell engagement at ilio Princess's, not to re-appear in London till they liave returned from tho Australian colonies. In the short time of their sojourn among us, how much has been done ! ' Humlet,' ' Othello,' ' Tho Mer jhant of Venice,' which aro three of the principal plays bequeathed to ns by Sliakspeare ; tho portion Df ' Henry the Eighth ' in which tho genius of our jreot tragedian is most prominently shown ; ' Louis SI,' naturalised upon our stage by Mr Kean's excel lent acting : and Coleman's pleasant comedy of ' The lealous Wife,' reprcsentedwith such exuberant humor Jiat it is almost impossible to identify poor Mr Oakley md his tyi'annical spouse with tho Danish prince ind his conscience-stricken mother. These pieces, ivo say, represent no small amount of mental or physical labor to bo performed within eleven days. Every ono of tho principal characters severally put forward on the list belongs to tho highest depart nent of art. Mr and Mrs Kean have left us amid icclamations nnd hearty rashes of success in a new ind untried l'egion, fairly earned by many years' ;oil endured in the best of causes, tho maintenance -f tho national drama ; and their admirable p er- 'ormanco during the last engagement at tho Princess's, newly impressing so many vivid images -n our minds, renders us more painfully awaro of he magnitude of our loss.
