The Hotspur is one of the finest vessels that have arrived in this port for eome months, and is consigned to Messrsi, George A. Lloyd and Co. Collision at Bba.— At 4.80 ajn. on the28rd« a collision took place off Port Stephens, with the Black Diamond eohoonerand Yarra Yarra steamer, by whioh tbe schooner's Jlbboom was car ried away. Considerable damage was also dene to the steamer's port quarter, and smashing in ths tide of her quarter-boat. ~ Oar eld friend Captain Lawson arrived on the 24th, still in com mand of the favourite ship Oliver Cromwell. Her passage, how ever, was considerably retarded at the oommenoement, she having encountered very severe westerly gales in the Channel. She left the Isle of Wight on the 20th, and was off the Lizard on the 24th November ; the equator was orossed on tne 28rd Deoember, and the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope passed on 17th January ; from thence she bad a good run to Cape Otway, whioh waa reaehed on the 18th instant. No vessels hare been spoken. Tan Tiau and Tbuth.— 1 This vessel, which igaded at New castle for Adelaide, had a narrow esoape from lightning on the 81st ultimo, when tbe barque was off Cape Hows, in latitude 88*47 south, longitude Ii6'4l'l6 easu The following particulars axs from the South Australian Advertiser of the Uth instant :— The weather previous to the ship being struck had been very threatening, end suddenly peals of thunder, aooompanied by vivid flashes of eleotrio fluid, passed over the snip, with but little wind, which blew in paffs. The captain was at this time reclin ing against the fore part of tke mizen-masL and the chief officer was sitting on the topgallant forecastle rail, when a flash of lightning struck the maln-royal-mast, descending to the deck, carrying away large splinters from the main topgallant mast and tbe royal mast, completely burning a block. On reaobing the topgallant lift, it appears to have run down the chain, striking the pump-break, and then flying off in various directions struck all hands on deck. Captain Slater and the fh*'* officer reoeived severe blows, the former on hie breast as though struck by a large body of water. Tne crew (those on watch) experienced the same elngular result. Tbe eheeve ofthe royal clewline-block, on being overhauled after the ooourrenos. wasfenna partially roasted, owing to tbe eheeve being well greased, producinga smell like cooked meat. The electric fluid left behind it a strong sulphurous smelL The Amelia Breillat, from Adelaide, was compelled to anchor under Kangaroo Island for five days during a heavy southeast gale ; the Rebecca, barque, was in company. The Miami left Adelaide on the 7th instant, and encountered euoh heavy weather from the south-east that she had to run back. Tbe Dan, from Port Cooper, reports tne arrival, on the 2nd instant, of the Windhover, from this port ; she made the passage south aobut. The Rita, from Taranaki, having left the same dav as the mall steamer, brings no later intelligence from the seat of war. The Yarra Yarra (e.), left Cape Moreton on tbe 21st, at 10*80 a.m., and arrived here at 1 p.m., on Saturday, having bad light variable winds with close sultry weather throughout tho passage. The Bonnie Donn arrived at Brisbane on the 18th instant. The Jeanie Dove and Duxe of Wellington, bound in, wero orosslng the bar on the 21eu Passed the Waratah (s.), on Friday, at 3 a.m., off the Clarence, and the Telegraph (a.), at 11 o'olook, off the Macleay. Tbe American whaling barque Draco and Ellsha, Dunbar, were at King George's Sound, on 8th February, both short of pro vialona. Tax 8omoka.— It will be in tbe reeolleotion of our readers that shortly after the departure of this vessel for Calcutta, on the 2Gth September, psrt of her figurehead, with the name attaohed, waa picked up at Base's Straits, and at the time it was con jectured some serious seddent had befallen her, but by the last India mall we find she arrived at Calcutta on the 17th December, after a rather long passage of 82 days. The ship Colonsay, of Glasgow, whioh was on a return voyage from Sydney, after having rounded Cape Horn, struck a sunken reef near the Falkland Islands, at two o'clock in the morning of tbe 16th of August last. The long- boat was smashed, but, by means of tbe jolly-boat the crew escsped, and at daylight saw land two miles ahead, whioh they reaohed. It proved to be Speeawell Island, where the crew remained eleven days, with suoh food as they could catch. When the weather grew oalmer, the captain ana a few of tbe crew (whioh consisted of twenty-one men) set eut In the small-boat, aad, at a distance of fifty iniles, met a sail* log schooner, by means of which the remainder of the orew were oonveyed to the Falkland Islands.— Illustrated London News, Deoember 22nd.— [A vessel named the Colonsay left Sydney on 14th February, for Guam, under the command or Captain M'Alister.l Scbew Collikbs,— A step in the right direotion towards de veloping tbe coal trade of New South Wales, has lately been taken by tne owners of the S.6. Corio, Messrs. Manning and 8on. This vessel has just been lengthened at the Messrs. Nsplsr's establish ment, and sBpplied with every appli&noe; for the rapid discharge of her coals, ny steam wlnoh, &o.;, several large hatchways being left in her decks to obviate the necessity ol trimming her cargo. 6he has bean chartered for twelvemonths by Mr. Thomaa Hale, for ths P«U«mbl trade, and made her flrat trip there on Wednes day, when she took in 200 tons of ooal, and returned to Sydney in thirty hours from tbe time of her leaving the Heads. Bhe la now discharging into the Light ol tbe Age, for Bombay. The Wonga Wonga arrived atthe Railway Pier, Melbourne, shortly after 11 o'clock on Monday night. Ths P. end O. Company's s s Northern will bring the January mail from Point de Gaile to this port next month, I The City ef Sydney (a.) left Port Phillip Heads at '8 oa Monday, and Eden at V a.m. oa Wednesday, arriving here at 6*80 aA«oa Thursday morning. She had fresh-JE.and N.E, winds to th« Bay, aad light variable breexes to Sydney. Passed the Wonga Wonga (a. f, at 7.46 p.m. on Monday, off Cape Schank. Borsrtm, raox LoimoK.^Thls vessel has been released from quarantine, and oame up to the Coveon Thursday afternoon. Her passengers will be passed by the Immigration Board, and released from tbe ship at noon, on Monday. Not the leaat interesting feature In her passage cut was the fact of her being three times In company with the Granite City, vie., on the 3rd Deoembar, off tbe Start Point ; again cm the 26th Deoember, in latitude 6'8 N., and longitude 21*0 W. ; and, lastly, on 22nd and 23rd January, In 42 44 S„ 18*6 E. ' Tbe Mephlsta left Sas Franolsco on the 2Gth Deoember, and has therefore oeen sixty dsys oa the passage. She reports ths Druid as sailing for Melbourne on the same day, to be followtf by the Achillea about tbe 4th January, and we are Indebted to Captain Anderson for San Franoisoo papers to the 26th Deoember. Tbe Loohinvar left Newcastle on tbs 23rd, bound for Mel bourne. and had reaohed about forty miles south of those Tffflf when she lost her main topmast, and split several of her sails during a tuddefi shift of wind, and it waa alao discovered that ahe had sprung a leak. Captain Barrett was therefore oompelledto bear up to repair damages, Tbe Picard is originally from Bourben, but oalled at Adolalde, wbenoe she sailed on tbe 7th Instant ; but, encountering heavy southerly gales and strong currents, Csptatn Sslller deemed it sdvlsabls to come south of Van Dlemen*s Land, whers she had a continuance of light winds and calms, The Jupiter, from Hongkong, will proceed to Melbourne after discharging that portion of her cargo Intended for this port ; she brings 159 Chinese, having lost one from consumption when off Cape Lewin. The Granite City left Graveaend on the let and the Start Point on tbe 3rd Deoember, and passed the equator on the SOth same month. On tbe 17th Jsnuary she passed the meridian of Green wich, In latitude 41* 8», and the Cape 0! Good Hope on the 22nd ; and from thence she made the tun to the south of Tasmania in twenty-seven days. No vessels oonneoted with the colony have been sighted. The Hunter (e.), from Merlmbula, briogs up 112 bales wool, 400 cheeses, 4 tons bacon, 80 boxes apples. 8he passed the Wonga Wonga (s,), eighteen miles north 01 Merlmbula, at 11*20 a.m.onSunday. i Tub Phantom, Stzamir.— ' This swift and' smart craft hart \- returned her trips to Manly Beach, having been for the laat week in the Dry Dock, where she has undergone a thorough overhaul of hull and mhobinery, and passed theuBual half-yearly exami nation prescribed by the regulations of - the Steam Board. From her being permanently fixed in this trade, as Well as from the regularity of her uips, tbis vessel has become quite a necessity to the travellers between Manly and Bydney. The Frenoh war steamer Coutlagon has returned to her mow ings In Farm Cove, after receiving a thorough overhaul in the Government Dry Deck. We have been favoured by Captain Copeland, of the Josephine, with Melbourne papers to tbe 20th Instant. We learn by letters received by the Jupiter from Hongkong, that tbat veasel had considerable du&oulty; in getting passengers, and very few may be expected this year. Tbe Raven, from Port Cooper, reports the arrival of tbe Blue Jacket from Auckland, on the 13th inatant* An American whaler, apparently bound for this port, was sighted three dsys age. The steam crano was again tried yesterday, and the result was satisfactory. Six waggons were lifted and ohipped in the Maolos Seld, schooner, in about an hour ; but it Is expected when all tbe gear, ftc., ts In good working order 'that muoh greater results will be obtained. Mr. M'Arthur superintended the trial, and 'several gentlemen watched tbe results with muoh interest.— New- castle Correspondent, 26th ultimo. Tbe Lady venison, from Launoeston the 22nd Instant, has bad light winds and fine weather throughout the passage. The clipper ehip Star of Peace completed her loading on tne 27th, and wilt leave fbr London on tho 2nd Instant, after one of the most remarkable Instances of despatch that has been wit nessed in this port. The vessel arrived here after an extraordinary rnn of seventy*nlne days, discharged 2176 tons of cargo, and has taken on board 3200 bales of wool, besides bides aad other cargo. In thirty working days, and wlU sail from Port Jackson 122 days after heaving anchor In the Downs. From the well-known saUing eualitee of the ehip. it Is more than probable that hot oar go will be landed In time for the May wool sales. Tbe Eagle (e.) left Boobhsmpton on the 17th ultimo, but was detained In the Fitcroy four days, owing to the very low neap tides. Bhe also experienced very variable weather from the east ward ss far as the Clarenoe, and put into Newcastle for coals at 11 a.m, on the 27th, leaving again at 3 p.m. Passed a steamer going into Moreton Bey on the 28d« Tho Emily Hort was going up the Fitsrov on tbe 20tb, and tbe Gleaner schooner was sighted on tbe 26th, hove-to off the Manning River. Signal station at Gkllib band's Potnt.— Within the last week tbis station has ceased to exist, in consequenoo, we believe, of the late reductions In the Government servloe. Its utility has been known for many years, as registering the times of arrival and d- parture of the numerous vessels visiting this port, as well as giving the tidal signals to ooasters wishing to prooeed up the Yarra. The authorities having Immediate charge of this branch are very muoh to blame for not having given due prominence to the notice of so important a change In the pages of the Govern ment Gazette.— Cornwall Chroniole, February 20. Loss of the Old Life Boat.— Sole, the old life boat, formerly the property of Mr. E. M'Fherson, and late purchased by Mr. Lang, sblpwigbt, of Stockton, and fitted op at considerable ex pense for the Port Stephens trade, was lost on Monday last, while on her trip to Port Stephens : one ef the hands waa unfortunately drowned. It appears she left Newcastle at ten o'olook on Mon day last, with a fair wind, having two men on board, aad whan ofl Hannah Bay, one of the men, named Tassel, had occasion to go be ow for some fuel to light a fire, leaving the other man to steer the vessel, a euddtn puff of wind caught her and eke gradually listed over. The man. Tassel* who was below per oeivlng the water coming ever the hatch, made his way as speedily as possible on deck, when the little craft almost imme diately foundered. Tassel managed to get on a part of the hatch, which fortunately brought him ashore. The other man waa seen to struggle for about five minutes, and then suddenly to disappear. Teasel arrived in Newcastle on Saturday evening, by the Flower of Wexford, from Port Stephens, and at onoe reported the clroumetanoeeto the polioe.— Newcastle Correspondent, 21th ultimo. NEWCASTLE.

Shortly after four o'clock tbe rope was taken from the frame aad laid upon the wharf, the mortar being plaoed alongside of It at an. elevation of forty-five degrees ; the line wss at once made East to the shot, snd the mortar charged with two ounoes of poMer* the friction tubes attached. The word 'fire' being given, tbe siring from the tubes was pulled, and discharged the mortar with great force, elevating the shot about 100 feet, and lodging It at a distanoe of 360 feet. The tins was gathsred in, and tbe mortar again prepared, though with a muoh heavier charge— eight onuoea being used, Tbe same process as before having been gone through the mortar was fired, but not with tbe same success. Almost directly the shot left the mortar the rope broke, leaving about ten fathoms on ths shot, which esoended to a considerable height, snd went nearly three times tbe distance of the first shot. Attaohed te the apparatus is a rope or cliff lsdder of fifty fathoms in length; the shot of the mortar weighs upwards of fifteen pounds, has hooks attached to tbe atem Inclining either way, to catch the rigging in its deeofint, when used in cases of shipwreck.
