BRITISH EMIGRANTS. CANADA'S EXAMPLE. KEEPING-THE STAFF FRESH. ORIGIN AND CLASS OF THE PEOPLE. ! LONDON. NoviMiiW VI. It is tin' rlusu toncli aliouily I'cfi.'i-rod to of tin; uinigrntioii and tin- iimiiiani t. ion ])ortinns of t-lii' uinciiiiiu wliiuli istiiUi'.s thu observer *o foicefuily. Of Itci'i-.s are frequently transferred from the work of recruiting in Great Jlritain to tlif work of rutuiviiiis in Canada, and vice ver-iti. i''or uxample, the pru sent .superilitendent ot omiynition, who has Ins neliuquarnjift jij uumiwu, m .^ .1. Olietl Smith, was fonuur.y thu Coni mi.sMoiii'r for Immigration; with his lit-iuU|\mrtem »t Winuiiieg, tlto ijreat ri'L-i'iving depot for tlio iminigraiit, and Hie jjfinlwiinn wlm held this position in London last year is now in the place Mr. Smith vacated. Th« wisdom of .such a policy immediately strikes olio on meeting Mr. Smith. This officer c.irrie.s in his mind the minutest de tails of the yrent organisation from (?lid to end. Mr. Smith in still com paratively a young man, and he stands himself for .successful Canadian immi gration, as he is by birth a Uritisher who achieved .success us a Canadian farmer. Therefore lie can speak as the emigrant and as the immigrant, as a selector, as the prosperous farmer, and tin: receiver of 'immigrants, and as the recruiting officer or the emi grant. He- overflows'. \v.ithf it zeal and a love for liis work which i.s dangerous in its infoctiovisness. Canada's emigration, forces lire to be found everywhere in this! country. The Dominion li:\s written her name in every vil.nge, if. not in every liome, in (ireat Britain. In addition to the head office staff ' in London, there are 10 other Canadian Government oflices in' the United Kingdom, at which public service men are, permanently employ ed. The whole of Great. Britain is divided into districts, and each group of districts' is controlled by one of these 10 officers. All goes by system. Then there is the great army of ro nruitinp; roiiuinssioii agents, who get £1 it head each emigrant, but us fclio cost of1 eiiclt one to the Dominion is esti mated at only £1 or a little more, it follow.-: that very.. '.large numbers are picked no by the (?ovoriimeiit direct, or that they proceed voluntarily. .RECEIVING THE STJUNGKR. ' And tile system on this side is not less fai'-reacUiujj-' and complete, than that in Canada. One gets glimpses of it talking to Mr '.Obcil: Smith. 'We don't assist in the. passages at all,' ho snys. 'Our immigrants pay their own fares — about £11 by si-a and rail. J5ut we don't bother imrticularly whether they have money, on arrival. While we do not guarantee work, we keep the men at .Winnipeg aild at other receiv ing hulls until they get it. 1 have had 20! K) immigrants living under the Gov ernment root's at one tiinci.' The Can adian Government maintaiuns a score or iiiorc ot thcni' great halls, and in times of great pressure, supplements them | with tents. Mr. Smith's last year's re port as Commissioner of I tnmijjration contains the following, which ,s a strik ing instance of tx elasticity of this im migration machine: »' The -'lass of per fin? receiving aceommodatioi) h,\t lieen in every respect Icm'i able, ? and they hni! \\\w ficc a(ciimmotlatiiin ol lua terial assistance in makiiiji- their ar inngcments. This '--an be be.-4 under stood wli-::i it i.« remcnibered that a vi-r.v lai-ge priipnrtion ol those ariivinn from the old couijt.-y liavi. c\\!iaustc(.l .ins sfmiier p»riMiiii in iiii'ir means in iiayng t'ie tiMii.siioitation charges for itii-h a long distance, and if men. with families were obliged to pay for lintel iiceoniniodatioii at- western riitps, it wotild entail hardship that many of them could' not .stand. The regulations of the department pi tuuit sisveit free days' accommodation, but- this oflice has Meadily pursued tile policy of. get ting. t.bi! people nut tu work, or on to tlie land iiuiuedintely, so that a large proportion of them -lo not -remain more than tini' day: while, in other cases where, unfortunately, sickness or other temporary disability ha.-: overtaken a family, i have not hesitated to care for them- and permit them the use of (he building for cneh period as ihght appear to be advisable, or necfs-ary, in order t.i enable them to maki- a fair start. I have given the --ame instruc tions to outside agents ill eharge of nuiltlinns, and to riiis rj(-neral policy of protection and assistance for tho new comer may, to a largu extent, lie at tributed the lack of complaint vonncct ed with the work of handling £o many tliousaiuls of people, t-'rom the eeiitivs at which our buildings are situated our agents have been able to afford assist ance in any difficulty which may have arisen during the past winter, or at any other time, and I ' cannot too strongly recomineii'! ihe continuance of the policy wliicii enables us to have .suf ficient offices reasonably near the new settlements to afford protection for the. new arrivals.' NO TWO EMIGRANTS ARK AL1KK. In .short, there is no rwl- tr.po about Canada's niethods. Not long iiyu a mombi'r of tho liritish Cfibnii't con gratulato:! a Canadian emigration offi cer on the wonderful success of tiie Dominion's campaign. 'Of course.1' lie remarked, 'you have the land to i'lfer I hem. hut without doubt you owe UKKt of your .success to the fact that you iiavi- linikeii nway- altogether from the ordinary Government Methods of '.tisim'K-..

'We have al ways recognised.' nw\ Mr Ol-e-| Smith to me this week, 'that Wi- were deal ing with human beings. No two emi graiits aw alike. No two can he handled in the muiic- manner. Ktu-li wants .-liglniy different, treatment to the other. We try to size a man up. ami treat him, not- according t' hide bound Government routine, but ac cording tii his' own peculiar personal ity.' Which means that Camilla has picked strong, capable, resourceful men for this !-!;-? national job. and has giveli them lots of liccllKt..

Of all expenditures of public money this looks the best. It is not poss'ble to icl'er heie to Ouiadu'.s many schemes tor impressing the jMiiopeilli, but mention may be made of the im portation of a considerable number of successful Canadian farmers who went through Great Britain, and talked to farmers and farm labourers in their own language about the agricultural possibilities of the Dominion. CLASSICS AND ORIGIN. To indicate the class of men and women scut to Canada, details may be (|iioteil of !JO,UOS persons who enter ed the country during nine months eliding March 31, ,lt)07.

A LITTLE 'HIT OF- ADVERTISING. .
