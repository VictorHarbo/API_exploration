It is au interesting book— published at one shilling, a price within tho reach of all— and wc may well give Mr. Pouting credit far tbo statement he makes in the concluding portion of it, viz.:—" So far as ability and memory would permit, I have given a plain, unvarnished account of tho incidents connected with tho most trying time that I have ever experienced." lie, however, omitted to mention that a short time prior to the wreck of his ship he came to us complaining of pains in his back. Wc then gave him a few boxes of our Liver and Kiducy Pills, and after using the contents bo tohl us that they had "set him up and made a new man of him." Not everyone Is called on to " Battle with tho Waves " of the SEA, but cvuryonc, mate or female, is called on, at some time or other, to "Battle with the Waves" of DISEASE, and It is only when the trouble comes that people feel they most require their strength. Tburo is a good deal of truth, ns well as wit, in tbc sny- lug credited to a native of Erin's Isle, " Be jabcrs, it's a flue thing to bo well when you're sick t " Ilcro is another authentic caso which is uuder our treatment nt the present time. A son of Airs. I'iuson s called on us a few days ago and said " On Cup day lost my mother was away from home, when she got an attack of suustroke, and since then she has been a great sufferer from pains in the back of the head aud neck. Sometimes the pain extends ail over tbc head, aud she has been the most ot her time iu bed, having her head covered with vmeear cloths, as advised by the doctors; but with nil their treatment and medicine she is no better. Can you, Mr. Mentiplay, do anything to relievo my mother?" "Yes," was my reply. "Take this medi cine and uso it as directed, aud ask her to come in to morrow, as I would like to see her." lie said, "That Is impossible ; my mother could not cotno out of the house, she is so bad." 1 told him that when bis mother bad used my medicine she would find sulficieut relief to enable her to visit mc, aud added, " I wish to sue hcriu order tp be sure that it is suustroke only thatsbc suffers from," He took the medicine away with hint, aud the next day his mother was so much relieved that she came in personally to thank mo aud tell how the doctors first tried ono mode of treatment uud then another without giviug bertha slightest relief. She Is now progressing favorably, the pain has disappeared, and I trust in ono week more nho will be restored to perfect health. A caso such as tho above is one where a person requires, not only strength of body, but also strength of mind to battle with the disease. The liver and kidneys being out of order are the cauBe of nearly every complaint, and those who ucglect thcee important organs have ouly themselves to blame for the suffering they have to go through. The only reliable medicines for getting and keeping these vital organs in the state they ought to be are Aleutiplay and Sons' Liver and Kidney Pills. If any person is unfortunate enough to suffer from the effects of sunstroke and can reach us within one hour afterwards, we will euro liim or her iu five tniuutcs. On reading this many may iinagino that it is not genuine, or it is too good to bo truo, but by this tiiuc the public, or at least tho greater portion of it, must know that wo are not given to puff and blow, but treat all disoases with the oldest and simplest method— that is, Herbs. With them we have cured 313 cases of erysipelas and blood poisoning in less than 24 hours In each esse without having a single failure. With them wo havo also cured hydatids, without operation, for 14 years successfully. Wo also cure ringworm iu half a minute, auU asthma when no other person can relieve it. Weakness, from nny cause, and all blood diseases, eczema, 4a, 4a, coughs of long standing— in fact, all diseases incidental to adults and children of any age— are successfully cured by 'us after all hope of restoring the patients has been given up. Tho fact of the matter is this : Many people suffer through prejudice, because they think that tbo treatment by a doctor is only to bo relied upon, but we would be very sorry to think that wo could not do moro to relievo suffering humanity than the doctors do. Those people who do uot know tho above to be true, it is time they did. So let them in quire. bend stamped addressed envelopo for our pamphlet, and full particulars, which we will forward free.
