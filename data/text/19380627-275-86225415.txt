DUTCH I LONDON, Sunday. r After concluding con versations with the Dutch Government, Sir Earle Page and his party have arrived here by K.L.M. airliner from Holland. In a statement to Assc-' ciated Press he said that the Dutch Ministers were, in cordial agreement about the possibilities of planned immigration. The next step must be the creation of voluntary societies in Australia and in Holland, the former caring for settlers after arrival, the latter selecting suitable migrants, preferably between the ages of 18 and 22. After a short course of training they would be sent out on British ships, on which they could brush up their knowledge of English, which is taught in most Dutch schools. Societies would be responsible for repatriation of failures, he said, but a similar Danish migration scheme to South Africa, and only one failure in three years, BEST TJPE Sir Earle Page added that he was satisfied that the Dutch were most de sirable settlers, owing to their splendid character and physique, their agricul tural achievements and strong love of family life. It was desirable to strengthen Dutch Australian ties in view of their com-' j mon interests.
