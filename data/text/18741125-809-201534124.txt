R. W. Cary, secretary. TO the ELECTORS of tbe ELECTORAL DISTRICT of RICHMOND. Gentlemen,— At the earnest request of many of the electors, and being in sympathy with the present Ministry, I have consented to' become a candidate for the scat in Par liament rendered vacant by the resignation of thohon. J. G. Francis. To mot of you I am well known, having resided in Richmond for twenty-two years, and throughout ray residence have been actively engaged in its interest, both publicly and privately. As an old colonist, 1 have naturally been interested in the progress of Victoria, nnd have sought to unfold gome of tlie natural resources of the country, and have so far succeeded in establishing some industries which now occupy and benefit many of the industrial classes. At the present time political questions appear to be in a quiescent state. Some of the principles laid down in former sessions of Parliament for guidance of otir fiscal and social conditions are still under going their trial, and the disposition appears to be, to give them full time to answer the etui uiincd at, namely, — the prosperity and happiness of the people. Ilasty'lcgislatfon must always tie deplored. The in terval, therefore, should be made use nf in noting how such principleawork to the satisfaction and benefit of all concerned. The subjects of Protection and of Edu cation are herein Included. 1 advocate and support the fosteringaud maintain ing of colonial Industries by protective duties, in so far as they pl.tce them in fair competition with the im ported articles. 1 advocate an amendment of the tariff In tho re- ductionof duties on all artlcleswhich cannot be produced here. . , I am iu favor of the present system of Education. Large amounts of uiouey are now being spent in the formation ot Railways. To make these of greater < service for settlement, immediate attention should be paid by the State to the storage of water in many or , tho districts. For want of tlffsl much of the land taken updurine the past few genial seasons by well- intentioned selectors must be abandoned when tbe dry seasons return, and may revert in perpetuity for pastoral purposes. J am in favor of Reforming the Legislative Council, . I am in favor of Eiectoral Reform for tho Assembly on a fairer and innre equitable principle of repref euta t!on. 1 mu Is favor of the Eight Houn Movement, and < would seek to extend it to all tabor— of assisted family , Immigration, and an Amended Licensed Victuallers' Act, Willi theso opinions on the general questions of tbe day, and a known rc3ident4anioi»2St you for so many years, it remains tor mc only to add that if returned ' to represent you in Parliament I would let no op- ) portunlty pass when special local interests are at ' stake to urge and advocate them, and, on general - questions arising, to bring to hear upon them com- . mon sense and honesty of purpose. t I am, Gentlemen, XMilhbl'zosmo. !
