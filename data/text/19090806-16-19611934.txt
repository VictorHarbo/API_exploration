'Illa aim of tile most enlightened civilisation is really to malte life less complex, lesa strenuous, and less unsatisfactory. Beeeham's Pilla are thoroughly modern in this respect, for their uiifailitm effect is to cure those disorders of the Stomach, Liver, and Bowels, which so greatly in- crease the measure of our troubles and difficulties. Existence, which under the evil spell of ill-health may appear hard and gloomy, will become bright and pleasant BY TAKING Beeeham's Pills. However much human ingenuity may do to make life less of a struggle the man who is suffering from any derangement of the digestive organs will always lind living a heavier burden than Jie would otherwise do. To him life will always bo more of a painful duty tuan a delight. It is, indeed, a mystery why he should continue to allow dyspepsia, biliousness, disordered liver, sluggish kidneys, and the aeoompanying loss of nerve-power to overshadow his happiness, when a certain remedy for all his troubles is to be found in BEEOHAM'S PILLS.
