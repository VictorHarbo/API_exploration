INTRODUCTORY. The first session of the eighth Parlia- ment of Victoria was opened on Tuesday, the19th May, by Sir Redmond Barry - the acting Chief Justice-and his Honour Mr. Justice Molesworth, the commis- sioners appointed by the Governor. The proceedings in the Legislative Council were of a merely formal character, and in the Legislative Assembly were limited to the swearing in of members and the election of a Speaker, the choice of the House again falling upon Captain MacMahon. His Excellency tho Governor attended in the Legislativo Council on the following day, and dolivered the usual Viceregal speech, which will bo found at length elsewhere. It will bo seen that it carries out the programmo enunciated by Ministors in their election speeches ; but besides the scheme for the amendment of the Constitution, it also mentions a number of othor measures which aro of a practical description, in- tended to deal with long- felt grievances, and which aro acknowledged to bo of im- portance. Chief among the measures other than that for tho reform of the Constitution to which reference is made, i« one for "a revision of the taxation of tho country with a view to secure a moro equitablo distribution of the public burdens. " With regard to this mattor, however. Ministers through His Excellency say, they are of opinion that such a comprehensivo measure aB this would hivolvo, cannot be dealt with satisfactorily until the ques- tion of constitutional reform is disposed of." To this expression of opinion objec- tion was takon in both Houses, and in the Legislative Council a paragraph was inserted in the address in roply, stating that that Chamber regretted the Ministry hold such views, and assur- ing His Excolloncy that lion, members were prepared, even before the question of constitutional reform had been settled, to deal with the revision of the incidenco of taxation in a manner which they be- lieved would bo satisfactory to the coun- try. In tho Assembly an amendment was moved on the reply to the address by Mr. Grant. It took exception to the paragraph already roforrod to on tho ground that all matters connected with the question of taxation pertained solely to the Legislative Assembly, andtoagrooto the sentiments expressed by the Govern- ment with regard to the matter wouldboto limit the powers of the Assembly in deal- ing with it, because tho paragraph in effect aftirmed that no revision of the taxation of the country could be engaged in until a reform of the Constitution liad boon consummated. Tho Government denied that the Assembly would bo bound in any such manner by agreeing to the address in reply, and after a spiritless debate, which showed that the amend- ment was only put out as a sort of feeler, it was negatived without a division. Almost immediately afterwards, the Chiof Secretary introduced tho promised measure for tho reform of the Constitu- tion. In accordance with the Chief Secretary's speech, it provides that when in two successive sessions a bill has passed the Legislativo Assembly and been rejected by the Council, the Govornor may prorogue Parliament, and within CO and not less than 30 days, con vono a meeting of the membors of both Houses, who shall sit together for the purpose of considering and dealing with such measure, which shall only bo passed by an absolute majority of the members of both Houses. The debate upon this bill has now extended over six nights, and on Thursday last a general understanding was arrived at by all parties that the dis- cussion should be brought to a close, and a division taken to-morrow evening. Judging from present appearances, the Government will havo a majority for the second roading, but very many members scoonil ruucuin_,, uni voiy many mcuiuui! who ]iaY o promisocl thou support thus fai, havo announced thou dotormination to voto against tho third reading unless very material alterations aro mado in committee Tho bill is opposed for tho most opposite and diverse reasons, mid yet nearly all have Yoiy considor ablo force Some members condemn it becauso they contend it will be de atractivo of the independence nnd in- tegrity of the Logtslatne Council as a second Chambei, and an integral portion of our Constitution , othora, on the othei hand, object to it as being dangeiouB to the liberties of the Lcgislatno Assembly, becauso it may permit tlio majouty m that Chambei to bo ovomilod by the minority, combined with the majorit) of the Council, whilst a third section insist that tho bill will be aliko mjiuious to and destmctiYo of the mdopendonco of both Houses Othei obiection» aie also urgod to the measuio It ia contended that all monoy bills should bo excluded from its operation, m order to prosei io the o\ clusiio rights of the Assembly to doal with such measuicb, winch at piesont can only bo passed or i ejected, and cannot bo amended, by the Council By some it is also contended that the 00th clause of tbo Constitution should not bo oxcluded, and that the mombois of both chambcis sitting togethoi should hav o the pow ci to altoi the Constitution, md thus-as Mi Higinbotham put it-pass a bill to abolish tlio Lo0islatii c Council iltogothci AJ tho

They were playing in a bark mill when one of them got his hands caught in the machinery. His brother in trying to save him got his hands drawn in also and both boys had their arms crushed to a pulp. The four limbs were amputated and the lives of the unfortunate lads were saved but they are helpless for life. They are two members of a large family in poor circumstances and their sad fate has excited universal commiseration and contributions for their relief have poured in.

ADMIRAL. The ship British Admiral, from Liverpool to Melbourne, was wrecked at King's Island on the 23rd May, and 79 lives out of 88 on board were lost. The British Admiral was a new iron vessel, 1,800 tons burthen, belonging to the British Shipowners' Association and was consigned to Messrs James Service and Co., of this city. Her captain was James Ran- dolph Taylor, who had on previous oc- casions made voyages to this port. The British Admiral left Liverpool on the 23rd May, with 49 passengers and 39 of a crew. The passengers were:— Saloon: Messrs Nicholson and O'Grady. Second Cabin: Mr and Mrs Thomas, Messrs R. Burkett, Godfrey Yeilding, Hunt, Nosworthy, G. Allan, Wm. Lawton, Andre- sen, Cantarowitch, and Stewarte. Steerage: Mrs Dale, Miss Lizzie Dale, Miss Tilly Dale, Miss Maggie Dale, Miss Mary Treahy, Miss Mary Conly, Mis Lizzie Conly, Mr Wm. Conly, sen., Mr Wm. Conly, jun., Mr. and Mrs. Mills, Mr and Mrs Blackburn, Miss Ellen Hayes, Mr John Hayes, Messrs Wm. Murphy, Boland, Wm. Pierce, Geo. Brooks, John Rice, John M'Garry, Thos. Allely, John Neville, Owen Hughes, Wm. Hughes, Wm. Hawkins, Wm. Miller, Robt. Hart, Dahlberger, Edouard Varbourg, David Keys, John Harold, and Thos. Jones. After leaving the Mersey, heavy weather from the eastward was experienced until the ship was clear of the land, and a smart run was made to the latitude of Madeira. The N. E. trades were shortly afterwards fallen in with, and were carried well to the southward, the S. E. trades being picked up about 2deg. north. These trade winds were also favour- able, and the ship made such a good course that great anticipations were indulged in of making a rapid passage out. After losing the S. E. trades, however, some dirty weather was experienced until after passing the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope. Captain Taylor evi- dently did not intend to run his easting down in a very high latitude, as he kept well to the northward, and at the time of year necessarily met with some heavy weather. He was compelled to heave the ship to when off St Paul's Island, and during this time she shipped some very heavy seas, which it is believed somewhat disturbed the chrono- meters. That was the impression of Captain Taylor, who during the remainder of the voyage made observations at every possible opportunity in order to correct the chrono- meters. For some days before the wreck the weather was too thick to take a meridian obser- vation, and it may therefore be surmised that Captain Taylor was unable to get the exact latitude of the vessel, and being somewhat to the southward of his reckoning, brought his ship in too close proximity to King's Island. There is no doubt, however, that he thought he had plenty of seaway in front of him, as on Friday, May 22, when the first watch was called, from 8 p.m. to midnight, the ship was running under two lower top- sails, reefed foresail, fore topmast staysail, and main staysail, the wind being on the starboard quarter, and the course some- what to the northward of east. At mid- night on the 23rd May, when the watch was changed, nothing was seen of land, but there was a man on the look- out on the forecastle. About half past 12 o'clock, the chief officer, who was looking over the lee side, saw the loom of the land ahead. He at once called all hands, ordered the watch to "haul out the spanker," and put the helm down to bring her round. The ship came quickly round before the spanker was set, and the mainsail and mizentopsail, together with the jib and maintopmast staysail, were at once put on her in order to claw her off the land. She had not been standing on her new course five minutes when the look out man (Thos. Crowan) sang out "Breakers ahead." The captain was by this time on deck, but before he could give any orders the ship struck heavily, and for a few minutes it was expected that the masts would go by the board in consequence of the manner in which they swayed to and fro. Up to this time the passengers had been totally unacquainted with any possibility of danger, but the severe shock of the ship shaking brought them rushing on deck and a most heartrending scene occurred. There were several women on board—one of whom was far advanced in pregnancy—together with many young girls and the screams and prayers for rescue from these were appalling. The women and children had congregated on the poop, and were clinging to the mizen rigging within a few minutes of the ship striking having been awakened from their sleep by the shock. The captain and mate at once gave orders to "Clear away the boats." Mr Baker (the chief officer) at the same time ran towards the cabin for the purpose of getting an axe in order to cut away the masts if neces- sary. The third mate (Mr M'Ewan), who had been confined to his cabin for the last fort- night with fever, hearing the shock, rushed on deck, and, seeing the land close to, at once seized some clothing and took his station on the quarter deck. The carpenter had in the meantime sounded the pumps, and was reporting to the captain at the time the men were clearing away the boats. There was no hurry or confusion, but according to orders, the starboard watch went to the forward boats, the port watch clear- ing away the after boats. The forward boats were secured on top of the house on deck, and the first attempt was made to cast loose the gig. The first and third mates together with several seamen cut the lash- ings loose and tried to launch the boat, but as the ship rolled heavily at the time, the gig fell between the bulwarks and the house on deck and was smashed. At the same mo- ment a heavy sea swept across the 'midships of the vessel, and the chief officer, together with several seamen were drowned. The third officer, seeing the sea coming, made a run for the fore-rigging, and together with a couple of seamen who followed his example, managed to secure their escape. The next sea that came on board swept away the mizenmast, and with it the crowd of passengers who had taken to the poop and were clinging to the mizen rigging. Heavy seas continued to sweep across the ill-fated vessel, and a few minutes afterwards the mainmast went over the side. The effect of the heavy sea now began to tell, as the decks showed signs of bursting, and without any great delay those individuals who were clinging on to the fore rigging found them- selves washed away by a heavy sea that nearly swamped them; they had scarcely relieved themselves from this sea when the ship slipped off the rock and went into deep water. The third mate and some others managed to secure some timber which had floated out of the hold, and made towards the shore. This was a matter of difficulty, but trusting to the tide and current, they managed, after considerable bruising and knocking about among the rocks, to secure a footing on dry land. At this time they were wet, cold, and bruised, but as they found that they had timber and that some provisions and cargo had been floated ashore, they managed to provide some accommodation for themselves. A cask of spirits was washed ashore and this was found most useful. The rescued crew having rested on Sunday, on the next morning made a start down the coast in order to ascertain whether there was any one living on the island. On their way they saw several dead bodies but upon reach- ing Currie Harbour, they found a hunter named M'Pherson stopping there who gave them every assistance. They also found with him one of their companions named Cunning- ham, who had managed to escape from the wreck. The names of the rescued crew and passen- gers are—the third officer, Mr Charles Wm. M'Ewan; Cunningham, A. B.; Baker A. B.; Wagard, A. B.; and Davison O. S. Mr O'Grady, saloon passenger; David Keys, Thomas Jones, and John Harold, steerage passengers. The survivors were treated with every attention by the hunters who live on the island, and a ketch called the Kangaroo, which was at the island crayfishing, brought them on to Melbourne. The intelligence of the disaster caused a profound sensation in Melbourne, and the Government despatched the steamer Pharos to the scene of the wreck to ascertain whether there were any other survivors. The crew of the Pharos made an examination of the island in the neighbourhood of the wreck, but could discover no traces of any of the passengers or crew that were saved. Some bodies that were washed on shore were buried. Inquiry into the loss of the vessel was held by the Navigation Board, which came to the follow- mg decision:— "The official court of inquiry held at Mel- bourne on the 2nd and 3rd days of June, 1874, having carefully considered the ev- dence of the survivors returns the following decision:— "1. That there is no direct evidence to satisfy the court as to the causes which led to the loss of the ship British Admiral on King's Island on the morning of the 23rd ult. "2. There is evidence to show that a meridian altitude of the sun had been taken the day previously. "3. There is also evidence to show that a heavy sea struck the ship off St Paul's, which was supposed to have affected the rates of the chronometers. "Taking the above facts into considera- tion the court is of opinion that the strand- ing of the ship is probably due to an error in longitude. "In justice, however, to the memory of the captain and officers, it is right that the court should record that the evidence shows they were careful and attentive to their duties during the voyage." The wreck has since been sold by auction to Mr S. Gardiner for £2,100. The following is an account of the visit of the Pharos to the scene of the wreck by the special reporter of The Argus :— The Government steamer Pharos arrived in the bay at a late hour on Saturday night, June 6, from her voyage to the scone of the wreck of the iron clipper ship British Admiral on King's Island. The voyage was a rough, and at times a dangerous one, as the western coast of the island is most rugged and bleak. It is fenced in by reefs and sunken rocks from Cape Wickham Light down to Fitz- maurice Bay, near its southern extremity, and it is only at one or two places that a landing can be effected, and then only in fine weather. Although Captain Anderson, of the Pharos, has not been successful in finding any more sur- vivors from the wrecked ship, some little good has been done in decently interring the remains of six more unfortunates, whose bodies were found lying on various parts of the coast, and in proving that there are no more shipwrecked persons remaining on the island. Those who visited King's Island on Thursday and Friday last will not soon forget the sight they witnessed as they scrambled along the coast. For 15 or 16 miles the rocks and sands were strewn with the debris of the cargo, a large portion of which consisted of beer and tobacco. At intervals along the only sandy beach, a small piece of plank, placed upright, marked out the place where some unfortunate being had found his or her last resting place. Among the rocks at one portion of the coast, two bodies, those of a man and a woman, were seen. These were recovered and buried, and about two miles below the principal scene of the wreck three more bodies were found on the sand, and also decently interred. Much of the cargo thrown up by the sea was un- damaged. The wreck of the British Admiral has been one of the worst that has happened on our coast since the loss of the steamer Admella. King's Island, and especially the western coast, has had an unenviable notoriety in the way of vessels, but fortunately the majority of them have been unattended with loss of life. Since the year 1830 there have only been two wrecks on the western coast where the loss of life has exceeded that of the British Admiral. In 1830 the Neva was wrecked on the western part of the island, and 300 lives were sacrificed, and in 1843 the Cataraqui was wrecked some 10 miles below where the British Admiral was lost, and 414 human beings then met with a watery grave. Since that time five vessels (exclusive of the British Admiral) have come to grief on the western side of the island, and all within a length of six miles. These have been—the Brahmin in 1854, when seven lives were lost; the Maypole in 1855, when three lives were lost; the Aurora, in 1865, when one life was lost; the Waterwitch in 1866, and the Netherby in the same year. In the two latter cases no lives were lost. To this long list of disasters the British Admiral has to be added, with the loss of 79 lives. This should be sufficient to show the Governments of Victoria and Tasmania that the present light at Cape Wickham on the northern point of the island is quite insufficient as a guide to masters of ships bound to Melbourne or through Bass's Straits, especially if their chronometers are in any way defective, as was the case with the British Admiral. A powerful light is urgently needed on some portion of the western coast. This has long been urged by seafaring men, and it is to be hoped that the subject will at once be taken into consideration. There are three points on the coast that would be suitable for the erection of the light, viz., the Waterwitch point, Point Netherby, or the outlying point of Fitzmaurice Bay. King's Island is about 45 miles long by 15 miles in breadth, and is in most parts covered with a dense scrub, with occasional patches of open country. It abounds with kangaroo and wallaby, the hunting of which for the sale of the skins constitutes the sup- port of about 10 men. Among the rocks lining the west coast are to be found plenty of fish, and a few small craft occasionally run across from Melbourne to secure a cargo. Crayfish are abundant. At the Cape Wick- ham lighthouse there are stationed the families of the lighthouse keeper and his assistants, and these constitute the whole population of the island. It was anticipated that the Pharos would have left for the island soon after midnight on Monday last, and every preparation was made at Williamstown to despatch her, but through some slight misunderstanding a de- lay of 24 hours took place before she got fairly away. It was not until 3 a.m. on Wednes- day that the Pharos, with a full head of steam, headed down the bay, and at 7 o'clock she passed through the Heads. The usual crew of the vessel consists of 11 men all told, but on this occasion she had on board an extra crew consisting of the second engineer of the Cerberus, two firemen, a quartermaster and six able seamen from the same vessel. The Pharos had also on board a few passengers. These consisted of repre- sentatives of the Melbourne daily papers; Captain Daish, who went down to the island in the interests of the underwriters; Mr T. D. Hammond, tide surveyor; Mr George Warne, tide waiter; and Thomas Parlane, a Customs boatman. The three latter were sent down by the Customs department to take charge of all dutiable goods, and will remain at the scene of the wreck until the whole of the salvage has been shipped for this port. When the Pharos cleared the Heads her fore-and-aft canvas was at once set, and she then made good progress across the Straits. About 4 p.m. the land near Cape Wickham was seen, but it was dark before the steamer was near enough to sig- nal the lighthouse keeper. Captain Ander- son was in some little doubt at first whether to at once run down the coast or wait until daylight, in order to first ascertain whether there were any survivors housed at the light- house. The fires in the engine room were banked, and under reefed canvas the Pharos stood off the land until 4 a.m., when she was put round and under easy steam stood in for the Cape. It was evident that the look- out had seen the vessel the night before, as the ensign was at once hoisted. By flag signals the question was asked, "Have you any shiprecked seamen?" A prompt nega- tive being returned, the Pharos came round on her heel, and steered for New Year's Island. A close watch was kept along the coast by means of glasses, but nothing was discovered. After rounding the islands the steamer ran down the west coast of the island at a distance of three miles. The tide, or current, was setting heavily to the northward at the time, so that the progress made was very slow, and it was not until 11 o'clock that smoke was seen issuing from the scrub at the head of Currie Harbour. This is about 20 miles to the southward of Cape Wickham light, and about 15 miles south of New Year's Island. As soon as the smoke was seen, the steamer's head was turned in the direction of the harbour and she proceeded under half steam, feeling the way carefully with the lead. The rocky, un- even character of the bottom was quickly shown as while one cast would give no bottom at 12 fathoms, the next minute the lead grounded at seven fathoms. After standing in as closely as was deemed prudent—about one and a half miles from the land—the whaleboat was lowered and under the charge of the mate pulled in shore with the pas- sengers on board. Currie Harbour is a small semi-circular cleft in the rocks, about three acres in extent, and when the wind is blowing anything to the eastward boats can easily land. It was at this place that a jetty was erected by Mr H. B. Donaldson, the purchaser of the Netherby wreck, and the remains are still there. There are several rocks in the har- bour and it requires some little skill on the part of the steersman of a boat to secure a safe landing place. As soon as the whale- boat was beached, the party was met by two men belonging to the ketch Kangaroo, who had been left on the island when the nine survivors left for Melbourne, and two of the hunters living there. These men were apparently most anxious to give every information; but at the same time their statements were so vague and contra- dictory that it was impossible to place any reliance upon them. Each of them was anxious to take the credit of having saved life, secured property and buried the dead, but from subsequent investigations it was evident that they were only desirous of throwing the customs officers off the scent, and securing, if possible, any reward that might be obtainable. The boat was at once sent back to the steamer in order to bring on shore the tent and stores for the customs officials, and while away the party proceeded round the coast to the scene of the wreck. As soon as the party started they found that they had more work before them than they anticipated. When leaving the starting-point they were informed that the distance was about two miles, but it ultimately proved that, in consequence of having to follow the curves of the coast line, the distance was extended to a good six miles. Nor was this over a sandy beach, the greater portion of the way being over water- worn boulders or heavy shingle that gave way at each footstep. In some places the path would be for yards across patches of rotten kelp, in which the party would sink to the ankles, and the effluvium from which frequently gave rise to the suspicion that de- composing bodies were beneath the surface. The first thing that was met with was the ship's cutter in which the seaman Cun- ningham and Mr O'Grady, a saloon pas- senger—who were saved—together with the second officer and several others left the ship after she went down. Upon reaching the southern point of the bay, very rocky, the body of a man was discovered floating among the rocks about a dozen yards from the shore. The features were totally undistinguishable— fishes and crows having removed every vestige of flesh from the head, leaving only a grinning skull. The other portions of the body, covered by the clothes, were in good preservation, and from the clothes worn it was surmised that this was the body of Mr Charles Henry Baker, the second officer of the ship. The clothes on the body consisted of a pair of blue pilot cloth trousers, a blue cloth vest, and a black and white checked crimean shirt. Some two or three more small rocky inlets was passed, in which casks of beer and rum, broken cases, and pieces of lumber and flooring, were to be seen in all directions. Up to this time the amount of wreckage seen was comparatively small, but on clearing the next point a sandy beach opened out to view. This was about a quarter of a mile in length, and it was at once apparent that here the greater portion of the vessel had come on shore. One of the first objects seen was the body of a woman washing about among the rocks. In this case also it was impossible to recognise the body, as it was greatly mutilated, both by abrasion among the rocks, and also by the attacks of the black crows, which hovered closely round the bodies, and were only disturbed by the close approach of the party. As it was un- derstood that a boat's crew was to be landed from the Pharos for the express purpose of searching for bodies and burying them, the party pushed forward. Cargo of all kinds was strewn about the sand. Hogs- heads of beer, boxes of tobacco, cases of porter, bales of cloth, dresses, and paper, crates of glass and china, cases of books, casks of hardware, piles of lumber, together with portions of the ship and her internal fittings, were piled up in most inextricable confusion. On some portions of the beach might be found hundreds of small glasses, filled with sand used for egg-boilers. These had quite escaped the fury of the waves, while within a few feet might be seen a large portion of the 'tween decks of the ship, with the iron knees attached, plainly showing that the power of the waves had been sufficient to break up the ship on the reef, while one of the most fragile portions of the cargo had been safely washed on shore. A little fur- ther on a still more extraordinary scene was observed. The lumber or timber planks were piled up to a height of about 4ft and these were apparently woven into a barricade by giant hands to prevent the further encroach- ment of the sea. So interlaced were the planks that it would take the united efforts of a dozen men for several days to remove the whole of the cargo here piled up. The most fragile articles were mixed up with heavy cases and planks, but the slightest goods appeared to have escaped in a most miraculous man- ner. Another dozen yards brought them facing the grave of the little girl Tilly Dale, who has always been spoken of as the "pet of the ship." The grave has been made a long way above high water-mark, and is covered with a lot of heavy planks. At the head has been placed a piece of board, on which is cut the following inscription :— "24 | 5 | 74. In memory of Tilly Dale." On the upper portion of the plank, above the inscription, one of the gilt cornices belonging to the cabin was fastened. Strange to say, right facing the grave of this poor girl, one of her boxes had been washed ashore, and, although the lid had been broken off by the wash of the sea, the painting on the front of it was quite dis- tinct, "Matilda Dale, Passenger to Mel- bourne. Not Wanted on the Voyage." In the box were many little things that a child would preserve for a voyage to a new country that was to be her future home. There were a number of illuminated texts, books of a religious cbaracter, and a half finished crotchet antimacassar, which was secured by one of the gentlemen present as a memento of his visit to the island. A few yards further along the beach the miamia erected by the survivors when they came on shore was reached. This consisted of a few planks, placed in such a position as to ward off the cold blast of the westerly gales, and additional protection had been ob- tained by winding round it a roll of grey tweed that had been washed up in the vicinity. As the sun was now de- clining rapidly, a start was made for the landing place at Currie Harbour. On the way back the party met the boat's crew who had landed from the Pharos in order to bury any bodies, and learned from them that they had buried the body of the woman previously mentioned. One of the boat's crew, having been on the island before surveying, took the party a narrow cut through the scrub, by which means a considerable distance was saved, but it was greatly to the detriment of the habiliments of those who faced the bush pathway. When the landing place was reached, it was found that Captain Anderson had landed the tent sent down for the customs officials, together with their stores, but not being desirous of remaining on such a rocky and inhospitable coast all night, had deter- mined to give his passengers an opportunity of experiencing the pleasures of "roughing it," and had consequently stood off the land, under easy canvas, until daylight. Mr Hammond, the customs officer in charge, quickly made everybody welcome to a share of his tent and provisions, and, as there was plenty to do, each man set him- self heartily to work. While some cut down the softer branches of the tea-tree scrub as bedding, the remainder of the party were en- gaged in making up a good fire, and the bush for yards round was felled in order to give warmth to those who were camped. The scene about midnight would have given full scope to the brush of a Salvator Rosa, as about that time the party was increased by the arrival of two more hunters, who had ridden down from the Yellow Rock opposite New Year's Island, in consequence of seeing the Pharos steam down the coast in the morning. They were accompanied by a troop of gaunt-looking kangaroo dogs, and having run down a couple of wallabys on the road, they made their appearance in the camp heavily laden. Of course they had their story of the wreck to relate, and proved— to their own satisfaction—that had it not been for them the nine men washed on shore must have inevitably perished. The hunters who were on the spot of course took exception to this statement, and a melee appeared to be the next step. The whole of them, however, thought better of it, and when they adjourned the party in the customs tent lay down on their bed of scrub to secure the best night's rest possible. Before sun- rise there was a general move, and the first look was cast to seaward, where the Pharos was to be seen standing in for the land, and at an early hour Captain Anderson cast anchor in seven fathoms water, about two miles from the harbour. He at once came on shore with a boat's crew, and it was decided that one party should proceed along the coast to the northward, while the re- mainder of the men should go along the beach to the southward of the point reached the previous afternoon, in order to ascertain whether there were any more bodies. It may here be stated that to the northward of Currie Harbour the coast was found to be very rocky, and the only trace of the wreck to be seen in that direction consisted of a number of casks of beer among the rocks. The remainder of the men, led by Captain Anderson, proceeded at a rapid pace along the coast to the south- ward, stopping on the way to bury the body of the man seen among the rocks the day previous, and believed to be the second mate. After passing Flagstaff Point, where the search was conducted the night previous, another small bay was found, in which was deposited a great quantity of school books, evidently intended for the Education department. At the extremity of this there was a small creek, which was perfectly brown from the amount of tobacco submerged in it. Leaping across this, the party had a small rise to a sandhill, and there a most horrible sight was witnessed. The body of a young woman was on the ground. The fea- tures were undistinguishable, and although it appeared as if some attempt had been made at covering her up with the sand, this had been unavailing, as the dogs had scraped away the sand, and had been gnawing the body, A grave sufficiently deep to properly protect the body was at once dug, and the unfortunate woman was carefully placed in it and covered over. About a dozen yards from this, and just as the point was turned, three more bodies were discovered. The first had evidently only been washed ashore by the morning's tide, and was lying face down- ward on the beach. The only clothing on it was a Crimean shirt, an undershirt, and a waistcoat. Captain Anderson, who was the foremost of the party, had passed the body, giving instructions to bury it, but from some unaccountable impulse turned back and com- menced to search the pockets of the waist- coat. In doing so, a pouch was discovered next to the skin, and secured by a strap across the right shoulder. A closer examination of this showed that it contained six sovereigns and three papers. The first was a steerage passage ticket, issued by Messrs Imray, Laurie and Co., of the White Star Line of Packets, Liverpool to Wm. Dyer Pearce, aged 25, in consideration of receiving the sum of £15. The other two papers were bank drafts. The first was one drawn by the East Cornwall Bank, Liskeard, Decem- ber 27, 1873, upon the English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank, Melbourne, for £170; the other was drawn by the Union Bank, London, upon the Melbourne branch, for £225, dated December 29, 1873, both in favour of Wm. Dyer Pearce. This pro- perty was taken possession of by Cap- tain Anderson, and will of course be avail- able for the friends of the deceased. A few yards further along the beach the body of another man was discovered, but in this case there was no possibility of recognising him. It appeared to be the body of a man about 50 years of age. He was evidently a passenger, and of stout build. From the appearance of his skull he must have been bald on the upper part of the head, as there was a small circle of hair round the lower portion of the head. Not many yards from this body was seen that of a young girl about 13 years of age. Both of these bodies had been mutilated to some extent by fish and birds, and were interred in one grave, above high-water mark. By this time the weather began to look threatening, and heavy rollers were breaking on the beach. A rapid return was made to the Pharos, and having landed all available stores for the use of the Customs officers left behind, the anchor was picked up at 7 o'clock, and a full head of steam was put on to clear the rocks off the coast before the full force of the coming gale was encoun- tered. A heavy passage was made across the Straits in the teeth of a hard northerly gale. It was not until half past 6 p.m. on Saturday that the Heads were reached, and the Pharos did not pick up her moorings until nearly midnight. DISASTERS TO THE LOCH ARD AND JOHN KERR. The ships Loch Ard and John Kerr, which recently arrived in this port, have undergone some remarkable expe- riences during their voyages. Both vessels are new, and are made of iron. The Loch Ard started for Melbourne from Glasgow in December last, and a few days after leaving she was dismasted during a tremendous gale, and was towed back to Glasgow to refit. While there, re- stowing her cargo, which had been landed, she was driven from her moorings during another heavy gale, and was stranded in the Clyde. After this mishap she was towed back to Greenock, where her cargo was re-stowed. After tiding over all these difficulties and delays, the Loch Ard again essayed the voyage to Melbourne, and it was anticipated that in spite of all previous drawbacks she would eventually make a speedy and suc- cessful passage, and thus make up in some measure for her unfortunate antecedents. All went well until April 2nd when the ship was in lat 44.30deg. S, and lon 61.6deg E. The wind on that date blew a tremendous gale from the north east, with a high cross sea, the ship head-reaching under lower topsails. At 10 a.m. the bees of the foretopmast stays carried away. The helm was put up at once, but in a few minutes the topmast came down bringing the foremast along with it. The latter broke off close by the deck and the whole of the wreck fell across the ship. The foremast in coming down carried away the mainstays, and the mainmast fol- lowed almost immediately, and brought down the mizentopmast, besides springing the mizenmast at a butt 4ft from the deck. The mizenmast was obliged to be cut away, as the wreck was holding by it and surfing heavily under the counter. Nearly all the spare sails were used as fenders in keeping the wreck from injuring the hull, as a quan- tity of heavy wire and chain had to be cut before the wreck could be got clear. From April 2nd to April 5th the gale continued to rage with unabated force, and the furious rolling of the ship broke the cargo adrift. The cargo consisted of large quantities of railway and other iron, and pipes, and it was with great difficulty it was secured. The jurymast was only got on end on April 6. After getting the ship in a manageable state, the water which had got into the hold was baled out with buckets, the pumps having been so injured by the falling wreck that they were rendered quite useless. Not- withstanding the enormous mass of dead- weight rolling about in the hold, the hull of the vessel was found to be perfectly tight. The whole of the wreck having been cleared away, and the jury masts set up, Captain Robertson made his way, as best he could, across the Southern Ocean, fortunately with- out encountering a repetition of the tem- pestuous weather which he had previously met with until a few days before arriving in Melbourne. The Loch Ard voyaged 4,500 miles in her crippled condition. The John Kerr left Liverpool about the same time as the Loch Ard left Glasgow, freighted with a quantity of iron rails and other deadweight. The ship left Liverpool on January 27; and on April 3, in lat. 45° S. and lon. 71° E., she experienced a heavy gale. During the day the bands on deck through which the topsail sheets reeve car- ried away, and the topsails were blown clean out of sight. The ship during this time was rolling furiously and at 1 p.m. the small spars came toppling down. In consequence of the violence of the gale it was impossible to show canvas to it, and there being nothing to steady the ship, which was straining heavily, something was bound to give way. At midnight on the same day the top gallant masts, which were of wood, went over the side. In order to save the lower masts, the topmasts were cut away, but the wreck of the foretopmast coming down on the lower rigging, and tearing it away, freed the foremast from any check and at 2 a.m. on April 4 it went over the side, crushing in portion of the bulwark on the starboard side. The main yard and main topsail yard, on their descent pierced the deck, and as there were heavy seas breaking over the ship, every effort was made to pre- vent the water getting below through these holes and also down the stump of the fore- mast. The main and mizen masts stood, but the head of the mainmast was fairly torn away about 4ft above the eyes of the rigging. The clearing away of the wreck was a work of some difficulty, there being so much chain and wire to cut through, but the crew worked with a will, and on Sunday, April 5, the most of it had been got rid of. Previous to this the gale had to some extent abated, and the sea had gone down a good deal. No lives were lost, nor did any one sustain any injury from the falling spars. Jury-masts were rigged up, and the ship arrived safely in Bass's Straits. Intelligence of her arrival having been telegraphed to Melbourne, a steam tug was despatched to tow her into port, and she reached Hobson's Bay on May 24.

that was declined lins statement is entirely without fonn dation No offer direct or indirect has ever been made by me or by anyone else with my authority or connivance to the Government of Victoria or indeed to anybody else to make an analysis of Victonan or other wines I will not trouble you with entering into the ments of the report which is now so strongly cntised It was the best that could be

The annual steeplechase meeting of the Melbourne Hunt Club was held on the 23th May. Although there were so many attrac- tions elsewhere, the courso was very well attended, and an exceUent day's sport en- joyed. Tho programme commenced with the Hurdle Race, which was won by Rory O'More. Gaffer Grey was second, and Doubtful third. The Maiden Steeplechase was won in good style hy Ragged Jack. Friar was second, and the favourite Colossus third. Seven horses started for the Handicap Steeplechase, which was won by Sheet Anchor after a fine struggle with Prior, who was second. Nonsense was third. Tho Selling Hurdle Race was won by Gamo Boy, who led from soon after the start to the finish. Seven horses started for the Selling Steeplechase, which was won by Wando, after an exciting finish with First Toss. The entries for the Melbourne Cup were made at Mr. R. C. Bagot's office on 1st June, when f 9 horses were nominated for the great handicap race of the year. It waa expected that tho number would havo reached 100 this year, but though there are 11 horses less than last year the quality fully makes up for any deficiency in number. Fifty-four two-year-olds were entered for the Mari- byrnong Plate, being 19 more than last year. The Derby has the splendid nomination of 100 youngsters, The other events ontered for at the same time showed a great increase over the entries made last year. The Annual Steeplechase Meeting of the Warrnambool Racing Club was hold on the 11th inst. The weather was fine and there wasa very large attendance, it being estimated that 4,000 persons were on the ground. A large number of Melbourne racing men at- tended the meeting. The Maiden Steeple- chase was won by Jewess. Lowan won tho Handicap Hurdle Race. The Handicap Steeplechase was won by Duffer; Ragged Jack|was second. Venture won the Hunt Club Steeplechase, and Ballyrogan the Sol ling Hurdle Race. HUNTING. Both the Melbourne Hunt and Essendon nunt packs have been giving some good sport this season. Mr. Cuirnside's harriers are often within reach of town residents, on which occasions there is always a good field of horsemen out. COURSING. The second coursing meeting of tho sea. son, the Sunbury Stakes, held under the auspices of the Victoria Coursing Club, came off on the 4th, 5th, and 6th inst. Like the first, this was a G4-dog stake, The card waa run through on the first day, and if the management bad been a littlo bettor the match might have been concluded in two days. The winner was a fine young grey- hound named Deerfoot, belonging to Mr. W. K. Thomson, of the firm of Messrs. M'Ewan and Co. Deerfoot was bred by Mr. Wm. M'Cul loch, and is by Cumloden out of Lais. The runner up was an imported slut belonging to Mr. W. II. Rocke, named Margery Daw, by Cheerful, out of See-saw. Some of the colonial-bred greyhounds ran very well, but many of the best dogB met with accidents through the hares leading them over rocky banks. A fine young dog named Sea Swell, by Rattler, out of Sea Silver, both imported, stood weU for the cup, but was so seriously inj'ured in the third ties that ho had to bo withdrawn. The meeting was held at Sun- bury, on the estate of Mr. W. J. Clarke, the staunchest patron of coursing in Victoria. The hares wore very plentiful, and with few exceptions showed fine sport. Mr. Warwick's judging gave great satisfaction, except to a few persons w-ho for the first time in their lives ran a dog at a public meeting, and were dissatisfied that they did not win.

The moat exciting topic of diacuaaion during the month baa been an approaching release of buabrangers. A return ordered by the Assembly shows that four and twenty are about to receive the Royal clemency. With aome of them exile is made the condi. tion of pardon, but there ia a strong feeling abroad that such an ostentatious deporta- tion of tho worst criuiiuala is not war- ranted, especially when the protests of the colony on the subject of transporta- tion aro still fresh in the memory. Crowded public meetings have passed reso- lutions condemning the release of Gardiner, the most daring bushranger now incarce- rated. In the debates which havo taken place in the Assembl)', Mr. Parkes, while devolving the responsibility of the remission on the Governor, accepted for the Ministry the position of tacitly approving it. Ho argued that in these small communities it was best that the pardoning power Bhould remaiii with the Governor, who was not so accessible to pressure, and declared that he for one would never accept responsibility únicas he had full authority at the same time. He intimated that a correspondence on the subject had been going on with the home Governmont, and he has promised to lay it at onco before the House. Nearly every speaker finding moro or less fault with the action of the Govemor or the Government, Mr. Parkea quoted priaon statiatica to ahow that in the mother country not a Bingle sentence had remained in force longer than 15 years, and comparatively few longer than 10, and main- tained that no ono ever expected Gar- diner's sentence to be carried out. YVith previous Adminiatrationa, he pointed out, ex- tensive remissionB had been the rule. The last debate on the subject has been brought to a conclusion. On a division being taken, the numbers were found to be equal, but the Speakern caating vote prevented the adop- tion of résolutions disapproving of the release of tho bushrangers. Ono effect of the excite, ment on the Bubject has been to establish a chango in the mode in which pardons aro decided on, principally owing to an able minuto of tho Governor's, and henceforth the system of direct and Ministerial re- sponsibility will bo adopted. The Upper Houso ia making alterations in tho Electoral Bill, which, if insisted on, will cause it to be loat. The Assembly has carried a motion ratify- ing the Pacific mail contract without a divi sion, and havo passed reaolutiona in favour of a aubaidy for two electric cables. According to some information just fur niBhed to Parliament, it appears that the value of the property now brought under Torrens's Act is hotweon two and three millions sterling, and that the aaauranee fund, which ia now over £10,000, has never yet been trenched upon. Colonel Coutilet, another communist, has escaped from Noumea, and arrived at Sydney as a stowaway in the hold of a steamer. uieuLu-i The funda of the S)dney corporation fare exhausted and all works are to be stopped in consequence and the majority of the employés üisnnased The residents of Bathuist have presented Bishop Quinn with a purse of 1150 guineas prior to his rev îsiting England The following is the minute by Sir Her cules Robinson on the question of the prerogative of pardon - I have read the mmute of the bon the Colonial Secretary upon the subject of par dons and it has occurred to me that the difficulty of dividing the responsibility in this mattet in the manner suggested by the late Secretary of State can perhaps best be illustrated b) showing how such a ayBtem would vv ork in the practical transaction of business ' Hitherto the practice hero has been for all applications for mitigation of sentences to be submitted to the Governor for bia indepen dent decision thereon Some aro sent to lum direct through the post by the petitioners others arepresented peisonally by influential persons interested whilst the remainder reach him through the Colonial Secretary s office without any expression of opinion from the Minister Taken altogether these applications are numerous I have not kept any count of them but I should think that a vv eekly average of 12 would certainly bo below the number All aro carefully perused by the Governor Some-m winch the grounds stated oven if proved would be insufficient to justify lemission- are summarily rejected others upon which inquiry may seem defin- able ore îefeired for the report of tho sheriff and the sentencing official and sometimes the opinon of the Crow n law officer is asked for Previous petitions and pni ers in ench case (if any) are carefull) perused and eventually the Govemoi gives his decision according to his own independent judgment The papers are then sent to the Colonial Secretary s office where the necessar) official steps are taken to carr) the decision into effect with out I behve ni oidmar) cases the matter being even brought under tho notieo of the Munster If a change Buch as has been suggested were to be earned out the first question to bo decided would he by whom should all petitions and ni plications for mitigation of sentences bo considered in the first instance by the Governor or b) the Mini ster' If ns at present by tho Covernor what would be the consequence under tho instruc lions contained in tho Secretaiy of Stites cuculardespatch on the 1st November 1S71' riiewoidsof that dcBiatch aio as follow - llie Governor as invested with a por Hie tjoicinor IIB IUVCBCCU IC i, tion of the Oueen s prerogativ e is bound to examine personal]) each case m which ho is called upon to exercise the i owcrentiuated to him although 11 i colon) undoi respon Bible goi eminent ho w ill of cour80 pa) due îecaid to the adiue of his Miniators who are îcsponsiblo to the colon) for tho pioper admimstiation of justice and prevention of crime and will not in ant ung pardon wit!

In cases in which the Minister advised a mitigation, the Gover nor could, of course, if ho saw proper, in the exercise of his ' undoubted right, reject such advice-upon bein" j_v"2_ to accent tho consequence. Burpractical. he wouíd nev or do so, except m cases which in Ins view, involved such a gross abuso of the pre rogativo that both the Secretary of State and local public opinion would bo likely to sup poit him in tho adoption of extreme mea suies lu all ordinnry cases in vrhich neither Imperial interests nor pol'ey weie m v oh ed, the Governor, w hateverhis own pm ate opinion might be, ' would bo bound to allow great w eight to tho recommendation ot his MmiBiT), who are responsible to the colony for the proper administration of justico and prevention of crime ' Practically, undoi such a S) stem tho prerogative of mercy would be tiansfened from the Goveruoi to the Mimstei charged with such duties "It was peih ins the recognition of some such difhculties which led to the suggestion . of a conipiomise between these two systems, thiown out in Lord Kimbeilo) s last des- patch on the subject In effect, his lord ship appears to suggest that the Governor I might continue, as at piesent, to examine ' into and deal with all petitions for pardon, but that ho should, beforo granting a mitiga- tion of sentence in any case, asceitaiu by means of informal consultation that the Minister concuired in such a step I fear that such a plan would not woik well and that its effect would simply be to fritter away any real 01 eleaily defined responsibility in such matters In tho fiiat place, who would be lesponsible for the appeals lejected upon which charges of sectauun paitiahty or official corruption might possibly be based ' Is tho Governor to remun lesponsible foi re- fusals, and thoMiiustci to become responsible for pardons ' Again, if the Minister is to bo re- sponsible for paidons, he would have, unless his concurrence waa a moro matter of form, to go through all the reports and papera in each case in w Inch a pardon y as proposed by the Gov ernoi, and, as I bave before shown, he would have to placo upon the papers in writing his final acceptance or rejection of the Governor's advice If such grave mattera were disposed of m informal conversations, Buch a loose mode of transacting business would inevitably result ni mistakes and mis- apprehensions. The Governor might decide a case under the full impression that the Minister concuned in his view, and jet ho might find subsequently that there was some misunderstanding, and that his decision was repudiated and condemned "For these reasons I entirely concur in the conclusion arrived at by the honourable the Colonial Secretary, in ins minute, that the responsibiht) for the exercise heie of the Queens preiogative of pal don, must either, as heretofore, rest solely with the Governor, 01 it must be tiansfened to a Munster who will be subject m this as in the discharge of other administrative functions only to those checks which the constitution imposes on ev ery servant of the Crow n who is at tho same time responsible to Parliament Tho real question at issue is thus brought withiu narrow limits. "The Colonial Secietary expiesses 'giave doubts whether any chango at present from the system which has hitherto pievailed heio will be beneficial to tho colony, and ho thinks that undei the cn ninisf anees oxiBling here, the prerogative of pardon will be bettei exeiciaed by the Governor than by the Minister If the validity of such an mgu ment w ere once admitted, it might poihips bo held to extend to other blanches of adini nistrative business But the very essence of the constitution is responsibility to Par- liament for the administration of local affairs, and possessing, i»i> the B)stom does within itself, a prompt and euectual means of correcting any abuso of powei, there can he little doubt that political tunning and official expenence will soon impose restraints upon thoso impulses winch sometimes mar the earhei attempts at self-government " I havo felt ever since ni) first arrival in the colon) that the practico which baa hitherto prevailed here, of entilisting an important branch of local administration aolely to an oflicer who is not responsible to Parliament is highly objectionable , and as I fad to see that any plan of divided respon- sibility in such a matter can be dovised, I can onl) repeit here what I havo on several occasions since the receipt of Lord Kim berle)'s last despatch stated to the Colonial Secretary in conversation, namely that I am quite prepared to adopt a chango of system , snd I think that for tho futuro all applica- tions for mitigation ot sentences should be submitted to mo through tho nitoiveiitioii of a responsible Munster, whose opinion and advice as regards each case should be speci- fied in w ritmg upon the papers.

REVIEW OF Till. STOCK AND SHARE MARK..T. . The dulitess which clnric'cnscd this market at dito of our last report continued during the gretter put of the succeeding fortnight, but since then in nn rioved demand baa boen experienced, especially for hink shires ond for Bcvcril of the leading mining companies, and the market cloBC3 tilth n better tone Government dobenttirca havo not, how ey or, participated ni tlio improvement Buaincsa in them has been under the aveiago extent, and previous quotations havo scared) beon Btipportcd Tho low prlcca to which National nnd Colonial Bank shares weio driven last month induced largo biijing orders, and tho market having been cleared of tho cheap lots, both ti eso stocka hav o eineo mado a considerable ad yanco in market yaiuu. Victoria and Commercial have had good inquir) 'at about previotia rates, and Now South Wales, Union, Australasia, and Oriental nil eoiumond full prices. Tho opening of share- holders' registeis hero by theso thrco latter banks has caused increased inquiry tor their shares, but as )ct tbcio aro few obtainable in this market, and tho delay in getting them from London makes business difficult. Insurance slmrcs havo liad only avery moderato business, with little chango in values. Gas companies' abarca have had continued good demand, and Mclbourno have been placed at higher rates Miscellaneous stocka have had few transactions, and aro without notovvorthy changes in prices. Business in mining shares ecems atlast to have experienced a decided chungo for tho better, quite a number of the leading companies have bocu in steady request, and fair ad- vances ou tho late low rates havo been paid to secure shares. The transactions havo not Indeed been numerous, holders showing un- willingness to sell at present prices, which in most cases would Btill entail heavy losa on tho Bollor. The improved demand is limited to dividend-paying com- panies and such as havo au early prospect of be- coming co. Call making companies continuo little dealt lu, aud great numbera of forfeited shares are every vvcole sold nt auction at very small prices. Among the principal changes in valtto we note-Albion, Blackwood ; Long Tunnel and Walhalla. Stringer's Creek ; Now North Clunes, Clunes ; and Extoudod Hustler's and Johnson's Companies, Sandhurst, all of which havo risen .considerably i and Cornish, Daylesford ; Nowlngton and Pleasant Creek, Stawoll ; Sultana, Blackwood; nnd Baud and Baud, Ballarat, which havo receded in valuo.
