TONIGHT AND TOMORROW AT 7.30pm - $2.50 A FIIM YOU'LL LOVE EVEN MORE THAN HAROLD AND 1 MAUDE ... FEAR EATS THE SOUL.. .' A PIUVI DYRAjlUEn WERNER FABSBINOER ' . . Its plot is an extraordinary mesh of low-key melodrama and social criticism. Emmi meets Alj when she takes shelter in a bar frequented by Moroccans, Germany's most despised immigrants. To her surprise, her friendly overtures lead to a seduction and, soon after, to marriage; to her dismay, she is immediately ostracised by her neighbours, her three grown-up children, local tradesmen and her fellow-charwomen at work. "She averts a breakdown only by taking Ali for a holiday abroad. By the lime they return to Munich, the social system has come 1t> 'accommodate' the upset they caused (Emmi is needed: as a helping hand, a babysitter or a customer) and Emit)! suddenly finds that she can command an 'audience' for her prize husband. Without noticing, she adopts a matriarchal role, ond Ali drifts back to a voracious womon barkeeper who enjoys his virility at lirst hand . . . ". . . Much, of course, hinges on sex. Ali is a terrific stud (Fassbinder twice shows him 'magnificently' naked) who provokes male envy and female lust, responses that the movie discovers behind nearly all the social facades. Throughout, the themes covert in the Jans Wyman-Rock Hudson relationship in All That Heaven Allows are made explicit, and ferociously convincing. "Fassbinder circumscribes the movie's area of interest by fading out on anything irrelevant to his direct concerns (the first flight that the couple share; their turning-point holiday). ... The overall approach invites comparison with other European critiques of America genres (Melville's gangster movies, Leone's Westerns); but Fassbinder is clearly as interested in vindicating Sirk as he is in using a rhetorical style to make his unequivocal statements on film. This 'politicised weepie' realises both aims with an assurance of a kind olmost vanished from narrative cinema". \- Tony Rayns, Sight and Sound . . memorable for its differentness of approach .. \- Daugal MacDonald, The Canberra Times, October 73, 1976 Plus RE: LONE (R) Franz Ernst's Danish film of escape from problems of life by Lone who runs from her foster parents, from the boy who gives her the love she needs and finally from the child she is expecting, ending in harrowing scene of self- help abortion \- with Pernille Klovedal, Sten Kaalo, Erik Frederiksen.
