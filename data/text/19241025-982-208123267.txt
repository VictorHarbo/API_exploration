The proposal for a State c F a ) Lottery has given him a glorious chance to look mournful and to wail about gambling, immorality, reducing the birth rate, ruining the home, making criminals of the children, and sending the State to Hades generally. Meanwhile, this hospitals can go hang for all he has to propose, or to give. » * * Italian Prime Minister Mussolini says "A Government composed of mediocrities which is continuous is better than a Government of geniuses which is subject to interruption." Either Mussolini has been studying some of our Australian Governments or Italy is more like this country than we thought. The Keehabites recently laid the foundation stone of their hall. We believe, on quite reliable authority, that a bottle of North Perth water was not placed under the stone. They did not want future generations to ever find out what we had to drink. * » . * British Lahorite, Captain O'Grady, is going to occupy an ordinary house as Governor of Tasmania.

The National Qounoll of Women, Included in other objections, claims that the lottery "will reduce the birth rate." What In the name of all that is great and Wonderful has buying a sweep ticket .got to do with the birth rate? Are the women goinjr to go on strike as they did in one of Aristophane's ancient comedies—or tragedies? Who can undaunted brave the Critic's rage. Or note unmoved his mention in the Critic's page.

They report a very quiet season latterly, and even the cockles have been too shrewd to be caught. • • * British Communists are demanding a declaration of independence of Ireland, India, Egypt, and ''other colonies.". If they include Australia in the latter, they can just stop doing it. We have quite enough elections and politicians now without wanting to add any presidential « wrangle * to « it. "Faith-healing.
