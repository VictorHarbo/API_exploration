The Penola was boarded in the Gulf on Satur day, at noon, during the prevalence of a strong north-west breeze, which the steamer had en countered since leiving Port Robe. She left Mel bourne on Wednesday with cargo for MacDonnell Bay, where she discharged it on Thursday, and on Friday called at Guichen Bay for a similar pur pose. During the early part of the trip fine north easterly weather prevailed, but afterwards heavy Bqualls, attended by hail and rain, with cross sea running. The Sarah is a clipper brig, which left Port Adelaide on March the 11th, and made a very fast passage of 28 -l;iys to Port Louis, where she loaded a cargo of sugar, and sailed on the return voyage on May 8. Xhe continuation of easterly and north- east winds during the whole passage h;ts been such as to prevent its accomplishment with similar celerity, but she arrived yesterday at noon, and immediately sailed into harbour. (Japt. Craig reports the barque Atrevida as loading for Sydney on his departure. The Crinoline was towed out yesterday morn ing, and commenced beating down the Gulf; but towards midday she returned, and sailed over the bar, from what cause Ls unknown. Passengers per Ha vilah, fonMelbourne(cicarance reported on Saturday) :— .Mr. Turnbull and Mr. A. Gaedechens, in the cabin ; W. Bell, C. Heath, J. W. McFarlane, Wm. Spicer, Edwd.

Extraordinary Tiup on a Boat's Bottom.— On Sunday morning at daylight the look-out at I the Semaphore Station perceived a dark object to j the northward, which ultimately was made out to be a man sitting on a boat's bottom. No time was lost in manning a whaleboat, and proceeding j to the rescue of the unfortunate seaman, whose ; description of his catastrophe is only another instance of the hardship the human frame is capable of sustaining. It appears he is named ! Charles Codis, the owner of a small cutter-rigged 5 boat, the Young Recruit, in which he earned his J living by proceeding across to Black Point for fire wood. In the accomplishment of his voyages he 1 had no companion, all the running gear being led 1 aft to a position where he could work it and steer i as well. On Thursday afternoon he left the Point 1 laden with wood, and on getting an offing the breeze freshened, and in jibing, the head of the j lower mast carried away, and the boat filled with j water, and afterwards capsized. Being decked j over forwards, that portion still contained the ( wood, keeping her head down and the stern tolerably high out of the water, and on the stern post Couis managed to secure himself, drifting i helplessly, across the Gulf in a strong breeze, with heavy rain squalls. On Friday, when morning \ broke, there seemed to be no hope for the cast- | away, though as the day wore on the smoke of the { Young Australian proceeding to Clinton was dis- ' tinctly visible, but too far away to be of any ser- \ vice. All Friday night without a morsel 'of food j or drink of water, and on Saturday the Lightship j was in sight, cheering the poor fellow, who clung ' with desperate energy to the wreck of his boat, and hoped some friendly telescope might be l directed towards a fragment of her topsWes, wh:ch he held aloft as a signal. It was singular he escaped notice alt Saturday; and another fearful night ensued, but he found the wreck drifting towards the shore, bo as long as the wind lasted there was a bare probability of his reaching it On Sunday morning he was so closo to the beach that the mast touched the bottom, but he was too much * exhausted to attempt to swim on shore, and again he raised the fragment of plank as a signal, which » was seen from the stations, and he was rescued from his dangerous position after being three ' nights and two days in the water.
