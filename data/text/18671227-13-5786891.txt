CHRISTMAS DAY. The anniversary of the great Christian festival, on Wednesday, was celebrated in Melbourne in the manner which has as- sumed with us all the regularity of estab- lished custom. In the morning, religious services were performed in the various places of worship connected with the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, at which large audiences assisted ; and the customary festi- vities of the season were observed by all classes with as much heartiness as any time since the early settlers sat down to their first Christmas dinner in this colony, surrounded by the now almost extinct abo- rigines. The busy scene enacted on the previous evening at the Eastern-market, and in the shops of all the provision dealers, sufficiently showed the satisfactory circum- stances under which preparation was being made for that day on which " E'en from the peasant to the lord A turkey smokes on overy board " and to judge from the crowds of contented looking people who were to be seen bargain- ing for the classic sirloin and materials for the huge plum-pudding of the old, English Christmas dinnei, there has been no merrier Christmas spent here than that just passed. There were, no doubt, silvery voices, jolly songs, and festive boards, surrounded by brave company to grace the good cheer ; and let us hope, that in this lime of feasting and wassail the unfortunates in the various charitable institutions-who have spent merry Christmases to,o in their days of pro- sperity, were not altogether forgotten in the mansions of the rich. The day was somewhat cloudy and threaten- ing, and a smaller number of people than usual spent their Christmas in the open air, as Australians are wont to do. A considerable number of excursionists ventured out, never- theless; and a great many pleasure seckers betook themselves to the companionship of "the sad sea waves," at Queenscliff, Brighton, St. Kilda, and Schnapper Point. The parks and public reserves were rather thinly attended, and the river had little of a holiday appearance to show. The subur- ban railways were kept tolerably busy, but it was anything but a day of bustle and excite- ment, and the city was almost as quiet as on Sundays. Of Boxing Day, however-the Christmas holiday par excellence- there will be a very different story to tell. BOXING DAY. The first burst of the Christmas holidays is now over, and in a few days we shall have forgotten them, in favour of a little proper excitement about the New Year. Upon the whole, it has been very pleasant, although things promised differently. Christmas Day broke disagreeably: a hot wind lightly fanned us with an air that made the perspiration come out like beads on the forehead and weigh heavily on the lungs. As the good folks came out of church in the morning the wind shifted to the south, and the popular enjoyment was increased by at least 300 per cent. However the wealthier classes might have managed it, the poorer people, to whom holidays are rare, would have felt it keenly; and on them would have come the full force of the many temptations to drink in excess which the sirocco brings. The cool breeze continued throughout yesterday, which was one of the most beautiful days of the season, and consequently the chief out-door amusements of the day--the fÃªte at the Zoological-gardens, the cricket match, and the review-were crowded with pleasure-seekers, who got what they looked for. It was thought by some, that our Christmas pleasures would be somewhat curtailed be cause of the money spent in receiving the Duke. If the fact be so, it has not appeared yet, and is only known to those whom it concerns. On every side all classes seem to have " gone in" for pleasure with unabated eagerness, and apparently with purses ordi- narily full. The reason of this is, it may be, that Victorians-at least those of Melbourne are gradually learning thriftiness, and find that they have in the past allowed their plea- sures to cost them a little more than they need. Be that as it may, the metropolis and the whole colony are making high holiday, and, it is to be hoped, thanking Providence for the weather that has made the Christmas of 1867 so delightful. We shall notice in de- tail a few of the more prominent events and amusements of the day. THE VOLUNTEER REVIEW. It would have been a great omission if the Prince were denied a sight of our volunteers in review, and so the authorities seem to have felt, by not holding the ordinary annual review on the racecourse on the Prince of Wales' Birthday this year, but postponing it till Boxing Day, when His Royal Highness would have an opportunity of seeing of what stuff our volunteers are composed, and they, nothing loth, get a full view of the most pro- mising member of the Royal family out of the direct line of succession to the throne. No pains have boen spared to give our men a chance to show their best, and they have taken the very fullest advantage of their opportunity. The most bitter enemy of the force-if it has a critic possessed of any such spirit-could not but admire their conduct yesterday, although no doubt their move- ments were frequently closely criticised, and perhaps condemned, by those whose opinions were indicative rather of courage than judgment. Doubtless, there were faults somewhere, but the Prince did not see them, or in his free-spoken way he would have men- tioned them, but it seems, on the contrary, that he was highly pleased. It is certain that a manifest improvement in the Volun- teer discipline becomes more and more visible from year to year, and never before have our men "marched past" in such a solid wall. We have seen greater crowds at the race- course on similar occasions, for yesterday there were not more than 5,000 people present; but those who went reaped their reward, and the lovely day, no less than the interest of the spectacle, must have afforded them the fullest enjoyment. Trains ran from Spencer Street to the Grand Stand, and also on the main line to the Footsciay embankment, throughout the morning, and coming and returning, there was no accident. The rail- way arrangements altogether call for high compliment in this respect, that as many as 170 horses wore conveyed to and fro without any mishap, and everything went as smoothly as could be. The review was to commence at half past eleven o'clock,' just before which time the Viceregal family reached the grand stand, and took their places. At first glance there was very little to be seen. On the heights above the Saltwater river one could just see lines of white cap covers and dots of red and grey, but no more; and the area of the course was bare. At about twenty five minutes' to twelve the signal was given, and then the review commenced. As at the last review in 1866, the proceed- ings were made to represent the operations of a force which, holding one side of the Salt- water river, desired to cross and advance in the face of an enemy (entirely supposititious on this occasion) in possession of the south-east side. For this, purpose the men had been brought from Melbourne by rail, and placed in different positions on the Footscray plateau, time being given that they might take refreshment immediately after their ammunition had been sorved out to them, and so be ready for action. The action was commenced by the Castlemaine and Sandhurst Rifles, under Lieutenant-Colonel Bull, being sent forward in skirmishing order, to occupy some rocky ground immediately overhanging that por- tion of the river at which it was desired to cross by means of a pontoon bridge to be built by the Engineers. At the same moment, the cavalry, with their battery, under Major Anderson, were ordered to move down towards the drawbridge (Lynch's), they being supported by a battalion of artillery acting as infantry under Lieut Colonel Mair, and the Ballarat Rifles, under Captain W. C. Smith. The grey rifles having taken up their position, three guns were fired, at quarter-minute intervals, from the forty pounder Armstrong battery as a signal for the Naval Brigade-who, with a number of boys from the training ship, manned some twenty boats (borrowed from H.M.C.S.S, Victoria, and various other sources), eight of which were armed with six-pouudcrs in the bows-and the engineers, who were afloat on their pon- toon rafts, ready to construct a bridge when the orders to do so came to them. The signal given, all got under weigh, the engineers at once commencing their work, and the boats their search for torpedoes and obstructions. As may be expected, they found several of both, and mines and torpedoes were fired, to the delight of the spectators, espe- cially the juveniles. The same signal was also obeyed by the field batteries of artillery, who, bearing it, moved forward on the heights, so as to command the river, and opened and kept up a constant fire, in order that the river operations might be undis- turbed. Simultaneously, with this movement of the artillery, the Light Horse crossed Lynch's-bridge, supported by the Ballarat Rangers and the artillery-infantry, and de- bouched on to the plain. At this point some- thing like a mistake occurred. The cavalry were to have taken up a position on the ex- treme right of the general position, with their own right thrown forward, tims forming a sort of ungle ; but, instead, they came too far to the front, and right under the fire of the boats, and also the artillery above. They had consequently to go back, for it was not worth while deranging matters further by ordering tho artillery to cease firing. As soon as the cavalry supports had crossed the bridge, they deployed into line on the 1st company of Colonel Mair's battalion, and opened into fire. By this time the pontoon bridge was completed, and the portion of the force which had not come over by the draw- bridge crossed by this new means; first Lieut. Colonel Bull's grey rifles of Castlemaine and Sandhurst, then Major Irving's red rifles, and then Lieut.-Colonel Champ's red rifles. As they crossed, each battalion formed columns, and deployed into line on their leading com- panies, so as to join in the line formed by the troops which had crossed before. Following the battalion last mentioned, a battery of field artillery under Captain Sargood, followed by another battery under Captain Strachan, also crossed by the pontoon bridge, and both formed on the extremo left of the whole line. The cavalry, which had been scouring the plain, charging and continually shifting its position in order to annoy the flying enemy, took up their position on the extreme right. The troops being now wholly in line, the idea of a supposititious enemy was abandoned, and review movements only practised. Next came the usual amount of firing, advancing in column, and so on, which was finished by a change of front, which brought the men exactly opposite the Grand Stand for the pur- pose of receiving the Duke in review order. It then appeared that the line was so long (for the volunteers were more numerous than ever before) that the cavalry and the artillery had to be formed in the rear of the right flank. The troops being thus in review order, with open ranks, gave the Royal salute to His Royal Highness, who, with the Governor and his suite, had left the field, and now remained opposite the Grand Stand. The ranks were then closed, and a line of con- tiguous columns formed, and the whole force marched past in quick time, the cavalry returning and passing again at a gallop. On returning from the saluting base to the parade line; lines of contiguous columns were again formed, and three cheers were given, the united bands (there were seven brigaded together) playing "God Save the Queen." Colonel Anderson came forward, and told the force that he was requested by the Prince to state that His Royal Highness thanked the men for their cheers, and was thoroughly pleased at the proceedings of the day. The review was then over. We regret to have to report a casualty. Thomas Hester, one of tho Naval Brigade in the boats, was loading a gun, and had his left hand on the muzzle when the explosion took place. The poor fellow had his left hand com- pletely blown off, and his arm dreadfully shat- tered. A cab was obtained, and he was sent off at once to the hospital, where he is doing as well as can be expected. It was thought best to send him into town at once, but there were ample means of treating him on the ground ns well. There were ambulance waggons in the rear for the surgeons, with their corps; and an hospital was established, under Staff-sur- geon Gilbee and Assistant-surgeon Garrard, in the grand stand. This was the only dis- agreeable circumstance connected with the affair, and the spectators on the hill as well as those on the grand stand (catered for by Messrs. Ellis and Hennelle), had every reason to_ find the day extremely agreeable. The Prince was on the ground the whole day. He looked very well, and wore the uni- form of a general officer of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, to the duchy of which he is next heir. It was this uniform which the Adelaide folks mistook for that of a colonel in the Prussian service. He was accompanied by the Go- vernor, Lord Newry, Sir Redmond Barry, Major Verdon, Mr. Yorke, Mr. Haig, Lieu- tenant-Colonel Page, Lieutenant-Colonel Pitt, Major Baker, Mr. Rothwell, &c.; During a portion of the morning, they came up to the grand stand, where they were received by Captain Standish, Mr. Creswick, and Mr. Dougharty. The field officers in command were as fol- low : Staff.-Colonel W. A. D. Anderson, colonel commandant ; Lieutenant - Colonel Rede, brigade-major; Captain Stubbs and Captain Burton, staff captains ; and Major Spront, Major Learmonth, and Captain Dowling. Cavalry.-Major Bell, Major Anderson, and Captain Sherard. Naval Brigade.-Captains Fullarton and Elder, and Lieutenant Handheld. Field Artillery.-Major Krone, and Captains Sargood, Strachan, and Steel. Engineers.-Captain Parnell, (The tor- pedo firing party was under Sergeant Phelan.) First Battalion (GarrisonArtillery).-Majors Stewart and Raven. Second Battalion (Metropolitan Rifles), Lieut.-Colonel Champ and Major Martin. Third Battalion (Metropolitan Rifles). Major Irving. Fourth Battalion (Ballarat Rifles).-Cap- tain W. C. Smith. Fifth Battalion (Castlemaine Rifles). Lieutenant Colonel Bull.

One of the greatest scenes of attraction yesterday was the sports, held in the old Zoo loogical-gordcns, by tho Port Phillip and Col- lingwood districts of tho Manchester Unity of Oddfellows. This file always constitutes one of tho greatest features of the Christmas holidays ; but on this occasion the committee made arrangements for an almost impreca dentedly brilliant celebration. In tho first place, they obtained the use of the large semicircular platform erected for the gathering of the Caledonian Society. Tho platform is capable of holding upwartls of 3,000 people, and during the day was almost fally occupied. It is, perhaps, the only "grand stand" that bim been lately erected which has been well filled - a fact, no doubt, due to the very mode- rato fee charged for admittance. In the centre of this platform a largo box had been railed off and canopied, for the accommoda- tion of the Duko of Edinburgh, who had inti- mated his intention of visiting the ground. Unfortunately, His Royal Highness, ex- hausted probably with the fatigues of the review, was not able to fulfil his intention ; but the absence of Royalty in no way inter forcd with the success of tho gathering. The programme of amusements provided by the committee was very various. In the first place, a large " rotunda"-though why an oblong enclosure, with a Hooting of wood, should be called a rotunda, we aro ata fosa ter see-^luÃ­d been erected for dancing. It Was 100 feet by GO, and was sufficient to accom- modate some hundreds of .couples. During the day this platform was largely, occupied, and although dancing in the heat of a summer sun is a somewhat trying amusement, it was cai ried on with uuflagging energy. The races and sports were also a great attraction during tho day, and were watched with in- terest by crowds of spectators. Some of the events weie well contested; and the racing' in j rinrticular diew forth several of the best runners in the colony. Then, in* addition to the dancing and races, there .was all the variety of amusements" incident to such gatherings. Every tree in the gardens was turned into a swing-post, and all over the grounds there were parties engaged at " kiss in- the-ring." Merry-go-rounds were plentiful and popular, and several Aunt Sallies received a large share of attention. For the specula- ' tively inclined there was an abundance of those pleasant little swindles so familiar on racecourses, but the polico were very severe on the "sportive gentlemen," and seriously injured their prospects for the day. One or two of the showmen tribe wero on the ground, conspicuous among whom was an exhibitor of tho " gi cutest natural curiosity of the day," from New Zealand. There was a representation of the curiosity outside-a bird with an enormous head and a ferocious looking tongue ; and the picture being pro- bably quite as attractive as the original, the showman did not seem to do a great business. There were upwards of 10,000 people ad- mitted at the gates, and the fete altogether was tho greatest and most successful over held in connexion with the Manchester Unity. The Oddfellows assembled at the Man- chester Unity-haU in Swanston-street at ? eleven o'clock, and marched with banners Hying to the scene of tho fate. Soon aftqr reaching the gardens the amusements of tho day were commenced, and kept up with un dimiiiishcd ardour till tho ovening, The races excited a great deal of interest, aiifl were generally well contested-a fact no doubt due to tho excellent handicapping df the committee. The 100 yards maiden plate, run in two beats, was won by Chali, with Parnell second. In tho half-mile handicap race, Higgins carno in first and Delahey second. The 200 yards race, for boys under fourtceenyears of age, was won by Gray, with bloody next. The 410 yards handicap hurdlie rucÃ³ was closely contested. Twdlvo coiri petitois started, and at the finish there was a capital race between Harris and Charles, resulting in the victory of Harris, with Challes, of course, second. The 440 yards flat race, open only to members of the M.U.I.O.O.F., was won by Crisp, with Lovick second. The 2Ã0 yards boys' raco, confined to the sons of members, was gained by Prentice, with Elliot second. The 200 yards three-legged race created, as usual, Ã  good deal ot amusement, and resulted in Cahill and Macintyre coming in first, and Edwards and Chandler second. In the one mile walking match, Williams came in first, and Woodhouse second ; but Lyall, who came in fouith, entered a piotest against the win- ner on tho ground of unfair walking.' It was considered likely that tho committee would sustain the protest, In tho 150 yards flat race Harris caine in winner, with Ban-as next, The last race, a one mile flat race, was won by Higgins, with Ford second. In the running high jump there was a tie between Dunn and Cahill, and the tiist and second prizes were, consequently, equally divided between them. In the quoit match, the first riuk was won by Bundey and W. Sharp, and thb second'by Methven and A. Sharp. Sevoral other sports in the programme had to be postponed from want of time to carry thora oat. Mr. Crespin acted as starter, andSlessrÃ¤. Leech, Dickson, and Spudding as judges. I Towards evening a considerable number of tho visitors began to leave tho ground, but still a great many remained to take part in tlio amusements which were to be carried on at night. The rotunda was lighted up .with Chinese lanterns, and, under their dim and feeble light, dancing continued to be carried on till nearly ten o'clock at night. About nino o'clock there was a display of firo works, which was very brilliant and success- ful. The only novelty in the exhibition were fountains which weie discharged iii the la- goon, and which emitted brilliant and coloured blossoms. j An unfortunate contretemps occuned in connexion with the music. The committee liad ai ranged with Colonel Anderson and Colonel Champ for the Pentridge Riflo Band. The band marched with the Pentridgo Rifles to the station, on their way to tho review, and it was then understood thal they wero to pro- ceed to the Oddfellows' fÃªte. In consequence, liowo cr, of some misunderstanding, they wet o ordered to goto Flemington. Some of thom refused, and wero placed under arrest ; and the remainder of the band, though they pro- ceeded to tho review, did not, we believe, play. Under these ciicumstances, tho com- mittee had to rely on the Sunbury Industrial School hand ; and it is but fair lo say that the boys did their best to supply tho absonco of the other band. BOTANIC-RESERVE.-THE CATHOLIC PIC-NIC. The sixth Catholic pic-nic took place yes- terday, in the Botanic-reserve, Domain-road, South Yarra. Early in tho forenoon the children attending the Roman Catholic Sun- day-schools in and around Molbounio, num- bering about 3,500, wero marshalled at the Eastern-bill, and proceeded to the scene of the festivities, accompanied by a band of music. As soon as tho young people arrived on the ground the entertainments were com- menced immediately. Several booths had been erected-some for the primary object of administering refreshments, others to servo as retiring-places for such of tho ex- cursionists as desired temporary relaxation from tho whirligig of excitement which was spiritedly maintained throughout the day. Every description of amusement, either to beguile the sedate composure of grown-up folk or the redundant jocundoy of their moro youthful neighbours, had been providod by the committee. One portion of tho ground was set apart for the giddy oxei eise of swings ; another for the disfigurement of the irropres siblo "Aunt Sally ;" heie you could "tryyour strength for one penny," or indulge in a sip of genuino "lemonade kali" for a similar consideration ; there you could havo danced yourself dizzy or passively suffered your corns to bo squeezed to pulp, i No breathing time was permitted to the conductors or managers of the soveral games. There were innumerable foot races for the male juveniles-a kind of amusement which the young rascals appeared to regard as a provi- dential forethought on the part of tho com- mittee. They never appeared to tiro, and the overwhelming number of entries for each event was sufficient to distract the patienco of any " crack " starter. The clerk of tho courso on these occasions was tho Rev.'Father Barry. A hurdle race, opon to all amateurs, was well contested ; but the committee would have exercised better judg- ment by excluding one or two of tho so called amateurs. Curing the celebration of theso annual festivities-which arc so closely connected with the enjoyments of school children-competition for prizes in the various games should be confined to the little people alone. At the south-east anglo of the ground benches were iixed, for the convenieneo of the children during the sub- stantial afternoon repast which had been provided for them. There was no appear- ance of stint of any commodity, thero being abundance of tea, coffee, bread, and meat, with a copious supply of Yan Yean. A stage for prize-dancing-jig and rcol was erected in the centro of tho ground Â¡ but as this portion of the day's entertainment was not entered upon until late in the after- noon, wo aro unable to say what amount of success attended it. There wero about 7,000 persons present, and the best good feeling and decorum marked the day's proceedings. The committeo's arrangements wero oxcel leiitly planned, and efloctively carried out. THE BOTANICGARDENS. Tho attractions of tho Catholic Pic-nic and I the Oddfellows' Sports seriously diminished the usual number of holiday visitors to these splendid pleasure-grounds. During tho day largo numbers of persons passed through tho gurdens, but passed through only to reach the feccne of festivities on either side of tho boundary. In tho afternoon about 200 of the girls belonging to the I'rinco's-bridge Industrious School were promenaded through the walks, and subsequently seated oil the grass surrounding tho band-houso. The wist- ful glances bestowed'by some of the girls towards tho adjacent scene of the pic- nic, as now and then thesoundof boisterous laughter reached the ear, plaiuly indicated tuo ton dcncy of their thoughts. In other respects the gardens -were unusually quiet. THE'RIVER. There was a fair share of patronage be-.' stowed on the Yarra yesterday. Throughout, the day small parties of visitors to the Botanic-gardens, or participators in the Odd- I fellows' demonstration, continued to depart from Prince's-bridgÂ« in every conceivably design of boat. Others, whoso muscular eicrtion appeared to he cjuickened by the anticipatory' gusto of a pic-nic under the willows, were observed skimming along the gently milled water. About five o'clock in tho ulU'mÃ³on the hand of the 14th Regiment embarked at l'rince's-bridgo and proceeded up the river, with full flourish of trumpets, as fur ns the Zoologil'ul-U'servo, where they were welcomed with deafening cheers, Not a single accident was reported during the day.' THE SURVEY VA DDOCK -THE GEHM AN PIC-NIC. The Survey Paddock was as usual dotted with numerous pic-nic parties, and in itself presented an admirable picture of the Vic- torian manner of spending tho Christmas holidays. Large numbors carno up tho Yarra in boats, and tho trains fiom Melbourne con- veyed many parties to this pleasant rural spot. Thewoods,rangwitlitholaughtcrof thegroups of merrymakers ; and with the tents, the flags, and tho crowds of summer costume, the survey rcsurve presented .a most animated and pic- turesque appearance. The largest gathering that took place nt this point was the German Pic-nic, which this year has been held on Boxing-day instead.of New Year's-day. The pic-nic .was got up under the direction of the committee which arranged the late torch- light procession, and embraced the members ot ,,tU0' different German societies in Mel- bourne. /The affair was altogether a most, pleasant and successful reunion. It was estimated that there were between 1,500 and 2,000 present,' and the day was spent in a variety of amusements. Several concerted pieces of music wore sung, and tho members of the-Turn Verein engaged in gymnastic exercises. There were, besides, dancing, kiss in-the-ring,' swinging, and aU the other sports usual to a holiday ocension. When evening came on it found the pleasure- seekers with still- unoxhuusted energies. Tho enclosed giound on which the dancing took place was lighted with a circle of Chinese lanterns, and the amusements were kopt up till between nine and ten o'clock. THE ROYAL PARK. The Royal Park is rather too arid a scene, its gross is too parched, and its shade is too scanty, to afford a very pleasant place for spending a Midsummer hohday, but on an occasion like Boxing Day every park and garden open to the public is sure to find visi- tors. Tho Royal Park, consequently, was not altogether neglected, and different groups of pleusure-seekers could bo seen hero and there seated on the shady side of a gumtree, or strolling over the hill overlooking Fleming- ton, to get, at any rate, aglimpse out into the country and away over the broad plains of < Keilor. The grounds of the Acclimatisation Society, with their zoological occupants, were also visited by large numbers of the juvenile population of Melbourne, who exhibited their usual iuterest in the animals kept there. F1TZROY-ÃARDENS. This pleasant and favourite place of pub- lic resort was visited by largo numbers of promenadcrs, who preferred a quiet stroU along the paths or under the trees of the gardens to a more extended journey. The various walks looked gay with the numbers of holiday-keepers by whom they wero fre- quented, and in the shady spots of tho forest, where the massive and antique eucalypti, relics of a by-gone state of things, so strangely mingle with- the young and moro cheerful looking trees of European origin, wero many a quiet fomily party seated, enjoying the beau- tiful appearance of tho gardens, now in the height of their summer vesturo of green. The rich thick vegotationof the central gully, once a hideous chasm with clay banks, but now full of the verdure of wUlows, and canes, and fern trees, also attracted a good deal of admiration, and the cool sparkling fountains, with their rock-work, and pools alive with gold and silver fish, were often surrounded by knots of interested spectators. SANDRIDGE, ST. KILDA, AND BRIGHTON. No matter how great the oxertions of Iho caterers for public amusomont in Melbourno, nor how excellent the entertainments provided by them may be, thcro will always bo some people who will exhibit a preference for a quiet trip to the sea side. To paterfamilias, who has nu- merous "responsibilities" that require looking after, such an excursion is alwaysmoroenjoy- able thon any amusement that is to be found amongst a crowd. With light hearts anil well- filled hampers, ho and his party set out from home, and in less than an hour they are landed in one of those delightful spots which abound on the eastern sido of tho bay. The weather yesterday being highly favour- able to this kind of pic-nic, there wero, as may be supposed, many who spent the day on the coast at Brighton and St. Kilda. At Sandridge there were no demonstration of any kind ; hut the increased number of sailors who were walking about, some of them, of course, in various stages of intoxication, indicated that it was holiday time with Jack as well al with the landsmen. There were also a fow promo naders on the Railway Pier. THE BAY. Hobson's Bay both on Christmas-day and yesterduy presented an unmistakable holiday appearance. Not only was there a cessation of work in most of the vessels in the bay, but on board of many of them there were signs of extensive preparations having been made in honour of the festive season. Tho Galatea, the Victoria, and soveral of the vessels at the piers wero decorated with flags and ever- greens, producing a very chcorful effect. During the, early part of Christmas-day the calmness of the sea induced a great many people to venture afloat in small boats, and they evidently derived much enjoyment from their trips until about two o'clock, whan the wnd changed, andscttinginsomewhatfreshly from tho south, marred tho pleasure of many of thn oxenrsionists. Tho steamers which left Sandridge and Williamstown early in the morning, carrying passengers to variousplaces down the bay, were most of them fairly filled ; and the favourite steamer Kangaroo, which as usual plied between Sandridge and Williamstown, carried in the courso of the day several good cargoes, although tho threaten- ing appearance of tho weather in the after- noon prevented this route from being so extensively patronised as it would ho doubt have otherwise boen. A number of amateur fishermen, whoso lovo for the hook and line was so great as to lead them to consider a good day's sport ampio compensation for tho loss of their Christmas dinners, procured boats, and proceeded up the Saltwater River for the purpose of follow- ing their favourite pastime. Tho weather being more favourable to boating yesterday, there were a good many people alloat. WILLIAMSTOWN. At an early hour yesterday morning the inhabitants of Williamstown were awoke from their slumbers by the sounds of martial music and the measured tread of the volun- teers, who were on their way to join the review at the racecourse. One portion of them (the Naval Brigodo) proceeded along Nelson-place to tho Ann-street pier, where they omb'arked in their own boats, and pulled away in gallant style up tho river ; while the Artillery corps, under the command of Captain Russell, marched to the railway station, and were conveyed by train to Footscray. Soon after their departure, there was another turn-out, consisting of horses and buggies and other conveyances, whose owners, taking advantage of the hohday.and the magnificent weather, had resolved to do their pleasuring beyond the precincts of the borough. The absentees, however, were few in comparison to tho numbers which flocked into the town from all quarters during the day. Some came for the sake of the trip across the bay, as well as to enjoy a plea- sant stroll along the south beach, or it may be to visit some of their acquaintances, or to go on board the Galatea. But the chief attraction yesterday was the grand fete in the Botanical gardens, got up by the committee of the local Mechanics' Institute in aid of their building fund. Tho grounds wore thrown opon at two o'clock, and ia less than an hour thora ? r were fully a thousand visitors present, which at a later period inci eased to-, sixteen or eighteen hundred, forming an incongruous mass of human beings of all ages and?all classes. In announcing .this file Â¡a.,y wy, at- tractive programme was issued by, the com mittco, who promised " unprecedented noyel ties,"and from what we observed the pro- gramme was tolerably well adhered to. Kirst of all, theTe were tvv o bands of music, which, played alternately, One of theso consisted of a dozen boys from the naval training ship, who deserve cieditfor_ the manaor in which they went through their performanccs, all the pieces selected being given with harmony and precision. The gteut object of interest, how- ever, was the performances of a troupe of acrobats upon thehorizontal barandthesingle and double trapezo. Some of tho feats pre- sented were really clever, and elicited rounds of applause from the assemblage that stood looking on. Other entei tuinments followed, which wero of a character much less perilous, and which engaged nearly, if not equally., as much attention. The first of these wivs a foot race of COO yards, for'the champion belt, which was won hy Mr. U. Sutton ; tho winner of the second prize, 10s.. bein? Mr. Rankin. The next was a lundie race, iu which there wero two prizes of 20s. and 5s. In this race theie wero several entries, and a good start was effected. Sutton nguiu took the lead, and although' 'he had the misfortune to fall in leaping . the second hurdle, he managed to keep ahead, and carne in first by several yards. The winner of the second prize was Mr, E, Janies. During the afternoon, tho juveniles, who formed no inconsiderable portion of tho mul- titude, were also entertained in a variety of woys. Swings, roundabouts, Aunt Sallies, and similar games were well patronised, while dancing and kiss-in-the-ring were not for- gotten, even by those who were'supposed to havo arrived' at years of discretion. A balancing contrivance, set down i in the. bills as "aFrench revolving elucidator,,',together with a galvanic battery, afforded exercise to nerve and muscle, and some sport 'at 'tho .same time. Towards evening1 there was an exhibition of asoinowhat novel character. Tho two local dramatic socioties engaged in what was called a "Richaulson's show,"and played several melodramatic pieces in a laigu tent, at ono end of which was erected n stage. The various characters were well sustained, and Hie performances afforded considerable amusement. In tlio evening, dancing was resumed, and, aided by the music of a quad- rille band, was kept up till a late hour. The fete was under the direction of the president and treasurer of thoWilliamstown Mechanics' Institute, and was carried out in a most ordoily manner. , HEIDELBERG. At an early hour all the favourite spots usually selected by picnic parties on the racecourse at Heidelberg were taken posses- sion of by troops of plciisuro-scekors. Cabs, omnibuses, and furniture vans, heavily freighted with holiday folks, arrived in quick succession, and at ono o'clock tlioro wero be- tween 300 and 400 people assembled to enjoy themselves in a simple but a hearty style. FERN TREE GULLY. There were more people at Fern tree Gully on Christmas Day than were ever known be- fore. The day turned out beautiful. A very large number of people camped out along the gully, in tents improvised huts, &c.; Between five and six yesterday morning it was a very lively scene, as preparations for breakfast, &c.;, wwere being carried on vigorously. A number of young men were out with guns, and many shots were fired, but up to a late hour no one was seen with any spoil. n.M.S.S. GALATEA. Christmas Day in port on board a frigate like the Galatea, where there is a complement of well-nigh five hundred men, so many thousand miles away fioni that "tight little island" where Christmas is an institution, in- terwoven with the national life, is " tho" day of all days in the year, and by no means to be observed lightly or celebrated with indif- ference. The continuous disciplino and strict attention to duty ever sternly maintained on board a British man-of-war are on this day care- fully laid asido-not altogether ignored, only most materially Tolaxcd, or not at all rigidly enfoiced. To the men and boys on board it is the ono day of all the threo hundred and sixty- five which is fairly given up to complete social enjoyment and unrestricted mirth and revelry. The boatswain's whistle, and the "blackhole" with its very unfestive adjuncts of bread and water, arc altogether un- heeded ; and holystones are relegated (meta- phorically of course) to that sub-tropical region alleged to be paved with good inlenlious, and the chief labour of lovo which is undertaken with anything liko alacrity and zest is the "splicing of the mainbrace." The time honoured usages and customs in force on boaid a lnrgc man-of-war in poll on this annual festive occasion wero fully observed on the Galatea, and no ono thing was wanting to lender tho day enjoyable to all hands, and to the friends and acquaintances who wero invited to partake of the hospitality offered with genuine sailor frankness-, and in true man-of-war fashion. On the day preceding Christmas, numbers of men and boys wore actively engaged with flowers and fruit and evergreens, and paper of many tints, decorating the wholo of this mess tables on the lowor deck ; and the dex- terity of their manipulation, no less than the exceeding tnstefulness exhibited in tho orna- mentation, was something marvollous. Each side of the lower deck showed a sorics of bowers of luxuriant foliage, prettily inter- spersed with oranges ; but the effectiveness of the scene was not apparent until noon on Christmas Day. The proceedings woro appro- priately begun by the celebration of the religious services pechar to the day; and theso over, tho tables ,vero lighted up with a lavish display of wax lights arranged in pretty little chandeliers, and the leafy avenues woro rendered brilliant by many lamps. This annual/i'fc is looked forward to with absorbing interest by all, and the ex pendituie is borne by the various messes. Although tho expenses of the ontortuinmont thus come out of tho well-earned pay of all bands-suilorsand marines alike-tho amount is most ungrudgingly acrorclcd, and is be- stowed with that reckless liberality so charac- teristic of men-of-war's mon. Tho faro which figures on tho mess-table on ordinary occasions was on Christmas Day nowhere visible, but had given placo to such a variety of viands, on tables PO handsomely laid out, that caterers for entertainmonts to royalty, had they b<-t witnessed tim sight, would have grootly on1 ied the tact and genius which combined so much luxury and display with such absolute com- fort and enjoyableness. During the time of dinner, visitors-and especially the ladies weie besought, in the most winning and per- suasivo manner, to partako of the good things provided, mid were enjoined to eat, drink, and be mciry, and make themselves thoioughly at home. Compliance with tho earnest and pressing invitations could scarcely beuvoideel, and great was tho delight of "Jack" to seo his guests enjoy themselves. The substantial portion of the spread was well sustainod by a, plentiful supply of diluents, ranging from. champagne and various wines to "four water grog and colonial ale. Feasting, sofar, was the order of the day, and dinner and. dessert woro followed by dancing on.the gun ileck, and fiddles, flutes, concertinas, and. accoi (leons wero kept going at a rapid rate. Sailois dearly love a dance, and during the aflenioon and evening they enjoyed them- selves in this respect to the utmost. Tbu Kost amusing portion by far, how- ever, of tho day's entertainment wos~ undoubtedly the chairing of the officers^. After dinner the men, as a matter of course, wero in a stato of high good, humour and. hilarity, and officer after officer, fiqm, the commander down to tho tiniest "middy,'*' was seized, placed on achair, lashed willi two handspikes, and duty hoisted and carried round the decks in triumph- The ludicrous, procession i was accompanied with, vocal and. instrumental music, distinguished moro by strength' of sound than harmony of execution, the chief burthen of which was a repeated and prolonged outburst of "He's a jolly good 'fellow, " sung to the usual popular tune, and followed, as the delighted oc- cupant . of / tho chair was shot out at his cabin, with three times three- rattling British cheers.' This privilege of chairing the officerÂ» is highly prized by tho mon, and vc only liable to objection / when tho head of the chaired* may huppen-accidentally, of courso-during: thu course of his ovation, to como in contact with some hard unyielding boam, or wrotebx'd. lamp which was hung scarcely high enough. This fun lasted until well on in tho after- noon, and when tho list of officers had been exhausted, the potty officers, wero also treated to a taste x>t the triumphal entertainment, but with rauch less delicacy of handling; and Avlren the, spree had. '""WcH-rviglmm its course, tho dogs belonging \- to various parties on board wore decorated ' with ribbons, and underwent the chairing .process in a state of "blank bewilderment, and with countenances on which the most comic -.consternation was expressed. After tea, ? singing and dancing wero resumed, and set .dances, circle-dances, and stop-dances were \- Â« arried-on simultaneously with unflagging zest \- and vigour. 'Onegreat feature in the carrying .out of the day's amusementis, that the boys ? on boord are for the day promoteil to the ''Tank of 'men and petty officers, and these in 1 ' turn tike the place of tho boys. Gieat scope is thus afforded to the youngsters to have some playful retaliation. The proceedings /'throughout the day were marked by tho "?purest fun and good- humoured practical ' joking, such -as only the British sailor mind .could conceive, and, having devised, carry -out with telling effect. To those who were .privileged to bo present, Christmas Day on 1 board 'the Galatea will not soon be for ' gotten.' ' ' ' TRIP TO SCHNAPPER POINT. , ,The steamer Reliance had as many passen ,, gers as she could accommodate on her t'Christmns-day trip to Schnapper Point; and though theweather was not the most agree ' able that could be conceived, the excursion by '"her,afforded nevertheless a great deal of .pleasure, and helped above a hundred of our '-citizens to lay in a fiesb. stock of health and ^.animal spirits with which to commence tho '"battle of life in the year about to begin, At starting, the sea was smooth, a liuht breeze .ef south-easterly wind only raffling its sur . face ; but a rather thick haze contracted tho view, and .prevented the excursionists from Â»fully enjoying tho varying landscape which 'would have boen visible as they coasted , , down the bay had the weather been clear. ?Before leaving llobson's Bay the Reliance steamed slowly round n.M.S. Galatea, to give her passengers-many of whom wore, 'from the country, and had not pre- viously enjoyed a similar opportunity-a i good look at that ship, and all who saw her for the first time w ere loud in their admira .tioirof her noble proportions and thoroughly complete appointments. The i un down tho bay . -was without incident. A fair band of music ' .played .popular tunes at intervals, and tho passengers, mostly grouped in parties, enjoyed themselves chiefly in anticipating the picnic festivities which were to be celebrated on landing, and of which they had the material .requisites present with them in a very visible and apparent manner. There was some talk W the outwaid voyage about the wonder ,' ful change which would be discovered tit \- Schnapper Point by visitors who had not 'Â¡i-been there for some yeais, and a certain languid expectation was excited in regaid to ? that township, and its commercial and shipping importance. It must be con 'iessed, liowever, that the total numbor of .the shipping in port on. Christmas Day was , one, and that alter the Reliance had made '.fast,to thepiei. Previously, the maritime / interest was umepresented, except by two ]' dilapidated fishing boats and ono mouldy '' barge, although piles of firewood contiguous , io the wharf, and here and there about the township, favoured the supposition, that the , .wit is occasionally visited by sheoakers. On being landed, numerous passengers by the steamer made their way to snug little nooks in the scrub fringing the shore, orto sheltered MjKitB among the locks, and there proceeded ? I to unpack the baskets -\v ith which a provident ,, habit of mind had instigated thom to supply .themselves. And those ?who, like Gilpin's -.Wife, preserved a fnigal mind oven -when on pleasure . bent, had very much the best of it. Savoury pies, made of three- halfpenny beef and mutton, were incomparably a better bargain than the lunch that less thoughtful excursionists had to put up with at the prin- cipal hotel, which, though spacious, and ex ceedingly imposing as to its outside, proved but a "gilded device" to cover sordid do signs. A sonorous bell summoned a highly expectant crowd to its dinner-table, but their hopes wore cruelly mocked by the sparse and chilly fare that met the eye when the invitation was eagerly responded to. What were some few slices of cold roast meat and ham, and some disjointed fragments of fowl, to famished, people just off a sea voyage? The proprietors of this most commodious and elegant hotel have yet to learn how the alimen ..tory wants of a carnivorous public, with holi day appetites, may be worthily ministered to. Thule was rhubarb tart, no doubt, and custard pudding ; but what were these in the absence of hot meat and vegetables? What the public wanted was a hot joint -which would permit of the "cut and come again" in which healthy appetites delight, and that being absent, Rennison's customers hod to go away unsatisfied and miserable. The far mote numerous picnickers were immeasurably better off. They may have been deficient in table napkins, but they had lplenty to oat; and if certain implements of older date than knives arid folks had some- times to do duty foi these latter in the sea- side dinner parties that were so numerous at Schnapper Point on Wednesday, that did not matter much, the merriment that their want occasioned amply made up for tho deficiency, food being abundant oven if ironmongery was scarce. Â»The serious business of eating having been m ought to a conclusion, the party spread themselves along the beuch, to the north aud to the south of tho pier, and spent a pleasant ',,houi or two in looking for shells and sea 3Â«, weed,, and . in enjoyment of the natural ' )-r beauties oi the place. Arid these beauties aro ' as numerous as thoy aro unmistakable. Pretty little sandy coves, exceedingly well suited for both bathing and boating, afford the most agreeable rosoit for the residents of the very pleasant villas situated in tho scrub, which stretches away from tho brow of the cliff that circumscribes the coast Hue. These ure now numerous, and many of them spacious and elegant, and . undoubtedly they form most iilcusuiufc summer lesideuccs. As to the Uttlc msiness i township, that does not seem to havo grown dining the pnst few years so rapidly as somo enthusiastic Sennapper Pointcrson board the Reliance would have had us believe. Theie aie many substantial brick plaoos of business in the main street, and very fair roads all about ; but tho wonder, to the miad of a visitor, was us to how theso were maintained. l'iobably_ the chief cus- tomers at tho shops aro agriculturists from the back country, and woodcutters and fisher . men resident .a little way oil ; but certainly theie was little appearance on Christmas Day . of the presence of business man of any kind. , i Schnapper Point is, for all this, an exceed j, ingly pleasant and picturesque spot, anti we Â¿ havonodonbtWHjidentsfindithighlyenjoyablo, ,. as wo know it is exhilarating and healthful ; .(.while no doubt (tho oidinary visitors to the -.principal inn finds plenty to cot theie, not g withstanding an unfoi tÃºnate experience of } its capabilities. Ã¯he trip home in tho oven " ing was not altogether without unpleasant ,Â¿noss, a fict.li south-west breeza (which set in ^tferly in the afternoon, the wind changing -quitÂ« suddenly) having raised a sea which . caused the ship to tees about a good deal, to i Â¿ho derangement of both male and femalo j.Vtpmuehs. Wo will draw a veil over the .agonies of the sunerora, who aftÂ« all wero . .but a small minority of the excursionists, and aniuvly say that all were landed at Sandridge ?abojit seven o'clock, mostly,in Â«rime condi- tion, while the damage sustained hythe more fragÃ¼e was not of a kind likely to have any unpleasant effects that would survive the , landing, .The trip was, on the whole, a very pleasurable onÃ¶.

The new dramatic .season at the Theatre Koyal opened last evening with the produc tion'of a new pantomime, from the pon of Mr. W. M. Akhurst, so well known to the Melbourne public from the number of similar contributions he has boforo made to their Christmas festivities. Tho Christmas season would not appear complete without a pan- tomime. Without it tho younger portion of the population would miss ono of their greatest and most fondly-enjoyed and dearly-recollected treats. And this element of our Christmas pleasures has been liberally supplied by the mana- gers of the Theatre Royal by the bril- liant and effective style m which they have brought out Mr. Akhurst's panto- mime of "Tom, Tom, tho Piper's Son, and Mary. Mary, Quito Contrary, or tho Good Child's History of England." Of the plot of the burlesque extravaganza which pre- cedes the harlequinade it is needless to attempt a sketch, as it is little more than an expansion, with whimsical and inexplicable additions, of Â¿he historical record relating of "Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son," "that ho stole a pig and away ho ran. " The adventures of the hero Tom (Mr. IT. li. Harwood) wore intertwined in odd fashion with those of Mory, Mary, Quite Contrary (Miss Emily Wiseman), her mother, Belformosa, queen of the fairies (Miss Doey Stewart), and Allsortsofvice, chatelaine of the Castle of Toorakannien (Mr. 11. Stewart). Tho movomonts of theso personages, with some others of subordinate positions, together with tho suite of the Queen, the Amazonian army, and the myr- midons of Allsortsofvice, are made to furnish some very amusing situations and effective displays. The dialogue theyspeak is not want- ing in life and smartness, and abounds in local allusions and hits at current topics, which told capitally with the audience. The visit and entertainment of the Duke of Edinburgh, the mayors who havewelcomcd him, the epi- demic of addresses which his progress through the country bus evoked, the free banquet, and all the various circumstances and phases of the Duke's stay in the colony, supplied inex- haustible matter for jokes of this kind, which, as relating to the subject of greatest public interest at the present time, did not fail_ of their intended effect. The most noticeable scene of the extravaganza was that of the "Hallof History." exhibiting the "Good Child's History of England." The scene was that of a large magnificent apartment, at tho iuither end of which stood a large open book of the History of England. It is from this book that "Mary, Mary," undertakes to teach "Tom, Tom," the history of his country. This is clone by allowing the kings and queens of England, personated by little children suitably attired in the characteristic costume of themonarchs represented, to issue one by ono from the book, tue leaves of which are turned for that purpose. The list com- mences with William the Conqueror, per: sonated by a sturdy little fellow carrying a cross-hilted sword nearly as big as himself, Kaeh of tho sovereigns, as ho carne upon the stage, was greeted by Tom Tom, and a few words passed containing allusion to the history or character of the monarch. Henry the Third was characterised as the enemy of tho human race, as shown in having invented rarliaments. Edward Longshanka, nenry the Fifth of Agincourt fame, .Itichard the Third, hunchback and lame : Henry the Eighth, the " bluff King Hal," so familiar from the well known por- traits of him and pueen Elizabeth wero all im- mediately recognised hy the audience in the diminutive piesentations of them which issued fron^ tho book of history. Olivor Cromwell, with steel morion and buff coat, was personated by a little follow of stalwart build, a noticeable contrast to the light and graceful figure of Charles the Se- cond, represented by u clever little lady, who sang an adaptation of "Cham- pagne Charley, which brought down Joud applause and secured an encore. The series closed hy the exhibition of the figme of Queen Victoria, to whose honour the long line of sovereigns sang a verse of the National Anthem. The scene terminati'd by an intricate and mazy mai oh, executed by the Amazonian army and tho little monÃ¡rchs in a style which showed the extentof the drill- ing which they must have passed through. The four leading parts of tho biulcsquo wero supported by Mr. Stewart, Miss Doey Stewart, Miss E. 'Wiseman, and Mr. Harwood in a very effective and mirth- producing manner, and their songs and dances were productive of rounds.of_ applause. .The transformation iicone, in which a wide wood ODCIIS into a wide expanse of valley, plain, and river, and that again changes into a brilliant fairy bower was very well managed, and a beautiful effect was produced. Tlio harlequinado which foi ?lows called for no special mention. The tricks and the fun woio, with slight modifica- tions, the samo as have been seen and laughed at a hundred times before. When it is said that this part of the entertainment was supported by Mr. Flex- more as harlequin, Mdlle. Kelli us columbine, Mr. J. Morris as pantaloon, the brothers Sengrist as sprites, and that it was under the direction of Mr, J, L. Hall, who played tho part of clown, nothing moro is roquired to in- dicate that it was given in capital style, and kept the audience in a roar of laughter from the commencement to the end, 'when the snell was dissolved, tho Galatea arrived, and Victoria gove a loyal wel cotno to a Royal son. The pantomime, as a whole, was very well received by tlio audience. It seems Ukely to run -vrell for somo time, and certainly docs not discredit titÂ« reputation Mr. Akhurst has won by his former works. It was preceded by the lively comedietta of "A Day After the Wedding, in which' Mr. Vincent and Mi s Cluveland ably sustained the respectivo characters of Colonel mid Lady Kreelove. . The house was tlw.'Ough'iy crowded from- tho pit to the ceil- ing by an avdience who were not nig^ardly|in expressing liieir satisfaction with the perform- ance, HAYMARKET ,TH1ÃATRE,-AMATEUR PERFORMANCE. The Haymarket Theatre presented a very brilliant appearance last night. The house was crowded in every part, and we believe that a portion of the stalls were turned [into drcss.boxes, so great was the crush. His Royal Highness .the Duke of Edinburgh was there, accompanied by his suite, who, when they were not behind the scenes or on the stage, were in the Royal box. His Excellency the Governor was not present. The Prince arrived about eight o'clock, and was con- ducted by Mr. Hoskins to a side-box that had been fitted up for him. As the excel- lence of amateur^ performances is always relative, and consists for tho most part, in a party of gentlemen doing tolerably well what professionals can do infinitely better, we prefer not to criticise the entertainment of last evening too minutely. The applause was almost incessant ; and as the majority of the people in the theatre had come for the purposo of seeing Lord Newry, the Hon. Eliot Yorke, and Mr. Fitzgeorge in fancy dresses, they were com- pletely satisfied with their evening's amuse- ment. The "Area Belle " was tho first piece givon, Lord Newry playing Tosser, and Mr. Fitzgeorge Pitcher. The latter gentle- man's acting-for an amateur-was amongst tho very best that has been seen in the colonies. Miss Tilly Earle played Penelope with much spirit. " The Isle of St. Trope/. " followed, and was chiefly noticeable for the appearance of Mrs. Ileir, who played Amelia Desart, tho heroine, with her usual ability. Mr. Yorke, as Henri Desart, was dressed with excellent taste, and acted a trying part with great intelligence. Air. Bruce's Damey was very clever ;i and Miss Louise Arnot played Estelle very prettily. Mr. Levey was satisfactory as Charles Daville. "Box and Cox" concluded the entertainments. Mr. Bruce's Cox was ex- cellent. Lord Newry played Box, and re- ceived much applause. THE JAPANESE AT THE PRINCESS'S THEATRE. The Lenton Japanese troupe made their first appearance at the Princess's Theatre last evening, and'both as regards the attendance I and the quality of tho entertainment given they may be said to have achieved a success. The pit, stalls, and boxes wero crowded, and in tho dress-circle tbero was a goodly number. Concerning the performances, it may safely be affirmed that they have never been approached in Melbourne. After witnessing them, one is at a loss to define any limits to the art of jugglery, and is prepared for almost any oc- currence which he might previously have con- sidered inconceivable. The majority of the acrobatic feats are exceedingly clever, al- though not, perhaps, very extraordinary when we remember what had been accomplished in this respect byEuropean gymnasts who had pre viouslyappeared inMelbourne ; butthoslcighfc of-haud tricks, and others that depend chiefly upon the quickness of the eye, are certainly marvellous. Tho rising of the curtain exhi- bited tinco of the company playing on Japa- nese guitars a time which might have been accepted as a Japanese comic song or a love ditty, just as the listener pleasedi but which to the ears of most of the barbarians seemed more discordant than harmonious. The famous " butterfly trick" was then produced. One of the company, delighting in the name of Cho-nos-kcc, folded np two or three small bits of paper into tho forms of butterflies, and by means of fans he kept them flying about in the air after the manner of live in- sects, afterwards turning them into a bundle of ribbons, from tho centre of which he ulti I mntely, to the astonishment of eveiy one, Ãiroduced an ordinary umbrella. Cho-nos ceo is said to be the person whoso jug- gling is so favourably mentioned in Mr. Sherard Osbornc's book, A Cruise in Japanese Waters. Two European lads, eight and nine years of age, together with a young man whose body is so wonderfully supple as to have earned for him the appella- tion of the " boneless boy," created no little surprise by the skilfulness of their gymnastic feats. What is known as the "perch feat" was also received with considerable applause. Gengero, the strongest and most athletic man of tho company, placed one entl of a fiole, some twenty feet iii length, on the top of his shoulder, and, without touching it with his hands or having anything attached to it by which to steudy-it, he balanced it there while a lail climbed up it, and executed various evolutions upon the upper end of it. The same man next produced a number of fans, balls, and sticks, which he kept flying about in the air in a manner perfectly bewildering to everyone but himself, never by any chance allowing one of them to fall to the ground. A common earthenware jar he twisted and turned, by the simple jerking of his arm, in anamusingmanner. SignorFerrari's Brazilian monkeys were then brought upon the stage, and acquitted themselves so satisfactorily as to maintain the name which they have achieved of being highly-educated animals. They danced, fiddled, fenced, and loaded and dis- charged firearms with the greatest accuracy, exhibiting an amount of intelligence that would havo rejoiced the heart of Professor Huxley or Mr. Darwin, had either of those gentlemen been present. After some further conjuring and top-spinning by various mem- bers of the company, the most interesting event of the evening-viz,, the walking on a slack ropo .by one of the Japanese women took place. A small-sized rope having been run across the stage, the performer walked, hopped, and ran upon it with the greatest apparent ease, all the while tnaiiruuvring iu the oddest way with her fan and umbrella. She subsequently transferred herself to an- other rope, which was fastened from one end of the stage to the front of the dress citele, and on this also she walked without tho aid of a pole or anything with which to balance herself. It is this marvellous balancing power for which most of the company are remarkable, and which in order to be appre- ciated requires to be seen. The troupe will appear again this evening, when a number of new tricks will be introduced. MR. MONTGOMERYS RECITALS. Mr. Montgomery's entertainment last night wasattended by alargo and appreciative audience. Amongst other good things which have already been given, Mr. Montgomery recited the highly-amusing tale in verse "Mr. and Mrs. Smith at Home," which was so successful on Tuesday night. It proved on this occasion no less entertaining than for- merly, tho audience every now and then being fairly convulsed with luughter. Mr. Mont- gomery took the opportunity of explaining that the author's name und position bud been incorrectly stated in the press, the writer of the tale, who composed it expressly for this entertainment, being Mr. Ilenry Morrell Acton, editor of the Manchester Guardian. The mournful poem, written by Mr. T. Hood, jun., "Homeat Last,"whieh was again given, was delivered feelingly and impressively, and in a similarly expressive way was recited Poc's few hut pregnant lines, "A Dream Within a Dream," which found a place in the programme last night for the first timo. The " Bloomsbury Christening " brought the entertainment to a successful and agreeable close. THE VARIETIES. This place of amusement was crowded last night, tho attraction being a new burlesque called "Jupiter's Frolic; or, Racing Mad.*' To such as appreciate the confusion and din of a rucecourso crowd, the burlesque no doubt proved entertaining, for its prominent feature .throughout was noise. To a certain extent it was amusing, the peculiarities of some of the strange personages always to be found at a race meeting being hit off rather skilfully, and not exaggerated more than waa warranted by the occasion. Though quite incomprehen- sible, the piece gavo opportunities for the display of fun of the sort which properly be- longs to pantomime, and if'it bael been pro- duced earlier instead of about midnight, it Ai oui d no doubt havo met with a more cordial reception. The preceding part of the enter- tainment, which was almost entirely of a musical character, was by far the most cnfÂ»f able. . THE POLYTECHNIC HALL. * There was again an excellent attendance at the above place of entertainment last night. There was no change of programme, but Mrs1. Case, while expressing her gratification at the largeness of the audience, stated that next week a chango of performance would take E"Iace. The efforts of Mrs. Caso and her usbaiid to ontertaiu their .vistors seemed to meet with tho highest success, as the ap- plause throughout the evening was frequent and hearty.

Opeiations in the cricket-field this year have not been at all of a brilliant character, though the game has received Royal patron ags, and the annual intercolonial match is this year being played in Melbourne. An | unusually wet spring, which delayed the I opening of the season some four or five I weeks beyond the ordinary timo, and the I commotion caused by the arrival of the Duke of Edinburgh, has no doubt had something to do with it; and besides, it must bo confessed that His Royal Ilighnoss was at soino pains to show that- he took no interest in the game, when he visited the Melbourne ground to seo the match between the Natives and All-comers,. which was easily won by the former. The only matches of > any interest played on tho Melbourne ground beyond the one just mentioned havo been-M.C.C. v. East Mel- bourne, Victorian Eleven v. Sixteen of 1 County of Bouike, and a practice match for the intercolonial, in which those selected to play in the annual contest took part. After the match with Sydney, the Victorian players go to.Tasmania, to meet an cloven of that colony in friendly rivalry. This match is to be played on the 20th and 21st January, at Hobart Town. The eleventh intercolonial' mutch with Sydney was commenced on the .Melbourne ground on the 20th inst., and, judging from the first tiny'.Â« play, the Victorians are likely to have the best of it. The following are the names of those engaged in the match : Victoria-Allen, Bennett, Campbell, Conway, Cosstick, Gibson, Greaves, Kelly, Robertson, Wardill, Wills (captain) ; J. Smith, umpire ; W. C. Hipwell, scorer. ' Sydney-Coates, Caffyn, Gordon, Gilbert, D. Gregory, E. Gregory, Hewitt, Laurence (captain), Sinclair, Sheridan, Thompson; Jos. Neale, M.L.A., umpire ; and Blair, scorer. THE NEW ZEALAND AND QUEENS- LAND GOLD-FIELDS. Very little information has reached us during the month respectinÃ the Now Zealand gold-fields, and nothing has transpired re- quiring special notice. The recently dis- covered auriferous ground in Queensland, though it has not yet realised the sanguine expectations formed concerning it, appears to .be turning out moderately well, and doubtless moro favourable accounts still will come to hand ere long. At Gympie Creek we learn that there are now assembled some 1,200 people, while miners continue to arrive. The prospectors have been the most successful ; for, while the other miners are not making over much, the men who secured the pros- pecting cluims aro said to be coining money. 1 he latest news from this gold-field is, that a quartz reef, from which very rich specimens have been obtained, has been struck. Seve- ral new rushes are repoited as having oc- curred in the Rosewood district, and at one place, Finnigan's Point, the auriferous depo- sits are exceedingly rich. SPORTING. The chief sporting event of the last month was the " Duke's Day " on Flemington course, November 30. In honour of the Prince's visit the Victoria Racing Club gave Â£1,G00 of public money to the various stakes to bo run I for, and the public attended in many thou- sands in compliment as well to the Â¿uko as to themselves. The weather was that of a lovely Australian summer day, and there was both great sport and great enjoyment for all. The principal race of the day was one in which Sydney Tim Whifller proved himself to be at this time the best horse in these colo- nies, as follows : THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH'S STAKES. A handicap hwecpstakes of 5 sovs. each, 2ft., with SOO sovs. added, and 50 sovs. for the second horse, the third to save his stake. One mile and a half and a distance.

After one false start, in which Lancashire Witch got away for about a quarter of a mile, but returned to the post in time to get away with the rest, the flag fell, and so many horses went away in front together that it was difficult to see which was bearing his colours in the van. Evile's black and white stripe's first got in advance, but Barwon, on passing the Stand, rushed up, and made terrific running by the river siele, Fireworks going on second, Exile about sixth at the site of the old stand, and Sydney Tim eighth. Fiicworks caught Barwon at the Railway bridge, and Tim almost immediately after ian up into the third place. On reaching the scraping-blied, Barwon held out signals of distress, and, retiring to the rear, left Exile as the immediate follower of the two favourites. The pace, good'from the "start, had proved too much for all but the untiring, and at half a mile from home there were only three horses left in the race ; but it was a fine race between the three, and the heavy weight was first treated to whalcbono at tho last turn. The riders were busy upon all of them in the run home, and under the gentle influ- ence of the persuaders the horses answered gallantly, the great condition of Sydney Tim bringing him home a gallant winner by half a length, Fireworks beaten about a length for second money. Time, 2min. CGsec. Next in impoitancc came THE GA&ATEA; STAKES, Of 10 sovs. each, hnlf ft., with 250 sovs. added, and 60 sovs. for the second horse ; the third horse to save his stake.

Fisher's b f Sylvia, 3 yrs Mr. Do Mcstro's b li Tim Whifller (Driscoll), 5 yrs. Betting.-2 to 1 and 3 to 1 on Tim Whifller. Fireworks went off with the lead, Sylvia second, Tim third, and Glencoe fourth. In this order they passed the stand, but at the riverside Glencoe and Mr. Fisher's two closed up on the favourite. Driscoll then made an effort to get through his horses, on the_ in- side ; but in so doing he was brought against one of the posts, which was broken oft short and thrown into the air. This accident left Fireworks and Glencoe in first and second places, where they remained to the finish, winning with ridiculous ease, the two miles being run in Â¡tarin. 43sec. ; The Fly was beaton off behind Glencoe, but saved her stake as third horse. It was noticed that the colours of the best sportsmen wcic once more in the van, Mari- byrnong taking, however, only a smali prize, and being unlucky in a bad start for Fenella in the Sapling Stakes. Mr. G. Watson ran iirst in the Steeplechase with his Banker, and second in the Huidle Race with Pyrrhus. Mr. De Mestre and Mr. John Tait divided the chief honours of Prince Alfred's own day tho foi mer carrying off the Duke of Edin- burgh's Stakes. Mr. Tait won the Galatea Stakes, a weight for age at two miles, with his line colt Fireworks. Mr. Tait's victory would be rejoiced at but that Sydney Tim met with an accident in running the race that threw out his winning chances, and the sporting worlil has yet to sec the great old horse beaten on his merits by any youngster at two miles. Ballarat races, on last Wednesday, Thurs- day, and Friday, were not equal to the glories of former yeais at the metropolitan gold- field, the two race meetings in Melbourne having used up or engaged most of the best horses. The veteran Exile, several times be foie "in trouble" on this ground, won very easily the best prize of tho meeting-the Ballarat Cup-but dropped down dead on tinning round to go to scale. The Steeple- chase was won by Reindeer, and the Ballarat lluntlieap by Snip-a well-known provincial celebrity of some years' experience, under light weights, in moderate company. The Inteicolonial Cricket Match between Victoria and New South Wales commenced yesterday on the Melbourne cricket ground. The Victorian Eleven went in first, and made 252 runs. Mr. R. W. Wardill played a mag- nificent innings of 110, and Mr. Robertson made 53. THEATRES. The various events that have taken place in the theatrical world during the past month, Â¡dtbough not unusually interesting, have been of a rather miscellaneous cha- racter. To the satisfaction of every one, Madame Celeste, who prior to the departure of the last mail had taken a farewell benefit, consented, at the special request; of the Duke of Edinburgh, to enter into a short engage- ment at the Haymarket Theatre. Her first appearance before II.H.H. was as Miami in tho "Green Bushes," on which occa sion the house was crowded , from pit to gallery. Tins accomplished actress never appeared lo bettor advantage. During the performance she was sevoral times called before the curtain, ' and greeted with rounds of enthusiastic applause and bouquets innumerable. Since then she has ap- peared in two of her best characters, and lias been ' well received. Madame Celeste playing only on Royal command nights, the theatre has been in the intervals occupied by a company of .lupane.se jugglers,:the Lehman ballet troupe, 31 r. Hoskins, and i latterly by Mr. John Collins, the Irish comedian, who has been drawing good houses. The old favourite, " Flyiug Scud," was revived at tho Theatre Royal, and enjoyed a-short but highly succeshful run. The Martinetti ballet troupe completed a brief'engagement, after which Lyster's opera company trans- ferred themselves to this theatre, but for some reason or other they have been unable to diaw such good houses as their per fommnccs used to attract. Not that Madam1 Escott and Mr. Squires, or any other members of the company, have fallon in the estimation of tho public ; they aro just as great favourites as ever they were, but the reason appears to be that the Melbourne au- diences have grown tired of opera. Be this as it may, it is certain that the past season has been an unsuccessful one. " Kaust," " L'Africano," "Lucrezia Borgia," " William Tell," and "La Sonnanibiua" have been produced, and on Saturday night the company made their last appearance. It is stated that a new Italian company, under Mr. Lystcr's management, will ap- pear at the Haymarket Theatre in the early part of January. Mr. Walter Montgomery, after having made a short professional tour through the country districts, has returned to Melbourne, where ne has latterly been giving readings and recitals, which have become ex- ceedingly popular. St. George's-hall, which ho has taken for the purpose, is invariably crowded, a large proportion of the audience consisting of persons who, having a strong desire to witness the rare elocutionary powers which Mr, Montgomery possesses, have a de- cided objection to entering a theatre. The rendering of the " Bells,"' " Lord Tom j Noddy," the "Charge of the Light Brigade," I and several other popular pieces, has given immense satisfaction. Mr, and Mrs. Case ' have for the last few nights been playing at the Polytechnic-hall, where they havo been justas well patronised as on their first appear- ance in Melbourne. The performances at the Varieties, where Miss Annio Bramley is the chief attraction, still continue to be interest- ing. - COMMERCIAL SUMMARY. THE MAIX.8. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's R.M.S.S. Bombay, Captain G. C. Burne, left her anchorage on the afternoon of the 28th tilt., for Point de Gallo, with the European and Indian mails on board. The P.N.Z. and A.R.M. Co.'s s.S. Mataura, Captain G. E. Bird, R.N.R., reached Sydney at nine a.m. on the 1st December. She left Panama on the morning of 24th October. The Mataura, from the date of leaving Panama to the 15th No- vember, had fine weather and fair wind, and then a succession of strong S.W. and westerly gales, at intervals blowing hard, with a heavy head sea. On the night of the 20th it blew with greater violence and heavier sea running, was obliged to stop the engines for three hours on account of ship plunging and engines racing ; kept away two points to avoid the sea. Towards morning of the 21st the weather moderated ; at nine a.m. made the land about Cape Turnagain, and arrived at Wellington at four a.m. on the' 22nd November. The P. and 0. Com Ãiany's R.M.S.S. Avoca, Captain Farquhar, laving the mails on board, anchored ni the bay at seven o'clock on the morning of the 16th. The Avoca left Point de Calle at a quarter-past four p.m. on the 25th ult., and arrived at King George's Sound at half-past ten a.m. on tho 10th inst. STATU OP Tit A D13. During the first week of the month the festivities and rejoicing which tho arrival of His Royal Highness Prince Alfred gave rise to, bubiness was altogether lost sight of. An improvement, however, set in immediately afterwards, and has continued with moro or less activity since. On the 1st of the month the Panama mail reached Sydney, with dates from New York to the 10th Uctober, and from England by post to 2nd October, and by telegraph to 11th October, was telegraphed from Sydney, but nothing of interest has been added to what had previously come to hand via Galle. The airival of the Penin- sular and Oriental Company's .steamer with the mails via Galle was looked forward to with some anxiety, but it was not until thu 16th that she made her appearance in nob son's Bay. Advices generally were consi- dered satisfactory, and wero the means of exciting a speculativemunia, through which the holders of many staple products, pre- viously depreciated below their legitimate value, have largely prolited. Of candles, some 12,000 boxes have changed hands. In bieadstufts great excitement has prevailed. Sales have not been huge, owing to the near approach of harvest, but the price of flour advanced Â£4 per ton, and wheat Is. Gd. per bushel. About 1,500 tons of iiour and some 40,000 bushels wheat arc about tho sales re- corded. Of oats, some 40,000 bushels Cali- fornian, in addition to large eales of colonial, havo been quitted ; over 30,000 bushels of maize have also found buyers, and an ad- vance in price has been established equal to Is. 3d. on oats, and Is. on maize. The sales of malt have amounted to 30,000 bushels to arrive, and to about 35,000 bushels on the spot. In kcroseno oil, speculative purchases were made to the ex- tent of 63,000 cases, about 26,000 of which have been resold at an advance of 4d, to Gd. per gallon. Of salt, some 700 tons have been quitted. Sugars figure in the month's sales to the extent of 31,500 bags. The greater part of the Tien- tsin's and Woodbine's cargoes of tea was disposed of by public auction, in addition to the private sales effected. Timber has been extensively sold, the sales comprising cargoes of cedar, hard- wood, flooring, lumber, and deals. Brandy, to the extent of SOO lihd. of Otard's, C.V.P., Ilennessy's, and Martell's changed in two days last week on speculation ; the prices have not as yet been much influenced thereby. Advices fiom Calcutta to 7th November mention no departures during the month. The Philibert was loaded with rice ; but hav- ing met with damage in the cyclone, the charter was said to havo been abandoned. Our dates from Foo-ehow-foo reach to 24th October. EXCHANGE ANO MONEY. On the exchange for this mail no alteration is to be made, the rate ruling last month (par) being fixed for the present month. Money is plentiful, the supply being moro than equal to the demand. The discount rates at all the hanks are steady at seven per cent, for ninety day bills, and eight per cent, tor bills having four months to run. Interest continues to be allowed on deposits lodged with seven' days' notice of withdrawal, attbnÃ®c per cent. ; four per cent, for three months, and six per cent, for six months' notice. WOOL. ,The sales of wool went off both in Mel- bourne and Geelong with considerable spirit until the mail's arrival, sinre which a decline of a halfpenny per pound had to be submitted to on good clips, whilo ordinary and inferior sorts have fallen one penny to three half- pence. The quantity disposed of embraces 11,051 bales, and latest quotations are: Greasy, 6Â¿d. to 12Jd. ; fleece, 14Ad. to23Â¿d. STOCK AND STATIONS. From Deniliquin (through the Pastoral Times) we learn that there have been some scorching days since our last. On Tuesday, the 10th, the thermometer was up to 148Â° in the sun ; the heat culminated on that evening. We had a storm of wind, and a little sprin- kling of rain now and again. The water is drying up fast ; the strong winds sweep away the dust, until the vast level plains look like huge seas, with rolling foam passing over them. Considerable quantities of wool are going down still. There is work for the dray- men for many months to come. The great bulk of the wool has been sent to Melbourne, the difficulties bavingbecnovorcomeatthe rail- way terminus, Echuca. The only sale of station piopertyrepoitcd during the month is that of the Brocklesby Station, New South Wales, together with 11,500 sheep, 30 cattle, 8 horses, and 1,020 acres purchased land, to Messrs. Anderson and King, for Â£9,747 sterling. Terms-One-third cash ; balance at one and two years, with eight per cent, interest added. INCREASE OF WOOL. As a proof of the increase in the production of wool this season in Riverina, we learn that about ten days ago the returns showed that 10,000 bales more had arrived in Echuca than the total returns for the whole of the previous season. Tho estimated value of the wool re- ceived up to the date referred to amounted to about a quarter of a million. OUR SURPLUS STOCK/ The question of the best means of dis- posing of the surplus horse stock is attract- ing great attention now in Riverina, and the answer seems to be, as in the case of sheep and cattle, "boil them down." Tho Tumut' Times says : --"Now, when horses are almost unsaleable and when sold from the pounds realise ridiculous rates, from Od. upwards, it may .he satisfactory to their owners to hear that there is a prospect of their soon possess- ing a proper commercial valuo. One of our enterprising breeders on the Murrumbidgee, in the neighbourhood of Gundagai, last week experimentalised upon a fat but otherwise useless horse, as to the profit of boiling-down, After the process had been carefully carried I out, he realised lifteen gallons of pure oil, that he readily sold at the first offer in Gun- dagai, for currying purposes, at Cs, Gd, To this is to be added the price of the hide, the value of the hair, the glue from the hoofs, \ and the bones fcrmanure-all of which would be realised if the process was carried out iu a .large and systematic manner." , MEAT PRESERVING. A number of gentlemen met at the Oriontal Rice-mills, Flinders-street, a few duys ago for the purpose of witnessing Mr. S. s! Ritchie's process of preserving meat, and also to form an opinion as to the quality of the article itself. Samples of beef and mutton which were prepared some time ago were produced, and, having been tasted, were found to be in excellent condition, having lost none of their flavour or tenderness. All present agreed that the process, simple and inexpensive as it is, has, judging from tho results which havo already been witnessed, proved itself to be a highly successful one. GOVERNMENT LITIGATION. The Customs duties litigation of 18Ã5 has popped up again in the Supieme Court, on the argument of demurrers in the coses of The Queen Â». Bowman and Henty v. The Queen. Both coses arise out of a claim by the Crown for tea duties, on the scale of the full duties imposed by law before the passing of the new tariff. In the first action the Queen sues for Â£1,500 of duties. The de- fendant Bowman pleads that he awed this amount jointly with Uiown and Reid for duties on tea, at the full rate of Â¡3d. ia the lb. ; that the Assembly passed a resolu- tion lowering the duties ; that theieupon tho teas in respect of which the full duties are now claimed of Bowman were entered for home consumption at tho lowered duty, and bonds given by Blown for payment of tho full duties if the resolution of the Assembly should not be confirmed by Act of Parliament; and that the resolution was not so confirmed. As Brown's bond has become comparatively worthless, the Crown seeks to fix Bowman on his original liability to the duties. He,' in his turn, contends that he was discharged by the Crown's acceptance of the bond of Browrr alone. In the other case, the petitioner Henty sues as trasteo of the estate oÂ£ Brown and Reid. The Couit reseived its judgment, but has since given its decision in favour of the Crown. CUSTOMS REVENUE. The Customs revenue for October and November exhibits a lamentable falling off, as compaicd with any of the previous months of the year. For the nine months ending with September the average monthly receipts were Â£121,000 ; for the last two months they have not exceeded Â£00,000. This is doubtless due to the collection of so large an amount of duty on spirits towards the end of Sep- tember. The deficiency in the Customs re- venue can now be stateel almost with preci- sion. The nine months ending September yielded Â£1,089,000 ; October and November, Â£180,000 ; December may return Â£101,001), although it is scarcely probable it will afford so much. Thus the revenue foi the year will be just about Â£1,370,000. As Mr. Verdon reckoned on obtaining Â£1,532,000, it is toler- ably certain that his deficiency on Customs alone will amount to Â£102,000, or Â£117,000 moie than he was willing to jilead guilty to in July last. PROTECTION FALLACIES. The protectionist millennium ought to be vciy near. Thus far the exports of 1807 have exceeded tho imports. We have sent out more than we have received ; we have parted with goods which we value at Â£10,189,000, and in return we have obtained others which we value at Â£9,975,000. Thus, according to Mr. .1 enner and his friends, the colony is being enriched, and by a perpetual Ã®epetition of this process of giving more for less, will soon become excessively wealthy. Surely, if the protectionists be not false piophets, weare on the high load to fortune. VICTOMAN I.ETTEK-W KITING.

AUbTRALIAX ALLIANCE INSURANCE COMPANY. An extraordinary general meeting of the Australian Alliance Assurance Company has been held, to get the assent of the share- holders to the formation of a life reserve fund, in accoi dance with the act of incor- poration. A resolution mo\cd by Air. Mac- mahon and seconded by Dr. Wilkie, was unanimously passed, as follows :-" That the necessary sum be now set apart, out of the receipts of the life assuianco branch of the company's business, to form, with tho accumulations thereof, a life reserve fund, pursuont to the Act No. 305 ; and that the directors do invest the said fund in such securities and in such manner as they may think fit." It was explained, in the courso of a conversation which followed, that the amount which was to be now Bet apoit as the nucleus of a reserve lund had been asceitained by the actuary, and that the sum was considered amply sufficient to meet any deterioration in the lives assured by tho company. In reply to one or two questions, the chairman desired tho shareholders to undeistand that this was by no means the entire reserve fund of the company-it was only the nucleus of a reserve fund for the life branch, tv Inch could not be touched by losses which might be sustained in any other branch of the business. IMPORTS AND EXPOMS. The value of the imports during the woek ending 21st inst. amounted to Â£289,121.

Tho Argus Office, Thursday Evening. Tlio week succeeding the departuro ef the Novem- ber mall was, in consequence of II.Il.II. Prineo Alfred's arrival, completely dovotcd to holiday making and pleasuro-sccklng, but this was moro than atoned for in tlio impetus that was imparted to tho market, and tlio improved tone which subsequently pervaded business in all Its brandies. Bulk ales havo not becÂ» much noticed. In bagging, comsacks and woolpacks have been neglected, but gunn) bag-" li ivo had moro attention. Candiel havo fluctuated const derabl), advincing ljd. per lb., and then leccdlng Id. Cements havo not been brisk. Fish mid fmils lim o | impioud in value.

A -vcry ordinary trade has beor, done in metals. In oils, speculative purchases in korosono to a \crj large extent have been recorded. Provisions have bcon moro dealt in. Quicksilver has also been cleared off llic inarkot by speculators, llicu lias not altered much, prices being too high to admit ot their going up much further. Salt lins declined in vniuo.

Brandies huvo beon e vtonslv ely Â»uruiaM.il on spÃ©culation, without, however, atieitlng priceÂ«. Ale and Stout.-There has boon llttlo business doing throughout tlio month in bulk ales, for though stocks of most of the favourite brands have been Â»Oil um doun, the demand generally has been too limited to allow that circunistatico to have much effect upon prices, the benson now at a closo having hitherto been enid and wintry, liana's No. 4 ale hua been soiling lu trade pareils at Â£S 6s., and an attempt was lately madu lo establish highor rates. There is, huÂ« ever, not much probability of succeeding In this. About tho middle of the month somo ISO hilda, and barrÃ³la in faulty condition were cleared oil at low prices. Quotations, however, of sound havo ruled at Â£Ã¼ 6s. for Ã®io. 4, whllo No. 3, of willoh there liat> been llttlo in tho market, has bcon quoted Â£710s.

Bottled ales of favourito brands have met with a freo inquiry, more especially Tennant'Â«, which is eagerly Â«ought after, and ahlp ments as they como f orw ard are al once picked up by the trado; upwards of 2,000 cuses have this inunili been disposed of ut 10s., without satisfylug tlio de- mand.

Hill prices hav o hitherto been obtained for tlio fen par eels disposed of, though of late symptoms of an easier tendency hovo not been wanting. Woolpacks do not command tlio slightest notico ; small lots of Dundees have bein placeo at 3s. 10d., while 3s. Gd. was this Â« etk accepted for a line of Calcutta*. Inquiries for gunny bags suddenly sprang up about tinco weeks u^o, which led to tlio disposal of somo 300 bales at 7.s.

In the beginning of tho month tho prico ruled nt lid. for Palmalmal and ll',d. for Brandon's. In the week enduite Dili hist, au impetus was im- parted to this article by the discovery that stocks in hand had become almost exhausted, and this caused usudden movement, which led to the disposal of somo 3,000 bo\cs on tlio spot, and about Ã.600 cuses to airlvo, at pilcos rising to lHd. for bost brands.

At no period did tlio market possess an appearance of strength while at this ligure, and after tlie mail was telegraphed advising l63 tons for the month's shipment, prices at once receded, closing this week at llÂ¿d. for sound Pal matines, 12d. to 12Iel. for Brandon's, and l'-.Jd. foi the Reva Company's. Sales for the month have amounted to nliout 12,000 boxes.
