FSTABUSHED 187L ! AGENTS WANTED. Good income and penna jneist employment offered to Gentlemen of good address ?who have the necessary energy and ability. References as to character are indispensable. There aUo esiat Vacanciea for several LAD* CANVASSERS to solicit proposals under the New Children's Endowment Table, particulars of which are given below, in addition to tha many liberal and popular features of this Society, which are so well known as to hardly require recapitulation, but from amoDgst which may be mentioned— THE EXTRA LARGE RESERVE3 AGAINST LIA BILITIES, THB MODERATE PREMIUMS. THE UNCONDITIONAL POLICIES, and the liberal and equitable manner In which Policy-holders are dealt with, the WIDOWS' FUND SOCIETY is now issuing Policies under specially attractive tables, which have been the means of bringing the benefits of Life Assurance to many persons who could not previously be induced to seriously con sider the subject. One that baa already become very popular is 'Ibe Return Premium Plan.' Premiums are payable for twenty years only, policy being then 'PAID UP.' In the event of Death occurring during the first twenty yeais the Society GUARANTEES Pajment, NOT ONLY OF THE SUM ASSURED, but also of an addition EQUAL TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF PREMIUMS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID. The New CHILDREN'S ENDOWMENT POLICY supplies a convenient means of providing Funds for a UNIVERSITY EDUCATION, ABTICLB FEES, SETTING UP a SON IN BUSINESS, or a MAR RIAGE PORTION FOR a DAUGHTER, and although it is quite new, and has not been specially pushed or advertise d. it is being largely availed of. The leading feature of this Table is that if the parent or guardian who effects the Endowment should die 6efT the date whsn the mon«y becomes payable, tbe Policy becomes 'paid up,' and no further premiums require to be paid. Thus, if a father (aged 30) desires to provide a fund of £100 for his son (agedl), payable on his attaining 21 years of age, be can do bo by taking oat a Policy under this Table at an annual cost of £3 18a. 8d. If the father Should die AT ANY TIME after oayment of iBVEN ONE ANNUAL PREMIUM,. the full pro vision for Ma child (WITH PROFITS) will be abso lutely secured without any further payment of premiums; while if tbe child should die before attaining the specified age the Society un4er ?abes to return the total amount of .premiums that have been paid.
