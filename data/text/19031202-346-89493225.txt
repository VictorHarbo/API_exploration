In regard to the Immigration Restriction Act, the color line was not laid, down at all, as even an un desirable Londoner could be excluded under it. The Sugar Bounties Act, which would cease at the end of 1G06, provided ior an ex cise duty of '.£3 per ton 011 black-grown sugar and .£1 on white-grown, and already the ex cise receipts showed that white labor dis placing black labor. (Applause.) To-day the 10 millions of descendants ot the original slaves furnished a great problem in America, as* the blacks—some of whom were qui e white—wanted the same powers as the domi nant race. If these rights were not conced ed one of the bloodiest racial wars the world had even seen would be witnessed, and there would be either extermination of the blacks or a separate territory would have to be al lotted them. Therefore, there should be no departure from a white Australia. (Hear, hear.) He had assisted to pass the clause m the Post and Telegraph Act providing. £or the exclusion of the colored mart from the snb-; Bidisetl mail boats trading' to Australia. The, ;British navy was recruited from the f mer chant scrvice, uiit if war broke out to-morro\Y< with one .or two of the large powers;! and .50.000 or?'60,000 men were required for-fhc! navy, there would be great difficulty in ob-; tainiligthem. In the 15 years ending 1900 43,000 additional hands were employed in ithe; mexcliant service. Of this number 19,COO.were colored aliens; 12,000 white, aliens, and only; •12,000. "bo'ys i of the bulldog breed." ■-(Ap-; plause.) There wore' 38,C00 -colored -aliens; .and/40,000. white aliens- iiv the' service,: and; th.esc constituted a menace to the empire; as. they, had no fighting sympathy with Groat Britain,.; and ■ would .'desert, her in time ot; need.; Oncc England lost control of the seas^ she. would be starved out ill six months with out: a sliofc:being ;fired.' Thirty out of every 100 men in; the merchant service were aliens,: and how could the mercantile marine' be' de-. pended.on under such conditions? i 'Ger iiian ship carried German subjects only, and; •it was the same with the Japanese navy.' ' ; A. Voice : It's;all a. question of money: '•■■■: ' : _ Mr. Styles : Then the shipowners should, receive such concessions as to enable them to. pay the men proper, wages. He believed this, was the case in Germany. (Hear, hear.) Hp; desired to: say a word with regard to Mr.- Or H. Ik-id . \ A Yoice: He was the: only maiv Bendi„'0. listened to. .... . _ . '' \ Mr. Styles:: Bendigo was listening to him', very \v-ell that .evening. Mr. Itcid, in 18S5,. had fiveil his support at a conference to the exclusion of, colored labor, from the mail; boats, but now he was prepared to remove; the; clause, if .lie could, but lie (the speaker), hoped lie would never get the:chahce.' (Ap plause.)., If the National .Parliament had done nothing else but secure a white Aus-. traiia and purify the mail boats, lie would gladly have paid; his share of the 3/9 or'4/ per head Federation had cost the people; In regard to the tariff,; he was against re-open ing , it, and ,lie fervently hoped Mr. • Keidj would not get the chance to do so. If.he did; lie ,would so alter the incidence of taxation, .that. large numbers .of goods now manufalc-' tiircd in Australia would be made in other countries, and many Australians would be thrown out of employment. A Yoice: That's* right. . Mr. Styles: He was in favor of preferential trade. : He thought that, broadly speaking. Australia should. retain its present tariff against England, and increase it against the foreigner, i and; that England should meet iis half- way. Mr. Reicl.had plaintively; asserted that while the grand..old mother country bought our butter, .we refused, to hiuy 'iior trousers. (Laughter.) He difl not , say she also bought Danish butter, and gave 10/ more per, cwt. for it.. Danish butter had to be carried 8C0 or 1000 miles, while we had to send ours 12,000. In.rcgard to wheat, France sent, her grain a few hundredmiles to: Eng land, ancl the Argentina could land it at id per bushel, while it cost 11s 8d. Mr; Cham berlain proposed to put a duty-011 the foreign article in favor of Australia. . (Applause.) He had strenuously opposed the formation of < a High Co.urt. as he did not believe in saddl ing the Commonwealth: with an unnecessary expense of 'at. least £35,000,,per.year; 11 nTHie High..Court had .up to the present dealt with a dispute over a. twopenny stamp,-aiid now the judges were, travelling.. around ., dining with tlie various Governors. . (Laughter.) He opposed the transcontinental railway, which was. really a State railway, wanted-only by West Australia, The Federal capital was another wild, cat, and thc.people; had the; Senate to thank for preventing the selection: of a site. The capital would increase neither; the wealth- nor the population of the Com-! moi wealth. For a few buildings alone the estimated cost fwas £2,117.GOT. How much bettor would it be to spend the money 0111 the. conservation of water instead of build-; ing a city in.the y.aeJc blocks: and a railway; through a.desert? (Loud applause.) Ho was; .opposed, to. any further, borrowing for years.; (Hear, hoar.) If -lie was elected, he would; set, his,lace against both the schemes-, allud-: ed to. , lie ,was prepared to - support a pro- | per scheme,.of water, supply, and in: conclu-;; sion; he offered his respectful assurance. that: if elected he would, do nothing tlmt .jvoiild;; cause the blush of.shainc to rise.to the cheeJkii; of ..life ;most sensitive . supporters- ■ (Ap-1 plause.) . . .. ;• - . _ / r: , In. reply, to a" question, Mr.1 Style? said.lie ,jyas.. in. .favor of a, Compulsory-Conciliation 'and.'Arbitration. -Bill.
