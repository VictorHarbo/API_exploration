COMMERCIAL. — ?» WEEKLY EPITOME. Advertiser and Chronicle Offices, Friday evening, Januarr 1L The week has been very quiet, and merchants have been holding back in expectation of the mail, which arrived very punctually on Thursday morning. The arrival of the English mail was eagerly anticipated by parties interested in the bread stuffs trade, and as the advices speak of higher Rites and continued firmness in the market, we may fairly calculate upon a good trade. \V'e most earnestly advise farmers to send a portion of their wheat to market, as by selling part of their crop at is., they will secure good prices for the remainder. If this course is not pursued wo snau lose me export traae, and prices will tall rapidly as the season advances. The difficulty is to get money for purchases, and this difficulty has been magnified by false reports about the Banks. It has been rumored that a meeting of all the Bank Managers has been held, at which it was determined to make no advances whatever upon shipments of wheat for England, but we can give the statement a flat contradiction. The only transactions of any consequence in the share market have been in Lyndoch Valley, Paramatta, Euko, and Adelaide Banks, and Poona. Paramatta, 32s. to 36s. ; Euko, 35s. to 39s. ; Poona, 20s. ; Lyndoch Valley, £3 2s. Gd. to £3 12s. 6d. ; Adelaide Bank, £3.

Stock Market. -The following is Dean, Laughton. & Co.'s fortnightly stock market report, dated Adelaide, January 3, 1867. — Fat Cattle— Supplies have been moderate, and chiefly of fair and good qualities. Owing to the holidays business lias been slack, though still equal to the light supplies brought f.-rward, which met ready sale at fully Lite prices. Stocks in the hands of the trade are light, both in town and in the country, and unless some extraordinary supplies como to hand, prices must rule high in this market. We have sold 95 head c-ittle, middling to good, from Mcniudie, at £'S 5s. Gd. ; 95 do. do., good quality, for Mr. C. B. Fisher, £10 Cs. (jtl. ; 11 do. do., middling to good, heavy weights, £10 14s. -id. ; 15 do. do., at £7 9s. Quotations : —Prime bullocks, £10 to £12 10s. ? second do., £7 to £9 10s. ; inferior do., £5 to £-5I0s. ; best cows, £S to £9 15s. ; second do., £5 10s. to £7. Fat Sheep — Supplies were not so heavy a? of late ; we have, bow ever, no improvement to report in the quality of those brought forward, which wore generally of an inferior description. These are only in demand at low prices, and from the fact of there being no prime sheep in. We quote prices Is. a head lower this fortnight :— Best wethers, lls. 6d. to 13s. ; second do., 10s to Us. Wo have sold 1.901 at quotitions. Fat Lambs still arrive in good supply, though we notice a falling olf in the quality of those brought for ward : — Best lambs sell at 8s. ; others, 7s. to 7s. Cd. Fat Calves are in good demand, very f.-w are, however, offering. Store Cattle. — There is considerable demand for good sound cittle suitable for fattening ; there are but very few, however, offering. Horses. — This market lias been completely bare during the last fortnight, and we hear of but few mobs to arriv-e within the next week or two ; tins, together witu the lower prices of fodder, will, we anticipate, have a favorable effect on prices. Fanning horses, of a good stamp, un broken, sell best, and arc in good demand. Store Sheep — The demand for all kinds of store sheep is still very limited. We have sold 1,600 mixed lambs at Cs. Gd. ; 1,880 aged ewes, lambs at foot. Stations— Nothing doing. Latest Melbourne Quotations -Best bullocks, £7 to £9 ; middling and inferior do., £4 l()s. to £7 10s. ; best cows, £*'. 10s. to £7 10s. ; middling and inferior do., £4 to £--; prime wethers, shorn, lls.

Hunt reports that the labor market opened this wenk in a very dull way. but towards the end it has im proved to a moderate extent. XumViers of able-bodied agricultural laborers, shepherds (married and single), and other hands are daily in attendance in search of work, which they are willing to accept at the reduced rates of wages (owing to the small prices obtainable for pro duce) now prevailing. Mr. Morcom says— The labor market this weal: continues hrisk- -«rgml people having been hired for farms, sheep stations, kitchen-gardens, &c.; A few of the immigrants per Canterbury are open for engage ment.
