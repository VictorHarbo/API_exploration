MOXVAY, DEcminim 31, son. In a letter published to day, Mr EDWARD PHI SI ORD, of New South Wales, discusses in a dispassionate and thoughtful tone the problem of Asiatic immigration Even those who may dissent from his conclusions, in YYIIOIO or in part, must admit that a distinct service is rendered by public writers who from time to time to open questions of this kind, which are of high importance to Australia, in which are apt to receive far too little attention at the hands of politician t ,_ So far the policy of Australia upon this matter has been quite in the c p treme It has consisted of little more than giving legislative effect in the toughest and in list Y ty to an easily aroused popular sentiment The colonising of this continent and Us ton version into a kind of British over seas has been accomplished by such a smooth and rapid process that the points of radical difference between the conditions of the DCYY Saturn and the a of the old Britain have been imperfect!) recognised England is in the heart of the Western World, and conducts her relations with Asia as with a remote country of the Far East that the Britons YVIIO have peopled Australia have settled in a spot where they have the Iteming populations of Asiatic countries as their near north hours And the satisfactory adjustment of international relationship between neighbours is a matter demanding prudent and delicate statesmanship Up to the pi i sent no one will contend that anything of the kind has been bestowed upon the question Australians have dimly perceived that some attitude 01 other must be adopted towards Asia, and they havoadoptedtho attitude who h first suggested itself, and which succeeded best with old world ideas and prejudices 'They have simply said, "Yo " will have nothing to do with you " You are there, we know-a vast con- tinent peopled by ancient races in " various stages of Eastern and Western " civilisation But we prefer to close " our eyes to your proximity as long as " possible " it

he shows from the census tables of 1861 and 1861 that there were 2,000 Lower Chinese in the seven Australasian colonies in the latter year than in the former This demonstrates that the Chinese invasion score of 1888 was one of those easily fomented agitations which have more imagination than fad behind them It also proves the tendency of the present ( Chinese population in Ausli crisis to become stationary, most of those who represent the excess of departures over arrivals in New South Wales having evidently not returned to their native land but gained admission to other colonies The main point to be considered, however, is that the Asiatic immigration question is likely now to assume a Yvidoi significance) than it has hitherto borne impending changes in the balance of power in the East, combined with the growth of Australia, and its urgent need for trade expansion, will compel us shortly to consider the problem anew in all its phases What principles are to sway our future

careful consideration Meanwhile Australians cannot too quickly disabuse the minds of the impression that the crude and ill thought out methods which have hitherto solved with China will do for iiidistinmtialo application whenever any question as to our relationships with Asiatic races comes upon the tar not We are so situate that the task of thinking out and pursuing a "wise foreign policy is thrust upon us just as much as it is upon England or any other European nation Although Great Britain is an island at the head of an Oriental empire, it is impossible for her to ignore the geographical situation which makes her put of the European system She can Lyne means cut herself adrift from European entanglements and from the necessity of prudently and watchfully icDulating her relations with the Western powers Just as little can Australia evade the responsibility entailed upon her by her position in the Pacific A certain section of colonists are given to complaining that the swaddling clothes of infancy still encumber Australia They contend impatiently for still greater independence and freedom of action If that be the deane, Australians cannot better prove that they are full grown than by grappling in a far seeing, states manlike manner with the problems confronting them in what is the "fal " East " to others but the " near East " to us If we are to enter into
