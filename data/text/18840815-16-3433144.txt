It Is situated about midway between llundn berg mid tlie Ben, being so noar the Jailor as to sccuro an equable elimata tho yoar round, and thus almost entirely ESCAPING THE TAINT OF FROST. Having a frontngo (doep water) to the Burnett Uiver of over 00J chains, and part of the northern boundary boing formod by a tidal creole, it has unusual fucllillo« for shipping sugar and other produce Out of the total area ubout 000 acron aro FIRST-CLASS AGRICULTURAL (COO being scrub land and 350 forest).
