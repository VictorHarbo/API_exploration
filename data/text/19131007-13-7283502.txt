Rupture Specialist, and Sola Controller of Dr. J. A. Sherman's Method of Treat- ment, will CLOSE his Present Visit to Melbourne, A sixth case, for the- headquarters, Samson's Buildings, Dowling street, Dunedin, New Zealand. I respective patients should understand, therefore, that the time is extremely limited during which I ney can avail themselves of this, the only scientific method of dealing with their malady. . ' In for to leaving Melbourne, Mr. Murray is pleased of tender his thanks to scores of patients who have gratefully acknowledged the benefits, both mental and physical, they have derived from the treatment. Such neknoii'ledgtnonts are not only encouraging to himself, but are invaluable In creating confidence in others, who would otherwise hesitate ill submitting to treatment. Sufferers will please bear in mind that, on account of the pressing calls from sufferers elsewhere, Mr. Mart In- cannot possibly extend the time of his stay here.
