VITAL STATISTICS. ANNUAL REPORT OF GOVERNMENT STATISTICIAN. SOME INTERESTING FIGURES. The report of the Government Statistician (dIr. Malcolm A. C. Fraser) on the popula tion and vital statistics of Western Australia for the year ended December 31 was issued yesterday. Following are some extracts from Mr. Fraser's remarks. (Througholut the report "rate" means rate per 1,000 of the mean population for the year. The "nor mal" referred to, unless otherwise stated, ;s the average for the previous ten years. Figures in parentheses, unless otherwise specified, relate to the previous year): 'The leading feature of the vital statis tics of the State for 1911 is the gain by ml gration of 12,130 persons as compared with 6,655 during 1910. When taking this into 'account, however, it must be remembered that during the period under review the immigrants introduced under Government auspices numbered 9,562, consisting of 4,709 adult males, 2,828 Ifemales, and 1,021 male and 1,004 female children. The birth, death, and marriage records also show in creases both in number and in the rate per 1,000 persons. The increase in the death rate is, fortunately, rather less pronounced than those for births and marriages. Births. "Births during the year numbered 8,095 (7,585), consisting of 4,125 (3,858) males and 6,910 (3,7l7) females. 'Ihe crude birth rate, that is, the number of births per 1,000 per sons in the mean population, was 28.25 (27.99). This is a tair increase upon the rate tor 1910, but is less than the average for the previous 10 years, 30.00. The crude birth rate is, however, a very inefficient measure of the fertility of a community, especially of one so abnormally constituted as that of W.A., and is only useful when no other is available. A much better method of throwing light on the subject is to com pare the number of legitimate births with the number of married women at the usually recognised reproductive ages, namely, 15 to 50, and the number of illegiti mate births with the number of unmarried women at similar ages. It is, of course, only possible to do this accurately when the data required have been ascertained by a census, and, unfortunately, that only hap pens, at present, once in every ten years; it is to be earnestly hoped, however, that the taking of an intermediate census will very shortly be arranged by the Common wealth authorities. Three cases of triplets oc curred during 1911. Twin births numbered 115 (88). Births in public institutions were 132 (96), a considerable increase on the pre vious year's figures. Illegitimate births num bered 363 (313), also showing a large .n crease. Deaths. "The total number of deaths was 2,924 (2,744), consisting of 1,923 (1,764) males and 1,001 (980) females. The death rate, 10.20. was slightly higher than that for 1910, 10.12. The following table shows what variations have taken place in the mortality of West ern Australia from 1891 to 1910. The mean population has been divided according to sex, and in several divisions according to age: Mean Population. 1891\. 1901. 1911.

On the whole, there has been a considerable reduction in the genera, death rate; the reduction being most marsi ed in the rate for infants under one year. "Itates for females, were much lighter than those for males. This fact is most strongly in evidence at infancy and matur ity. Another remarkable feature is the low ness of the death rates of children aged from 5 to 15, which is, undoubtedly, ithe most satisfactory period of life. "Infantile Mortality.-Deaths under one year of age during 1911 numbered 617 (592), 371 (331) males and 246 (261) females. The percentage of infantile deaths to births was 7.62, showing a slight decrease from the per centage for 1910, viz., 7.80, and a consider able decrease from the 'normal,' 10.61. There was, in former years, a very high in fantile mortality prevailing in Western Aus tralia, but the rate for the past year is much the same as that in the Eastern States, between which and this State comparisons unfavourable to the latter have frequently been drawn. It is generally agreed, how ever, that much may still be done towards preservation of infantile life, and that the lives of many infants might, in future. be saved, whose deaths are now brought about by preventable causes, more especially diarrhoea. Thea proportion of infantile deaths to total deaths was 21.10. The high. est and previous lowest figures recorded dur ing the previous 10 years were 33.93 in 1903 and 21157 in 1910. Deaths under five years. compared with total deaths, showed a per centage of 28.69 to a decennial mean of 55.30. with a decennial mean of 51.10; and for deaths over 65 the percentage was 15.63, as against the decennial mean, 12.57. "Deaths in Public Institutions.-Of the total deaths 941 (885). 693 (662) males and 248 (223) females, occurred in public institu. tions, the principal of which are situated 'n the metropolitan area, and consequently have a detrimental effect upon its death rate. The percentage to total deaths was 32.18 (32.25), the 'normal' being 26.12. This was the second highest ever recorded, the highest being 32.25 in 1910, whilst the low est, 21.19, occuhred in 1904. This increase, however, is probably an index of the result of the better provision now made for the care and comfort of the aged and dying. "Causes of Deaths.-As regards the princi pal causes of death, the following diseases show a decrease in the rate per 1,000, as compared with the normal:-Typhoid, 0.16; phthisis, 0.09: other tubercular diseases, 0.02; diphtheria, 0.07; bronchitis, 0.07; and whooping cough, 0.07. Increases are shown in the cases of influenza, 0.02; pneumonia, 0.02; cancer 0.10: and measules, 0.02. Of the worst infectious diseases, the number of cases reported and number of deaths were: Typhoid, 691 cases. 84 deaths: phthisis. 259 cases, 190 deaths: diptheria, 764 cases, 36 deaths; and scarlet fever, 199 cases, no deaths. "Deaths in Seasons.-Apparently the quar ter ending June 30 has again borne out its reputation of being the most fatal, whilst the March quarter has proved itself the healthiest, the number of deaths occurring in those quarters being 768 and 705 respec tively. This is still more evident in the in fantile mortality, the percentage of deaths under one year to total deaths being 23.70 in the June quarter and 17.68 in the Sep tember auarter. Takine the average num ber of deaths per month for the last ten years. May has the heaviest mortality, 277, and September has the lightest. 204. Typhoid.-From November to May was the worst neriod for typhoid. The heaviest mortality occurred in January and the light est in September. The majority of cases occurred between the ages of 6 and 40. and the mortality was considerahly heavier amongst males than amongst females. Th;s is naturally, however, only to be exnected, on account of the rougher manner of living to which so many men are exposed. "Diphtheria.-Mest ca'es occurred from November tn June: Mr. showed the greater number, and December the least. ".Co,!ret fever was most prevalent in Anril. "Phthisis.-The number of deaths from nhthisis was 190. as compared with 195 in 1010\. 18R in 1909. 193 in 1908. and 206 n 1907\. Of these, 124 were males and 66 re males. The maiority of the fatal eases oc curred hetween the agses of 20 and 50. "Phthisis and cancer are the two diseases which should attract most attention, the former on account of the fact that it is to a large extent nreventable. and the latter on account of the mystery as vet cnrroundine its nature. and the fact that the rates of deaths caused by it are apparently consider ably increasing. This latter fact is attri buted hv some authorities to the hbetter diae-nosis and more complete certification of death now available. It is also possible that the increase may be due to the fact that cancer is a disease of more mature life. and that owing to the general improvement n medical and hvgienic science, a larger num ber of persons now survive to the are at which cancer is more prevalent. and ulti mately fall victims to this fell disease. In spite of the smallness of the figures ava:l able for use. some reliable deiM ctions mRe he drawn. For instance. for the ases 15 to 30 the death rate from phthisis is greater for females than for males, whereas, for the groups at the older ages, the female inortality is lighter. It is also noteworthy that a general improvement has occurred in every group, except the especially import ant one of males, aged 30 to 50. It is significant that for aces 15 to 50 the cancer death rates are greater for females than fo males, whilst for older ages the male rates are heavier. Marriages. "The total number of marriages was 2.421 (2,107). The rate. 8.45 (7.77) shows an in crease over that for 1910. but is still below the 'normal,' 8.61. The rate has almost consistently declined since 1902 until this year. when a slight increase is recorded. Migration. "The arrivals. 40.865 (31.208) exceeded the. departures, 28.735 (24,553) by 12.130 (6,655), the balance in favour ot the State being composed of 8,087 (4,720) males and 4.043 (1,935) females. This net gam was mainly composed of 12,482 Europeans, of whom 11.147 were of British birth, the rema:ndcr being chiefly made up of Austr,auts 441, Dan ish 60. Italia's 324. Russians 62. Dutch 22. Greeks 139, French 30, Swedish 43. Nor wegian 36, and Germans 135. The total Asiatic population of the State was decreas ed by 20, the Chinese and alaniuamen losing 25 and 22 tesepetively. There vwas a fairly large influx 'of Japanese, 272. 261 males. 11 females, as against 231, 213 males. 18 females, who left the State; whilst 190 Malays arrived and 185 departed. These two latter nationalities, however, are princi pally non-resident, being for the greater part employed on the North-West pearling fleet. During the period under review the Government introduced 9.562 immigrants, viz., 4.709 adult males, 2,828 adult females. 1,021 male children, and 1.004 female chil. dren. There was a continual inflow of per sons from oversea, the total for the year. 14.350, being 4,788 in excess of the imnmi grants introduced under Government aus pices. On the other hand. there was a considerable loss to the Eastern States during the latter half of the pyear. MEDICAL STATISTICS. Mr. Fraser quotes the following remarks by the Medical Officer to the Central Board of Health (Dr. Atkinson): "Having regard to the fact that in most parts of the State the rainfall during the year 1911 has been exceptionally low, one expects to see an increase in the mortality from infantile diarrhoea and enteritis. This disease has long been known to bear a m.-@ or less regular dependence upon tile amount of rainfall, being more prevalent in seasons of low rainfall. This year has been no ex ception to the rule, and we find quite a considerable increase in the number of deaths from enteritis. In spite of this, how ever, the infantile mortality is well below the normal, which fact we must refer to improved sanitation and probably in part also to increase of knowledge on the part. of the general public. of the cause and prevention of disease. Probably the most noticeable feature of the infectious disease notifications for the year is seen in the case of scarlet fever. Whilst in 1910 there were 572 cases of this disease tiotifird, in 1911 there were only 193. There were no deaths from the disease, which fact further supports the already accepted dictum that scarlet fever in this State is a very mill disease. The reason for this is difficult of explanation, but it would appear that cli matic conditions oppose the development of ans degree of virulence in the organism re sponsible for this disease. It remains to be seen whether the influx of immingran. from countries where the disease is a much more serious matter will introduce a more virulent germ, or servo as a more suitable soil for tic development of virulence. Cer tain it is that in the case of typhoid fever at any rate these newcomers stiffer to a far greater extent than those resident in the State for a longer time. "Diphtheria.-In the case of this disease we find the leath rate tise lowest for eight. years. and very considerably below last year. There can be no doubt that the prompt swabbing of schools on the first sign of an outbreak, and the immediate isolation of any carriers and contacts of the disease, is thi greatest factor in the suppression of this disease. 1 "Measles.-The death rate for this disease shows a considerable increase on the last two years and on the normal. Many cases have been bro-aght into the State by imni grants, an'd it is difficult to say how far these cases have influenced the character of the disease. "Typhoid Fever.-A noticeable feature of the figures for this disease is the fact that although there is a reduction of something like 25 per cent. in the number of notifi cations as compared with those of last year, yes the number of fatal cases has been considerably larger, so that whilst in 1910 there were 927 cases, with 50 deaths, during 1911 there were 691 cases and 84 deaths. This would point to a more virulent form of the disease occurring in 1911. At the, same time it must not be overlooked that many cases notified as typhoid fever rary in reality be a much milder disease, namely. Para-typhoid fever. This point has as yet been little investigated in this State. "Phthisis.-The notifications of this dis ease continue to show an increase; 1911 shows a 25 per cent. increase upon the noti fications of 1910. This apparent increase in the incidence of the disease does not represent a true increase, but is probably dun to the fact that medical men are he coming more promnpt and careful in the notification of the disease. As time goes on the stigma supposed to attach to this disease in the minds of the public and the question of breach of professional secrecy on the part of the medical man, will both lie put aside for the common good, and the disease will be notified with the same reait ness as other infectious diseases. "Pneumonia.-A colsiderable increase in the mortality from this disease has occurred during the year under review, anti side by side with it runs an increased mortality fromi influenza. It is probable that during per?ods of increased incidence and virulence of this latter disease. pneumonia is more readily contracted on account of the reduced vstaiit2 of the respiratory tract, which folons iin fluenza. During 1911 there was a muarked prevalence of an influenza-like coll in the State, and this in some cases was followed by a cerebro-sninal meningitis, which in quite a number of cases proved fatal. Bac t?fnto|;wmls nenminsti.in of several eases de omonstratcd the fact that catarrh of the re spiratory passages and the cerebro-spinal meningitis were so far related that. a similar organism was isolated in each case. "'Whooping cough, which in 1910 was re sponsible for 55 deaths, during 1911 only contributed 13. "Malaria.-With regard to this disease, although it is not endemic in this State at present, there is great doubt as to whether it can long be kept out. Six cases of ma laria, introduced from other countries, have been notified during 1911. Since also the malaria- carrying mosquito anopheles is to be found in this State, it would seem that ali the conditions necessary to make the disease endemic are to be found here. Cer tainly the Local Board of Health, under th direction of its chief inspector, SMr. Petherick, are doing splendid wsoik In the destruction of the mosquito, out sooner or later it seems inevitable that the disease must get a hold here as in the ease of Queensland. "Bilharzia Haematobia.-A case of th:s disease, in a man who contracted it in Africa, has been notified during the year. This is the first case that has been notified in this State, and the seriousness of it be comes apparent from the fact that two further cases have since been notified from the same district. Undoubtedly these latlr cases have become infected from the first, and the danger of this disease becoming endemic here appears considerable."
