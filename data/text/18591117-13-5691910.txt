SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. INTRODUCTION, "We avail ourselves of the departure of the Benares to resume our monthly summary of events in Victoria. The Malta, with the September mails from Europe, did not arrive in Hobson's Bay until the morning of the 13th inst. having been docked at the Mauritius, and thus delayed for five days. When the last mail for England quitted these waters, it was at the close of a General Election, which had resulted in the return of a large majority hostile to the O'Shanassy Administration In- dividually and collectively, the members of that Government had succeeded in ren- dering themselves odious to the country. Destitute of character and principle, it seemed to be their policy to court opprobrium, and to defy the censures of public opinion. The convocation of Parliament was deferred to the latest practical moment, but the postponement of the period at which the inevitable fall of the Ministry would occur merely! served to strengthen public hostility, .and to furnish additional proofs of the unwoithiness of those who were clinging with desperate tenacity to the reins of power. Parliament was opened on the 18th of October by His Excellency 'the Governor, with such spectacular ad- juncts as Imperial precedent "sug- gests, and our moderate resources can supply. The number of members of the Assembly had been increased from sixty to seventy-eight, elected by ballot, on the basis of manhood suffrage. The House thus constituted included about half-a-dozen "working men," two or three representatives whose candidature was regarded as a practical joke, and whose election is anything but credit-* able to the intelligence and discernment! of their constituents, and a, 'fair sprink-! liug of all classes of society.) the medi cal profession sending several members, including one advertising practitioner-, nearly ^related to the lessee of Drucy lane Théâtre. It was evident from tue first that the Ministry was doomed, the only ocoupants of the Trea- sury Benches being the Chief ^Se- cretary, four of his colleagues i,(lhe Attorney-General had twice failed to secure a seat), and two faithful followers. An amendment to the address in reply to the vice-regal speeeh was moved by Mr. Nicholson, well known to English politicians in connection with the ballot movement in the mother-country, and the terms of his amendment de- clared that the Administration did not possess the confidence of the House. The debate which ensued lasted four nights, and excited considerableinterestthrough out the colony. Some of the speeches delivered on the occasion were as much above, as others were far below, medio- crity, and if the discussion was once or twice rendel ed lidiculous by buffoonery, it was also illustrated by eloquence ; the most successful effort of oratory having been that of Mr. J. D. Wood, the pre- sent Attorney-General, and a native of Tasmania. Among the charges brought against the late Administration gene- rally, and the Chief Secretary more specifically, was that of having exhibited a culpable apathy in regard to the rescue of the sufferers from the wreck of the Admella. In order to defend him- self from those charges, or,rrather, for the ;purposo of weakening the credit given to the Messrs. Henty, -the owners of tjie Lady Biid steamer, ifor their promptitude and humanity in sending to the rescue of the survivors, Mr. O'shanassy "capped the climax" of audacity, and committed the orowning eu or of his Ministerial career. Ile in- timated ito the House that he'had cer- tain telegrams in his possession, bearing upon circumstances connected with this disaster, which he would produce if the House wished it. The Assembly signified its willingness to listen to any exculpation which ho could offer, ibut was plunged in a stupor of amazement by the production of several private messages of which the Chief Secretary had possessed himself, and now read sei iatim to the members. Not the least astonishing feature of the transaction was the evident unconsciousness, on the1 pait of Mr. O'shanassy, of tlio turpi-' tudo_ of his conduet j and when this ' conviction was subsequently foiced upon his mind Joy tho burst of indignation which so gross a violation of the scciecy and sanctity of the elcc tiio telegraph departnaent provoked, in this colony as well as in those ad- joining, the obliquity of Ms moral sense was such that he appeared io think the offence of which he had been guilty con- sisted not so much in the illegal pos- session as in the indiscreet publication of thoso documents. In order to palliate his misconduct, he alleged that the then Attornoy-Geneial had sanctioned theab «tiaetion of the telegrams, and, when presged more closely upon the subject, stated that tho sanction was verbally given. The Attorney General (Mr. Chapman, known to many English readers in connexion with the Canadian Rebellion), not being a member of the Assembly, was unable to confirm or to contradict the statement of his chief ; and as no contradiction has been since offered by that gentleman, it is presumed that he differs from the whole Bar in his interpretation of the Act whioh regulates the operation of the department referred to. It is }mt justice to add that the late Solicitor-General disavowed any participation in the opinion alleged to have been given by the First Law Officer of the Crown. Before dismissing this episode of the debate, we may mention that a public meeting was held, a short time after- wards, at the Mechanics' Institution in this city, for the purpose oft protesting against the unwarrantable conduct of the Chief Secretary, but the room was I packed with partisans and fellow countrymen of Mr. O'shanassy, acting, apparently, under the direction of a re- tired publican and City Councillor named Keeley, and the proceedings terminated in hideous uproar. A few days after- wards, however, the, Chamber of Com- merce met, and being free from the in- trusion of Irish rowdies, passed a series of resolutions strongly condemnatory of the Chief Secretary's tampering with» the electric telegraph, and demanding fuarantees of its inviolability for the uturo. > When the debato on the Address was brought to a close, the division-list ex- hibited the following result : For the amendment * . . 56 Against it....... 17 Majority against Ministers . 39 The minority included five members of the Government, eight new members of the House, and Mr. John Thomas Smith. As a matter 'of course, Mr. O'shanassy and his colleagues resigned, and His Exoellcnoy the Governor con- fided to Mr. Nicholson the 'task of forming a new Administration. This was a work -of some difficulty, owing to the composite character of the late Opposition, which embraced (1) what is known as the Constitutional party j (C2) the Convention mem- bers, about ten in number, hold- ing extreme opinions on the Land question, and asserting an influence and authority ludicrously disproportionate to thoir'real strength and legitimate status; and (3) Mr. Duffy (alienated from Mr. O'shanassy) and a small following. Mr. Nicholson is understood to have been anxious to construct a Ministry upon a j 'bread and inclusive "basis, and to havei been willing to malee it representative! of all sections on his side of the) Assembly, hoping, by a policy o'f( mutual concession, "to frame measures' ?which should command the support of all. With "this view, two seats were offered in élre<Cabinet to Mr. DuEy and a known ally. Mr. Duffy, however, claimed the nomination of three of'Ins colleagues, and as this preposterous pro- position could not be entertained/the negotiations in that quarter fell through. Two of the ablest of the Constitution- alists-Messrs.'Ebden and Michie-de- clined to j oin t the Administration, pre- ferring to give lit an independent sup- port ; and eventually the following list was submitted 'to the Governor, and re- ceived his approbation : - Chief Secretary . . Mr. Nicholson. Treasurer .... Mr. M'Culloch. Public Lands ... . Mr. Service. Public Works . . Mr. J. C. King. Post Office ... Mr. Bailey. Customs . . . Mr. Pyke. Attorney-General . Mr. J. D. Wood. Solicitor-General . Mr. Adamson. The last-named gentleman does not occupy a seat in the Assembly, and it is proposed 'to make the office neliolds non-political and permanent. Mt. Fel- lows, a member of the Upper House, will have a seat in the Cabinet without office ; and Messrs. Pyke, Bailey, and Wood (each representing a mining constituency) will charge themselves with 'the dutios which would belong to a Minister of Mines. The ,pc7'sonnel of the new Ministry, if not wholly unobjectionable, is a great im- provement upon-that of the last. "Mr. Nicholson combines a lengthened po- litical experience, 'business habits, and much homely sense, with practical aims, liberal -views, and 'honesty of purpose. Mr. M'Culloch is a member of the firm of Dennistoun Brothers, and creditably filled the office of Commissioner of Customs in a former Administra- tion. Mr. Service, as the first Chairman of tho first municipality erected out of Melbourno, evinced ani aptitude for public life, which his Par-; liainentarycareer has £ince improved,' but is somewhat deficient in mental dis- cipline, and more impulsive and im- petuous than might be .expected in a Scot. Mr. J. 0. King vwas formerly Town Clerk of Melbourne, and after- wards acted as the agent of the Cor- poration in London. Mr."Bailey is a new man, a journalist of abÜity, and of some promise as a debater. Mr. Pyke has distinguished himself in a former Parliament by intelligence andindustryj and Mr. J. D. Wood is unquestionably tho ablest, and icertainly not the least honest, member ef the Cabinet -, hasty, perhaps, in the adoption of principles, tut faithful to üiia convictions, and earnest and eloquent in their advocacy. As> Mr. Adamson will not figure upon the Parliamentary arena, it is not neces- sary to discuss his mea'its. Opposition was offeced to the re-elec- tion of Messrs. Nicholeon, Pyke, J". C. King, and M'Culloch ; but it was only ' in the case of tho last-najacd gentleman that the Opposition assumed anything like a serious character. The other members of the Cabinet just men- tioned were again returned by very large majorities. One of the first acts of the new Government, immediately after its accession to office, was to pro- mulgate a frank and explicit exposition of its future policy, and more particularly with regard to the Land question. This thoy propose to deal with as follows : 1\. As the squatting leases will ter- minate in 1861, this branch of the ques- tion will be remitted for consideration, in the interval, to a Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly, which will take evidence and report thereon. 2, The auotion system of disposing of the Crown lands is to be abandoned, ex copt in bo far as town lands, and others which heve acquired a special value, aro concerned. i 3\. Large areas of the beat agrioul-1 tural land, in all parts of the country, j are to be immediately surveyed and) made available for selection, at one pound per acre. - ¡ _ 4. Persons seleoting any quantity not exceeding 820 acres will be allowed to rent a contiguous block of three times the purohased area, with a pre-emptive right, under certain conditions, within a given number of years. 5\. A "penal tax" to be imposed upon alienated lands unimproved, so as to discourage speculative purchases. ( 6\. Commonages to be reserved both for agricultural settlers and miners. j The Land Bill thus outlined, while it is far more liberal, as well as more intelligible, than the vague measure shadowed out by the late Administration, makes as large concessions to the views of the Convention party as moderate men would desire or the country would ap Ílrove. Very general 'surprise, there biro, was felt and expressed when it was announced that Mr. "Wilson Gray, the parent and champion of that body, in- tended to contest the representation of East Melbourne; upon Convention prin- ciples, against Mfc M'Culloch, the '»ew Treasurer; and public satisfaction was not less generail when this factious oppo- sition was signally defeated by the re- election of Mr. M'Culloch by a majority of 350 over 'the Convention candidate, -tho numbers being 1,273 and 923 respectively. < The short Parliamentary Tecess ne- cessitates hy the return of the members of the Administration to their con- stituents, will terminate cn the 29th inst., when the new Government 'Will commence its duties, strong in popular favour and in the support of ' the Press throughout the whole -colony. All classes are disgusted with 'the selfishness and weary of the factiousness which characterised the late Cabinet. All classes are anxious Tor the settlement of the land question, and for the removal of that great obstacle to .practical legislation of othor kinds. Agitators who subsist upon popular .grievances, and to whom the »rivation .of a good "cry" is equivalent'to politi- cal destitution, will be loth to witness a settlement of this much-vexed question j but we have at length a reasonable pros- pect of this desirable event; and in view of this propitious circumstance we may renew our invitation to the indus- trious, the persevering, and the en- terprising, \vho may 'be earning a scanty livelihood in 'the old country, to come and cast in their lot with the colonists of Victoria, well assured that, in spite of the misrepresentations of the prejudiced, "flic discontent expressed by the indolent, and the 'indigence exhi- bited by the intemperate, strenuous labour will always meet with a liberal reward, enterprise be 'enabled to dis- cover an unoccupied field, and practical ability a successful career, in this young, promising, ®nd prosperous country. THE GOLDFIELDS. An abundant supply of »twator once again from (he heavy rains of two weeks since has imparted renowod life trad aetivitytto tho minors for a timo, and has enabled theni to realise an amount of gold large -in the aggregate, and which ought to toll on the escorts for some weeks to como. At the commencement .and during tho con-, tinuance of every summertho fact that the want of wator is ono of tho greatest hindrances and j difficulties the miner has to contend with is forced I on the attention of Mi, and this is deemed sufficient to acoount for and decrease in the yield; but «till it waa only too manifest I during the winter and spring months, while water! comparatively plentiful, that tha yield of¡ gold is falling off, and from somothing more than I a tomporary cause. It mas long hoped that the oxport for the year mould at least equal that of last; but of this wo have now no prospect. The deficiency will not be alarmingly great, still until the turning-paint has boen passed, and the chango is in tho right ¡direction- upwards, npt downward-full «confidenoe in the greatest of our resources cannotlio restored. Tho investment of moro capital, and the large accessions of business talent brought to boar on this branch of industry, wcro to have checkeditho tíeclino in tho yield of gold ero this-and so no doubt they will in good time, but not so suddonly tis « as expected. AVero it not for tho constant increase of steam-power, and tho erection of new machinery every day, for quartz-crushing, pumping out the deep shafts, puddling, and othorwise«upplementing the hand .power, formerly all-sufficient, the doorcase would lhavo beon vory much greater tlhan it is. The gonoral íecognition of this foci was followed by us general an inclination to assist, not only in booping up the equilibrium, but in turning the seale the other way, and it was -rather too san gilincly expected thut the formation of companies wich a large total amount of capital would at oneo bring about tho desired chance for the bettor ; but in the excitement »Mending all such enthusiastic movements H was nat remem- bered that much time must Olapeo bcfoio many .of those companies could in any way -assist in the production of gold, ana that tho preliminary nrraugemonts must of necessity havo a contrary effeet. The -present difficulty in tho formation of new companieo, and the depreciation, or rather fall, fiom a fictitious value whidh they may or may not oventaally reach, in tiho shares of those already formed, dooB not trtise from any want of faith in such investments .of capital proving amply romunor«. tivo on the average ; but from the disappoint- ment of per»t.nB who joined theso projects witik the mero objoct of trading in shares, quite care- less whether thoso might he good permanent investmen'a or »ot. Ono of these companies on a small seale has lately failed ¡ and, at tho meeting called to consider tlio propriety of a dissolution, a .surveyor's report was read, stating that tho giound chosen could not be mado to pay, or worked without danger-which report should manifestly have been obtained be foro tho commencement of operations, and not after the capital of the company had boon un profitably expended. With such carelessness, of «ourse the chancos of success wore small, and several more of these companies havo been brought before the public, formed in the samo heedless or reckless spirit; hut on tho other hand it íb known that tbo estimates of by far the creator number have been prepared with all duo caro, and that the expectations of thoir founders will be more than realised. Even though one, if not two, new fields of apparently great extent have been oponed up within the last few weeks, wo believe that tho finding of several moro doop leads in tho Indigo portion of tho Ovens district may bo ranked as tho discovery of most importance. All these aro evidently branches and feeders to a main lead running beneath tho great plain qf the Murray ; and tho tracing out of this, and the closer ex- amination of tho country around, may probably lead to the discovery of other and still richer ramifications. The district íb auriferous super- ficially to a very great extent, and it is not at all likely that rich and deep deposits should exist in one part of it and not in others. These deep j leadsat the Indigo al o worked at an average depth of about 200 feot from the surface in tho gullies, the dopth incrooslnK ft« the lovel land i* ap preached, ant some of them are highly remunera- tive. Wateris, however, Bcarce in that part of the country, and will nave to bo supplied arti-1 flcially. The two _ew fields ¡aro in very wild unsettled parta ,of the country, and are not likely inTjonsequeno to receive any great accessions of population for some tirne lo come. The first, and, at present lea* promising, of these, the Baw Baw Diggings, are utjie northcrnpart of GippsJciand,i and on the eattern slopo of the mountain from which they an named. ; It ovos stated by the first discoverers that they had found a rich country of unlimited _ext<jit ; but many of the men who wet o induced bj their representations to incur the trouble pnd expansé of a difficult journey ¡"reach- ing them wouldnot remain,'saying that any of the other and more accessible diggings in Gipps Land were quite as good. Tho leoond now field is near the Upper Yarro, about 50 miles to the eastward o{ Melbourne, ai,d 2o from the;EmCTnld Diggings, in the Dandenong Hanges, which they much re- semble in regard to the densely- umbered charac- ter of the country about them.

Tho reefs in difiérent jthrtricts of the colony have become famous in tern for tjheir yield of gold, but «of lato Poverty "Reef, fatj Sandy Greek, has eclipsed all others. Two monster cakes of amal- gamated gold have* been produced from quartz r&ÍBed vvithjn thejostfow weeks from one claim on this reef, the feat larger than ahy cake of e»ld "before retorted in the colony, and weighing l,472oz /and the second still larger, andtreigh ing no less thSn l,522oz. LABOUR. " We are In the midst of a renewed and more wide spread struggle between the 'Workmen and employers for the extension of the Eight-hours system, and for other and perhaps more imme- diate advantages to the former. Men of differ- ent trades are out on strike for the eight hours in its integrity : the masons on the northern line of railway determined to leave their work unless Messrs. Cornish and Bruce "Would discharge all ^masons who did not belong to the Union of their trado, and as this demand was not complied with, they aro out on strike too ; and" the bricklayers, on some portions of the same works, are out on strike for an advance of wages to tho extent of 2s. a day. Tradesmen are still hanging abont town in considerable numbers, complaining that they cannot obtain anything to do, and yet many who have employ- ment throw it up thus foolishly in the hope <of compelling masters to accept the very unreason- able terms dictated by the agitators at head- quarters, who are mostly men with other means of living than by tho trades to which they no- minally belong. The bad feeling against the contractors has'been increased by the importa jion of masons and labourers from Germany under engagement at lower rates of wages than are current here, and the renewed, agitation of the Eight-hours question has been fostered and extended by the" lately-formed Eight Hours'-Labour League. The avowed objects of this association are to secure a peacable enjoyment of the advantages of tho system to the trades now experiencing them, to extend these to every class of labour, and to support the mem- bers of any class which may be engaged in a struggle with employers, to disseminate informa- tion, and to assist in the formation of branch leagues through all tho colonies ; and, finally, to procure a local enactment defining a day's labour to consist of eight hours. What amount of sup- port the League is likely to receive, either pecuniary or otherw¡se we cannot yet foresee, but the 'first fruits of its formation are to bo found in a great increase to the ranks of the un employed, previously, and for a long time past, by far too numerous among us. Mechanics, as well as tradesmen, still complain of a 'difficulty in obtaining employment. In town the only demand is for useful married couples without children, and "competent house servants, who are readily engaged in any num bers that offer. Thus the last shipload of immi- grants, consisting mostly of married couples and single women of a desirable class, were all hired within a very few days, at the highest quoted rates of-wages ; although hundreds of young women, unfit for housework, and married men with large families, spend day after day and week after! week, at the labour-offices in vain. Up the' country shearing has employed many extra hands during tho last month-or two, and harvest | is now commencing to afford occupation to a still -greater number for a time. - As it was last year, so it promises to be this-the farmers had then no trouble in obtaining as many men as thoy re quired, even without leaving home in search of them, and this season there is every probability of mowers and reapers offering their services in fully as great, if not greater, numbers. AGRICUDTÜRE. The hay harvest is now commencing, and >wo 'have still the same prospect of good and abuntlant crops of all kinds. Complaints there are, of course, as usual, of mischief done by tho 'hot ?winds, or by too much Tom-by the sovere'hail- storms that visited some parts of the country, or by the blight, whether of the known or littlomn. derstood kinds ; hut the 'reports from the moro 'important districts all agreo that the bulk of (the crops is looking remarkably well, and that thero Thas not been for some years past, at this season, -such fair prospect of a good harvest. In thein «terior, much of the now'lnnd has been sown with wheat, so that unless somo very unfavourable weather should como to <mar our prosont mro «pects, wo will this year make a great stride towards providing within our own territory a frill supply of bread-stuffs. Last year the in- creased .quantity of land under cultivation was devoted .principally to oats and hay, hut 'this season the market lias been so much overstodked with imported oats that -there is littlo chanco of these being cleared off beforo the now crops como in, and wheat having'been comparatively high, with an upward tendency through tho winter, 'this grain was sovfn in preference on mo<t of the land nowly brdken up. It is do sirablo at any timo that we should havo a home-grown supply of bread-corn, but this year tho increase will be especially -needed to counter- act tile tendency to speculation 'that would other- wise bofoatercd by what wo may now consider as moro than tho probability of a partial failure in South Australia. The prices of wheat and flour have 'Only just subsided from a height to which thoy would never have readied but for the constant reiteration by speculators of an opinion "hold, .or said to havo beon held, by many, that thero-was not a sufficiency in fhe Australian colonies to imeot the consumption piior to the coming harvest. Contrary to the warnings given from time tctime as to the ' untrustwortlnness of the calculaiions put foi th in support of these views, pcoplo became so far convinced of the truth or the statements,"that flour was at length got up to a preposterous price, to tumble down, however, on the arrival of the first cargoes from California and South America, to tho rato abovo whieh it should never havo risen, for it has all along been plain enough that wo have in the colonies enoughto meet our requirements until the now grain comes in. These needless fluctuations in the price of bread aro bad enough, hut most in- jury is dono by the importation of a quantity of wheat and flour that we do not require, and the consequent deprCBBion of the market to our own producers. With a steady supply of home- grown crain, and moderato prices, the farmers would bo better paid than they over aro hy prices fluctuating between wido extremes ; for, somehow or other, ,they never derivo in any great degree the benefit of a riso when it does take place, and thero would then be no necessity or inducement to pass off on consumers the stale or damaged remains of theso imported stocks. As a proof of tho progress agriculture is making in the intorior, wo may. refer to tho first annual' show of stock and implements held a week or two sincç at Ballarat, and very largely attended by visitors. This was tho first attempt at getting up a bIiow in that part of the country, and, as such, was a decided success. Tho number of exhibits was large, and from the interest displayed by all classes, the society may well caloulate on abun- dant support and encouragement to future exer- tion. Some of the members proved the earnest- ness of their intentions individually by nurohnsing at very.high , prices moro than quo of the prize animals at the last Melbourno show, and in their corporate capacity they havo, expressed a deter- mination not,to remain content with a second or third rate position, but to aim nt becoming a first rate society. It is not many years since black-' smiths were only needed in that district to point tho miners' picks, and now, in competition, with the best English and Melbourne madclmplements/ a Balhmtt-mado plough is adjudged to bo worthy of first prizo ; and, on the day of the show, tho miners themselves were to bo seen in hundred« in tho yard discussing the merits of a short- horn or » Spanish prizo cock." ' After » check to importation for a time, a rather largo quantity of ? stock of all sorts has been landed here within the I last few days. A number of short-horn bulls and heifers have been sold this week, or aro now on sale, and several lots of fine and coarse woolled sheep havo beendietributed throughout the coun- try. Of the hulls sold on Monday last, two realised' respectively ¡£350 and £400, prices sufficiently re- munerative to the shippers, as neither animal boro a character to necessitate the payment of a, very high prico in England. In consequence of the appearance of pleuro-pneumonia hero, bTotrprht to the colony most undoubtedly hy an imported cow, a Bill is now being prepared by^ a com- mittee of stockovrners to prevent if pos- sible the shipniont from England hither ward or landing here of may animal that has ever heen diseased, and to provide for the immediate destruction of ¡ all cattle that may at any time become Infected. For the piesemt, we believe, the nftiscnief has been confined to the ono herd in avhich the disease at first appeared, but without -some precaution of this sort, and legal authority to interfere, should itihreaktout again, pleuro-pneumonia may be- come established among xts, and decimate the herds of the colony its it did those in some I parts of Britain. It is reportedi that a number of young cattle, principally yearlings, havo lately ched in ¡the Murrumbidgee district of a disenso .similar to or identical avith "black leg," but avith what truth we have no means at this dis- tance of ascertaining. ¡ 'railways. ' The two Government lines aresteadily hufcslowly progressing. On both all the largo viaducts/ and other engineering works of importance have now been commenced, and will be pushed forward simultaneously. The Geelong and Melbourne line is not yet in the hands-of tho" Government, nor" has any furthor information beon given to the public of the present position of the negotiations between the company and the parties appointed to audit the hooks on behalf of the Government.

The St. Kilda and Brighton Railway is now nearly completed, and will be opened for traffic early-in December. The length of the line is 4 miles 1,518 yards, and in this comparatively short length there aro 213,059 cubic yards of ex- cavation, 1¡1,737 lineal yards of fencing, ono viaduct Í00 yards in longth, seven bridges under and five over tho railway, and five level cross- ings. There .will also bo. four stations along the line. ' It will thus be seen that the works aro unusually Tieavy. The cost of the whole line, including 'ballasting, drainage, &o.;, will be about £10S;000, or £21,000 per milo; which must, however, be considered a low estimato, consider- ing tho 'nature and stability of the works. Tho starting-point from tho St. KHda station is tho portion of £ho lino upon which tho most work re inains'to'bo done. rOn 'tho Melbourne and Suburban Railway tho traffic has been mucli greater than was antici nated'by its most sanguine supporters, nearly «00,000 (six Tiundrcd thousand) passengers hav- ing'travelled on it during &0 last nine months.

The departures wore :-1,019 to the neighbouring colonies, 130 to the United Kingdom, and 699 to foreign ports ; total, 1,654. It is singular that in the month of October, 1858, tho depai turcs exceeded tho arrivals ; but at that time the Port Curtis mania had seized on the mining population, and thou- sands thronged the wharves, anxious to mako their way to that Bl Dorado. During tho past month tho intercolonial migration has been slightly against the colony of Victoria, and tho departures of Chinese have swelled up the returns of emigration. _ SPORTING. During the past month there has been a sur- feit of racing on the Melbourne Course, and the different country clubs are just about to open their spring campaign. In our last Summary we alluded to the fact of Flying Buck, owned by Mr. Yuille, the winner of the Champion Sweep- stakes, having been beaten for the Jockey Club Derby by Buzzard. The latter is a colt by War- hawk, the reputed sire of Flying Buck, and was purchased shortly before the Derby (to be delivered to him after the race) by Mr. Hector Norman Simson, an intimate friend of the Cham- pion colt's proprietor. Doubts before the race wore freely expressed of the two three-year-olds running on their merits, which almost generated into a conviction that they would not when an announcement was posted in tho Subscription Betting Room, signed jointly by Mr. Yuille and Mr. Simson, setting forth that the two animals would run fairly, that there was no collusion be- tween the proprietors. The Derby was run, and, as we have before stated, won by Buzzard. The public generally pronounced the race was not run fairly, but that Flying Buck was held back; and many experts, who witnessed it from dif- ferent points of view, entertained a similar opi- nion. The sporting reporter of this journal freely expressed his conviction that the mat- ter had been arranged. An indignant de- nail from Mr. Yuille, and an ambiguous letter from the Secretary of the Jockey Club, followed. Then another letter from our sporting reporter, confirmatory of his previous statement, appeared, after which there was a lull of some days, until all Melbourne was astonished at seeing in The Argus a voluntary statement from the boy who rode Flying Buck that he was induced on the one hand by promise of a heavy bribe, and coerced on the other by a powerfully-worded personal threat, to lose the race. Mr. Yuille's next proceeding was to get hold of the boy and take him back into his service (the lad had previously left of his own accord), having previously got Mr. Andrew Macarthur, J.P., to administer an extra-judicial oath to the boy in a publichouse parlour, when the lad recanted the whole of his previous state- ment. A charge of conspiracy was then brought against Messrs. Goyder and Gearns, the former a well-known and respected book-maker on the Turf, which, after two days and a-half's hearing in the Police Court, was dismissed. The Bench, we have reason to know, were almost unanimous in their wish to dismiss the case before any evi- dence had been gone into for the defence, The police magistrate, however, Mr. Sturt whose subsequent conduct at a special meeting of the Turf Club, called to investigate the run- ning of Flying Buck, has brought upon him much well-deserved censure - wished the matter to be gone on with, and only declared the case dismissed when the evidence was becoming stronger and stronger against Mr. Yuille. And yet Mr. Sturt, at the Turf Club meeting, stated boldly that not a particle of evidence came out in court which could implicate Mr. Yuille in any way; and further, that if there had been any testimony to show the race was a "sell," it would have been brought forward. When it is remem- bered that the defendants' only object was to clear themselves of a charge of conspiracy, and that no more witnesses would be heard than were sufficient to show the absurdity of this presumption, Mr. Sturt seems to have conveniently stretched his conscience so as to make such a remark, which it is hardly necessary to say was contrary to fact. The Turf Club, although having appointed a Committee of five to watch the proceedings in the Police Court, whose report strongly condemned Mr. Yuille's conduct in taking the boy Coyne back into his service, and suggested a general inquiry into the Jockey Club Derby, quietly hushed up the whole matter, and broke up after administering a mild rebuke to Mr. Yuille for again harbouring the "penitent" young liar. Public opinion as to the race having been a "cross"is stronger than ever, notwithstanding the clumsy attempts at whitewashing made by what is called the "sporting authority" of the colony. The general conviction is that the whole truth will come out some day. If Mr. Yuille be really innocent of the charge laid at his door, he may well say, Save me from my friends! (of the Turf Club); and if not, no man ever went less wisely to work to prove his hands clear of a very dirty matter. We may add, that Mr. Yuille is an old colonist, and a man of means. AMUSEMENTS. Theatricals and music remain pretty much in the same position as at the date of our last Summary. At the Theatre Royal Mr. G. V. Brooke has for a time intermitted his professional' exertions, and has initiated an opera season, of which last month we were still only able to speak hopefully. The company includes Mesdames Carandini and Sara Flower, and Messrs. Farqu- harson, Greig, and Sherwin, and the operas already produced are " Il Trovatore," " Lucrezia Borgia," " Lucia di Lammermoor," and " La Sonnambula." The promises made that " Rigoletto," " La Traviata," " Louisa Miller," &c.;, would be forthcoming, remain as yet unfulfilled, but the last will be produced in a few days' time. So far as it has gone, the opera season must be pronounced not unsuccessful ; the audiences have been large and encouraging. Nothing has yet been heard of the Signor and Signora Bianchi, who were expected to arrive from America. At the Princess's Theatre two new actresses have made tlfeir début. The first. Miss Kate Howard, formerly of London, was quite unsuccessful, and retired after performing for two or three nights. Miss Avonia Jones, tho other débutante, came to us from the United States, and her appearance has been a marked success.'? She is a tragedienne of powers altogether beyond the average, and possessed of personal qualifications which aro important accessaries to artists of her class. Her repertoire is professedly the same as that or Rachel and 'Ristori, and those best qualified to judge havo, without insti- tuting any comparisons, pronounced her to bo not unworthy of following in the footsteps of her great predecessors. Her greatest disad- vantage is the possession of a strong American accent, which, however, thero is every reason to believe, will yield to the influences of timo and study. Mr. II. N. Warner has returned to, this theatre during the engagement of Miss Jones. The Olympio Theatre, which, it is anticipated, will shortly close, owing to the commencement of thp summer season at Cremorne Gardens, still enjoys the pre-eminence in melodrama, comedy, and burlesque. The company generally is per- haps the best comedy company in Melbourno. Messrs. Rogers, F. Younge, Dunn, Milne, and Bellair, are deservedly favourites with the public. Miss Rosa Dunn is also popular, and Miss Roso Edouin is an exceedingly clover, though very young, burlesque actress, and perhaps the best grisettc at present on the Melbourne boards. The Philharmonic Society is well supported by the public, nni deservedly so. Its strength has lately been considerably increased, and arrange- ments are in progress for the building of » intiBic hall worth\ of the Southern metropolis. Cre- morne Gardens, situated within a mile and a half of Melbourne, will shortly ho re-opened for the summer season, with every prospect of abundant patronage. They remain under the management of Mr. Georgo Coppin, whoso long experience and tact in catering for the public amusement can hardly fail of meeting with its reward. COMMERCIAL. This, the dullest season of the Australian year, has been even duller than usual. Trade has been quiet since the date of our last Summary, the money market tight, and rumours have to a con- siderable extent occupied the timo usually doa-oted to business. The heavy losses sustained by holders of flour, grain, butter, ire, gave the im- petus to the rumour system, at hich fell on a declin- ing market, and spread rapidly. Notvv ithstanding this, the month has passed away without a failure in commercial circles, and with less than the UBual quantity of rcnovvals being applied for. The banks havo shoavn a strong disposition to nan ovv the limits of their accommodation, and have in some instances administered the cheek sud- denly. This has caused the affairs of solvent finns to bo made matter of discussion in public, and has aided in imparting a tono of want of confi- dence, which has been detrimental to the interests of importers and shippers. Consumption has been steady and increasing, but the caterers for the up-country trade havo boen cautious buyers, and have had the command of a declining market. Thero has not been any speculation avorthy of remark. Capital for the purpose has not been obtainable, the caution whioh has operated with the buyer having had equal effect with the banker. Stocks have been accumulating, the overdue ship- ments aro vory considerable, and the people are in- creasing in habits of economy. The yield of the gold-fields has not been maintained, and political excitement has interfered avith the sources of industry. Immigration has fallen off. In Oc- tober tho departures exceeded the arrivals by 1G7. Theso, and other less important causes of a temporary nature only, are quite sufficient to ac- count for the aery general complaints avhich exist in a colony so notoriously overdone "by the trading class as Victoria still continues to bo. Tho banking returns, which will be found in another column, do not give indications of tlio existence of any pressure during the thirïl quarter of the year. The deposits have steadily increased since the crisis of 1857. In the third quarter of 1858, they amounted in round numbers to .£5,672,000 ; in the fourth quarter they rose to £5,900,000 ; in the first quarter of 1859 to "0,200,000 ; in the second quarter , to £6,330,000; and now ave find that in the third quarter the amount avas £6,391,257. At the same time there has been a considerable drain of gold. For some years past the banks hero have held in thoir coffers coin and bullion to the value of about one-third of their liabilities. So late as the fourth quarter of 1858, the liabilities were £8,211,651, and the coin and bullion amounted to £2,692,429, or pearly one- third. During the present year, the ratio of one-third was not maintained, but there was no material decrease till the third quarter. In the second quarter of 1859, tho liabilities were £8,536,442, and the coin and bullion £2,766,344; but in the third quarter, while the liabilities me to £8,661,762, the coin and bullion fcfl. to £2,296,740. , , - Our stocksiof Jmported goods have ¡ncre_3___L» the expense of our stock of specie aw) Sh_Em^ . and our present supplies, with a few c_n_nar - exceptions, are equal to the consumption-c__«tor than 12 months, with every prospect of t--~ added to.

Tho circulation of notes fell from £2,121,588 to £1,932,553 ; the average circula- tion or bills, for threo quarters, from £71,680 to £05.202 ; the deposits rose from £0,017,446 to £0,394,257 ; but the discounts and advances roso from £7.562,428 to £0,388,594, while the coin and bullion decreased £470,000 in the last quarter. Thus, it appears, that while the circu- lation both of notes and oills and the bullion have been decreasing, while the deposits havo in- creased to the extent only of £370,000. the ad- vances to the colonists have increased during the last 21 months by no loss than £1,82G,000. The returns further show that of this largo amount £1,234,910 was advanced during the present year, and that the increaso in the last quarter alone ovor the ada-ances in tho previous quarter was no less than £647,803. The bank rates of discount remain at-For bills under 95 days' currency, 8 per cent. ; for 95 days to 125 days', 9 per cent. ; over 125 days', 10 per cent. ; nail for overdrawn accounts and . cash credits, 10 per cent. Outside the banks Î;ood securities are moro plentiful, and money in arco sums finds ready investment. Tho selling rates of exchange on England are 3uotod at from par to 1 per cent, premium for 60 ays' sight for large amounts, and at 1/J per cent, premium for 30 days' sight for bills under £50. Freight on gold by sailing-vessels is from 2Jd. to 3d. per ounco, deliverable in London ; insurance, 1!¡ per cent. By tho overland route the freight to tho Bank of England, including insurance and transit duty, is 2 per cent. To Mauritius and India, freight 1 per cent. ; insurance according to the character of the port to avhich the ship- ment is made. At a meeting of the proprietors of tho National Bank of Australasia, held at the bank premises on the 1st inst., tho first half-yearly report of the directors aros submitted to tlio shareholders. This report gia'es evidence of the progress of the bank. On the 2nd of May last, the circulation in Victoria and Adelaide amounted to £80,178, and tho deposite to £101,518. On the 24th of October lost, theso had risen to a circulation of ¡6157,587, and doposits £273,452, showing an in- crease in the circulation of £77,409, and in the deposits of £171.934. This result is highly satis- factory, especially when the inauspicious circum- stances .attending the launching of this institu- tion into existence are taken into account. The directors announce the establishment of a branch at the Mauritius, which is now in operation, and doing a fair amount of business. In tho stock and share market the transactions of the month have been comparatively few and insignificant. Mining shares continue as de- pressed as they were at the date of our last sum- mary. Other local joint-stock undertakings are firm, with few no/the market; Wie subjoin the monthly report of Messrs. Wrfcy\\._ad _ryant: " We havo little this month to reoort relativo to tho stock and snare market. Thoro has been no prominent fcaturo worthy of remark : In fact, business has sub- sided almost to a standstill. Forweeks post tome ease has been looked for in tho money markot, but a con- tinued tightness Is obsorvablo in all quarters. Mor cailtllo houses havo found great difficulty in obtaining accommodation, and the stringency of the banks, with tho rates charged, has brought soveral houses of long standing to an adjustment. That this Is greatly to be deplored may be seon from tlio .several facts Î that tho staple commodities of commerce In which spe- culation generally rages, and olten with profit -to tho consignee, havo 'suffered from sovero fluctuations ; tha . our principal securities havo been totally neglected, and, which is of far greater importance, (as well as from want of knowledge and judicious application of oxporlonco In mining enterprise, which of late has keen the pro- minent feature in this country,) tho plothora of Eng- lish capital which -would, if encouragingly invited, havo ero this found its way Into the colony, has, and undoubtedly for au indouulte period, been dolayed. Could our energetic capitalists havo foreseen tho necessity of properly launching, and with sonaowhat moro discretion, tho various mining enterprises allowing tlio profitable resulta to havo shown thorn solves Ina vvholesomo and legitimate- way-wo do not hosltato to affirm that many of tren- shares would bo now quoted in tho London list. At the same timo n little foresight may discover that, should some of our moro promising companies prove as successful as wo anticipate, in tho absence of moro favourable Investment, tho unemployed capital with those In I England avho aro always on tho alort will find an ' agoncy amongst us. Anil indeed ave havo bohío reason for oncouragemont in tho ixintlnued high prices of thoso of our socurlties alroady nogotiablo in London. Our dobonturos maintain thoir high figuro, and our railway shares aro avo'l 'entertained. Our private advices from tho Stock Exchange inform us that tho extant feeling - of distrust from tho still unsettled nflUr of tho Molbourno and Geelong Railway with tho Government is tho only thing that militates ugainst ' tho favourable réception of our bonds, and that Hob- ' son's Bay shares are realising £75. i " The amount of business during tho past month has boen as fulloavs: " Banks.-Victoria, £33J £34. Colonial, £5|-G ; tho declaration of the usual divldond of 10 per cent, has not encouraged purchasers, although tho shares of this bank aro considered to bo the best Investment at tho prico, National, at 2} to 8 : they continuo dull at tins figuro, increased by tho call of _1. Tho caso of Mr. Gibb, tho promoter of tho Institution, for a claim of some £500, lins boon decided lu thoir favour. " Railways.-Hobson's Bay have boen dull and difficult of sale abovo 70, sovoral parcels having boon disposed of st, 69, GS£. Tills may bo accounted for partly by thcappearanco of a prospectus of tlio Sand- ridge Dock and Tramway Company, and tlio idea of a direct St. Kilda Uno, besides the question of their not paying so largo a divldond, on account of its being the va inter half-year, and tho Increased capital. " Geelong and Melbourne havo been sold at £18. Tho chango of Government ought to plaeo theso shares on a better footing. " St. Kilda and Brighton expect to open their Uno oarly in tho ensuing month, when we hope to seo an Improvement in theso shares. " Suburbans, exercising their borrowing powers, aro again flat at 0}, several sales having boon modo at that price, and a few at par. " Publie Companies.- Meibourno Gas aro quiet' holders aro dcairous of accepting 13}. Salos have been effected at that prico up to 14. Geelong Ga» a 2}. Ballarat, nt OJ to j. Bendigo -Gas, at 20s.

Victoria Lifo havo been rather slow of lato at about 3J ; noav sellers at that price. "Mining Companies.-Albion,-i ; Bagshots, nt 3J and 3J ; Bolinda, nnd Bank Vale aro both vory flat, no very favourable opinion being entertained with rogard to olther. Solivias havo been frequently doalt in at 2J, i.and I, and aro now Boilers at tho latlor figure ; a dividend of per share was declared on tho 14th. Bendigo Valley and Whlto Hills are scarcely saleable at J dis. Bendigo and Mi ors'e Flat tho same. Ohovv tons havo declined gradually from 7£ to S (par), at avhich thoy are scarcely buyers in spito of a Castle- maine rush. Coliban is undoubtedly a genuino com- pany, and a good investment.

Uko tho rest, aro drooping. They are now to bo had at i prom. Maryborouehs, long con- sidered to bo oneof tho best companies, aro now dow n to i prom, sellers. Monto Christo has shown great vigour In commencing operations. Tho cngino Is already at work, and a feu' days, wo anticipate, will show a satisfactory result, and enhance tho valuo of the shares, which aro now at J prom. The unhappy reve- lations of the New Chum Company lioa-o doomed tho shareholders to disappointment: tho shares uro uiiBaloihlo. Spcclmon Gully and Old Penny- weights havo gradually dwindled to 8 and 31 respectively. Sandy Creeks, avlileh lor a timo maintained a high premium, havo likewise dropped : it is evident that holders compelled to realise must dlsposo of thoso shares which »re at a premium avlillo tho opportunity offers. Wattle Gully and Windlass Hill Companies aro considered good ; trans- actions naa-e taken place in both at par and a slight premium. *' Bendigo Waterworks, probably moro than any other company, appear to puzzle tho public, whieh is solely attributablo to tho simple fact that they have boon at work now about throo montliB, and not a single statement of thoir operations has boen presented to tlio shareholders, nor has one of them apparently Had the courngo to demand It. What can possibly bo tho object of keeping things so much in tlio dark wo aro at a loss to comprehend ; cortain it is that the shares havo fallon gradually from £15 to £4. " Wo may remark,[wlth regard to all mining-shares, that from the sudden flow of them some tn o months back, and absonco of any exhibited profitable result, alf shares havo been hard to get rid of; delay, anita some instance* call«, havo materially affected .prices, tho greatest ovi', hovvovcr. bolng, as ave havo beforo observod, tho unwarrantable dtigulso of tho proceed- ings of nearly tho wholo of our now companies. " It Is with scmo satisfaction that wo aro enabled to announce that, from tho frequent meetings of stock and sh.aro brokers, and avith tho assistance of several who avoro members of the London Stock Ex- change, whoso oxporieneo Is necessary for tho purpose, a Stock Exchange has been, after sovoral futile and premature attempts, Instituted aud founded ; tills has lona hcon needed by tho Melbourne public, mid n fow weeks will suffice to show tho bonoftt accruing from a constituted body bound by the strictest rules for honour and Integrity. Tlio remainder of tho present year will bo employed In arranging the stability of the concern, prior to its Inauguration on the 1st January, 1800." A new company, entitled the Snndridge Pier Dock, and Tramway Company, has been intro- duced into the market, capital £150,000, in 15,000 shares of £10 each. The prospectus slates the objects of the company to be-the formation of a lino of tramway " from King street, across the Hobson's Bay Railway and Sandridge- road, along the saltwater lagoon, to the beach, near the Sugar Works ;" tho construc- tion of a pier at the Sundridgo terminus, " suitable for tho accommodation of tho largest tonnago of shipping in the Bay ;" and the con- version of the lagoon into a dock. Tlio project has been brought beforo the public with good names attached, and has received a duo share of publie notice in these dull times. While rumours of failures have provaMed to an alarming extent during the month, only afevv small suspensions have taken place in mercantile and trading circles. Mr. James Graham, a con- tracting and general butcher, in a largo way of business, suspended, with liabilities to the amount of about ¿80,000. The Insolvency Circular of Messrs. Mackillop and Cooke, for tho month of October, contains a list of 95 insolvent estates, the majority of which exhibit small amounts of liabilities, 58 being under £500, and the remainder, with the exception of 13, being under £1,000. The trades and callings of the insolvents aro thus classified-two auction- eers, two bakers, one bedding-warehouseman, two boarding-house keepers, eight butchers, one boot- maker, one builder, one bnckmaker, two carriers, one carter, one cabdrivcr, two carpenters, one cab proprietor, one confectioner, one conveyancer, one cordial manufacturer, two cook», two commission agents, two contractors, one clerk, one dairyman, one draper, two doctors, seven farmers, one fish dealer, two fruiterers, one gentleman, two general dealers, ono hair-dresser, ono lighterman, one livery stable-keeper, two labourers, ono law clerk, threo miners, two incrchnnts, one mariner, ono machinist, seven publicans, one poundkoeper, ono painter, ono puddler, one solicitor, one stonemason, nine storekeepers, one sheep pales man, ono stock-dealer, one slaughterman, ono teacher of languages», and one watchmaker.

Tho an [vals from tho West Coast of America caused a panic lu tho markot, mid prices, which had boen in great measure supported on tho reliance of exhausted supplies in South Australia, gave way, and left thu market In a perfect state of prostration. Country dealers, however, have been at last compelled to come forward to puiclinse, and considerable orders to bo taken liaek to tho out stations hy tho returning wool drays had ciussd an improved foiling lu tbo market, and pi ices appeared to bo settling doun steadily, at about £10 to £10 10s. por ton lor Adelaide town brands, und other sorts at proportionate rates, when further arrivals from Valparaiso and ¡san Francisco awaiti unsettled the market, and theio is now no prospoet of any ndvanco on present rates, ?nure especially as tho harvest timo ol' South Aus- tralia is close approaching. Whoat.-At this la o period of tho season thero aro of course but few «vinillos, and thoso of no extont, otTcrlng in the market. Tho latcBt salo reported is of a parcol of about 1,000 uushoJa from tlio Western District, placed a few days since at 0s. por bushel. Barley Ih so largely supplied as lo bo almost unsaleable, 'i'lio season for nulling being passed randers tho talo of English very dull, and tho low prices of oats and other feed corn p-evoiits the salo ot Chlli.ui and Capo ; quotations for tho latter sorts aro, howovor, givon at from Hs. Od. to 3s. Od. per bushel. Ma't is in hut little inquiry, and, supplies being largo, sales aie difficult to effect at thu quotations roportod, of 8s. Od. to Os. por bushel, winch may Indeed bo considered as morely nominal. Oats.-Tlio low prices to which tho excès,Ivo stockB, by continued arrivals, havo caused this grain to full, haa'o Iiiorensod an unusual consump- tion, and Induced tbo belief that prices ii ust shortly rally. Speculators, however, appoar fearful of buying, and tho amounts taken oil' by small consumers, al- though considerable lu the aggregate, aro insufficient to piuduco any effect on market prices, which may bo quotod as follona, a!z.:-Scotch and Irish, 3s. 3d. to 3s. 6d. ; Danish, Sa. 3d. to 3a. 4d. ; Californian, 3s. Ud. to 3s lOd. ; Calcutta, 3s. Sd. to 33. Od. ; colonial, 4s. 3d. to 4s. 0d. per bushel. Gram is in fair demand, but holders seem indisposed to accept tho prices offered, which rule fruin £0 to £0 10s. per ton. Muizo comes forward freely, and owing to the low prices ruling for other sorts of feed corn, Is dull of sale, host samples of Now South Wales growth not being worth muro than 3<. Od. to 3s. Od. per bushel. Bran continues In steady demand, and brings from Is. 8d. to Is. lOd. per bushel. Fruits.-Dried.-A» may bo oxpected at this season of tlio yoar, thoro ¡s but littlo doing in driod fruits of any description. Frosh table fruits aro noav frooly at market, and green sorts for culinary purpo«osboinr plentiful, drlvd fruits aro dull of safo. Muscutcl and pudding mhlns aro in very little Inquiry.

Coylon, plantation, in bond, is worth Od. to OJd. ; and nativo, 5Jd. to Od. per lb. Sugars.-The market 1b dull, and very littlo doing. Arrivals havo boon considerable, and tho trado natu- rally feel indisposed to enter tho market until thoy aro acquainted with the position tho lato arrivals aro likely to assume. Fino bright yellow grocery sorts would no doubt bring full prices, but for low and dingy groy sorts thero is no dcmind. The Bales effected havo eon of inconsldorablo amount, and from their pecu- liarly unmarketable qualities, afford nojustcriteri-ii ol prices. Rico.-No sales of any Importance have boon recorded during tho last wook, beyond tho disposal of about 100 tons of Patna, by auction, at X17 6s.

A Black Snake, between threo aud four feet in length, avas killed on the 13th, in a right-of way near the offices of the vPort Phillip Minini? Company, Flinders-street.1 -The1 reptile was seen undulating leisurely down the street/and was quickly despatched. It had, no doubt, been con coaled in some hollow log-a portion of somo housekeeper's stock of firewood. Tub Chamber of Commerce elected a nevt President on the 11th inst., in lieu of the Hon W. Nicholson, resigned. A ballot took place for two hours, but it was merely a matter of form as the late Vico-Prcsklent, Mr. Charles Bright (of Bright Brothers), was the only candidate A special general meeting of the Chamber 'was called after the ballot had elosod, and the elec- tion was formally reported and confirmed. Chisholm.-Inspector Smith, of the detective branch of the Victorian police forco, who wa» despatched to England-some months back com- missioned to apprehend Chisholm, tho Portland Hoad Board defaulter, returned on the 10th avith his prisoner, by the Wellesley. Chisholm is charged with embezzling funds belonging to tho Board, and, as will bo remembered, avas appre- hended in Ireland by Mr. Smith. Ho is tobaforUb with consigned to' tho custody of the police af Portland., The Governor of Queensland,-His Ex- cellency Sir Ilenry.Barkly embarked in tho mail boat Kangaroo at nn early hour on the morainif of the 13th, at Sandridge, and in company with Captain Seymour, of H.M.S. Pelonía, proceeded to the Malta to meet Sir George Bowen, the re- cently appointed Governor of the new Australian colony of Queensland. Subsequently Sir George and Lady Bowen made a hasty visit to Toorak and returned to tho Malta. . , ' Pish.-Some short time since, a littlo schooner of 32 tons burdon, named the Jano and Ellen went into Bass's Straits on a fishing trip. . She returned to Hobson's Bay a few days since henvihr laden avith fish, avhich were all alia o in the tanks with which tho craft was provided. Thoeuccess of the enterprise has induced the ovners to' make arrangements to keep their littlo vessel regularly employed in deep-sea fishing, and sho sailed again for Boss's Straits, coinplctelv fitted with every requirement. Tho opening'-up of this branch of trade will give us a welcome addition to the somewhat scanty stock of iish with which wo are at present supplied. A Sad Accident occurred at Brighton on October 29, hy aihich three respected colonists, lost their lives by the upsetting of a four-oared gig. Their names aro Mr. Love, Mr. Durham and Mr. M'Intosh, A hasty chango of position by one of tho party, nt a moment when the sea was running very high, and'it wai necessary to trim the boat carefully, was the cause of tho disaster. In the attempt to regain his. balance this gontlemnn (Mr. Durham) sent his foot com- pletely through ono of the bottom planks, and tlio boat at once filled- The bodies have been re- covered. Tile Horticultural Sociltv's Show at- tracted a laige numberof visitors to the Botanical Gardens on tho 5th iiiBt, His Excellency the Governor and Miss Barkly being present duringa part of the afternoon., Tho show, although not presenting any prominent novelties, yet betokened progress in horticultural development. A bazaar in aid of the funds of South Yana Presbyterian Church (hto Rev. Mr. .Dlvorty's) was held in tho grounds, from which a very large sum, judging from its crowded nppearanco during tho day, must have been realised. The Government Offices Beserve at tho eastern end of Collins-street presents a busy scone just now. Besides tho rapid progress made in tho erection of the Ticasury, the foundations for tho new Chiof Secretary's offices are being built, and a largo number of men is employed thereon. As tho level of theo latter is intended to bo the same ns that of tho Trea- sury, and a considerable^ difference exists between tho present levels, a wide embankment ia being formed to sorvo as a carriago-drivc, which takes a sweep from the Flinders-street entrance past the Treasury and the Chief Secretary's Offices, to tho entrance facing tho Pitzroy-square. lu connection with tho Treasury buildings, it may be remarked that somo of the largest jueces of stone over brought to Melbourne aro being used for the cornices lo that edifice. The Baths and Washhouses now in course of erection at the triangular comer of tho Gaol reserve, in Swanston-street, nro rapidly approach- ing completion. A galvanised ¡ron roof is put over tho swimming bath, which is by far the most spacious mid commodious that the colony possesses. Tile private baths will not, from what can be judged of thom by a cuisory inspection, bo on n corresponding scale of magnitude. At the same timo, a great desideratum »ill have boen supplied when the establishment is opened. This event, from all appearance, »ill take place in about a month from the present dato. The portion set apart for females washing and bath- ing lias been carefully separated from the rest of the building. The avholo structuro deserves a visit, and we trust tho City Council will not be satisfied until they have extended the benefits of such establishments as that wo havo roviovved to other parts of tho city. Breach of the Passengers' Act.-Captain Moran, of the ship Barmonidcs, was summoned on October 27 to the Sandridge Police Court, to nnsvv or a chargo of having served out provisions to the pai&cngcrs; deficient in quantity and bad iii quality. The charge was preferred by upwards of 100 passengers. Tho Immigration Agent, in prosecuting, said, tho Hnrinoniues was the third vessel arriving at this port, within a rcceut period, and chartered by the Black Ball hine, against tho captains of which complaints had been made as to the provisions. It was denied by the defendant that the Harmonidcs did belong to tho Black Ball Lino ; sho was chartered by the owners of the Eagle Line. But, on the other hand, it was admitted that the agents for both élusses of vcssols wero the samo-Messrs. Baines and Co., of Liverpool, and Messrs. Bright Brothers, and thnt the contract tickets for both wero idontical. It was not easy to pcrceiio what the defendant, or rather tho agents, e\ pected to gain by this nico distinction, which simply went to show that tho Eaglo line of ships «.ero ns imperfectly victualled as the Black Ball Line. It was proved thnt tho allowance of peas for 155 passengers avas 1511b. per week 6hort, tho potatoes 27¿lb., and tho rico SO.Jlb., while the défendant admitted that tho flour lins bad for two-thirds of tlio voyngo. A (¡no of £210s., with 5s. costs, was indicted in each case, a moiety of the fine and the costs togo to each passenger. The total amount of the penalty will be from £220 to £250. The Governor on tho 2nd ¡nit. paid a visit to II.M.S. Pelorus, nt present anchored a short distance off tho Sandridge Rnilwnv Jetty. Upon his arrival at the Pier, accompanied by Captain Bancroft and Miss Barkly, His Excellency wns received by Captain Norman, of II.3I.C.S. Victoria, who luul a barge in readiness for the visitors. At about 2 o'clock tlio bargo left the Pier, and in a few minutes afterward* it vins alongside tho Pelorus-the yards of that ship being manned, and the boat's crew tossing oars as His Excellency mounted to tho deck. On his arrival there he wns received hy Captain Seymour and hisiomcers, and was conducted over tho ship, after which tho visiling Ëarty wero entertained by tho Captain, lbs Ixeelloncy left nt about half-past 3 o'clock, the yards being ngain manned, and a salute of li guns being fired. Viovved from a distance, the sun shining brightly on the viater, tho Bay pre- sented nn unusually lively appearance, added to which tho largo crowd assembled on the Santl ridgo Jetty, and on board various ships, formed, a scene winch, noa el in its character in these 'waters, affbrtled, apparently, great enjoyment to the spectators. It is unnecessary to say tliaHlic '* Jocks" performed their work in that officient mid olT-haud manner peculiar to British s.iilois. Wo may add that the crew of tho bargo pi no Victoria acquitted themselves most ercdiMWy, taking into consideration the fact that their su vicos nro so seldom required on similar occasion«. Alligators on the FirzROY.-Whon hun- dreds of foolish people wero mad to go to lort Curtis and most aviso pcoplo declaimed against their ill-fortuned exodus, there was much tune about tho alligators which wero said to abojinu in mid on tbo banks of tho Fitzroy River, »on dcrful were the stories told hy persons who nail visited that locality boforo the famous rush, ann still more wonderful wero those told by Ta returned nnd disappointed gold-seekers of turao said alligators, but some doubt always attached o them. ííovv, however, their truth is practicauy established by the am', al in Melbourne nndc.am bition in Kyto's-buildings, in Bourkc-stfcot cast, of two immense specimens of tlio species, »incn wero shot by a Mr. Craig on the banks of the lin- roy, some 100 miles above Keppel Bay.
