The highest premium in tho gift of the pubUo has again becnawardcd to tbc SINGER SEWING MACHINE COMPANY. Read tho following evidence:— The Custom House report In the "Melbourne Journal oi Commerce" for 187S suppllog the follow ing important figures; — Imported by Messrs. Stanford and Co,, agents for tlie Siuger Manufacturing Company Cases 6655. value £33,487 Being an increase on the imports of 1872 Cases 1936, Value £8,632 And exceeding the imports of any other firm by Cases 2471, value £11,226 These facts speax volumes for tho Singer Sewing Machine. This extraordinary success of tho " Singer" has been mainly achieved by the company's "New Family" machine, which is universally acknowledged to be tho most simple to learn, the easiest to work, unequalled forstrongth and beauty of stitch, and the most com plete and perfect in mechanism and accessories tor every varletvof domestic sewing and embroidery.' BEWARE OF IMITATIONS of the SINGER SEWING MACHINE. Spurious Singers, made of inferior metal, are in the market, but they oan be easily delected by the absence o the Singer trade mark, with the uame of our firm written underneath. Any person caught selling a counterfeit machine as a genuine Singer will be urosecuted without further notice. Illustrated price lists sent poetfreo. STANFORD and Co.. SOLE AGENTS For Australia and New Zeal ami, Corner of BOURKE aud RUSSELL STREETS, Melbourne. IMPORTS of SEWING MACHINES for 1873 Tito Imports of The WHEELER and WILSON MACHINES Show an increase ot over 150 PER CENT., or Four times more than Singer's, As proved by tlie Journal of Commerce. The great success of the WHEELER and WILSON Co. is without doubt due to the Superior Exctlleuce of their machines, and tho LITTLE EXERTION requird to work them, which rcudera them the most sultablo FOR FEMALES. These qualities arc owing to the Rotatory Hook System on which thev are roustructcd, and which combine GREAT SPEED with surprising durability and simplicity. It baslieun clearly proved that the genuine WHEELER and WILSON MACHINE Will do ONE-THIRD MORE WORK, and bos double the durability of the Singer.
