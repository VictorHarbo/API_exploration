The White Star R.M.S. Sultana, with the English Mail of the 20th October, arrived in the Bay on Satur- day evening, having made a very good passage of 83 days from port to port, and 79 from land to land. She was detained in St. George's Channel by a S.W. gale for three days, and has since then experienced mostly light winds. She brings 229 passengers, who have en- joyed generally good health, there not having been one serious case of sickness during the passage,- Melbourne paper. STEAM TO AUSTRALIA IN SIXTY DAYS.-The Liverpool and Australian Navigation Company's new Steam- auxiliary clipper, Royal Charter, 2719 tons register, F. Boyce (late of the Eagle), commander, was to be de- spatched for this port in November, with passengers to all parts of Australia. This splendid vessel has been built expressly for the company by William Patterson, Esq , with engines by Messrs. John Penn and Son, and combines all the advantages of a steamer with those of a clipper ship. As the steam is to be put on at all times when her rate of sailing falls below a given standard, this ship offers to the public the fairest expectations of performing the voyage in sixty days- Melbourne paper. THE HELLESPONT.-This favourite steamship has been sold by the Sydney and Melbourne Steam Packet Com- . pany. Her present proprietors have determined, in the first instance, to send her to Singapore, where she will deliver the Australian February mail to the P. and O Company, for transmission to Europe. She will leave Sydney on tho 9th of February, and Melbourne on the 10th, and we have no doubt but the demand for her ex- cellent cabin accommodations will be greater than can be supplied. The Hellespont is now having her bottom cleaned In Mr. Mort's dock.-January l8. Captain Gilmore, of the Wonga Wonga, reports the ship Thomas and Ann Cole, from Callao, bound to Mel- bourne, as having struck on a reef near Port Lonsdnle, shortly after entering Port Phillip Heads. After getting off, she was making about two feet water per hour in going up the Bay. The Thomas and Ann Cole Is the same vessel which struck on the Corsair Bock about l8 months previously ; she was then under French colours, and named the Antoinette Cezard. After being got off she was sold in Melbourne to Mr. Colo, whose name she now bears. The Corsair Rock Is situated a short distance from Point Lonsdale, and it is rather remarkable that the same vessel should have got ashore a second time, within so short a period, so near the place where she first struck. The Morayshire arrived on Saturday with 324 immi- grants under the charge of: Dr Bleech; they are clas- sifled as follows:--84 married couples, 128 single women, 39 single men, 38 buys, 28 girls, and nine infants. One birth occurred during the voyage. The ship is remark- ably clean, and the very healthy appearance of the passengers speaks most favourably for the excellent arrangements that have existed during the passage, and which are spoken highly of by all on board. Jan. 21 The James Booth arrived yesterday from Portsmouth, she having been compelled to put there. She has been particularly unfortunate on the passage, having lost several of her yards, but with all these impedi- ments she made Cape Otway on the 79th day. Captain Duthie reports having signalled the Walter Hood, hence, off Seilly, on 23rd October. Her reported arrival at Gravesend on the 22nd October must therefore be an error.-Jon. 21. The Preusessan Lovisa, from Stockholm, touched at Rio on 11th October, and the Cape of Good Hope on , 28th November, for the purpose of disposing of her cargo, which consists of deals, but she brings no report of interest from either port. The Saga, from Copenhagen, has been 154 days on the passage. She reports the Clarenden, schooner, I rom Mauritius to Sydney. 34 dnys out, on 17th December, inlotitudo 80S., longitude 03 E. There were no other vossels bound for Sydney when the Saga left. MELBOURNE.—Arrivals—January 11 : Clasmerden and Cherusker, from London ; Shooting Slur, from Liverpool. 12 : Sultana, R.M.S., from Liverpool. The wreck of the royal mail ship, Schomberg, was sold on Saturday, for £447 18a, This includes the boats and every thing obtainable.—Melbourne paper. The Government, through the medium of the Water Police, have taken tho first steps to an enquiry Into the circumstances attending the loss of the Schomberg, nnd far that purpose an Information was filed at the Dlstrlot Folleo Court, Melbourne, last Thursday, by Mr. Shil- linglaw, Inspector of thu Water Police, untlrr tho 235Ih section of the New Merchant Shipping Act, niininst Captain Forbes, for the wilful lost nt the ship, "by omitting to do eertnin lawful nets proper und requisite ta.be done by him for preserving the suid ship from loss."-Afetoourne paper.
