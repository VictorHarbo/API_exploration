Alert nud thu Rutlerlug endured by Robert Tontlng, tho sole survivor. It is an interesting book— published at one Hhillfng, a prico whiu tho reaoh of all— and we may well give Mr. Pouting credit for tho statement ho makes in the concluding portion of it, viz.:—" So far as ability and memory would permit, 1 have givcu a plain, unvarnished' account of the Incident connected with tho most trying time that I have ever experieuced." He, however, omitted to mention that a short time prior to thu wreck of his ship he enmo to us complaining of pains In Ids back. We then gave k.ai a few boxes of our Liver and Kidney Pills, and nfter using the contents ho told us thnt they had " set bim up and made a new man of him." is'ot cvorrone in called on to " Battle with the Waves " of tho SEA, but everyone, male or female, is called on, ntflometimo or other, to "Battle with the Waves" of DISEASE, aud it is only when the trouble coines that people feel they most require their strength. There is a good deal of truth, ua well as wit, in the say ing credited to a native of Erin's Isle, " Be japnrs, it's a fine thing to he well when you're sick " I Ilero Is another authentic case which is under our treatment nt the? present time. A sou of Mrs. Pineoit's called on us a few days ago and said 1 " On Cup day last my mother was away from home, when she got an attack of sunstroke, and since then she has been a great sufferer from pains in the back or the head and neck. Sometimes the pain extends all over tho head, and she has been tho most of her time in bed, having her head covered with vinegar cloths, as advised by the doctors; but with all their treatment and medicine sho is no better. Can you, Mr. Mcntiplay, do anything to relievo my mother?' "Yes," was my reply. "Take this medi cine and use it as directed, and ask her to cotno in to morrow, as I would like toseo her." He said, "That is inipnsaiblo ; my mother could not cotno out of tho house, sho is so bad." I told him that when his mothcrhad used my inodlcino nlie would find sufllcient relief to enable her to visit ino, and added, " I wish to nee her in order to be sure that it is nunstroke only thatshc suffers from." lie took tho iticdicino away with him, and the next jy.hl» mother was so uittch relieved that rite came in iwrsouolly to thank mo and tell how tho doctors first tried one mode of treatment and then another without her giving the slightest relief. She is now progressing favorably, tho pain has disappeared, and 1 trust In ono week more she will be restored to perfect health. A case such as the above is ono where n person requires not only strength of body, but also strength of mind to battle with the disease. Tho liver and kidneys being out of order aro tho cause of nearly every comploint, and those who neglect these important organs have only themselves to blame for tho Buffering they havo to go through. The only reliable medicines for getting and keeping these vital organs lu the state they ought to be aro Meutiplny aud Hons' Liver and Kidney Pills. If any person is unfortunate enough to suffer from tho cflects of sunstroke and can reach us within ono hour afterwards, we will cure him or her in fivo minutes. On rending this many may imagine that it 1b not genuine, or it is too good to be true, but by this time the public, or at least tho greater portion of it, must know that wo are not given to puff and blow, but treat, nil diseases with tho oldest and simplest method— that is, Herbs. With them wo have cured 313 cases of erysipelas and blood poisoning in less than 24 hours iu each case without having a singlo failure. With them we havo .also cured hydatids, without operation, for 14 years successfully. Wo also cure ringworm in half a minute, nud asthma when no other person can relievo it. Weakness, from any cause, and nil blood diseases, ezemn, &c.;, &c.; Cougha of long standing; in fact, all diseases incidental to adults and children of any age are successfully cured by us after all hope of restoring the patients has been given up. Tho fact of the matter is this : Many people suffer through prejudice, because they think that tho treatment hy a doctor isonly to he relied upon, but we would be very porry to think that we could not do more to relieve suffering humanity than the doctors do.
