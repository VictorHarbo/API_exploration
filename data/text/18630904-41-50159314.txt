The Asshur. -The barque Asshur, now lying at Levi's Whaif, is a very handsome specimen of naval architecture. In externals she is perfect, for the lines are symmetrical ; and while her hull pre sents a graceful lout enneuMc, it is, if possible, heightened by the proportions of her spars and rigning. She is now on her first voyage, and was built by Messrs. Duthie & Sons, the eminent ship builders of Aberdeen, who have already furnished several smart ships to the Australian trade. Her dimensions are i:t»i feet over all, 2ti.J feet breadth of beam, with ltil feet depth of hold; anil while her register tonnage is 4tMI, she has capacity for S50 Urns of general merchandise. She is classed Al for ten years at Lloyd's : and while reviewing her appointments, the manner in which every known patent is brought into use on hoard is icmarkable. Cunningham's patent self-reefers are on the ton sailyards, though Captain Collie prefers double sails. Trotman's ground tackle patent, pumps, distiller, windlass, and steering gear all contribute to r-nder the vessel as perfect as possible. In pas senger accniiimndatism the arrangements are ex cellent, haviii' a very neat main cabin, with state rooms fur twelve, and in tins particular point she is equal to anything in F'ort Adelaide for some time past : for while every attention is paid to comfort, yet the attempt at ornamentation has lieen suc cessful. Gilt mouldings and mahogany panels, fretwork, and upholstery contribute to render it equal to the most chariuin' hoiidi-ir, and as she is laid on from Port Wukciield for Lou Ion, doubtless slio will receive a full complement of passengers. Her commander is well known in the trade, and if his present intentions are realized he will become a veteran in the Australian service. VK-iSKUS IN HA~KHOUK.
