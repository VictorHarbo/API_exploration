TAYLOR'S REEF. rpHIS Reef, j formerly known as the: Prospoc JL tors' Reef,, is' situate ut Talgui, about twenty-two miles fromWarwick, and comprises an area of 600 feet by 400 ieet, with -the reef distinctly defined through the .entire length of the claim. . Tho stone U rich, the trial crushing having .yielded over six (6) ounces to the ton, and a lato crushing of thirty-five (35) tons yiolded ovei\ seventy (70) ounoes, which is; considered romarkably good, looking at the im perfect appliances upon tho ground for tho extraction of tho gold. There are two shafts sunk on the lino of reef,' one being sixty (60) feet iu depth, the other forty '(40) feot; both, showing a thickness varying from one (1) to' threo (3) feet. It is believed, from tho present;* indications, that if another shaft, were put down so as to Btriko, the reef at a greater depth, tho' stone so obtained would yield considerably moro gold, besides having a greator body of quartz to! work upon. The reasons why the former owners have brought the Property before tho public is, that they havo expended tho whole ot their money , m sinking the present Bhaft and developing tho reef, and have no means of carrying' on tho work further,;' but the Provisional Directors' ? aro convinced that, with the proper appliances on tho ground, the leturns would bo most satisfac tory, the stone having by lecout Mint assay been j proved to bo very rich. 0 / ' Tho 'following returns of cruslimgs (the ' original documents can be Been at the Broker's office).

'Sir, — Several of tho piovisional diroctoia of the proposed company deeming it advisable that one 'of their number should make a personal inspection of thovpropoi'ly, so ub to bo'quite'isuro that the report, on the faith of which they had themsolves purchased interests 111 il, was strictly correct ; I beg to state that by pouoral desire I have visitod the -ground in question,' tuking; with mo for comparison the original skotnlr made of tho underground workings in tho shdftfknown as tho : 60-foot Bhaft. ! ' 1 'Tho general outlines of the prbporty Ifound to bo ub repiesontod '''^ '' 'J ' My examination of tbo reef commonoed at a depth of about 40 feot? wheio it ib1 in width from 10 to 12 inches, and very cloaily defined, which is the' caso throughout. 'Tho locf nanows a httlo from this point, and then gradually widens out to about 18 inoboB ; 'this width is niuiulainod' for a few feot, and then gams to about 2b feet. Tho leef may possibly bo wider than this but as it dips to a hollow ut the bottom of tho shaft, whero thero had accumulated 12 or 14 incliCB ol' walor, oausod by the heavy ruins of tho' previouB-duys, 1 find it imposaiblo to stato tho width exactly ; but us nearly 2 feot showed clear, I havo no difficulty in determining 2V feet to bo tbo narrowest probable width at tho point whero sinking stops. 'Mr.Dunlop, aMolbournogontlomaninnoway interested, also descended the abaft, and tpgothor we knocked off 15 or 20 piccLS of btono from varioVia poiu1 ts of the reef at tho bottom of the ihaft, and in nearly tho wholo of those spool' xaons wo found traces and specks of gold. 'The 40-foot shaft I could not go duwii, there being no appliunces ready. It is ovident that there has been an immense amount of labor expended on this property ; and although other shafts may have to bo sunk to a greater depth, still these havo done good sorvice in proving tho ground, and will, no doubt, bo valuable auxiliaries in futuro operations. 'Thero avo several well-built huts, liouses, &c.;,-on tho ground, which can bo scoured by the Company for a very reasonable sum. 1 ' Taylor's Reef is very advantageously situated for crushing, being within half-a-milo of tho Condamino river, to which a tramway can be inexpensively made. 'The road from Warwick is good, and distant 22 miles, and from AUoru 12 miles. ' I will add that the wholo afl'air impressed me most favorably. 'lam, Sir, &c.;, ? ' CHARLES STREET.'
