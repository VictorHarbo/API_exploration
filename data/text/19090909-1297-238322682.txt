TRADE AND FINANCE. To a very': great. extent wo can: endorse tho following, which appeared la: tho "Statist" , ot July 31:— ; ..... . ..In Australia-. the. situation has. rarely been so favorable and tile outlook ho nssuroi. There Is now the llkcli- \- . iiuuu-oi a greater. umnigrnuoii inio 'iiic.uittmi . comment , than iv e have witnessed since 1 the -eighties and u greater expansion in production and consuming. powers. . ' . , /For oightccn years Australia, lias been., out of lash tern In England,' and lllat Is an exception ally long timo. v Canada has been greatly boomed :v. sinco.- then; South 'Africa ' has - boe'n boomed" . twice; Although in 1890 England lost heavily by. Argentina, that country has long since been received -back into favor;, and Europe, Asia, . America, and- Africa havo 'all been fashlonnblo slnco- Australia .has bsson,' ., "Well!1 Australia's turn Is coming. Partly, wo have had ourselves to thank for the protracted neglect". "Wo have . ilot .encouraged — rathor discouraged — Immigra tion,. and our process of paying oft and buying \- out . the British mortgago and land companies, and our. Labor-Socialist advocacy bavo all" tend ed to keep back the incoming tide. That tho British' investor lost n good deal on his Aus- tralaslan 'securities in 1892-3. is. certain; But it was.- less than, might, have been supposed,, for. tho, reason that so largo a proportion- of - the, British money, received here :. in tho past has been.lent. to us on. Government, stock. . But for a long timo. past our securities have paid tho British investor, exceptionally well, and- doubts with regard to .Socialism.. are passing away.! Then. theroaro the products we export to speak for,. us, and fhero.aro many- evidences . Lhat our people, are well-to-do. -Wo are, . too/ grappling more fully- with the problems of land settlement' and immigration. . . . . ! . . . . \- Some checks exist to tho investment of British capital. hero. Apart from, Government stocks, \- British, investments have not, as a whole;; in creased in Australasia in recent -years. "Wo . have no. railway companies, nor land eompanios , to oifer for -subscription,. and our. banks do not care for British deposits. But/there is increas ing -.scope for- capital in manufacturing con- corns,- and possibly . wo may . aeo some revival , tnthat direction. . There is only a 'limited, amount of capital attracted by 3% per cent., which wo-pay to investors In Government stock, und the-prospcct of 4% to 5 per cent, would at tract a much greater volume of capital. Such arc admittedly stumbling blocks.- Still, there are the openings for enterprise, nnd they are beginning to attract in some degree. , A conti- . ncnt 1 like Australia,, with-. £65,000,000 to £70,000,000 of exports, , and stoadily growing wealth, is bound to come to tho fore, and we agree with' tho "Statist" in thinking that In the early future the attractions for both men and money will come ' far more- strongly into evi dence.

Above nil, as the slackening of trade has produced the V-"" prevailing ease, so I look forward to the expected revivul of "trade as the most powerful and tho best stimulus to a return to healthier anil more profitable ( - monetary conditions, and I do not think .we are over- ; sanguine when We look for that " cviv'al . with- feeling of : considerable confidence. : IVhcn'it does take place I think it will come with rapidity end .make itself rclt . . all over the world; and, given only a fairly' bright out, , look as regards international polities, and frecdoni from labor disputes at Rome, we may. expect, before another year has pasacd, considerable development in every' dircc- " tlpn.'
