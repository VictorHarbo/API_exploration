AUSTRALIANS DONT LIKE FOREIGNERS Miss Esther Skouboe. Danish journalist, said she had beeu told in Canberra by a member of Par- liament that it was "unnecessary" for Australia to have "intellectual" European migrants. Said Miss Skouboe: "This didn't surprise me when I recollected what I'd observed here already - a fairly general diffidence to any manifestation of culture." A Danish journalist, she is in Australia, to write articles and a book. She added- "In Canberra, I also met the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell). He was very willing to answer all my questions. He told me Australians liked Scan dina\Â»ians. But having been here two months, and having talked with Mr Calwellt I can't help wondering how much you do like them "One thing which seemed very strange was Mr Calwell's statement that he'd never been abroad, and had no wish to go. I think it must be awfully difficult to be a Minis- ter for Immigration and Informa- tion, if you haven't been abroad. "The danger is that unless you know other countries, you tend to get a distorted picture of your own." Miss Skouboe said, that in Syd- ney she heard that Australia wanted English -and Scandinavian migrants first but she realised that Australians did not like foreigners. The general feeling seemed to be that foreigners got everything that Australians wanted exclusively for themselves.
