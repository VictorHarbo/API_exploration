THE PORT OF MEWCASTLE. The following Statistics of the Port of Newearile (collated and compiled from the meet authentic sources) have been carefully brought np to the present time, and will be studied with interest by a large number of our readers desirous of becoming more thoroughly acquainted with the past and present commerce of the princip*l northern har bour of this colony. 'We begin with some particulars relative to the coal exports from Newcastle dnringthe last sixteen years ; the figures being such as serve to manifest the very great importance of the trade in coal -the maiu staple of the Hunter River district. Tiie details areeuch as go to enow that this trade has gradually increased in magnitude, notwithstanding those occasional fluctuations of prosperity, which seem to be inevitable in all mercantile and industrial affairs.

At this first decrease, .recorded in our table, the coal exported was nevertheless as aacli as 139,938 tons. In 1859, the increase of the coal .exported over that of the previous year amounted to 101,463 tons. In I860, the like increase (still ascending) was 42,510 tons. In 1861, there was another decrease — in respect of the high total of the previous year— the amount of decrease being 27,896 tons ; that is to say, 255,940 tons, instead of 283,836 tone. During the next five years there was an annual increase of coal exporte, the least increase being that shown t-y the returns for 135-5. Thus, in 1862, the increase of exported coal was 101,533 tons ; very closely approximating to that which was exported in 1859. In 1863, the increase was 12,820 tens ; in 1864, 89,617 tons; in 1866, 2142 tone; and in 1866, 183,613 tons. In 1867, there was a third decrease— the amount of that decrease being 63,582 tons ; that is to say, 592,033 tone, in stead of 64o,SiS tons. I'n ISoo, iae Increase oi tile coal exported over that of the previous year amounted to 95,187 tons— 556 tons (in the annual inerca.r-e along) im,re taan was exported from the port of Newcastle altogether in thoyear 1854\. In 1869, the increase of coal expoited over that of 1868 was 18,368 tons. Laist year (1870), there was a fourlh occasional decrease on the antecedent year; tho amount of such decrease being 13,389 tons- 692,099 tons instead of the 706,488 tons of coal exported in 18159, From this it may be seen that tho coal exported annually through the p»t of Newcastle, including the trade coastwise, iatercolonial, and foreign, may be fairly estimated at seven hundred thowvid tent, representing, even in its present stage of imperfect development, a commercial and industrial interest of which the colony may justly be proud. All these figures may be depended upon, as they are derived from an official Eource. CHARGES ON VEB6EL6. As respects the charges on vessels at the port of New castle, the following statement shows the number of all vessels (inclusive of coasters) entered inwards and outwards at this port, and the charges actually paid during the year 1870:— Total number of vessels inwards, 2646—689,968 tons; the amount of dues paid thereon being £6457 4s. 6d. The total of vessels outwards was 2681—703,768 tons ; the amount of dues paid thereon to the Customs at Newcastle being £7289 3s. 8d. These figures may serve, in some degree, to show the extent of the present commerce £of Newcastle, the nature of which does not as yet seem to be generally recognised.

The following is the total amount of revenue collected at the port of Newcastle for the year 1870 : — Ad valorem, £874 15s. 4d. ; tonnage dues, £6457 4a. 6d. ; duty on spirits, &c;, £17,624 2s.

VESSELS BELONGING TO NEWCASTLE. All the vessels belonging to Newcastle are now required to be registered in the Custom-house, at the corner of Scott and Bolton streets, in that city; the sub-collector of the port (Mr. W. R. Logan) furnishing in every case a certificate of such registratien. The number of the vessels belonging to the port of Newcastle on the 2nd of September, 1871, thus registered, with their tonnage, in pursuance of Acts of Parliament, was as follows :— Nineteen vessels, whose tonnage is under 50 tons, the total tonnage of which was returned as 592 tons. Also thirty-three vessels, whose tonnage is over 50 tons, the total tonnage of which was re turned as 7197 tons. Grand total of tonnage of the fifty two vessels belonging to Newcastle— seven thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine tons. _ . From returns compiled from shipping registrars op to the 1st of January, 1871 (completed with much care, and published in the Serald in April last, by Mr. Frederick C. Jarrett), it is an ascertained fact that Newcastlehas the highest average tannage of any port in Australasia— ? namely, 180J per vessel Auckland, in New Zealand, has the lowest- only 6OJ per vessel. The like average for Melbourne is 165| tons; and that for Sydney, 136| tons. The average tonnage of the 6ydney vessel* w greatly re duced by the river eteamcr* and ferries.
