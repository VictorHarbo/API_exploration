INTRODUCTION. The month has passed over without any substantial progress having been made with public business in Parliament. This is the immediate consequence of the incapacity of Ministers, who are not able to submit a single proposition to which they can adhere, but have to take back and recast their proposals, and to do this usually more than once in each instance. The feeling in the House and in the country that the new taxation under consideration is unnecessary, and is the result of extravagance in expendi- turc, is undoubtedly Di ivung and at length a direct motion ch ulei]£,ing the Government on this issue has buen sub nutted, and is to be considered next week Nothing has been heaid of tlie Reform question of late in the Assembly Minis tors have been content to allow thou bill to slumber vvhilo they mado an ellort to dispose of then now taiill Tlie constitu tional party aie furn m the belief that tho time thus gn on foi consideration is telling against tho íncasuio, and they have evidence to support this conclusion in tho fact that a party of Corner members, who give tho Government a general support, but who aro strongly opposed to tho Reform Bill as it stands, havo had then views endorsed, and havo îocoived thanks for their scrv ices, at a publie mooting hold in mich a Ministerial stionghold as Creswick The Council has been steadily piocecding with tho reform mcaauio introduced by ibir Charles Sladen As it now Btands the bill proposes io lcduco the £00 iato paying franchiso of the Council to a £20 freehold qualification,

waa also tho cumulative voto pioposed by Sn Charles Sladen with tho same object m view Under these circumstances Sn Charles Sladen withdrew fiom the chargo of tho measure winch was proceeded with by Mr Cuthbeit, who it will bo remembered held oilice as Postmastor Genoral in tho present Government, but who resigned when the Refoim Bill of last session was introduced The Council vvero invitod to include in the bill piov îsions for a joint dissolution in cases of disputo betvvoon tho two blanches of tho Legislatuio, and for a final vote of the two Houses sitting togethor, but tho majority of membois thought that they were only called upon to reform then own Houso, and that anti deadlock proposals, dealing with the constitution as a wholo, should emanate fiom the Lower Houso At tho same time, it was satisfactonly indicated that tho Council is pledged to consent to a reform of tho constitution on this basis The bill has passed the Council, and has been taken chargo of m tho Assembly by Mr Munro, who sits m tho Ministerial Corner, and who it is understood will insist upon tho House coming to a divi sion upon it In the Assembly tho tariff and the estimates havo been dealt with in tho ludicrous and hurtful mannor alioady dcscubed Ono of tho most important discussions was on the proposal to placo a einige of Is pei gallon on coba, castor, and other oils not alieady taxed After a night had been wasted, Majoi Smith withdicw the duty on the ground that Mimsteis had ascertained that oils ara extensiv ely used to lubiioato machinery a f ict winch was known to most othei people beforehand A few dava aftorwaids Ministers sanctioned tho proposal to im poso a duty of Od on od, because thoy had discoveied that a man had staited an oil factorj in Collingwood The Opposi tion was indignant, anti as a Cornel mcmbei proceeded to " stonewall ' the motion, it was withdrawn Undei pros HUÍ o also, Mimsteis consontod to exempt reapers and bmdeis fiom taxation foi the piesent yeal A duty of 2 J pei cent on patent medicines was substituted foi a símil ti impost on drugs and it w as do cidod that secondhand fuinituio comm., into tho colony should bo taxed This lattoi impost is much objected to,because not only will it pi ess hal silly upon immolants from themothet countiy, but it is a "îeat obstiuction to nitei colonial traflic ihinng the piocoedin0s an eiloit w as mado t )

sliongest languago is painful o\ idenco of how tho spoliation policy advocated by Ministers has spread It was hoped at first that the wy w is merely a ciy, and that tho Government vv ould not respond

our Go vcmmeiit and the P and 0 Companj is still unsettled In our laBt Biimmary it was stated that the Victorian Government had offered to take the South Australian mails on the conditions of the present contract except that they were willing to reduce the special annual fee paid by South australia in consideration of the mail steamers malan?; a detour to Glenelg or the Semaphore from £\>,000 the amount paid under the present contract, to £2 ÜOO the South Australian Government demurred to continuing to pay a special fee and contended th it the cost of the service should be di Vided annually among the colonies uauif, it according to the actual weicht of the mails carried They alleged that under the tcrnia proposed by our Govern ment we should pay too little in proportion to the othei colonies and that in fact we should under the new contract get our cor responaence carried for notkin0 and indeed make a profit In reply to these representa tioiiB our Government made a suggestion to the effect that ui on South Australia under talune, to forward all her tegular mails bj the contract Bteamers if it should bo found after the new serv ice ha3 been in operation that the contributions and postages received leave a balance to the credit of Victoria the sub Bidy of £ JOO asked for from South Australia should be further reduced or be wholly dis pensea with if the financial results admit of that concession On the 11th October the South Australian Government agun wrote still urging their objection to the special fee and that the onlj fair and equitable arrange ment was that that colons should contribute to the cost of the contract in proportion to the weight of mail matter carried Die latest communication on the Bubject is from our Government to the South Aus traban Government date 1 2bth October It does not alter the position of ill airs Ob jections are urged in this communication to the proposal of the sister colonj that she should in future contribute onlj in propor tion to the weifclit of the mail matter carried It is pointed out ii tn al a that Victoria sends and receives proportionately a larger number of newspapers and smaller number of letters than South Australia and that, under the plan proposed the Beveral kinds of postal matter would be subjected to one tixed charge according to the gross weight which would be a manifestly unfair arrangement considering the differences in the rates of postage paid the principle now in force of ¡ixed transit rates based on the postages chargeable IB commended Kecent event3 have shown that there is in the farinera union mov ement as much v itnlity as IIB vv eil w mhers could hav e hoped for and more than the Ministerialists and protec tionists feared 1 arly in October the first conference of delegates from these unions was held in Melbourne About GO delegates were present representing upwards of 30 unions mall parts of the colony lue pro ceedint,s were chaiactensed bj unanimity and determination Itwasresolvedtliatthevanous unions should unite and be called 1 he Vic lorian 1 irmera Union A progiamme of objects including the following was adopted \- Ihe conservation

thoroughly identify themselvcB with and advocate the farming inteiest and pledge themselves to faithfully represent the principies of the union in Par liamcnt Knies for the conduct of business in the central and branch unions were agreed to Subsequent^ the conference waited as a dei utation upon the Attornej General in formed bim of the objects of the union and submitted that the grievances under which the farmers auDered ought to be redressed Ihej asked that the duties on all agricultural irai foments bags wcol packs le should be removed and ex pressed their willingness on the other hptid to have the protective duties on farmiug produce abolished Sir Brjan O Lo^hlen in repljint, endeavomed to show that the interests of the farming community were being carefully attended to by the present Government and told them that the duty on reapers and binders would be 'e moved for one season-namelj until the 30th of June next-and that in order to encourage the manufacturers to pioduce cheaper and better articles than the imported machines the Government were to give them bonuses He however, declared that on no account would the protective policy of the country bo interfered with and the only pro mise he could make to the farmers was that their grievances would be laid before the Cabinet Iht deputation showed they were far from satisfied at the result of their inter view Sev eral fresh branches of the union have been formed sinco the conference was held Both friendB and foes of the I ducation Act are on the alert At a largo public meeting held in Melbourne on the 3rd October íeso lutions were passed almost unanimously m favour of the maintenance of the Act in its entirety, and of every legitimate means being used to oppose any candidate for a seat in Parliament who will not pledge himself to oppose any sum of money, grant or subsidy being given bj the state to any rehgioua sect or denomination for educational purposes On the 4th October a deputation, represent- ing the XX esleyan, Independent, Presbyterian, Bible Christian, Primitive Methodist I ree Methodist, and Baptist denominations at Ballarat, watted on the Minister of rducation at Ballarat in regard to the question of religious instruction m state schools The numbers of the deputation who addressed the Minister spoke strongly m favour of the Lducation Act being carried out in ita integrity and protested against pay ment in any form being made to any Christian denomination They urt,cd that every poa Bible facility should be giv en to mimaters and other voluntary workers to malee use of the buildings after ordinary school hours, ind tiley giv e the Minister to understand that they altogether objected to the state teachers being called onto give special religious in Btruction Major Smith, in replyiug to tlie deputation, slid that no obstacle would be placed m the way of ministers uBing the buildings after school hours He would look with great disfavour on any board of advice that refused in application mado for that purpose He stated that if the varioua re ligious denominations would prepare scrip tural iesBonB which did not infringe on the secular principles of the act, he would he willing to use them m the stato schools In reply to another deputation, headed by the Bishop of Melbourne, which suggested that certain Scripture lessons be taught in state schools by the teachers and requested that if the department could not permit the state teachers to(,ive such lesions ni school hours it would nilovv the denominations to instruct the children before and after Behool hours, Major Smith pointed out that tlie adoption of tlie proposals in question would involve an alteration of the act, winch lie waa not nt present prepared to undertake as he believed thut i great majority of tlie people were opposed to my interference with the measure Ile reiterated ins statement tint the department would at nil times afford every facility for the ímpirting of re ligious instruction in

proposed reduction of wages from 12 os to £2 2s per week About 300 men turned out, the consequence being that work in a number of the mines has been suspended 'Hie reasons given by the mmeowners for the reduction of wageB are that thero has been i gradual falling off m their returns, without any corresponding decline in the expenses of working nnd that the industry is crippled by Die burdens

private establishments, and, as a consider ible nuin ber of their old pupils continued to attend them, the roll of children receiving state edu cation was by so many diminished 'Hie second cause is

On Friday, the 4th of October, Mounted constable Monks, of Avoca, was out looking in the bush for a man who had stolen some saddles and grass seeds from a person in Clunes On the back tracks of the Pyrenees be met a man dru inga waggon and a boy on horseback by his side Suspecting that lie had found his quarry, ho proceeded to ex arome the saddle on the boj'a horse, and when he was thus engaged the man called out "Bul up, and the constable found a revolver pointed to bia face ne struck it down with his whip, and at tho Bame niBtant it exploded, and the bullet went into the constables thigh The man took another aim, but the constable dodged behind a tree and fired in return, but missed, aB tbe man got behind the waggon The constable kept bim bailed up m tbiB position for an hour, when a boy passed, and he Bent him into Avoca for aBsistince A farmer also came along, and Monks asked his assistance, but tho man presented a revolver at him and the farmer bolted The man then made a run for it, dodging from tree to tree, and firing again at the con Btable, who followed lum for four miles, when he had to give up the pursuit on account of Ins wound and loss of blood The boy companion of the offender galloped away on the firing of the first shot The constable has bad tho bullet extracted from his thigh, and is progieasing favourably It haB been ascertained that the culprit is an old offender named I dward Evans, a re cently discharged convict, and a bushranger of the early days of the colony During tlie fight with the constable he said he would never be taken alive, and that he would become OB bad as the Kelly outlaws Hellas not y et been captured POLITICAL The amount of Parliamentary business transacted during the month is somewhat out of proportion to the time spent upon it Sir Charles Sladen's bill for altering the con stitution of the Upper House has, however, been passed in that Chamber Sir Charles Sladen declined to proceed with the meaBure on the rejection of the principle of nropor tional representation, and the bilhvas carried through the House by Mr Cuthbert The Legislative Assembly has been cbielly oc cupicd with the estimates and the tariff, with which Blow progress was made The tarifl IB now complete, apart from some important exemptions winch havo to be moved Tho House has adopted with some amendments the stamp tax duties proposed by the Govern ment 'Hie Government lieform Bill, which was read a second time last month has not vet been considered in committee Mr Bent has tabled a motion in the Legislative As- sembly declaring "that, m the opinion of this House, the Government, instead of nicreas ing taxation, Bhould reduce the public expen diture ' Hie motion ia to be discussed on V.V, eduesday next It raises the IBSUO whether the unpopular tarifl before the HOUBB should not be altogether set aside, and the prospecto of the motion are now being anxiously dia euBSed Mr Beut baa submitted the motion on his own responsibility, but he is under stood tobe receiving numerous promises of support THE Tvnirr The new duties submitted bj the Govern ment were disposed of on the 7th October 'Hie Government m connexion with tins mrtttcr pursued a singularly, erratic course, proposing ind abandoning duties "1 t' C most îeckless manner, us supporters or friends hapi cued to suggest When the oil duties came on for discussion, Major Smith roseand said that Ministers hav unascertained that oils were extenaively need in connexion with mining ind factory machinery, would withdraw their proposals Hie announcement was receiv ed w ith cheers and laughter Major Smith went on to Bay that one firm in the Barwon district was ready to put a first-class oil on the market, and the hon. member exhibited a bottle handed to him by Mr. Ince. The House proceeded to dispose of the new duties on jewellery, timber, and pearl barley. The proposal as regards the latter article was to impose a charge of 6s per 100lb., and at first it was strongly opposed on the plea that pearl barley is au article of everyday household consumption Mr. Harper, how- ever, explained that as barley had been taxed, it was a matter of necessity to im- pose a corresponding duty upon the manufactured article, and that the oppo- site course would be equivalent to taxing wheat and admitting dour free The equiva- lent duty to that imposed upon barley is 5s per 1001b , and thiB Mr Harper suggested should be the rate The amendment waa adopted Patent

point the Opposition seemed deter mined It wis in vain that Sir Brsm O Loghlen announced that one of his con Btituents was also making oil, and, in sup port of ina case, produced from a pocket 111 one of liiB coat tuiiH a bottle contamine, a com pound which was unanimously declired to have a filthy smell The objection was main tamed, and flnalts Mr Bent stone« ulled for one hour and a quarter, and when lie sat down Sir Brsan O Loghlen rose without the bottle, but with the stamp duts resolution in ins hand matead, and no more was heard of the oil question TILL-ii IMP TW DUTIES The following are tho particulars of tho alamp duties as they were originally Bub mitted by tile Government -Chequea ure to beir Id Btamp Bills of exchange under £25 pay Od , under £o0 they pay la , for every succeeding £50 tho stamp ia la A receipt stamp of Id is required upon all receipts over £2, but payments to banka, to charitable inatitutiona, to building and other provident aocietiea are exempt IJeeds tranaferring real property pay la for each £50 of v alue, and niBurance companies pay £2 10s for every £100 of premiums received during the year When Sir Brsan O Logh len submitted the propoaala in Committee of VvasB and Mean8, however, ho ex- plained that an alteration had been mide w ith regard to the insuranco companies T lie clnrge of £2 10a per cent on premiums is not 111 ans elbe to be less than £30, nor more than£i00 The lion gentleman expects the Id cheque stamp to realise £18,000 per annum, the bills of exchange will sield £32 000, the receipt stamp £14,000, stamps on land tianBfera £22,000, and the insur ance company fees will bring in £17,000 'I he total is £103,000 per annum, or about £70 000 for tlie balance of the sear , and this sum, the Attomes General BISS, will about make up tlie deficient!) 111 the revenue Mr Service said that when ho proposed stamp duties he also proposed to make lirgo and sssteniatic reductions ni the CuBtoma duties , while now the Government, 111 aubmitting Btamp duties, not only kept to the old Cus toms duties, but piled charge upon charge Ihe lion member expressed his belief that the new taxation was wholly unneces siry, and was the result of an extriva _ant expenditure winch could hive been easils kept down The Ministrs, says Mr Service, are making Victoria the financial scarecrow of tlie colonies However, aa lie could not defeat the duties, Mr Service said lie would do his best to improve them Ile took exception, therefore, to the new pro posai not to charge any insurance comp iny more than £300, as that arrangement would mean that a small and struggling comisan) should pas £2 10s per cent while a large and prosperous company would pas, perhaps, not so much aa £1 per cent per annum Mr Berrs, however, defended the limitation on the ground that it it is not fair to tax the results of enterprise and energy An important and interesting speech waa made by Sir John O Shanassy, who pointed out that the tax on commercial transactions would inevitably have a bad effect 111 ctuamg Riv erina accounts to be tranaferred to S5 dues, and if the accounts are transferred the wool winch liquidated thcin will Booner or later follow Mr Carter expreaaed hia conviction tint the Bame tiling would happen in con nexion with life insurance companies, and that policies would be taken out in the sister colonies, and that mones which ought to be inv este! 111 Victoria would flow out of the colons Mr Cooper allowed how the tax would affect the miner The cheques in which calls are paid must bo stimped, the receipts given for the calls must be stamped, the cheques pud awas for ordinary expenses muat be stamped, and the receipts given by the miners for their wages must be stamped 'lhuB the progressive companies will pay the stamp duty four times over Mr MTntsre supported Mr Cooper, and joined 111 a re quest I hat payment, for wages should be exempt Mr Munro was effective in point mg out how tlie tax will crush out tho smaller fire offices, and inevitably result 111 higher rates to the public, while Mr Ker ferd denv ed a melancholy pie isure from tho reflection that thero was still one place of refuge from the general taxation of Victoria, thoufch that place is the gaol When the matter was next under consideration, a long and noisy sitting had no other result than the passing of tho receipt stamp in ita amended £5 form 1 he discussion in Com tmttee of \\\ as s and Means did not turn upon this impost, but upon the billa of exchange stamps adopted at the previous sitting Sir John OShanasBS asked whether the Go vernment had considered hiB suggestion to name a maximum Bum, say £3, bosond w Inch u bill of exchange Bhould not be taxed, eo aa to avoid unduly pressing upon the heavy financial transactions now arranged on behalf of Riverina, New South Wales, and Queensland in Melbourne Sir Brsan O Logh len said that tlie Government had not seen their way to accept the suggestion The repls provoked much dissatisfaction, and Sir John O ShanaBsy s pioposal was vvarmls supported bs Mr Ramsay, Mr TranciB, and other commercial members, who Bpoke of the great v alue of the intercolonial trade, and the probability that the stamp tax would jeopar- dise UB retention After a discussion, Mr Berrs promised that the Government would further consider the point, but he said that there were two Bides to tlie question It was not altogether to the advantage of Victoria that c îpital should be diverted to the other colonies If the present large withdrawal of money were Btopped the rato of interest would probably fall, and the coiony could 1 oceiv e no greater benefit " ltiv erina, say s Mr Berry, "is not to be king 'ihe idea that the colony would be benefited by being deprived of a profitable trade was ridiculed bs Sir John O SlnnasBs Finally the receipt stamp waa adopted 'Ihe tax on life maur anees waa withdrawn, and the resolutions, windi are given ejscwbeie, were agreed to with some modifications TUL ESTIMATES 111 connexion with the Estimates, the naval and defence votes havo formed the chief topics of discussion Mr L L Smith moved to strike the defence vote out, but the chairman declinod to receive tho pro position as an amendment, because it was sinipl) a direct negative Mr Cooper then moved that the vote be reduced bs £3.000, and it appeared from his remarks and those of aucceednig membera that the idea was that the permanent artillery corps ahould be gradually diabanded, on the ground of its cost and its alleged uselcssuess Ihe members for M îlliamstow 11 and Ararat were the principal Bpeakers I malls Major Smith intimated that before the vote is re ported to the HOUBO ho will consult tho Chief Secretars and hia colleagues aa to the future of the permanent artillery corps, and will be prepared to make a statement on the subject, and also on the point aa to whether a select committee ahould bo appointed to report on ti e organisation of the forco as a whole The voto was then agreed to The naval estimates were discusaod at aome length, but not with the acrimony with which the volunteer vote was debited Tho total amount asked for waB £37,215, which included £13,955 for the Cerberus, £0,345 for tho Nelson, and £2.701 for the naval brigade, irrespective in each ínatanco of stores and contingencies Tho Cerberus crew num bera 124 men, tlie Nelson's 62, and the naval reserve conBiBts of 218 men Major Smith explained that it waa absolutely necessary to keep tho Cerberua efficiently manned until the forts wero completed aa the iron elad is at present the main defence of the harbour. Aa to the Netaon, he again maintained that in her converted state she is a thoroughly useful vessel He is quito willing that her speed ahould be tested, and that she Bhould bo taken outside of the heads Mr, Cooper Bubmiyted an amendment to dis b ind the Cerberus crew ond to rely on tho Nelson but he Bubseiuently modified the pro] osition so as to Btriko £10 000 off tho naval vote Mr Bent disparaged the Cer berus and suggested that the Government Bhould tow tier up the river and make a coal hulk of her But the discussion was practically terminated 1 y a Btatement from Sir John O Shanassy that he had given the subject attention, and that he was convinced that the only way to man the Cerberus if Bhe vv res to be used at all was to continue the prcBent Bistcni which had been proposed by Captain Panter On Mr Coopers amend ment being put it waB negatived by 10 votes to 12 VA hen the depar'meut of the Attorney General was being dealt with Mr Service called attention to the circumstance that the Ministry which had said a treat deal against nigh salaries and had defended the Black \\\ ed nesdny dismiBSalsonthcground that large pay ments ought to cease appeared tobesystemati cally increasing the high B lianes and the high salaries only Hie chief clerk in equity who receiveB £7r0 a year was taken by Mr Sor vice as n case ni joint Hie salary of this ofliccr has been increased by £H0 in two years becauBO he happens to be the relative of an influential member of the Government, Hie commander of the Cerberus was in Btanced as another case, and tho registrar general as a third , and the secretary the traflic manager and the accountant of the Ballway department have also been favoured and this in a time of general depression 1 hese increases to large Balancs are accord mg to Mr Sen ice the feature of the I stimates 1 he Attorney General declared that the chief clerk in c mity was even now underpaid and that nothing would have been said about his salary if the circum stance of his relationship had not been dis covered It might be the misfortune saul Sir Bryan O Lochlen but it was not the fault of the chief Hcrk in equity that that gentle man had inm for a son m law A three hours discussion took place upon the advertising vote It arose from a large number of members protesting against tho action of the Ministry in withdrawing Go vernment business from theDail/ Iclcgiaph and asserting broadly that the excuses mado from time to time wereBhams and tbat the real motive was political hostility Mr Service fearlessly Bald that the present Go vernment was the first winch had used this public vote for private ends Major Smith declined to enter into the question of the Dadj J elegiaph H" was not ni office when that paper waa atruck off the

Some, QI the goods and machinery from the United States have not yet arrived Since the end of September, when the shilling days com- menced, the attendance has amounted to 10,000, 14,000, and 15 CK>0 on Saturdays, the most popular dav of the woek It was never expected that the Exhibition would be a profitable undertaking The receipts will probablv be much more than sufficient to cover current expenses, and moy even pay interest for tho time on the original quthiy, but the cost of the Garden Palace and outside buildings will hardly be recov cred In other respects the Exhibition may be regarded aa a substantial success The display of goods is very fine, particularly in the British and colonial courtä but Tranco, Germany, Belgium, and the United States Beem not to have realised tho importance of making a repre Bentative show of their chief manutac tures Only a few classes hav e been at all well filled by them It is expected that the fine arts gallery-a special edifice built near tber Botanic gardens-will be opened on tho 10th November, and thatthenccforwa- dthere will be a marked improvement in the number of v ísitors Special show s of sheep and pigs dogs, poultry, and How ers have been already held, and cattle and horses are to follow No progress has yet been mado with the judging of the exhibits in the Garden Palace The ma chinery hall continues to be very backward in consequence of the late arrival of exhibits In spite of a multitude of difficulties, the commissioners have managed affairs very creditably The burned way in which they had to execute their arrangements, however, have operated prejudicially from the first Up to the present, the vv eather on the w bolo has been line and cool and v lBitors from a distance have greatly enjoyed both the Ethi bition and the picturesque scenery of Port Jacl son Numerous pnv ate and a few public lestivitiea have talen place since the opening Balls have been held on board the shipa of war Le It'iin (trench) and the Heligoland (Austrian), luncheonB have been given by the Mayor of Sydney, Mr Roberts, and dinners by the Ministry and the 1 xecutive Commissioners Several of the British exhibitors have sent in their goods very late to their own disadvan tage, but still in ample time to be judged Several attempts have been male to induce the commisioners to open the Garden Palace in the evening, but the many practical difli culties m the way, and the strong objections of the exhibitors, have shown that the pro posai is quite out of the question Another suggestion made is that the palace should b" opened on Sundays CONGREGATIONAL U\IO\T The annual sittings of the Congregational Union of Victoria commenced on Oeto ber 14 Tho Rev Joseph King was elected chairman of the union for the ensuing 12 months, and delivered the usual annual address on the position of the church lue rev gentleman dwelt at consider able length upon the education question commenting upon the discussion which our national By stem of education has been ex citing of late TIe deprecated the raab state ments made with respect to the alleged pagan condition of our state schools and gave many of the state school teachers credit for exerting a very direct and powerful moral influence for good both by their words and actions, in the presence of the scholars while he pointed out that there is still a residuum of religious knowledge in the national school books At the same time it was undeniable that there were some children in the Btate Bcbools whose elia ractera were being formed without any corrective moral or religious ínlluence But whatever alterations nuaht be made with a view to perfecting the Christian culture of the children the 1 ducation Act Bhould bo maintained Ihe act contains a germ which we ought to guard most carefully and resolutely from destruction, and the full tree will unfold m due time ne was con v meed that the only satisfactory basis foi ii national By stem of education in a 1 md where there are so many schools of religious thought is that it shall be secular lo use no other argument, it is impolitic, under such cir cumatances, to ask the state to provide religious training At the same time, the Government of a Christian land ought not to hinder those who are willing to impart such instruction Lvery facility should be given to the churches for carrying out that part of the work for which they are re^pon Bible Going on to speak of the claims of the Roman Catholics the rev gentleman strongly opposed a separate grant to their church, expressing the opinion that no ey stem could be invented to mete out out more equal justice to all thin our present system does Hie business sittings of the union commenced on Tuesdij, October 15 Hie secretary (the Rev J J Hallej) read the annual report whi hshowel that during the last year ti e work at some of the outljing stations had been lunfored by want of funds and by the migratory nature of the population but gave on the whole, a satisfactory statement with respect to the j tar s vv ork Among the delegates in troduced was Air Lloyd a representative of the Colonial Missionary Society of Lou Ion who received a very cordial welcome an 1 addressed those present principally with reference to the reí itions between the home and colonial churches It was subsequently decided to »end a letter to England, inviting the attendance of dele pates from the home churches at the next sittings of the uuion in Melbourne A lengthy discussion with respect to the educa tion question took pbee on the 17th, o i a motion proposed by the Rev A Godman m favour of illowmg Scrii ture leesons to be given in state schools by the teachers, when theso ]es°ons include only such secular subjects as geography history, and morals The

but work is still going on as usual at the exten euc quurU mines there Itseems now to bo the general opinion that Stawell must place its future dependence on the aid which rock porers will give, ns with the assistance of these appliances companies will be enabled to fall back upon and work stone profitably that has hitherto been regarded as not being payable At a meeting held by the repre Btntativea of some of the companies it waa resolved that an order bo Bent by cable for drills and air compressing limit 'Hie directors of the Extended minc were authorised to expend of i their reocrve

Northern Company and the Moonlight Company have also o.dered three drills, two for the former and one for the latter mine It is expected the machinery will be out here in about three months time The orders have been pent through Mr Thureau, of Sandhurst, who is the agent This may be taken to be only the beginning, as it is expected that all the other claims which are in a position to afford tho outlay w ill adopt the use of the borets On Titeadas last the Pleasant Creek Cro33 Reef Company, whose mine has been one of the richest in this colons i drilled into some stone which showed a splendid prospect of poid 'Hie discovery is considered a most important one, as there seems to be scarcels a doubt that the stone will prove to be the main branch of tlie Hat reef which has here tofore yielded exceedingly high returns The rush to the Emu Plains in the Stawell district, and another new rush near it, called the Extended, are what may be termed at a Btandstill, the nopulation neither increasing nor decreasing It was hoped the rushes vv ould hav e opened out a large extent of new alluv lal ground, but the countrs seems too poor, and tho good claims already proved are being worked out Prospecting is, however stiÜ carried on .n the neighbourhood of the rushes, and it may perhaps result in the find mg of moro pasable ground AGRICULTURE As the harvest season approaches greater

in the season, and the coming harvest promises to be the largest and moat abundant we have bad for y cors, a fact which is further confirmed by the renorts received by the Minister of Railways from the Wimmera district, which induce him to behove that tho quantity of wheat which vi ill be sent by ratl this year will bo threo times na large aa that of last year, and in order to get the roll ing

to refer more at length to the various articles thus affected by nome adv ices, in order that the general character of the improvement may be the better appreciated We observe, however, that the advances in the home market are chiefly confined to articles of produce primarily affected by the injury to the crops, and tho Bhort yielda over all Europe consequent thereon and can scarcely he considered the legitimate out- come of a genuine improvement in the home trade, which we have so long wished to see In common with tho rest or the world we benefit largely by tbo result, but we cannot help feeling that our gratification and aatia faction w ould hav e been all the greater if the improvement referred to owed its origin less to the losses and more to the gain of others than it has done lhere is, however, a gleam of sunshine in the fact that the rise in metala originated in the demand from America, and is the genuine result of improved trade there, through the splendid han est by which that country baa been blessed The month haa passed without any appearance of weakness in trade Scarcely a meeting of creditors to which the slightest interest could bo attached has been held Confidence, in consequence, has very materially improved, and busi ness throughout haB been quite free of that feeling of anxiety and dread the natural result of the dulness pervading all branches of trade so prominent a feature for avery long; period Early in the month a very considerable amount of relief waa afforded to traders by the intelligence regard- ing the settlement, by composition of 14a per £, of Messrs L Stevenson and boas business, and the fact that " proceedings in bankruptcy hod thus been avoided " Private telegrams at same time confirmed the an nouncement published regarding the settle- ment referred to, and added that further arrangements had been entered into by which the firm have obtained the command of a large increase of capital, thus placing them in a stronger position than they have occupied for years We were at same time authonsed to Btate that the firm will pay creditors the full 20a in the £ out of the first profita made In our hat of sequestrations for
