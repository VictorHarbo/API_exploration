This will bring a great deal of foreign capital into that Presidency, and if gold quartz be turned out in a fair proportion of the mines in paying quanti ties, a new era will have commenced there, both for capital and labour. .

The corpse presented a most unsightly and charred appearance, and it is not known how the man met his death, but foul play has been surmised from a large clasp knife being found open near the bones of the fingers of his right hand, and he was lying when found on the broad of his back. Aa old woman was seen en Friday evening in the hut (which was a common resort for ' trackers,') but has not since been seen or heard of. The man, though of that class commonly known as ' trackers,' was possessed of some money.
