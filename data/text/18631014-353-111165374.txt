^ate^t Kttteiitsencf . Adeiaide.— Friday, October 9.— We have private advices from Foo-Chow-Foo to th.e IStti Au^aet. A decline of two taels for light Savoury to medium teas had takeu place, and from one to two taels for good to medium. The fall in good teas is attributable to the ex*' tensive demand in Australia for lower priced teas. The stocks in chet-tB of all descriptions of teas amounted to R4-RI-l!tiq. Th« finvernnr has recpived an ImDerial Act setting at rest all doubts respecting the validity of local acts. The Imperial statute states that all acts passed shall havo the force of law from the date when they re, ceired the Queen's assent, notwithstanding technical in. formalities. The Coriel sailed fur Melbourne August 12th, with 4-12,000 lbs. ; the Armistice for Sydney on tbo 18th August, with 34-0,500 lbs.; the Meander tor Mel bourne, same day, with 400,000 lbs. , the Thomas Brown for Adelaide, with 231,100 lbs.; the Trepros for Mel- ? bourne, with 301,500 lbs. tea. The Keepsake and Juno were loading for Australia. The total exports to Aus tralia for the season ending August 18th, amounted to 3,461,171 lbs. tea ; against, i,0C-0,im lbs. last year.
