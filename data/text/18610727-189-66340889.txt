FLOUR, GRAIN, &c.; (Review for Month ending 25th July, 1861.^ The return of a general election again brings forward the question of protection to native in- dustry. Thisquestion seems imperfectly under- stood by many. At present rate of wages, the labor alone in producing a bushel of wheat is uer.riv 50 per cent, on its present value. IC im- migration is fostered, and labor becomes cheaper, that will be the best protection we can have. Capital will be invested in house-building, while milk, distilleries, &c;, will come into operation, and thus bid defiance to foreign im- ports. If the system of protection ii JW agitated for be carried out, it will fall most heavily on the gold miners. Flour.-Imports since 1st inst, consist of about SOO tons, principally South Australian, which is under an average; however, the diffi- culty of making sales has induced exporters in the neighboring colonies to hold back supplies ia meantime. Recent exports to Mauritius, New Zealand, &c;, amount to about 400 tons. I Prices are fully ¿1 the ton under last month's rates, quotations being for country aud town j made, £16; Tasmanian, £15 10s; Adelaide j sorts, £15 10s to £16 10s; Hart's and Magarey's j superfine, £17 per ton; American, 40s to 42s per barrel. Wheat.- Imports are considerable from South Australia as well as Tasmania, amounting to 15,000 bushels since commencement of month. Prices have given way; very large parcels of damaged and ill-conditioned wheat come into the market, finding bu3-ers at 3s 6d to 4s 6d, while milling parcels of Country and Tasmanian sell at 6s to 6s Gd ; and South Australian, 7s to 7a 3d per bushel. Oats.-The Government statistics showing a very great increase in the production of this t^rain, directly influenced the market. The imports from Tasmania and our own coast, tliis month, amount to about 70,000 bushels. The tendency of the markrt is downward f.gain, and prices are fully 2d to 3d per bushel lower, closing quotations being-for Danish, Scotch, and Irish 3s 9d to 3s 10¿d ; Dutch 4s ; Cal- cutta, 3s 9d ; Californian 4 s ; Colonial, 4s "d to 4s 4 Jd per bushel. Barley-Stocks are light, and prices nominal. Cape, 5s ; English malting, Gs per bushel. Maize.-Imports are on the increase, but not in excess of requirements. Prices range from 5s to 5s ld per bushel. Gram.-Stocks are light, and out of first hands. Bran.-Imports have fallen ofl^ owing to the low prices ruling. Better prices are now ob- tainable, closing quotations being 1 ld to 15d per bushel. Oatmeal.-Imported is dull of sale, Colonial having takeu its place, closing quotations being £10 to £2 ) for imported ; Colonial £25 to £20 per ton. Malt- Imports and advices of shipments to come have inflenced the market, and brought down quotations, being-for best English, Os 6d to 10s per bushel. Hay ranges from £4 10s to £7 10s per ton. Potatoes aro unsettled, and prices rule about £5 10s to £7 per ton. Onions have been long depressed, but aro now improving, prices niling at £6 10s to £9 per ton.

Trans- actions in the import market have been nearly nominal. By auction but little business has been effected ; the only sale of any note has been that of a parcel of damaged white Cossi pore sugar, by Messrs Fraser and Cohen, at Messrs Dalgety and Co's bonded stores, at from £18 lös to £49 per ton for cash. Messrs Power, Rutherford and Co report having effected the salo of the Woolgoburg Station, near Mosquito I'laius, with 1000 head of cattleand 140 horses, for£19 0'j0. The run is nearly all fenced in, and the improvements extensive and complete, ; everything given in at the above price. Mr George Wright, of Geelong, sold yester- day that well-known old establishment called the Vulcan Foundry, in Little Malop street, the property of the late Mr Croll, with all the buildings and machinery attached, for the sum of £1750 ; terms-the purchase money to run over two years at 10 per cent. The purchaser was Mr James Harrison. The original cost of thc machinery was about £4500, all now as good as new ; and the land and buildings cost Mr Croll about £1500 more. The sale is looked upon as a good bargain for the purchaser. On thc previous day, Mr Wright also sold the pro perty known as Weaver's Garden, of four and a-half acres, for which £4000 was refused three years ago, for the sum of £450.
