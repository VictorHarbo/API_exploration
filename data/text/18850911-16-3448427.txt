Secretary Pro. Tem. MR. JOHN WILSON, 5 ExohaDgo, Queen-street. The increase and development of the resources of the colony of Queensland during the past quarter of a century justify the belief entertained by the Promoters that the present is an eminently favourable opportunity for the establishment of another Banking Company, having its headquarters in Brisbane, and occupying some portion of the field of operations, which has proved, and still continues to be so attractive to the financial institutions of Great Britain and the other colonies. With this view the Provisional Committee now issued this prospectus, setting forth the objects to be attained, and invite their fellow colonists, by taking shares, to co-operate in founding the proposed Bank. The progress of the colony, and the opening that exists at the present time for a new Bank, with a local proprietary, may be best realised by comparing the advances made by the Banks here in the years 1870,1875,1880, and 1885. 1870 east quarter) .... £1,309,769 1875 " .... 3,451,616 1880 " .... 4,053,923 1885 (first quarter) .... 9,798,898 During the same period the deposits lodged in the Banks in this Colony have risen from £923,556 to £6,26l.3:<3 and the note circulation from £116,921 to £607,036. At the same time the Savings Bank' deposits have risen from £332,8 to £1,235,050. The population has increased from 115,567 in 1870 to 313.245 in 1885. The Royal Bank of Queensland, Limited, will be a bank of issue and deposit, and will conduct all usual banking operations. It is proposed to open the Head Office of the Bank in Brisbane soon as the services of a duly qualified Staff of officers can be secured. Branches will be opened in the principal towns of the Colony from time to time, whenever it is deemed expedient. No promotion money will be paid on account of the launching of this institution. The only charge made will be for the ordinary preliminary ex- penses of printing, advertising, broker's commission. Sec. Should the bank not be floated the application money will be returned in fulL So soon as the Share List shall be closed and the Shares allotted, the Provisional Committee shall call a meeting of shareholders, to be held at Brisbane. At this meeting the functions of such Provisional Committee will cease, and the shareholders will then proceed to elect a Board of Directors, who shall be empowered to take such steps as may be necessary for completing the organisation of the Institution, appointing a General Manager, and commencing business. Applications for shares (which will be allotted to each applicant ratably according to the number applied for are to be made on the annexed form, accompanied by the deposit, or by the banker's receipt, addressed to the Chairman, Provisional Committee, at their office, S Exchange, Brisbane. Applicants up-country may send the amount of deposit on application, by Banker's Draft or Post Office Order direct to the Chairman, Provisional Committee at Brisbane. The share list will be closed at noon on Wednesday, 30th September, 1885, or earlier in the discre- tion of the Provisional Committee, it the shares shall have been fully applied for. WM. MILES.
