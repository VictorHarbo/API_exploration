The Havilah arrived early on Tuesday morning, after a passage from Melbourne of ordinary dura tion. Captain McEacharu anchored off' the Sema phore Jetty in such a capital position that she was reported in yesterday's papers. -t The Frowning Beauty is still detained at the Queen's Wharf for want of water to float her from her berth. The Northumberland was towed down the rivet as far as the North Ann on Tuesday afternoon. The Agxes Jessie, timber laden, from Port Frederick, arrived on Monday night after a very good passage. The Cosco sailed to the anchorage on Tuesday morning, but the ship's papers being detained by the Consul, the vessel is in consequence unable to clear out. It appears one of her seamen was in Melbourne written off the articles a.? a deserter by the Consul there, but after the vessel sailed he eilled on him, and demanded his wages, and as the Congo had left for Adelaide the claim against Captain Christensen is here enforced, ami he is detained till some arrangement can be made. His offer is to allow the matter to remain in abeyance till it can b« tried on its merits in Denmark, hi order that the vessel may proceed on her voyage; but to this there are objections raised, and m the meanwhile the ship and cargo are subjected to the inconvenience of laving at anchor with a fair wind for the prosecution of the voyage.
