THE RUSH TO CANADA, 7 -6 , GROWTH OF AMERICAN TOWN!, POPULATION POURING IN. EX-LORD' MAYOR'S IMPRESSIONS. v "Australians have no conception of the w 17 in which Canada is developing her- lands said Mr S 'S Lees, ex-Lord Mayor of Sydney, who arrived from the East by the Japa- Rose steamer Kumano Maru yesterday after nine months mostly In Europe and America. The Canadian Pacific Railway alone has been negotiating with an American syndicate to sell them 900,000 acres of land The sand cate will irrigate it cut it up and sell it In farms on easy terms The Canadian Pa. close Railway Itself is doing the same thing in other parts They put down irrigation works, and sell the freehold over an easy term of years Who, Regina which is an old ranch that they have lately cut up-is going to be a great city The streets have not been levelled at People walk along a raised platform of boards at the side until the street is made But they have the whole plan of the city laid down before they build It. "Nine years ago Seattle, in the United States, had a population of 6000 Now it has 250,000 Australians have not the remotest idea of the way in which people are pouring into America, not only at New York but at Boston and a dozen other big cities Americans told me that they realised it was their salvation The normal increase of the ne goes is faster than that of the whites, and the great safeguard against the blacks Is this huge immigration of Europeans It was interesting to find that they were guarding against the danger of black America by rail gration The Canadians have, in cutting up their land a great advantage over us in their big rainfall, and their snow-fed 1 Rivers for irrigation The water alone which is drawn away from Niagara for the electric power plant, after they have finished with it comes out in a volume such as you cannot see In Australia They are working railways 180 miles to the south and tramways 30 miles to the north 2n Canada from the Niagara Falls. NO JUNGLE "I walked through Swifts meat works in Chicago for a mile and a half up and down, and then I had not got to the end there was nothing of the ' Jungle' about it. The place was very clean The wages as far as I know, were good And not an atom of the beasts they kill goes to waste When they got the meat a man stands there and pitches the heart into one hole in the floor the liver into another, the horns into another and so on There is a receptacle for every part of the bullock, and a use for every bit They even make soap-common and perfumed-out of those bullocks "An unskilled labourer In America gets as much as 10s but Ss here would go as far as 10s In America London is a far cheaper place for ordinary living than America I have seen good Australian meat sold in London market at 3d and 4d a lb You couldn't get it for that in Australia And then you go to another place and see them selling rabbits at 6d each , IMPROVEMENTS IN OTHER. CITIES "London is being wonderfully Improve!, Some of the suburbs are magnificent We do not use our privileges here in Sydney as we ought We have such ample chances that we are letting them slip Other cities are rushing on improvements Their millionaires are not slow to give money to the improvement of the cities in other countries. I In New York the Riverside Drive is to be increased In Hongkong they have a water- side drive three-quarters of the way round the Island " Mr. Lees was exceedingly struck by the size of the New York ferries The passengers from the upper decks and the lower deck as well do not have to crawl up a gangway,' he said They walk straight along the deck down a trap In the end of it on to the street where the street cars ara, The ferries have beautifully fitted saloons, The train ferries both at Albany and at Helsingfors in Norway- on to which the C. P. R. and the Danish trains run and ara chained down for the crossing are just like our North Shore ferry Just like the old Bungaree, only many times bigger The rails are automatically raised to any height that is required The crossing at Helsingfors takes about half an hour and there must be plenty of sea to 1 oil In sometime,. The passengers In these States can get out and walk about during the crossing There are men to shine your boots If you want them "I found that the Americans all looked on Sydney as the place where their fleet received its best welcome Their boys seem to have made it out so They know a great deal more of Australia than they used they look on it as a great country of great resources, but as far away for tourists to visit AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE BILL RAISED "There was great interest in England even the Australian navy Over the Defence Bill establishing the Australian land defences I read In the 'Dally Graphic' the highest praise that I think I ever saw written The Bail it was one of those accomplishments for (which praise was futile The work itself owes its own praise "In Japan when I was there a telegram was published in the press that the New South Wales State Government had ordered 5000 tons of Japanese coal and that if the strike did not break up In ten days another 60 000 I tons would be ordered There was great activity In Japanese harbours loading coal
