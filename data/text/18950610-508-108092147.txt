ROUND THE WOMB. . — -^ — — ♦ ? The Dutch brigantine Anna arrived at Gibraltar April 30 from BarL She re ported that on the previons Sunday after noon, while becalmed off the Biff coast of Morocco, she was attacked by eight boats filled with armed Riffians. The latter fired as they came alongside, and both the master'and mate were struck, the former, being killed. They then ransacked the vessel, and. carried off a portion of the cargo as well as the sails and provisions. The Biffians did not leave- the vessel till the evening, when, a light breeze spring ing up, they all went ashore. The Anna was brought into Gibraltar with some diffi culty. She had the body of the master aboard. The mate, who was severely wounded, has been taken to the hospital. At their sale rooms in London lately, MesBrs. Christie, Mason, and' Woods dis posed of, among other articles, a number of racing cups, the property of the late Duchess of Montrose.- A number of well known sportsmen were present at the sale, and some excellent prices were realised for some o: the late Duchess's racing trophies.

Among the thirty-eight applicants for the post of police-sergeant, in Podgorz, Wesi Prussia, the other day. one gave an eloquent account of his qualifications. He was, he said, besides being well acquainted with other occupations, a gardener, a car penter, a wheelwright, a shoemaker, a stonemason, a writer of poetry — could, if necessary, write a comic song for a music-hill ' tarn ' — and was ready for anything. The report that Professor Keeler, of Alleghany Observatory, has solved the proble ii of Saturn's rings is calculated to interest astronomers, even though his dis covery is, apparently, merely a confirma tion of what has hitherto been only a pious belief. He has, so it is claimed, proved that the rings of the ' belted ball ' are composed of innumerable satellites, or .other small worlds, which do not revolve at the same speed round the planet. But this is substantially the hypothesis — the theory, indeed — which was enunciated nearly twenty years ago by M. Trouvelet, of the Harvard Observatory, and is now, for lack of a better explanation, very generally accepted. If, therefore, Dr. Keeler has ascertained nothing more than this, the chief merit of his investigation must consist in the completeness of the spectroscopic and other details by which he supports this remarkable advance in astronomical science. - The play ' Gossip,' in which Mrs. Langtry wears some wonderful dresses, is dated by its author four months ahead, and the action takes plaee at Biarritz. The fashions illustrated are supposed to be those of four months hence. The gowns are creations of Paris costumiers, and the ladies of Boston, U.S.A., where Mrs. Langtry has been acting, are said to be much impressed by tKese prophetic frocks. One of the other actresses in the pl*y an pears in the beach scene in a bathing cos tume of black satin with a very short skirt trimmed with three narrow rufiies of white lace, and an extremely large sash'. A bow of scarlet ribbon ties the bodice together in front over a chemisette of white muslin. There are no sleeves. Her bathing shoes are tied on with yellow ribbons, wound round and round the black stockings and tied below the knees. A scarlet handker chief, tied in front with two pointed ends standing erect, forms the headgear. — London Paper. An article published in the .New York ' Independent ' shows the increase and. decrease in the various American relifjiots bodies during the last four years. It ap pears that the Roman Catholic Church exhibits the largest growth, her churches increasing by upwards of 2000 and her communicants by 1,243,568. Irish immi gration to a considerable extent accounts for this. The Methodists- come second, with an increase of 352,245 communicants. The third body, ' The Disciples of Christ,' is almost unknown in England, while the Presbyterians are fourth. .All the other churches are at a considerable distance from the first four. The Theosophists claim an increase of 1085, but three sects show a decrease — the German Evangelicals, the TTniversalists, and tbe New Jeru salemites. The Mormons, or Latter Day Saints, notwithstanding recent legislation, still continue to show a considerable in crease, both as regards churches and communicants. Mr. Frederic Bernal, British Consul General at Havre, reports the almost total disappearance at that port of British sail ing-vessels in the carrying trade of dye woods, aide's, and minor article of produce from the West Indies and South America, whose places have been taken by Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, and German shipping. He says: The.trade was formerly largely done~by uswith a handy class of vessel, . manned, byexcellent crews, who were gene rally shipped at and belonged to the, smallerports round our coasts, and were good seamen. The rfisnlc of some inquiries I '-'have made shows th&,t while a con siderable number of the vessels now doing the trade have : been purchased from us, a certain number are still owned by British subjects.havingbeenplaced under a foreign Sag to avoid' the formalities and restric tions of oar laws.
