Young Danes Allowed Entry . ? Â«^- ? SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION BY CONSUL Perth, March 31. As a result of representations from Canberra, it is probable that no further action will be . taken against two young Danish seamen, who left their ship at Fremantle on March 19. They were charged in the Children's Court with being prohibited immigrants, and the Danish consul protested against their detention in eraol. on the ground that they were the type of immigrant Australia needed. When the boys appeared before Mr. A. Schroeder in the Children's Court to-day, the magistrate told themi that they must remain with the guardians whom he had ap pointed to them, and they expressed pleasure that they had been allowed to remain in Australia.
