CHARLES ROCK 42 Gladen Street. East Brunswick. for 33 yers in the Melbourne Tramway Company. writes this letter (2/4,12). which is of special interest to all Rail way and Trncway men, to CLEMENTS CLEMENTS TONIC LTD. "In December, 1911,1 caught cold and serious pleurisy. For three days my temperature was 104 degrees. My life was des paired of, but through taking the doctor's advice I live to-day, he advised my wife to get Clements Tonic, as 'THERE WAS LIFE IN THAT MEDICINE.' They were the truest words he ever uttered, and I would have been dead only for that grand medi cine. My wife paid 2/3 for the small bottles, had she paid £40 she would have had good value. I have seen a lot of letters about CLEMENTS TONIC in books and papers, but what I find fault with is that every writer has utterly failed to give the proper value of that medicine. (Sitaed) CHARLES ROCK." A Cairns resident writes: "A line shewing the result of taking Clements Tonic. 12 months ago I had an attack of yellow jaundice, also a very serious nervous attack, loss'of appetite, great weakness and lassitude. Acourse of Clements Tonic soon restored me to health and vigor." Fee Necces oseakol a afh Led e nleloe Typl~i~t Fease, Sick ttsaajael,e,' Sluaggsh Lrnee, Coestipasic:., ae tPant Sleep-lake it.

I gave her a number of cough rewe dies, and- I was always taking her to therdoctors, and they gave her many cough remedies, but nothing had any effect wha'ever. One day a lady re commended me to' try Dr Sheldon'a New Diecovery and said it was very good for Whoo pig Cough, so I got a bottle and gave her three and sometimes five doses a day, and it seemed to re lieve her almost at once, and in a week's time you would not know her; she did not look the same child.
