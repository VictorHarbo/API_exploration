He did not put it forward that this or any other Ministry would be debarred from doing so from any sense of decent) or fairness out no Ministry with the slightest intelligence would venture to proclaim a state of sen oils industrial disturbance when actually there was nothing of the sort Any Ministry that did that would be flung out of office No Ministry would care to use these powers despotical!) Advice to Opposition Ah Brennan (Y ) - A. You used them fraudulently Mr Bruce - Let me give members of the Opposition a word of advice although I know that they do not usually relish advice from me Do they think that the people will tolerate them saying in this House that the people did wrong and that they had no right to return this Minis the Mitlil I suggest that they would be better advised to take their defeat in a sporting spirit and not to of time after the event? I agree with Mr. Charlton that there are trades union leaders vi who work day and ingot- to my art and to settle indus of land dispute and to try to counteract the work of the extremists who lead their followers to ruin Such men are doing an invaluable service, and this measure does not affect them. It is intended to deal only with men who in go the continuance of a struggle which vitally) affects the nation after a proclamation of serious industrial disturbance has been issued I repeat that this measure is not aimed against trades unionism or its leaders but only against those who are trying, to destroy our national life and to bring untold largely on our people (Ministerial cheers ) Mr. Scullin s Views Mr Scullin (V ) said that the Prime Ministers speech explained why his pain had been so successful at the elections Mr Bruce had said that the bill would effect what he had promised the people and not what is actually would do The bill would never have been before the House had it not been for the fact that the Ministry) had fought the election on a rigged up stunt issue The Ministry) was now trying to save its fate before the people whom it had fooled In the House shortly before the election campaign had opened Mr Charlton had made a speech in which he had declared emphatically that the Labour party was not connected with communism or the revolutionary) movements He (Mr Scullin) find load what purported to be Mr Charlton s speech in the newspapers on the follow- me, day and he could only say that it was the most badly reported and slaughtered account that he had LVCI seen He did not wish to discuss the Fascist question or tin letter', about which there had been so much talk He was asked to say how ever that the Prime Minister's principal point in den) mg the authenticity of the document had been that it had been dated weeks before it was known that an election was to take place Personal!) he had known that in election was to take place sometime before it was actually announced He had known because of the great public halls in the country had been booked by the ISatonahst part) for the night of November Id before any announcement had been made concerning an election ! or a workman to say, I will not sell my about below a certain price was treason, but for an employer to say, I will not sell us) goods below a certain price meant ii knighthood Closer co-operation and a better understanding must exist if industry were to be carried on, but this bill de stroyed both Mr Parsons (3 A ) said that it had been claimed that strikes were not more free spirit in Australia than the) were in other countries but in other countries the, strike was the only weapon which the workers possessed while in Australia arbitration was supposed to be the law Much had been said by Labour members against de portation, but it was another word for expulsion which was largely practised by trade unions When. Jil Scullin had begun to defend the Fascisti letter, he had begun to wonder whether Mr Scullin knew anything of the circumstances in which it had been forged Mr Scullin asked for a withdrawal of this statement Union Dlsorganlsors Mr Parsons withdrew Union organisers he said, should be called disoitHiuscrs Hie) robbed their followers of tin LI tatest Sift in life which was contentment I he using force for the improvement of the conditions of labour had always been Christian) Communism was opposed to Christian), substituting selfishness for use selfishness Mr Bieiman-Communism was the essence of Christianity in its early days Mr Mahony (N S W ) said that when during the war Mr Hughes passed a measure declaring the I W W illegal he had at least the courage of his convictions in that respect he differed from the present Ministry and although it had declined throughout the country) that Australia was being assailed by associations which were attempting to disrupt the peace order and good government of the Commonwealth, had not the courage to decline the chief menace the Communist assets lion, illegal If Communists were a menace why did not the Ministry take action against Jock Garden' The real purpose of this humbugging measure was to strike a blow at trades unionism The Ministry could not destroy) trade unionism li) tyranny of common Members of Parliament as sensible men should sit down and set what was the matter with the militia ml system remembering that the Arbitration Court had long outgrown its usefulness Mr Lambert (N S W su 1 that trades unionism was of such a character that when it was assailed, when burdens were heaped upon it and stUmps were lindo to crush u then it rose to new heights, gained new strength, and marched onward invincible) Repressive legislation such as this was a mistake, and he sincerely hoped that the Ministry would withdraw it Once "'in the deportation and imprisonment of industrial! leaders and the whole country would be thrown into the soil In stead of deporting one or two men it would be necessary to deport 50,000 or 100,000 unionists of indomitable courage, and determined to maintain their liberties Mr Gardner (N S W ) said that he had listened to splendid speeches upon the lights of trades unionism from members of the Opposition and he acknowledged that they probably knew much more about trades unionism than most members on the Ministerial benches He could not however, see that those speeches possessed any relation to this measure, which he held did not affect the rights of trade unionists li must be remembered that not only unionists but primary fire duceiR also had rights They did not receive weekly wages, but were dependent upon the sale of their produce Grave labour troubles such as the British seamen's strike jeopardised the livelihood of these men, and it was with such cmci gencies that this bill dealt The debate was adjourned, and at 7 minutes to 10 o'clock the House adjourned till this morning at 11 o'clock PARTY MEETING DISCUSSION. Amendments Suggested At a meeting of the Nationalist party in the Federal Parliament yesterday the Crimes Bill, now under discussion, was considered On the broad principles of the measure approval was unanimously expressed, but on some points amendments have been suggested for consideration in committee
