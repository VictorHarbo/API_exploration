Tito net,'pfoTIts fdr thc past year are £27,8G4/lowe'r, than shown in 1920, but this ls after-providing £15,000 more for depreciation". Thc net results represent an average monthly prout of £3,420 ns against £5,750 and £2,090 respectively "fur the two previous periods. Since this company first started all liindn ul' com- petitors have entered tho Held, and the ?earnings must bo affected not only by faro cutting but also by tho higher operating expenses to obtain business. Shareholders must therefore congratu- late themselves that a satisfactory pro- fit lias been shown instead of a deficit, as waa tho case with Some of tho com- pany's competitors, even if tho dividend is only at the rate of 10 per cent, as compared with 171 per cont, in cash and 10 per cent in bonus shares for 1920. In concerns of this nature, depreciation is an important item, but as the balance I sheet shows that provision to the extent of more than one-third of the cost price ¡'ot tho licet of cars, trucks, etc., has been I made, this phase of tho question seems to haye boen dealt with satisfactorily. At Juno -30, 1925, tho company had only 152 cabs operating solely in Mel- bourne. Twelve months later the num- ber had risen to 392 in both Melbourne and Sydney, and ut June 30 last tho toial was - 502. ' Dealing .with the past year's opéra- tions thc directors' report states as fol- lows:-"Tho company's licet in Mel- bourne and Sydney now consists of 502 cabs, which number your directors con- sider will meet all requirements during tho present financial year. Of these cabs, 110 hiive been operating over dif- ferent periods considerably less than ono ye:u' and in some cases for less than three months. Tho cabs are fulfilling all expectations ns to their stability and efficiency for tho work, but nevertheless your directors have adupted a sound and careful policy of depreciation.

LONDON STOCK EXCHANG BUSINESS GENERALLY QUIET MARKETS. LONDON, July 30. Thc new account of the London Sto< Exchange opened with a fair amount ? liveliness yesterday, but thc approai of the August hank holiday became tl dominant factor, and generally qui markets ensued, but prices Were mai: fained to a surprising degree of strengt Gilt-edged securities were very fin with sohle of the recently-issued colon! stocks in steady demand. The mov ment.of the Exchange to 1 5-S per coi discount against Australia, is attribut to the material reduction in Lundon tho funds, of Australian banks. Til partly seasonal development has assur cd unusually large proportions owli tu thc recent heavy imports of Austi- na, while the outlook for tho comb Australian export season is less favou .able, owing to the severe droughts in some districts. . THE NATIONAL TRADE POSITION. Commentators derive cold comfort from tile inquest on the nutional trade position, made this week in the House of Commons by Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lis- ter, tile President of the Board of Trade, The "Economist" says that the most I notable feature of the debate was tho revelation ot tile deep-seated uneasiness among all parties that tho volume of net i Imports for the first quarter of 19-7 came~to 132 per cent, ot the second I quarter, and 127 per cent, ot the 1913 figures, while the exports for tho same periods were only 7.1.7 and 7S_ per cent, respectively of the 1913 figures. Great Britain's ad\'ersc trade balance lins grown from -70,500,000 for tho first halt of 1913 to .£209,500.000 this year. The "Economist" expresses the opinion that the nation is living on its invisible re- ceipts to a moro significant extent than before tho war, resulting in a lower ca- pacity to make capital investments abroad. BRITISH FACTORIES FOR AUSTRALIA. Thc "Yorkshire Post" thinks that Mr. H. K. Pratten, the Commonwealth Min- ister for Trade and Customs, is over optimistic in reference to tho probable response of British manufacturers to lils invitation to start branch factories i" Australia, and says that thc feeling in industrial circles is that Australia, for the time being, would bc better advised to develop the purchases of British manufactures. Industrialists arc most willing to carefully examine the pros- pects of establishing Australian branch factories, but told Mr. Pratten that it would bo necessary to establish long credits, which cannot at present be ob- tained. The result of the recent Com- monwealth loan flotation is regarded as ominous for those seeking further cre- dits, for Australian enterprises, and there are doubts as to whether Austra- lian rates of immigration warrant an immediate building of branch factories at tho heavy Australian llrst costs. THE WOOL POSITION. The last wool sales revealed tho sound standing ot tho raw material. Thc Homo trudo was tho largest buyer, taking 50,700 bales, as compared with 49,(109 for the Continent. Nevertheless, the manufacturing end of tho trade ls -ar from satisfactory, there being far too much standing machinery. This con- dition of affairs has been so prolonged that it has given rise to a search for a heroic remedy. Correspondence in the Yorkshire newspapers shows that there la a growing opinion that thc industry needs reorganisation In thc direction of collective action, as it is now burdened with tho multiplicity of small firms sending up costs by thc frequent hand- lings of goods and numerous profits be- tween tho raw material and thc finished fnbiics. A combination of all processes under a single management, collective advertising, and a search for trade arc being influentially advocated. BUTTER MARKET. l'Un trade Jr» Australian and Now Zea- land butters'has been disappointing dur- ing tho past month, chietly owing to heavy supplies of European descriptions. Tho production of meat in Europe has boen maintained at tho flush point much longer than usual. Owing to heavy rains Germany has not taken her normal share of Danish, resulting in heavier shipments of tile latter to London, it Í3 interesting to note that Denmnrk forestalled speculators by a recent Act, compelling tho casks to be stamped with tho dato of manufacture, thus enforcing immediate marketing. Australian and New Zealand butters seem, however, ,to have touched bottom.

COMMONWEALTH LOAN LONDON'S RESPONSE UNSATIS- FACTORY. TURNING TO AMERICA. LONDON,.July 29. Mr. J. B. Collins, tho llnancinl advisor in London for the Commonwealth, is proceeding to America for the purpose, it ls understood, ot negotiating a Com- monwealth loan ot £10,000,000. The re- sult of the last Commonwealth loan in London was so unsatisfactory that tho Commonwealth is compelled to go to America for money. CANADIAN . OATS. AVINXIPECi, .Inly So.
