OOMMEEOIAL INTELLIGENCE. i The Argus Office, Saturday Evening. Export entries were passed at the Customs to-day for 35,097 ounces of gold, for shipment in the Essex for London. The total quantity ehipped in this vessel was 61,08- ounces, in the following parcels :-Bank of New South Wales, 17,382 ounces; Bank of Victoria, 15,009 ounces; Union Bank of Australia, 18,073 ounces; Oriental Bank Corporation, 11,895 ounces ; English, Scottish, and Austra- lian Chartered Bank, 5,429 ounces ; Messrs. L Bobinson and Co., 564ounces; Mr. Sanders, 336 ounces ; Mr. J. Spruge, 250 ounces ; small shipments, 147 ounces. There has been a steady demand for gold during the week, but at prices below those of the lost month. The Melbourne bullion brokera are buying at the following rates . Pleasant Oreek, Castlemaine, and Bendigo, 75s. 0d. per ounce; Maryborough, Dunolly, Avoca, and Fiery Creek, 77s. ; Ararat, 76a. Gd. ; Ovens, 77s. to 79s.; Ballaarat, 78s. 6d. Some raicéis of vory low quality have been received in town by Messrs. William darke and Sons, from Pleasant Oreek, tho value of which they do not assess higher than £312a. per ounce. We have the autho- rity of Messrs. Clarke and Sons to say that this is the first instance in which alluvial gold of low quality has been sont down from the western fields. The total quantity brought down by escort this week has been 55,286 ozs. 10 dwts. against 89,296 ozs. 15 dwts. for the corresponding week of 1857. This total is 7,616 ouhoas above the average of the past year, and 13,861 ounces above that of the first quarter of the current year. In the following list the fort- nightly escorts are distinguished from the weekly by the prefix of an asterisk : 1858\. 1857. ozs. dwts. ozs. dwts.

The Bame remark applies to ship- ments, which have amounted to 1,019,798 ozi his year, against 1,088,401 ozs. for the corres- ponding period of 1857. The following are the shipments for the week :-? ozs.

Although the escort returns have been favor- able this week:, the reporta from the diggings have not been so. There has been no great event to chronicle directly affecting the I miner. The increase in the escort returns is the result chiefly of the quartz mines, under the influence of improved machinery adapted for tbe separation of the metal from the matrix. The reports of the eaily part of the week speak of want of water on the western fields, which, for the present, are lesa produc- tive, comparing the present with the yields of former periods, than any others. In the ex- treme east the movement over the New South Wales Border Is at an end, but the Sydney journals are still disposed to keop up the excitement. The Sydney Morning Herald, in a recent issue, has drawn the following fanci- ful picture of the prospects of the gold-fields of that colony :-" The quiet progress of oui gold-fi elds, the gradual bat constant Increase of the quantity produced, and the approved methods of production, all announce the ap- proach of a great change In the relative position of this territory as a gold country. We are not In any way sur- prised by new discoveries-we have been amply prepared for them by the strone assurances of the most eminent geologists. The following figures show the steady advance from January to April. From January to April, 1857, the qr anti ty brough1 by escort was 44,042 oz,¡ hnt for the same months in 1858 we have 69,000 oz. This, of course, is exoluBive of the large quantity which finds its way over the border, or is dolivorod by private hand. As to the exhaus- tion of the gold, that will be the work of cen- turies. In one field alone-Araluon-there are supposed to be quantities beyoud any- thing yet Indicated. They are merely scratch- ing upon the surface, while the riches are below, It is the same in other places. We have seen a private letter addressed by a young man to his friends, from Tamba- roora, who states that he has been offered £5,000 for his portion of the claim, and that a single tub yielded 20 ounces. We have hitherto hesitated to dwell much upon this mportant branch of colonial industry. Wa wish to see no feverish excitement, none of that confusion and disaster which result from gold mania ; but, notwithstanding all this, we augur, from present indications, that 1858, be- fore its close, will see this country take a high nnd permanent rank among the gold countries of the world. Evory shopkeeper and trades- man will be benefited by the stimulus, Every mechanic will find the demand for his labor increased, and the produce of the farmer will meet with a better market by the opening of new centres of extensive consumption." The returns of the Immigration Board for the month of April were published in the Bill of Entry on Friday. The number of arrivals at all ports of the colony is given at 3,744 and of departures at 1,702, the balance in favor of Victoria being 1,982.

The announcement of the Treasurer that Ministers were not disposed to take the opinion of the House on the question, has led to tho belief that offers have been made sufficiently advantageonB to the Interests of the colony to warrant the acceptance of one of them by the Government, It is generally expeoted that Mr. O'shanassy will give prominence to this subject in the pre- mised explanations of Wednesday nest The banks have, in anticipation of the issue of remlttable debentures, reduced the rate of exchange on England to par Money continues abundant, and large trans actions in loans and mortgages are spokot of as having taken place. The speculatlvi spirit recently shown in the import-marke has been somewhat checked by the refusal o the banks to discount too much of the pape evolved by these transactions. The curron rates are ¡-For bills under 95 days' cúrrenos 8 per cent. ; from 95 to 125 days', 9 per cent. over 125 days', IO .per cent.; and on oval drawn accounts, 10 per cent. Exohango on England is at par for 60 dayl sight, and at J per cent, premium for amount under £50 for 80 days' sight. Freight on goh by direct steamers or sailing vessels, 3d. pe ounce, deliverable in London ; insurance, 1 per cent. ; by the overland route, f per cent. that is, 7d. per onnce as nearly as poBsible inBuranee, 1J to 1$ per cent. In the local share market transactions hav not been large, but prices have been mail tained. Colonial bank shares have been sol at £517s. 6d. to £6 ; Melbourne Gas and COB Company's shares at 40 per cent, premium fe first, second, and third issues ; Colonial insu ance shares at £2 2s. to £2 3s.; Australasia Insurance Bhares at £1 10s. ; Melbonrne an HobBon's Bay Railway Company's shares t £75 for old, and £72 to £78 for the new issu and Melbourne Exchange shares at £55. parcel of City of Melbourno bonds of lor dates has changed hands at par, and of Soul Australian Government debentures at 6 p cent, nremium. In the export trade there has been very I little doing during the week. Wool is almost j cut of the market. Tallow is in demand for homeuseB at former rates, which are above the values set by shippers. There are buyers of hides in the market at 2Jd. per lb., but holders aro declining to sell at this in the pro sent bare condition of Btocks. Specie has been exported to the value of £10,171; the port of destination not being Earned. Stock and stations havo not been so fre- quently Inquired for. The St. Enoch station, in i he Portland Bay district, with a pre-emptive light, 100 horses, 300 head of cattle, and 30,090 pheep, has beon disposed of for £45,000. The Customs returns of the declared value3 of the Imports and exports for the current year berrin at last to have a healthier ap 1 earance. The value of the exports has boen gradually mounting up till it has overtaken that of the imports.

Barley.-The last remarks are Btill appli- cable. Oats.-Holders anticipate the next advices from Melbourne will show considerable im- provement, consequent on tho favorable ad- vices from home. Flour.-There have been no transactions since the 12th. Since the steamer's arrival parcels have changed hands at the quotations, but millers are unwilling to sell, as a further rise is expected. Bran has been in great request, and several sales are reported at 2s. 9d.

Tho rcBultB of tho last roportcd London salos aro, on the wholo, considered satisfactory, but at this lato season ol the year aro unlikely to affoot tho small quan- tity romalning on hand. Tallow-Tho quantities cflorlng bolng purchased for the local trado, at rates ulrich prooludo shippers purchasing, tliofo aro no eales of importance to record. HIDES.-The markot is noarly clear of shipping sorts, and business is confined at present to country hides, chiefly purohased for local use, pricos of which sort aro, however, rather looking up. LIVE STOCK.-Fat Oattlo.-Tho supply at markot has been light, and tho demand being brisk, parti- cularly for good quality, pricos advanced on lost woek's ratos. Bost quality brought 27s. Od. per 100 ; or, say, bullocks from 11.10s. to 11!. 15s., cows from 0Í. to 92. oaoh ; and, had any rosily first-class quality boon at markot, advanced prices on those rates would have doubtless boen roodlly procured. Store Oattlo uro much inquired ior, but few lots offering, except at long distances from town. Good mixed lota may be quoted at from 07B Od. to 72s. Gd. por hoad. Work- ing bullocks aro much inquired for, and moot with ready salo, more particularly If in good working con- dition. Messrs. J. Ii.

Mossrs. Byan and Ham- mond report tho ealoB at from 80s. to 80s. oaoh. Messrs. Dalmalioy Campbell and Co. also disposed of a lot at from 22.12s. Od. to 32.10s. each. Fat sheep. The market has boon fairly supplied; tho preso nt pricos requirod, howovor, prevent tho trado pur- chasing beyond their Immediate wants, and while tho comparatively low prlco of hoof tondB to lesson tho demand, pricos can scarcely bo roportcd as sustaining last wcok's ratos. Mosbrs. Powor and Rutherford announce having oflootod salos of 600 primo wothors st from 27s. to 23s.; 000 good wethors at from 22s. to 21s. ; as well as 1,000 primo owos. Mossrs.

Gd. each, and 3,000 ou os and wethers, a mixed lot, a por- tion bolng unfit for tbo butcher, at 17s. each. Storo sheep aro much inquired for, and bring full prioos; buyers aro, however, gonorally awaiting supplios ex- pected from N.S.W. A lot of 2,600 maldon owes wore disposod of by Messrs. Power and Rutborfard for 11s. each. Lambs.-Tho supply W»B vory small. Mossrs. Byan and Hammond disposed of tho fow at markot at from 13s, to 14s. each. Horse Markot.-Tbo scarcity of fresh stock at markot lias csusod un apparent duluoss. The douiand, however, is good, especially for staunch hoavy draught lloraos, for willoh tho late rains, by rendoring tua roads heavy, havo Increased iho Inquiry. As tho season brings on tho grass, tho unbroken stock will bo coming to market in better condition, and aro likely to iniprovo in valuo. Mossrs, James L. Loban and Go. roport having sold imported staunch hoavy draught horsos at from £33 to 1252, medium class, 172. to OS!., and stock horses, tilt for immcdlato work, at from 222. to 802. oicli. Mr. W.

Gordon, Esq, all in low condition, tho brokon ot from 122. to 322., averaging 212., and tlio unbroken at an avorago of 02.12s. por hoad. LABOR MARKET.-This market has been dull during the past week, and with the exceptlon of a trifling In- quiry for farm laborers and plougnmen, there has been but little demand for agricultural or rough labor. The inquiries for male domestics have been more numerous this week, and female servants, thoroughly compe tent, are still much wanted. Second-class female do mestlcs, not equal to undertaking any particular branch of household work, are not in much inquiry, and when unable to afford references, find some dlfficulty In pro- curing respectable situations. Tradesman appear to be much in want of employment. As, however, the opening out of the railway works is expected to lead to a large amount of employment, the aspect of the labor market generally Is looking more cheer. ing. One hundred and three immigrants by the Admiral Boxer arrived yesterday from Geelong; being, however, all of the assisted class, and mostly of respectable appearanoe, their arrival will not interfere with the market. Tin following are tho nominal rates of wages, subject, of course, to arrangements.

Tho announcement brought by the Australasian of n declino In shipments of many classes of goods, al- though In uoiuo inoasuro anticipated, induced a sudden epeculatlvodomand for many articles of gonoral con- sumption. Those wore, during tho oarly part of tho week, run up to oxcossivo prlcer, BO as onllroly to discourage purchasers, aud speculators hare been loft In tho unpleasant position of holding goods at ratos at which no one Booms disposod to relievo thom. Advanced prices, owing to short- coming snpplios of somo few articles, may fairly be reckoned on; but the Bplrit of speculation, onoo started, embraced many classes of goods, of which ttio oxcossivo stocks on hand utterly precluded any Imme- diate hopo of Improved value Even proaumlng tho total temporary cessation ot shlpmonts of many articles, our stocks aro quito suiliclont *o carry us on for a considerable porloel, and a moro speculative demand, wblch simply, changos ownors ot goods, without increasing consumption, cannot pro- duce any permanent ¡mprovoment. Tho riso has hitherto provod injurious to our markets, as buyers . havo becomo alarmed, and have declined purchasing . until prices hare sottled down. Tho conscquonco hu been a »mau amount of actual business dono, par- ticularly for tho country, msny drays having boon ULsuccessfuI In procuring loading throughout tin I v. bolo week. , Liquors.-Tho demand for bulk ales continue'! brisk. Tho largo quantities of eecond-rato qualitlos, much of which Is in very questionable condition, anil is offering at vory low prices, opéralo unfavorably on tho botter sorts, and prices of these kinds have Bllghtly declined, £0 Doing tho highest prossnt value for Bass's No. 3 Burton. Uoldors of really sound ales arc, however, looking for highor prices. Draught porter Is in light demand, aul in small parcels only of most proforrod brand). Bottlod boors hare been for some timo past un- usually inactivo and dull. Largo supplies of olio*.) sortB of previously unknown brands had boen pur- chased for country demand, and having to be con- sumed, havo much intorlered with tho sala of bettor does bottling. Bales of Byass's are, howover, to-day reported, In equal proportions of ale and portor, at 10s. ed. por dozon, at which figuro slralUr assortments of AIlsopp's ale and Barclay's porter, botli of Friend and Oo.'s bottling, havo been placel by suction during tho week. Spirits.-Thero is at Isngtu a tendency towards Improvement in this markn, however "temporary It may prove. Brandies bl bos', »orla hare certainly been In more demand, and tor Kartell's, of course -of undoubted - genuineness, 18s, 9d. per gallon has boen paid¿, although the amount ol sales have not been very extensive. For bottled brandies of boat brands there is also Improve- ment both In price and demand, and holders of U. V. Oo.'s aro now declining offers undor 88s. per esto. Conova of boat brands has also improved, and sales of J. D. E. Z. bavo been made at lea. por case. Tho domand for old tom (colorless) has Increased, and prices may bo quotod tor most approve, brands at SB. Od. Bum Is In botter Inquiry, although wa hear of no salos at enhanced ratos. Whiskey is still in light inquiry, oven at tho low prices ruling. Wines.-The domand for both ports and ahorrios of goorly medium sorts to Ano qualities has muoh improved this wook, and considerable Bales have been effected both prlvatoly and by auction, good medium sound ports bringing from 002. to 062. per pipe, and sound palo shorrlos lrom about 602. to 682. fier butt. Tho season of tho year prooludos sales of Isht wines to any oxtent, and the few piroolB disposed of afford no criterion as to genoral prices. Flour, Grain, &c-Tho; rapid advance which oc- curred during tho early portion ol the week In tho prlco of flour has not boen supportod, the valuo having dwindled down really for wanto* purchasers, and not- withstanding the reports of advanced rates in Adelaide have t o.da> boon received, thore has boen so little to do In this market ss bardy to Influence it. Tho salos, boyond thoso for actual consumption, haro, since the rpeoulattvo demand coasod, boon of very trifling amount, and during the latter part of tho wook the article has boon very dull, country brands of Adelaide bardy bringing 202,, whllo best brands cannot bo quotod ovor 222. per ton. Wheat Is In Bteady demand, and may be quotod as of ready salo at 7s. Od. to 8s. por bushel, vhllo for very Uno grinding samples 8s. 8d. is procurable. Oats have boon largely operated in on «peculation, and during tho early part of tho wook high prices wera asked by holders. Considerable quantities have, howovor, been forcod on . the mar- ket by auction for cash, and pricos bavo declined i during tho wcok about Is. per bushel. Thoconsump ¡ tlon is largo during tho wintor months, but, with stocks on hand, and the bulk of tho producá of the lait hnrvest of Van Dlomon'fl Land yet to come, high rates can hardly bo oxpoctod to bo maintained.

Tho sudden advance In oats and othor descriptions ol horso. corn attendant on the lato speculation caused corresponding Improvement in tho value of substitutes, for theso articles ; tho temporary oxcitomont having however, subsided, Drices are declining. Gram is now bold for 202. and split peas for 202. por ton. Provisions havo continued In stoady domand. The late Bpeculatlvo feeling causod much inquiry and consequent improved value for butter, which, from tin very small quantity of really primo quality on hine and tho nnnouncod short supplies ooming, was one o: tho fow artlolcs attracting legitimate specula tlon ; parools of tho boat in tho rnarkot have beor readily dispoBod of at 2s., which price can now bo pro cured for any first class sorts.
