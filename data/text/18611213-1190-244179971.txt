AVith respect to the houses, lie .has to state . that every one of them is let to highly respectable tennnts, producing a safe and certain Ineome, thus affording an opportunity not often occurring to capitalists nnd to trustees, to. make advisable investments, ns they will find upon inspection, - that all the properties nreof a first-class descrip tion, so much so that it' would be /difficult to select nny particular one ns being more advisable than another. At the same time, he would de sire to call the particular atteution of capitalists and publicans to that splendid hotel known as the Royal or Terminus Hotel, on the , Brighton Esplannde. I : This hotel was erected under the- 'careful superintendence of Mr. ChariesAVebh, tlu> nrulil- ! tect, and no expense was saved to makellt sub-- stantial, perfect,, and .one of the best arranged hotels in the colony. " | ' ' The Devonshire Hotel, also, is worthy of consideration, ns having an old nnd wrill csta- . Wished connection attaclicd.tp.it, which is a guarantee for the well doing of the house; in nil-: dition to which it has the advantage of large assembly rooms, the only ones in Brighton and the district. ' 1 . The deprceiation in value of all kinds of pro perties has been considerable within the last two or-thrce years; but, ns there is every prospect of a speedy nnd continuous flow of immigration from all parts of the world to this colony, it is ' but fair to assume that there will be a gradual rise in the value of properties; and the auc tioneer would remind capitalists that it is far I safer to purchase now than when properties are : i exorbitantly high; lie therefore respectfully so licits the attendance of all moneyed men' at this sale.
