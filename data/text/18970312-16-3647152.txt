" Dear Sir,-I am a poor hand at expressing my feelings, but I should like to thank you. Your Lozenges have done wonders in relieving my terrible cough. Since I had the opera- tion of ' Tracheotomy' (the same as the late Emperor of Germany, and unlike him, thank God, I am still alive) performed at St. Bartholo- mew's Hospital, no one could pos- sibly have had a more violent cough; it was so bad at times that It quite exhausted me. The mucous, which was very copious and hard, has been softened, and I have been able to get rid of it without difficulty.-I am, Blr, yours truly, J.
