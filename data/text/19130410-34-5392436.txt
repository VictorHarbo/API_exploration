The Commonwealth Parliament is, about, to be. dissolved, and writs issued for the .Election of Members of the New Parliament. - . Twice vou have returned me at the head of the poll for the Senate. For twelve vears jou have given me 'jour generous confidence. = . It is therefore, my duty once more to submit myself for election as one of your Senators. It is for vou to say whether I am still to serve you. In dil Australia I am to-day tha only Candidate for the Senate and. if elected. I shall be the only Senator who was a Member of the Federal Con- vention and one of the framers of the Constitution. The Constitution is on its'trial. Grave changes are proposed. I helped to frame it. I have tried to expound it I have done my best to guard it from needless alteration. With, you I have twice -fought successfully against uncalled lor amendments-when proposed-vinee by Mr. Deakin s Government, and once by Mr. Fisher's. I am readv, if you wish, to do so again and to defepd the Constitution from any change that is not proved to be good for both Commonwealth and States. The States must be maintained in their self governing integrity. That 'duty rests primarily with the Senate, which was never meant to be a party house. In it the States have equal repre- sentation, because it is the custodian of their rights and interests as States. If it fails in that, then it falls short of th high purpose fot which it was designed, and the national .welfare, whien embraces that of the States, must suffer. Important issues are h'efore you. and I shall take an early opportunity of addressing you upon them! _ > J. H. SYMON. Gladstone Chambers 9th April, 3913.
