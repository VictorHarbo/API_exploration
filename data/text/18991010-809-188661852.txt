Dcur Sir,— For many 'years I was secretary -and literary assistant to thq Rev. Dr. Parker, of the "City Temple," London. At' that time my left side bec.nnu paralysed ; in fact, nil power of using my left leg had. left me. 1 went and consulted the first authority in Eogland on paralysis and nervous diseases. Dr. Fcrrie, of the. London Hospital and the Hospital for Paralysis aud ' Epilepsy, Quccn's-squnrc. Bloomsbury. He told me my disease was "LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA," and- there was not .the smallest chance of my ever being cured.. Well, I came out to Australia. My people thought the long cea voyage might b« beneficial, but It was ull no good. I- got acquainted with some good pco pic, , one of whom persuaded me to try "WEBBER'S VlTADATIO," on the understanding it would do .ma no barm; I took a couple of bottles, and found no benefit. . My friend persuaded mc to go on with it,' saying, "It took many years to get the complaint, YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO CURE IT IN A WEEK." so I- continued, and after taking six (6) large bottles ' the use of my limbs gradually came back to mc. and now 1 can run a race, with many athletes. . I feel tuis is simply wonderful, 'so cannot forbear to let you know of it. _ ' ' "I remain, , Yours faithfully, PERCY B. HUNT. Witnesses: STEWART MACINDOE, J. B.
