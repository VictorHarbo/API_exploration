INTRODUCTION. Parliament; is now in recess, and will be dissolved about the end of March. The general election will tako place during the month of April, but already the note of preparation for tho coming \- strife is heard throughout the colony-old V representatives are feeling the pulses of their constituencies, and now candidates are putting forward their claims to con- sideration. Tho Opposition is dissatistied with its leader, Mr. Berry, and a section of that party has suggested his deposition In favour of some moro astuto general. JEÜB successor must be either Mr. Service, Mr. Casey, or Sir 0. Gavan Duffy. This division in the camp will not help the opponents of the Government. The Free-trade League has established branches throughout the colony. At the last meotlng of the league a motion was 1 proposed affirming the desirability of direct taxation, but after somo discus- sion, in which it was pointed out that the resolution was outside the defined objects of the league, though some form of direct taxation must necessarily follow the abolition of Customs duties, the motion was withdrawn. The Protection League has boon put- ting forth some ludicrous efforts to be- come a power in the state, and has mado ineffectual overtures to tho Reform League, which numbers a good many members who aro freetraders, for an alliance with, that body. The protec- tionists, altogether, seem to think they aro on the losing side. The revenue returns for the quarter ending December 31 wore published on the 5th inst. The total revenue for tho quarter was £1,082,700, and for tho year ¿4,462,262, showing an increase on the quarter, as compared with tho corre- sponding period of last year, of £10,070, and on the year of £246,738. The Customs receipts show a deficiency on the quarter of £9,081. On "all other " articles " thero is a decrease of £18,233, but in sugar and molasses there is an increase of £12,475. The receipts on the other items aro nearly the samp. The Customs receipts for the year, however, show an increase over 1875 of £53,7Ü, the prinoipal items being ¡-Spirits, £10,000 ; wine. £5,097 ; sugar, £30,554; hops, £4,393; dried fruits, «fco., £9,034 ; and ad valorem, £16,665. On "all other articles" thero was a decrease of £29,530, and on wharfage rates of £3,879. Excise and inland revenue shows a decrease on the quarter of £4,962, and an increase on the year of £5,639. The duty on bank notos, however, brought in £20,577 during 1876, an item which did not appear in the pre- vious year. In the receipts from the succession duties thero was a falling off of £16,177. In territorial revenue there was a decrease on the quarter of £544, and an increase on the year of £115,258. A On receipts towards the purchase of lands p and rentB and licences there was an in [ " crease on the year of £107,101, and on pastoral occupation of £24,207, but on auction sales there was a decrease of £36,581. On " public works" there was an increase for the quarter of £27,870, and for the year of £81,711, of which £79,515 was due to railway income. On " ports and harbours" there was a decrease for the quarter of £1,160, and for the year of £1,875. On " post and telegraph offices" the increase for the quarter was £2,017, and for the year £13,668. On "fees" there was an in- crease on the quarter of £4,074, and on tho year of £20,613. There was a decrease in the revenue from fines of £1,376 on the quarter, and of £8,175 on the year. On "miscellaneous" there was a de- crease on tho quarter of £709, and on the year of £33,844. On one item alone " interest on public account," there is a decrease of £38,100. A conference of representatives of tho Australian Governments on the subject of a duplicate cable to connect with Europe,.will meet in Sydney in a fow days. Victoria is represented by the Poatmaster-General, Mr. Ramsay, and the Commissioner of Customs, Mr. An- derson. The offer of the Eastern Exten- sion Telegraph Company to lay down another cable between Ban joe wangle and Port Darwin, or between the former place and North-west Cape, is the only practical proposal to be dealt with. SOCIAL. Melbourne during the holiday season o' Cbtistmastide and the New Year was crowded with visitors from the country and from the other colonies. People devoted themselves to amusement with an energy characteristic of Australians, and business during this period waa entirely neglected On Boxing Da; the weather was very un- favourable, and heavy rain fell, which interfered greatly with many ot the out-door entertainments. The cricket match between the All- England Eleven and Fifteen of Victoria, au account of wtiich is given elsewhere, excited great public interest, and vos attended each day by several thousand visitors. The advent of the new year was celebrated in a lively manner. Midnight services wore held in several of the churches, [ and SB the clock struck 12 the bells were Bet tinging. The West Melbourne ' tonn band marched tarough the principal i stteels of the city, playing a variety of popular airs, and was accompanied by a large crowd. New Year's Day was observed as a public holiday. The Champion Race meeting I on the Flemington course was the chief | amusement, ana attracted several thousand | visitors. The entertainments at the theatres (in the evening were crowded. The intercolomul conference on the subject of duplicate cable communication will meet in Sydney on Thursday next, January '23. Íl'be delegates from Victoria aie the Commis sioner of CuBtoms, the lion. R. S. Anderson, , and the Postmaster-General, Mr. Ramsay, accompanied by Mr. S. \V. M'Gowan, in. spector of the Tolegraph department* The B.B Victoria, couvejing the delogates, some other members of the Government, and some private members of Parliament, loft for Sydney on the 19th inBt. Mr. RamBay and Mr. M'Gowan travelled overland. The delegates to the conference from the other colonies aro:-Western Australia-Hon. Mal- colm FraBer, Surveyor-General. Sjuth Aus- tralia-Sir Henry Ajero, Chief Secretary; Hon. E. Ward, Minister «if Education ; and Mr C. Todd, Poatmaster-General and Super- intendent of TelegruphB. New Zealand Hon. G. M'Lean, Commissioner of Tele- graphs, and Dr. Lemon, General Manager. New South Wales-Tlie Premier, Mr. Robert jon, and the PoBtmaster-GBnerol, Mr. J. F. fe ] nth, Minister of Education and Attorney Jieuetal. The conference is not expected to Jast more than three or four days, and Ministers will be abBent about a fort- night. The information received from Sydney con- cerning the outbreak of small-pox there has induced the Victorian Government to con eider the neceBBity of taking precautions to prevent the introduction ol the disease into .¡J!" colony. The ohief medical officer, Dr. M Creo, has recommended that all vessels coming from Sydney should be quarantined, but there are strong reasons against adopting such an extreme measure. Toe effect would be to parnlyae the trade between the two Ports, and it is very doubtful whether the result aimed at would be attained, as it would be impossible to prevent the passage of people acrOBB the border. It U not there- fore intended to carry out this recom- mendation, for the preaent at any rate, but the most stringent examination will be mude of all vessels at the Heads. Uuung the last few days typhoid fever has made its appearanoe in the hospital for sick children at Catlton. Two ohildren have been seized with the malady, and have boen con- sequently secluded in a room by themselves. iJirectious have been given to romedy a de- fective system of drainage. Scarlet fever »leo occasionally exhibits itself, and cases have been reported from different parts of the country. The Education department has taken the preliminary steps for the compilation of school rolls in the various districts, with the view of carrying into effect the compulsory clauses of tho act. As- soon as these rolls, which will give an alphabetical list of the children resident in the school districts be- tween the ages of three and fifteen years, have been prepared, truant officers will be appointed to seo that the children attend the schools. The experiment of running railway trains with the carriage doors unlocked has been tried on the Williamstown line. It ia too early yet to arrive at any definite opinion as to the value of the change here, so far as this experiment is concerned, but the practice has proved of great convenience in- other the countries, and there is no reason why it should not prove equally successful here. Plans for the reclamation of the West Mel- bourne swamp have been completed, and only await the final approval of the Minister of Lands before tenders will be called for the carrying out of the work under them. Tho area to be reclaimed amounts to 1,000 acres, and after making due provision for roads,''drainage, and a reserve along the margin of the rivers, it is estimated that there will, under the proposal, remain 70S acres available for gardening, grazing, and other snch purposes when the land has been reclaimed. ' The leading features of the scheme are to construct a new channel and embankmentround the margin of the swamp so as to exclude the drainage of West Mel- bourne and the waters of tho Moonee Ponds, and to convey them into the Yarra and Salt- water rivers, The cost will be from £10,000 to £13,000, and it is expected that an annual rental of abont £5,000 can be obtained for the reclaimed land, A board appointed by the Government to report as to the best kind of stoue that could bo used in the erection of the new Law Courts in William-street, has recommended that alternative tenders be called for the facing of the building in stone from Mount Abrupt, in the Grampian Ranges, within easy reach of the Ararat and Hamilton Railway, or from Spring Bay, in Tasmania. The licensed victuallers of the colony are in a condition of agitation with regard to the new Licensing Act, the provisions of which relative to the prohibition of Sunday trading are very stringent. At a large meeting of the trade bold in Melbourne on the 12ih inst. the feeling was unanimous that the law should be strictly enforced, with the view of allow- ing the public to recognise the inconvenience | that would reeult therefrom. Resolutions' i were poBSCd pledging the publicans present to keep tiieir ilQ'.t!? Closed on Sundays, and an agreement to that effect was signed by tboBe present A large vigilance committee was appointed to carry out the resolution, and to report to the police the names of those publicans who would not be bound by the re- solution. The same course has been very generally adopted in the country towns. Intimation has boen received from the agent-general of the appointment of Mr. Gladman as superintendent of the Teachers' Training Institution. Mr. Gladman, who was recommended by Dr. Lyon Playfair and Mr, Jolly, senior inspector of schools, is a B.A, of the London University, He was tor gome time head-master of the Godalming Government School, and he subsequently held asimilar position in a state school at Great Yarmonth. For the last three years he has occupied the post of normal master in the Borough-road Training School, London-one of the largest training establishments in England. He has received very high testimo- nials from Mr. Matthew Arnold and from the inspector of training schools. He will leave for Melbourne by the Durham, Mr, Meikle, the superintendent of the locomotive branch of the Victorian Railways, has tendered his resignation to the Minister of Railways. He haB now completed the term of service under the Civil Service Act which entitles bim to claim compensation on retiring, and is deBirous of returning to Bug land. In August next, an international con- ference on the subject of prison discipline, the management of penal establishments, and other kindred matters will be held at Stockholm. Mr. G. O. Duncan, inspector general of penal establishments, has obtained Borne months' leave of absence, and will be sent as the representative of Victoria to this conference, where no doubt he will be able to obtain information relating to the best methods of prison management of a highly valuable kind. The engicoer-m-caief of railways, in an official report, condemned the locomotive en- gines manufactured in the colony. The Phoenix Foundry Company, Ballarat, the only contractors for these engines, challenged the correctness of his statements, and in order to bave the matter thoroughly investigated, the Government has determined to appoint a board, -whose duty it will be to consider the merits of the colonial manufactured locomo. tives. The locomotive superintendents of the neighbonring colonies have been requested to let. The great mining case of Learmonth v. Bailey has been settled by contient of the patties, and all future litigation concerning it will now ceaBe, Each side haB agreed to pay its own costa. The annual meeting of the members of the Medical Society of Victoria was held on January 10, Dr. M'Millan was elected presi- dent of the society for the onBuing year, and Dr. Day, the retiring president, then read an interesting address, in which he reviewed the proceedings of the medical world during the past year. A vote of thanks was accorded to Dr. Day for his services to the society. The contributors to the Melbourne Orphan Asylum have resolved on the adoption of the boardii'g-out system, and have also deter- mined that in the new buildings to be erected the cottage system rather than the asylum system shall be carried out. The advantages claimed for the cottage over the barrack system are-1. Greater freedom from danger of contagious disease. 2. More natural and home-like life for the children, and better facilities for their proper classifi- cation. 3. Industrial training of a character more suited to after life. The cost of build- ing five detached bouBes for 30 children each, -chool for 100 children, hospital for 20 chil- dren, administration block, bakehouse, laun- dry, stables, sheds, paved yards, fencing, &c; was estimated at £11,300. The extra cost of wanes under the cottage system for an insti- tution containii g 150 children would be only about £12. After some discussion, it was decided to adopt the cottage system, and to provide accommodation for 150 children, an amendment by Sir Wm. Stawell, that accom- modation should only be provided for 100, being negatived. The annual meeting of the subscribers to the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum was held on January l8. The Committee of Manage- ment reported that the asylum had fully maintained its character for efficiency and ueefulnees in relioving the necessities of the destitute and enfeebled poor of the extensive Melbourne district. Daring the year just ended, 806 cases had been relieved. There are at present in the asylum 032 inmates, but no less than 201 have been refused admit- tance through want of room. The report und balance sheet were adopted. In reference to one of the actionB brought by Messrs. Stevenson and Sons against the Customs officials for detention of their goods, it is contemplated on behalf of the defen- dants to apply to the Supreme Court shortly for an order for a commission to examino witnesses in England. The Nemeeis, a largo screw Bteamer which was laid on the berth at home some time ago lor Melbourne and Sydney, to run in con- junction with the steamers St. Osyth and Whampon, arrived on January 8. An experi. mont interesting to those who desire to see fresh meat preserved for a length of time, without losing ile appearance or flavour, was tried during the voyage, and with a successful result. On leaving Plymouth n quantity of fresh meat was stowed away in tue ice-bouse of the steamer. Tho meat on being produced was found not only to be sound and wholesome, bat had all the look of a joint from a recently killed animal. An attempt is being made to establish in Melbourne a deep-sea fishing company, with B capital of £25,000, in 5,000 shares of £5 each. It is considered that a capital of £5,000 would enable a satisfactory com- mencement to be made, but the larger sam is to be provided in order to allow of the ex- tension of the company's business if the ven- ture ehonld prove as successful as ex- pected. At first it is only intended to equip three or four boats to test the fishing grounds, but after a time, when the full capital iB called up, it is thought that a Ueet of 12 vesselB of 80 tons each could bB pro- cured. The boats will convey their produce to Queenscliff, and the fish will be brought up from there to Melbourne by steamer, and conveyed to the inland towns by rail H.M.C.S. Victoria returned on January 16 from King Island, where she had been search- ing for the rock reported by the Flying Squir- rel, which vessel was wrecked near Sea Elephant Island, on the eau, coast of King Island, about the end of September, 1875. A notice to mariners was issued by tbe Htr bourdepartmenr, followed in doe coureeby the Hydrographie office giving tbe position of tbe rock upon which tho flying Squirrel was Bald to have struck. The master of tbe wrecked vessel was exonerated on the supposition that be really struck upon an unknown rock, but a thorough examination of the locality proves that no such rock .a in existence, and the barque, without doubt, struck upon the well known reef lying about a mile to the northward of Sea Elephant Island. One of the buntere on King Island informed Captain Stanley that he saw the vessel at 10 in the morning run on to the reef Tbis is the second vessel which has been wrecked since 18G7 upon tbis reef. The Drat waa the barque Omagh, and in consequence of her report the Victoria, in October, 18C8, made a spécial survey, not only of the place of the supposed danger, but of the whole of Sea Elephant Bay. The reported position of the Omagh rock was not very far from that of the Flying Squirrel, but, as a matter of course, if they struck on a known rock, and were de termiued to deny it, m order to avoid the consequences, they only had to give false bearings, ana place the rock in an outside position. The Hospital Sunda; fund for the past yoar has been distributed as follows, viz ,-Mel- bourne Hospital, £2,013 13s 8d ; Alfred Hospital, £093 18s Od.; Benevolent Asylum, £605 14g 7d ; Lying m Hospital, £303 lös.

In Augnst last, in consequence of a tele gram received by the Governor from the faecretary of State for the Colonies, two men named Mark Lyons and Morris Karhsbaw were arrested on their arrival here in the s s Somersetshire, the former being charged with feloniously receiving stolen property in Onqualand, South Africa, anu the latter with abetting in the same. Karlishaw, who op peared to have been the dupe of his partner, was discharged, but Lyons was remanded time after time, pending the receipt of docu- mentary evidence After the lapse of nearly three months, the original depositions were received,but no witness arrived to a wear to the signatures appended though ltwas stated that an officer had been despatched from South Africa. No witness arrived, and Lyons, after having been repeatedly remanded, was discharged. On the 5th inst Her Majesty's war ship Wolverine arrived at Sydney, and having called at the Cape of Good Hope, brougEt Iroiu thence Mr. W. M'Kenna, sub- inspector of the Gll_UR-»ad constabulary, with depositions and a warrant í_í tas ftrrçBt of Mark Lyons, on the charge of having re- ceived stolen property Mr. M'Kenna arrived in Melbourno a few days later, only, of coarse, to find the bird flown Lyons and Kailisbaw both left for London by the St. Osyth on the Gth of December, and this fact had at the eame time been telegraphed to the Home authorities Curiously enough, the Wolverine ond the St Osyth spoke each other off Western Australia Mr. M Kenna pro- ceeded to England in the Kent, with the view of again apprehending Lyons, and takir g him back to South Africa lu all pro babihty, however, he will be saved much trouble there by finding the fugitive m custody. One or two instances of busbranging have occurred recently on the New South Wales border. About 37 miles from Albury, on the main Sydney road, and about three miles from Germanton, is a small store kept by a man named Bounds The house is a mere roadBide store, doing business principally with teamsters, the place being a convenient and favourite camping ground About half past 10 on Saturday night, January ü two men rode up to the store on horseback, and one of them dismounted, and, giving his horse into the charge of bis companion, entered the house Pro- ducing two revolvers and presenting one, he ordered the inmates of the store-Mr. Boanda and his wife, and a girl about 15 years of age-in true busbranging style to "Bail up," a command which it need hardly be said was at once obeyed, The robber then pro. ceeded to tie np bis three subjects, a work which he accomplished m a secute and work- manlike manner. Having made all fast be inquired what money there was in the place, and ascertaining the whereabouts of the till, helped himself to its contents, which fortu- nately amounted only to £115s , 25s in silver and a half sovereign. To make up for the insignificance of the money booty he then proceeded to help biroBelf to some of the store goods, and having selected what he wanted, be removed the bandage from Mr. Bounds' eyes and forced bim to sign a cheque on the Commercial Bank, Albury, for £22, a document not of much use to the bushrangers, as the bank got notice of the robbery early on Monday. After obtaining the cheque, the robber quietly rejoined his companion, mounted his horse, and rode away. The police on receiviug information went in pursuit. Two or three cases of misconduct on the part of masters or officers of vessels trading to this port have been made publicduring the month. Upon the arrival from Liverpool of the Ship Loch Lomond, the passengers for- warded to the Steam Navigation Board a formal complaint against the master, Thos Meiklejohn, of continued drunkenness daring the voyage out The charge was inquired into on the 22nd inst The evidence was conclusive, and the masters certificate was BOBpended for l8 months The command of the vessel has been conferred on the chief officer. WalterS Watts, the master of the brig Doretta, has been committed for trial on an information of having cruelly ill-treated a little boy named Elias Wright, belonging to his crew. The alleged ill treatment con- sisted of having tnced the boy up by the thumbs to a Bhearpole Gft. lin. from the deck, and kept him in that position BO that bis feet bai ely touched the deck, for about two hours. Thomas Bewley, the chief oflicet of the ship Antiope, was charged at the Sandridge Police Court, on the 12 h ins1-, with having, on the 2nd met, murdered a lad named John Howard Southern, an apprentice belonging to the ship The evidence showed that the deceased was ordered to remove some boughs placed on the yards and mast head of the ship on the day named. He had been several times sent to the mast head during the day, and bad been kept without his dinner. He stated he would try next day, but was too tired then to go. Too mate ii Biatmg he went up the riggintr, but fell before reaching the most head, and received injuries of a vory serious nature, from which which he died. At the inquest the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, but severely censured both the first and second mates for their inhumanity. Pro- ceedings were taken against the first mate in the police court, but the Bench, consider- ing there was no evidence of intentional ciuelty, dismissed the information. The inquest on the body of the woman Ann Hastings, who was found murdered near 1 rankston on December 12, was held on December 21 William Hastings, the husband of the deceased woman was present in custody The evidence, which was chieily of a circumstantial character, incriminated the prisoner, againBtwhom the jury returned a verdict of wilful murder. He was accord- ingly committed for trial. A boating accident, whereby two lives were lost, occurred at Brighton on Monday, Januarj 8 Tour young men, named James M.uuiz l8 years of age, son of Mr George Mouriiz of Brighton, William Mortimer about 10 yeatB of oge, Bon of Mr. J F. Mot ti- mer, of the Customs department; John Adamson, about 17 years of age, non of the late Mr. W. Adamson, of M'Caw, Adamson mid Co , Little Collins Btreet, and Norman Paterson, 17 years of age, son of Mr W Paterson, of the Assay Office, Bank of Aua ttalasia, were out sailing m a small skiff called the Belle They had gone out for the purpose of picking up a buoy which had been used to mark the course of the race for the Brighton Sailing Club Cup, which took place on Saturday afternoon. The boat was nnder the charge of Mouritz, who was accustomed to sailing. There waB a still southerly breeze blowing and a heavy sea on the bay. The boat was sailing before the wind, and the attempt was made to alter her course by gybing. Just as her boom was passing over, tho boat was caught by a Budden gust of wind and capsized, and the four young men were thrown into the water, about three* quarters of a mile from shore. Mouritz Bceing that the boat was comparatively buoyant, told the others to stick to her while he swam ashore for assistance. He left them clinging to the moat, and started for the shore He was a _ood swimmer, but he bad been Buffering for some time past from a bad leg, which prevented him making rapid progress. Two gentlemen who saw the skiff capsize procured a a boat immediately and rowed to the rescue. They picked up Monritz and reached the boat in time to save Mortimer, whom they found still clinging to the mast Adamson Btarted for shore soon after Monritz had left, and when a few yards away fiom the boat sunk, Paterson then et go his hold, and sank quite close to the boat Another unfortunate accident occurred on the Yarra on January 13, whereby Mr. C. E Torrance, a gentleman who held a responsi ble position in Mesera. Sargood Son, and Co 's warehouse Flinders-street, and brother of the Rev G W Torrance curate of St. John s Church, Latrobe street, was drowned. Abont i o'clock in the afternoon he hired a boat and rowed up the river About 10 p m two men, named George Mansfield and Robert Lynch, were fiahing in tbe river near the Survey paddock, and heard someone Strug gling in the water, and subsequently saw the boat iloat down tbe river empty Being unable to do anything towards rescuing the drowning person they went immediately to Richmond and reported the occurrence to the police, The body of Mr Torrance waB re covered next day at tbe Bpot indicated The boat was subsequently fonnd further down the river, and to all appearance it had not been capsized It is supposed that the de ceased overbalanced himself and fell into the water. The death, under very sad circumstances. in the bush, of Thomas Stevenson, second son of Mr. Alexander Stevenson, of Messrs, Stevenson and Elliot, carriage builders, King street has been reported. The deceased was 16 years and 10 months old, and was staying with his elder brother Archibald at their station, Bendilmee, about 50 miles from Louth, New South Wales. At 1 o clock on the morning of Friday, the 8th December, Thomas started on horseback for the post office at Louth and arrived there during the day. He set out for home again at daybreak on the following Saturday, but instead of re turning by the ordinary way he took what he thought would be a shorter route On Wed- nesday his horse arrived at the station rider, less, with the coat, scarf, and spurs of the deceased fixed to the saddle. It was then feared that he had been lost in the bush, and his brother Archibald, with black trackers, started to search for him The weather had been extremely hot, and it was known that the missing young man never carried a water bag. The black trackers found that he had been wandering on the Debil Debil moun- tains, on ascending which, and finding that be could not take his horse down the other side, he had turned back for the purpose of getting round the base of the mountains Instead of doing this, however, he had gone back towards Louth, and darkness coming upon him, he had camped out, and hobbled his horse The trackers ultimately traced him to a lonely part of the bush where on the following Sunday they found his lifeless body lying in a composed manner between two logs Two or three days after losing his way, and when he must have suffered severely from thirst it would seem that he had become resigned to his fate and prepared himself for death Having taken off his coat, scarf, and spurs, and fixed them on his horse, leaving that animal to find its own way home, he had placed the two logs on a track and laid down between them, with his head resting on a cross piece at one end, and thus expired. His body was conveyed to the station and there buried Among the obituary notices of the month we have to record the death of Mr R D Ireland, Q C The deceased gentleman for many years occupied a prominent position m public life, aawwas one of the most distin- guished members of the Victorian bar. He came to the colony in 1852, and soon acquired a lucrative practice He entered public life in 1857, having, after two or three failures, succeeded in gaining a seat in the Legislative Assembly for Castlemaine In l818 he became Solicitor General in the Chaf man AdnmvBtration, and held office till October the following year In Novem ber, I860 he joined the UealeB Ministry as Attorney General, and failing to obtain bis re election, was for six months nnable to obtain a seat, tbongh holding ofii'e He quarrelled with his colleagues, and retired irom the Ministry but when that Adminis- tration was ousted he joined the coalition Government then formed aa Attorney General, and held offico until June, 18G3, He resigned hia Beat in May, 18C1 and for nearly two years took no part m politics, bat in 18U6 he re entered political life, and waa one of the leaders in the famous "tack" and Darling grant struggle. At the general election of 1868 he was defeated, and did not again enter Parliament. In his pro feBBion he maintained a leading position until about two years ago, when his health gave way. In 1SG3 he was created a Queen's counsel, and in 1868 he visited New Zealand under special retainer to defend certain porsons (alleged Fenians) con- cerned in a riotous procession at Uokitika. In private life he was Been to the greatest advantage, and though not without grave faults of character, will be remembered as a brilliant leader of the bar, as an ublÈand eloquent statesman, and as a warm hearted and companionable friend He died at his residence, South Yarra, on January 11, and was buried on the following day in the St Kilda Cemetery, the funeral being foi lowed by many of the leading members of the community and personal friends. Mr. Matthew M Caw, of the firm of M Caw, Adamson, and Co, died on December 30 The deceased, who was 61 years of age, was an old colonist, and for some years took a part in the politics of the colony. At the general election of 1866 he became a member of the Legislative Assembly, when he was re- turned for East Bourke in conjunction with Mr Balfour, He was re olected in 186S, but resigned during tbe year 1870 and was succeeded by Mr. Ramsay. He has not emce taken part in public affairs Captain Colley, an old colonist, well known in shipping and commercial circles died on January 0 He had been a resident of Melbourne for nearly 27 years. The early jems of his life were spent at sea, and in 18-19 he commanded a vessel trading between Melbourne and Tasmania When the dis- covery of gold was made here he quitted the pea, and in 1852 entered into business in Melbourne He was about 56 years of age at tbe time of his death. Mr Matthew Mar- wood, of the late firm of Lorimer, Marwood, and Rome, Queen street, died on January 8 at the age of 44 years He bad been m ill health for some time past The deceased had been over l8 years in the colony. POLITICAL. Since the prorogation of Parliament, mat tera political have been quiet, but there are already premonitions of the forthcoming general election. Candidates are starting up on all sides, expressing their willingness to place their services at the disposal of their country. Parliament will be dissolved about the end of March, and the general election will take place during the month of April. The new electoral rolls cannot be completed before the end of February, and as BOOU as they are ready tbe necessary arrangements will be made for holding the general election. Under the new Eloctoral Act the writs must be issued within seven dayB after the dissolution of the Assembly The nomina bon day must not be less thanJ&ur; nor more than seven clear days from tfTWdate of the issue of the writ, and the polling day not less than four nor more than seven clear dayB from the day of nomination All elec tic-us take place on the same day The utmost time that can elapse between the dis solution of the Assembly and the election of the new Assembly can therefore bo only threo weeks The Minister of Lands, Mr Gillies who baa represented Maryborough for several yearB post, has addressed bia constituents stating that it is not his intention to solicit their suffrages at the general election Ha stated that as a great change had been made in the electorate by joining with Maryborough a large portion of the former district of Cres wick, be bad to determine either to contest the new district with two friends, when one of tbem must necessarily be defeated, or solicit the BuffragoB of another electorate Ho determined to do the latter, and he came to that decision with considerable regret In response to a numerously signed requisition he has since intimated his intention of standing for Rodney Mr Wrixon, who has represented Belfast in the Assembly for the last nine years, has intimated bis intention not to present him self for re election at the approaching general election, on the ground that tho act lately passed has made that constituency not merely diffeienr, but opposite in political charactor to that which be had hitherto represented A careful analysis of the rolls showed that a party, or combination, whose determined op- position he must expect could command a decided majority of votes He was anxious not to be excluded from the next Parliament, which will be the answer of the public of Vic tona to the most momentous question ever submitted to it, and which will constitute, for good or bad, a turning point in our political life He therefore intended to contest a metropolitan consltuency. It is probable that he will stand '««Fitzroy. * The main questioWat the coming election will be that of free trade v. protection. Both patties are organising for the coafliot, I The Free-trade League has extended its rami- fications throughout the colony. At the last meeting Mr. Colin Campbell, M.L. A, resigned his position as secretary to the league, on the ground that he bad been informed that the fact of his being a squatter and a landowner lent colour to the insinuation of the enemies of the league that it was allied with the landed proprietom to prevent the imposition of a land tax, Mr. Lyell brought forward a motion affirming the desirability of direct taxation, bnt after considerable discussion, in which the opinion was expressed that the resolution went outside the sphere of the league, it was withdrawn. The Protectionist camp is somewhat divided, and is ropresontod by two leagues-the Protection League, whoee object is tbe maintenance and exten- sion of protection pure and simple ; and the National Reform League, of whose plat- form protection is but a single plank. In view of the approaching conflict efforts have been madefor the amalgamation of the two bodies, but without Buccess. The terms submitted hy the Protection League wore ¡ "1. That protection be the first plank in the platform for the general election. 2. That the two leagues bave equal representation in the amalgamated body. 3. That the amalga- mated budy be called tbe ' Victorian Protec- tion and National Reform League.'" The Reform League replied :-" Resolved, that this council, having established the National Reform League on a popular basis, is unable to concede to the re- quest of the Protection League delegates viz,, to alter its name and constitution; but this council shall with pleasuro receive the members of the Protection League, and admit them to this league. This council further expresses its hearty desire for the cooperation of tbe said Protection League, innsmnch as the constitution of the National Refoim League contains the principle of protection in its entirety." The proposals therefore fell to the ground. _ At tbe close, of the session a table was pub- lished in The Argus showing the number of times each member of the Legislative Aesembly had addressed the House during its continuance. The "facts and figures there presented exhibit in the most un- mistakable manner the disgraceful pitcb to which the eacoiithes loouendi has reached in the lower branch of the Victorian Parlia- ment. Comparing the session of the House of Commons, which commenced on the 6th February, and lasted till the 4th August, 1873, for a " comparison of talkativeness" with the final session of the eighth Parlia- ment of Victoria, which commenced on July the lltb, and ended on December 22, 1876, having held 71 sittings, we find the following result : House of Commons Legislative Assembly Number of speakers 335 77 Number of speeches 4386 5143 Average for each speaker 13 66 Average for tho whole House . 6 65 Number of memhers who spoke less than 10 times 168 11 Number of momborB who tpolie lloro than 10 times .. 1£8 68 Moro than 20 times ,, 70 Í7 Moro than SO times .. 80 51 Moro than 40 limos .. l8 43 More than CO limes ..

Omitting Mr. Berry, who, as leader of the Opposition, might perhaps be legitimately allowed consi- derable latitude as to the number of his speeches, the members who must be credited, or discredited, with having caused the greatest waate of time during the post BOB sion by wanton torrent« of words are the fol- lowing, and their names are given in the order of demerit :-MesBrs, Gaunson, A. T. Clark, Woods, Bent, Munro, Longmore, Mac Bain, Lalor, and Major Smith. The united speeches of these nine members nnmber no less than 1,419! or an average of 157 for each. _ ARRIVAL OF THE NEW BISHOP OF MELBOURNE. The Right Rev. Dr. Moorhouse, the new Bishop of Melbourne, arrived by the mail Bl earner Bangalore on the 7th inst., and has met 'with a very cordial and gratifying re. ception. The Bangalore reached the Heads at a very early hour on Sunday morning, aid there was, in consequence, no formal reception by the clergy and laity of the diocese as originally intended. The Rev. H. J. Wilkinson, incumbent of the church at Queenscliff, boarded the steamer and presented an address of welcome to the bishop. The steamer then proceeded up the bay, and arrived off Williamstown about 3 a,m, Shortly before 9 o'clock the Very Rev. the Dean of Melbourne, Sir Wm. Foster Sta- well, Chief-Justice, Hon. T. T. A'Bockett, registrar, and others, went on board and wel- comed the bmhop to bia new diocese, A special train with the Governor's state car- riage was in waiting at Williamstown, and upon the arrival of the train at Spencer street the Governor's carriage was in readi- ness, and the bishop and Mrs. Moorhouse were driven to Government-bouse, where they remained for some days OB the guests of Sir George and Lady Bowen. The installa- tion Bervice was performed on Thursday, January 11, at the cathedral church of St. James's, William-atreet. The ceremony was one of an interesting character, and a large number of members of the Episcopalian de- nomination attended. The church was too email 'or the occasion, and the ceremony vas robbed to some extent of its impressive character by the overcrowding and confusion consequent thereon, Nearly all the clergy in the diocese were present. The installation was conducted by Archdeocon Tucker, who was empowered by commission from the vicar-general, who waB too ill to bs present. The bishop preached a short sermon. After the service was over addresses from the clergy and laity were presented to the bishop at the diocesan registry. The luncheon to welcome the bishop was then held in the Athenuum. His Excellency the Governor presided, and over 306 ladiea and gentlemen were pieBent, In replying to the toast of his health, Dr. Moorhouse made an effective speech. Speaking in reference to a remark in one of the addresses presented to him, he observed- "You have said our church isa comprehensive institution. I particularly remarked that phrase, because I believe it to be profoundly true. There are several reasons wby the church is distinguished by this characteristic. One is that her constitution allows great diversity of opinion on doctrinal points to exist within her pale without de- stroying ber unity. (Applause.) The position taken np.by the church necessarily leaves room for considerable diversity ot opinion. Our constitution makes na comprehen- sive, and we cannot help ourselves." Again, in dealing with the necessity for establishing an institution : for the training of clergymen, he remarked Since my arrival here I have heard that one of the great wants of the church in the diocese is the necessity for supplying ministers of sufficient culture to keep abreast of the times. I have been told that the church in the colony desires certain work to be done for the doing of which men of a high cultured type are required. We cannot ex- pect to draw for the wants of this colony from English sources. To draw English clergy- men to the colony we must have far more overpowering reasons to induce them to come than appear to me at present to prevail here, For instance I could not conscientiously urge to such a man as a reason for coming here the greater liberty of our church although that is a powerful argument that had its effect with myself. Nor could I dilate upon the spiritual destitution of the colony. In the latter case my answer would at once be-Why it is absurd, tbat over 800 000 Anglo Saxons of an energetic character, settled in a fine colony like Victoria, cannot breed their own parsons, with- out coming to England to beg for them. 'Ihe question then arises, what are the best efforts we can see for the education of these men ourselves? I mean for the education and training of the cultured men which the church requires. Under the existing state of things, of course it is ímpossible for me to appoint difficult examinations for candi- dates desirous of entering the service of the church, if the means are not afforded such candidates of coming up to that standard. It is, to speak plainly a matter altogether for your consideration. If you, members of the church, come to church to worship God, you niUBt necessarily listen to sermons. These sermons may be good, bad, or in« different, but if they aro bad certainly none but yourselves can make them better, because none but you can furnish the means of edu- eating clergymen that will be capable of preaching good sermons. It is altogether for you to deal with, for, in fact it is a mere question of pounds, shillings and pence-a question of money, after all. If the means are afforded na of establishing a theological college in connexion with the University of Melbourne, presided over by two men Belected, say, from my own university or Oxfotd, you would have in a few years men coming from Buch an institution with scientific and theological traimug which would supply the want thatis now felt in the colony. If we want men to teach our clergy, we must adopt this means of obtain- ing them You must either starve your pockets or starve your souls I feel that this ia a subject of moBt vital importance. My pocket is not a full one, but I feel on this subject so deeply, that I will pledge myself, if anyone initiates this project of providing an institution for the training of the clergy of the diocese to subscribe towards it £200. (Applause ) On Sunday, January 14, the bishop held an ordination service at St James a Cathedral The following day a public meeting to wet come the biBhop waa held in the Town hall Tho hall waa densely crowded, and many hundreds of persons who sought admission were unable to obtain it The chair waB occupied by the Ven. A. Craw fuid Archdeacon of Castlemaine, the Dean of Melbourne, who was to have presided, being unable to attend in consequence of lllneSB A large number of clergymon of a'l the Protestant denominations were present His Excellency the Governor and suite, with Lady Bowen, were present amongst the audience in the balcony. The BISHOP in the course of his epeeoh remarked that since he spoke at the dejeuner the other day about giving a better educa* tion and a longer education to their minis teis, be bad been met with this observa tion- 'You don't seem to appreciate (he poverty of the Cbnrch of England in Vic- toria " (Laughter ) Well, no, he did not. (Laughter ) He looked round that room and saw no signa of it (Laughter and op planee ) He looked at miles of villas and he Baw no signs of it He met working men in their clothes in the Btreets and he had seen no signs of it (Applause ) He supposed they were not very much poorer than the denomi- nations that atood beside them, and if they were, Billi he knew of no poverty that could discourage him here (Loud applause ) He put it to them aa men of common sense-he would not to night speak of the higher aspect, of that question-ho would not say a word about their common duty to fight for the glory of God, tor the welfare of mankind, for the advancement of the kingdom of Christ, but he would put it upon the quea tion of self interest and he would say boldly that if tbey bad money, there was no form of expendituie which the; could indulge in that would bting them in as good a return as giving their ministers a good education. Since he bad last spoken he had bad an ordi nation m wbat they wore constrained to call their cathedral. (Laughter ) Now, tbat waB a very inconvenient building He wonted to see here in Melbourne for his fellow churchmen-not of one parish, but of all parishes-anti for all strangers coming to Melbourne from time to time grand services, such as people crowded to in St Paul's or Westminster Abbey If a man were asked to assist in building a cathedral, he would not litte to hear him say he did not want to contribute to a cathedral because be would rather build up living things He would not like such an answer, for it would be a sham. It would be a Bham because every man who could afford it built a fine house to live in. If he went to men who built such houses, and said they ought rather tobe looking after tbe poor and the blind and the naked than be building such houses, he would be snubbed, and rightly so too, for the men would say they could do as they liked, and their consciences were their own Vi hat he wanted was, not to take away one farthing from what anyone be stowed on the poor, but a little from the money they devoted to their fine hoasea He was sure ho had a right to ask that If people were in a small place or district he would say only build a shanty for a church, as that would accord with their circam stances, but people around Melbourne built palaces for residences, and it did not ac cold with their daily life to put up shanties for churches. The people of Sydney and Ade laido were shaming the people of Melbourne by their churches, and the Presbyterians and Independents in Melbourne were showing the Church of England people here what to do He had asked what were tho principal churches he saw here, and to whom they bo longed, and was told they belonged to the Roman Catholics, or the Independents, or the Presbyterians, and when he asked what belonged to the Church of England, bo was told St. James's (Laughter ) It might be said he would find many difficulties in his way m regatd to tbe cathedral, bat he had never yet gone back half a foot in the face of difficulty, and he hoped he would not do so until he was m his dotage. If they would set to work in right earnest, and assist him m raising the cathedral, they would soon have it finished. A commencement was made at Christ Church, South Yarra, on Sunday last, in the matter of rowing a fund for the erection of a new Church of Lngland Cathedral as sag gested by the Bishop of Melbourne, Dr Moor house After the address of the bishop at the meeting of welcome in the Melbourne Town ball, the Rev W. P Pearce the minis* ter of this church, suggested to the church- wardens that the offertory at tbo morning Beivico on Sunday should be devoted to the inauguration of the new cathedral fund, and the suggestion was at once agreed te. The church was crowded. The sermon was preached by the bishop, and the collection, from a congregation numbonng 11D0 per- sons, was £29 4a 8d. A committee has been formed to promote the erection of the proposed new cathedral It is empowered to ooneidor and roport upon the most suitable Bite and the best modes of raising the necessary funds. Two gentlemon hat e intimated their intention of contributing £500 each, and a third has promised £1 000. THE REVENUE RETURNS.

The conclusion of each year affords an opportunity of ascertaining the total yield of gold in the colony daring the year, and as there is no certain mode of arriving at an idea of the progresa of mining, so far aa the yields are concerned, at any other period, a carefnl calculation is made by The Argus immediately after the close of every year. The estimate is arrived at by taking the amount of Victorian gold exported in the year, the amonnt minted, and the difference in the amonnt held by the various banks-who are the gold- buyers here-at the commence- ment and at the closo of the your. The Customs retains show that in 187G Victorian gold was exported to the amount of 709,031oz. lBdwk, of the value of £2,841,037, and that in 187G there waB 50G,221oz.

Daring 18CC, 1,536 58loz of gold were obtained, while last year only 937 260oz, rewarded the labour of the miners This shows a falling off in the annual yield of 599 32loz, which, at £4 per ounce, equals £2 397,231 Of course, the diminution may be accounted for by the reduction m the number of miners employed, but this does not make the matter any more satisfactory In 1856 there were 73 479 men employed in mining, while m 1876 only 41 5C4 were so engaged. Some idea of the capital sunk yearly in mining operations may be arrived at by dividing the groaa produce amongst those employed in obtaining it Omitting frac lions, the yield during the last 11 years, valued at £4 per ounce, if divided amongst the miners engaged, would have been equal to the following weekly woges - Weekly Weokly Year.

Of course, as long as mining goaa on to any extent there must always be a large sum of money sunk before any returns can be obtained and what propor- tion will be eventually recovered it is impos- sible to say. It would be absurd to assert that the immediate prospects of gold-mining in tbis colony aro very cheering Last yew at this time we were hoping that the diB covery of gold bearing quartz at an immense, depth had inaugurated a new era in this in- dustry, and that great results might follow However, very little has been heard of such achievement Tho Government has again induced Parliament to grant a sum of money for prospecting purposes but one cannot entertain any very lively expectations on tbat account Exploration conducted on the " Government Btroke system is never likely to result in any very astounding discoveries It appears that the only likely way to assist mining enterprise is to relieve the miner from the burden of taxation undor which he now labours, and so give him a fair field for the display of his own energios Pnat plan can be commended as an easy and sensible way of helping a great industry to the atten tion of the coming Parliament It cannot be said for a certainty whether it will bring back prosperity or not, but if it fad the Govenirneiit can do no more. Although tbo gold yield has fallen as stated above, the dividends which bave been paid to the shareholders in mining companies were higher in 1876 than in 1875 by the sum of £75 275. The following table shows the mining dividends for the past three years, distinguishing quartz from alluvial - -iear Quartz Mines Alluvial Mines Total Mining Dividends 1874 _ 1876 1870 £ 800 000 672 260 669,478 £ 45 005 83 690 71048 £ 862 001 055 813 731,121 The exceBS in the amount of dividends over 1875 is principally attributed to the smaller amount of prospectinggoingon in the varions districts, and the determination, as a rule, to work only paying gold-reefs or alluvial wnslies. The following remarks from the Bendigo Adiertiser, although applying spe- cially to mining affairs in the Sandhurst dis trict, may, in so far as the mode of working is concerned, be taken as tolerably correat if applied to many other divisions of the auri- ferous portions of Victoria - 'Great ad- vances have been made by managers in the ekilful management of their claims, for though the past years yield of gold is tho smallest known since the beginning of 1870 yet the average of dividends declared per company is larger for 187b than for any previous Bimilar period. Had the prospects of tbe year finished up in as healthy a manner as thej commenced, very brilliant resulte wonld have been achieved, bat un- fortunately, it has been otherwiee It is not for a moment to be denied that the yield of gold, especially within tho last few months, bas greatly fallen off, and is now smaller than it has beeu for years past. The laBt year's work ehown a decrease upon that very dull year 1875 of 20 076oz , but though lees gold has been actually won from the earth, the largest percentage for the last four years of dividends per company bas been paid Inclusive of an allowance made for dividends from private claimB the total net profits of the year 1876 are £101 C93, as against £312 8C5 for 1S75 or in other words though during the last year wo have obtained 20 OOOoz less gold from our mines than before, yet we have boen able to declare £161 830 more in dividends 1 or the decrease in the yield of ¿old no BUUI lent cause is assigned It IB not shown that the quartz recently broken is poorer in its quality or more expensive to work, but, on the contrary, we believe that the cost of breaking raising and cruBbmg it has been leas per ton than at any known timo before and also that the nverage of gold per ton is higher. It ia not in any of these causeB that the decrease must be looked for, but in what the actuil amount of work done in our mines amounts to when compared with former periods We believe that never during the lait five years has there been so little prospecting done as now- never hoB the call list been so small, for the whole of biet year it is only about half of what it was for six months only, in 1871 and 187.2 On'y £101 007 havo been paid in to the mines during the yoar, while £404 095 actual profits have been distributed, nnd for this paltry outlay of £101 007 in calla 274 93107 of gold have been obtained, or equal in round numbers to £1 0 )C 000 wealth distributed in the district " The districts from which last year s mining dividends were derived rank as follows m ordir of amount distributed -Sjndhurat, £344 695 , Stawell, £U1 418 GippB Land, £97 loO , Creswick, £56 550 Clunes £3o 002 , Egerton and Gordon's £22 000 , Daylesford nnd Maldon, £12 618 Smytheadale, £9 226 , Blackwood, £7,187 , Wood's Point, £5 587 , Maryborough, £ > ¿50 , Ballarat, £1 600 , Reefton (Upper "i. arra), £1,100 , Lauriston, £1 258. The following six companies, all quartz, rank highest (or amount of profite distributed nmong their shaiebolders during the past year -North Cross Reef, Stawell, £77 000, Long Tunnel, V, alhalle £76 800 , Viotory, Sandhurst, £63 4Ü9 12S , Pandora, Sandhurst, £58100 , Gorden Gully United, Sandhurst £51,836 18a 6d ; Extended Cross Reef, Stawell, £34 776 The first two have each occupied a place among the premier six for many years paBt, the Garden United for three years , the Victory, Pandora, and Extended Cross appear for the first time. An application was made to the Minister of Mines on the 18th inst, by Mr B G Davies M L A , to appoint a prospecting party to test the large area of comparatively untried gronnd lying between Berlin (now Rheola) and Wedderburn. From the exceedingly difficult nature of the sinking which is prin cipally through a bed of hard conglomerate, , and from the densityof the mallee scruby the district has not been developed, but it is believed that there are rich allnvial deposits in the locality, as there have been long con- tinued goàd yields at Orville, Rheola, and other townships. The Minister of Mines replied that Mr Warden Orme had received instructions to form a local prospecting board under whose management a prospecting patty would be sent out. No time would be lost in setting the prospectors to work. He also stated that the vote on the Intimates for prospecting new country for the year was far too smail to test the deep grouud under the basaltic plains of the Loddon, as at one time promised, that the land was found to be principally private properly, and that the subject must therefore bo deferred pending further legislation. It is also understood that tbe Miu.ng department has made arrangements for the immediate despatch of a prospecting party to the Gippa Land dis trict The party has received instructions to commence operations in the vicinity of Stock yard Creek, and other parties will be sent ont from time to time, as the wardens select the men for the work The 01 oration of the Regulation of Mines Statute during the past year has been of a most satisfactory character and the results Bhow that tbo act bas done much to diminish the number of preventible accidents by caus ing greater care to be exercised in the large mining claims In 1874 the number of accidents recorded was 296 in 1875 the number decreased to 27J and during last year the number has been still further reduced by about one third. It must, however, be borne in mind that the number of miners is also diminishing, but the cons derable dec-ease in the acci dents is without doubt due in a great measure to the beneficial operation of this act The number of fatal accidents is also vory much smaller In 1874, there were 90 fatal accidents , m 1875 83, bat last year the number was reduced to 63 The regu- lations for the prevention of mining acci- denta act moat successfully, as might be ex pected, m regard to the large quartz mining drums, wbeie a more strict inspection can be maintained, and where the responsibility can be placed on the owners or managers of the works The des.rability of extending the operation of this act, so that the reaponsi bility can be thrown on the mining manager or any other person through whose laches an accident may be caused, ia under considera tion, and with other alterations recom- mended by the mining conference some time Bince, will donbtleSB be incorporated in the amending bilL In alluvial mining, whore the operations are, as a rule, on a smaller scale, many of the accidents are cauBed through the carelessness of the men them- selves and are prevented only by the exercise of greater caution. AGRICULTURE. The harvest in Victoria has been brought to a close, excepting only m the latest dis. tncts, and as the weather during the past fortnight bas been almost rainless, work is well forward and will virtually be brought to a CIOBO by the end of the month. Harvest hands have been very unequally distributed this season, so that immoderately high rates have been paid in certain localities, whilst no difficulty has been experienced in pro- curing labour in others We are unable for the present to state anything certain with regard to the yield of wheat beyond the fact of the range being even wider than usual Instances have been reported of the results of threshing being less than a bag per acre, whilst yields of nearly 50 buahels per acre will also, we aro assured, figure in the returns of the Government statist. The former, the small yield, has been reported to us from the Terricks the latter from the Bellarine district and throughout the colony jiolds will be found of every degree between those two extremes In mercantile circles an impression is general that the usual average will not be reached, and this has manifested itself in a stiffening of priceB, which will be found referred to in our com- mercial columns The trial of automatic leaping and binding machines under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, announced m our last monthly summary, has not been concluded, an accident having happened to a promising machine by the upsetting of a dray. It will however, be further tested with others on the 1st prox at Kyneton, and, if necessary, at Bungaiee, in the Ballarat district, on the Ck The drought, which has become re esta- blished, IB Beriously affecting the supply of feed and water in many parts of this colony, but not to the Bame extent as in parts of New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia Heavy raine have lately been reported in the north, but as usual they have been partial, and until the close of february any rain which may occur mil not be likely to affect the supply of feed in the warmer districts.

RAILWAY RETURNS, The returns of traffic on the Victorian lines of railway, all of which are the property of the colony with the exception of those held by the Hobson's Bay Company, show a favourable increase for 1876 over 1875. The amount of money taken for all kinds of traffic in 1875 was £949,363, and in 1876 £1,028,878, or an increase of £70.515 for the latter year. There were 699 miles of lines open at the end of 1876, and 599 at the close of 1875. The return from the traffic on the same lines for the week ending the 11th inBt. was £19,604 18a., as against £20,714 16s. for the corresponding week in 1876, From the let of July last to the 11th inst the aggregate return was £5S4,545 18s,, as against £549,712 5s. lOd, for the correspon- ding periods in the years 1875 and 1876. Tbe weekly average since June laBt for the 1876-7 periods was £20,87612a. 9J., and for the cor responding 1875.6 periods, £19,632 11s. 8d. The traffic on the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Company's lines, of which there have been no extensions for a long time past, in- creases rapidly year by year. From the 1st of July, 1876, to tbe end of the same year, the total amount of traffic waa returned at £93,325 le. 3d., as against £87,22714s Id. for the cor- responding six months of 1S75. The weekly averages during the same periods were-for 1876, £3 550; and for 1875, £3,318. The amount taken in the first 11 dayB of this year was £9,497 18a. 10d., and in the first 13 dayB of 187D it was £9,784 5s. Id. THE WEATHER. With the exception of a few hot days the weather for the,past month has been ex. ceptionally pleasant for ibis time of the year, and at "times'quite'cool. For a couple of days after the departure of the last mail the weather was equally, with drizzling rain. Oa tbe 4th and 5th inst the wind was very boisterous, with a high temperature, the thermometer registering 91 Odeg. in the Bbade. On the 10th inBt it agûn became very hot, and the thermometer reached 100 7deg. in the shade, and on the 13th it fell to 44 2d eg. The rainfall has been light for the past three weeks. For the year 1876 the total rainfall WOB 24 05in., aa compared with 32S7in. during the year 1875, 28 Win. in 1874, 25 61in. in 1873, 35 62in. in 1872. 3017in. in 1871, 33 77in. in 1870, 24 58in. iu 1869, l8 27in. in 1868, 25 79in. in 1867, 22'41in. in' 1866, 15 94in. in 1865, 27 40in. in 1804 30'42in. in 1803 22 OSin. in 18C2 2916in.'in 1861, 25 38in. in 1860, 2182ro. in'1859, 20 Olin. in 1858, or, an average of 20 57 in. THEATRES. There haB been little to noto in regard to theatrical matters during the month, the stages of the three Melbourne theatres having been held since our last Summary by the pantomimes. That at the Royal is an original work by Mr. Garnet Walch, and is entitled " Hey-Diddle-Diddle," &c.; It was altogether too long on its first production, but it has since been cut down considerably, and has proved fairly successful. At the Opera-house, Plancbú's "The King of the Peacocks" has been revived for the Christmas piece, and has answered very well. At the new and very pretty little theatre, the Academy of Music, Farnie's "Heathen Chinee" has been pro- duced with much Buccess. AU throe of the theaties bave vied with one another in the matter of producing a gorgeous transforma- tion scene, and it is difficult to say which ia the moat attractive, each of them being excellent in its way. St George's Hall is occupied by the Royal Illusionists, from the Egyptian-hall, who had a very successful run at Sydney, and appear likely to have a still more successful one in Melbourne, and as tbey are extremely clever, their success is a deserved one. The Princess's Theatre was only once occupied during the month, viz, on Saturday night laBt, when a performance was given for the benefit of the excellent Scottish comedian, Mr, R, S. Pillans. MUSIC. The musical doings of the month have been restricted to a few performances only. There have been three pantomimes playing simultaneously, with the extra attractions of two great circus exhibitions, and one of them containing a menagerie as welL These, with races and other amusements, have been found sufficient to absorb the attention of the pleasure-seekers during the time we mention. On New Year's Night the Mel- bourne Philharmonic Society gave their second representation of Wallace's opera " Maritana," to a tolerably numerous audience, Mr. David Leo was the conductor, and the choral and orchestral work, especially the latter, went admirably well under bia baton. The principal singera were-Mra. Howitz (soprano), Mrs. Rim^den (contralto) Mr. Benjamin Clark (of San Francisco, tenor), Mr. S. Lambie (batitone), and Mr. Juniper (base). They all acquitted themselves with great credit, and the effect upon the audience was most satisfactory. On Fn'day and Satur dry evenings, the 5th and 0th of January, .Mad« moiselle Ilma de Murskaappeared at the TuWL-lial), in two farewell concerts. There VTUB a large attendance on each occasion showing tbat the popularity of this highly gifted vocalist was unabated to the last. She wr-B BEBisted on these two occaBionB byMisB Christian, RA.M, (her first appearance at tbtBB concerts); by Mr. John Hill, K.S., R.A.M. ; by Signori Rosnati, Luisetti, atd Suisini, representing tenor, baritone, and basso voices respectively, and by Mr, T, H. Rainford, an English bass singer of de ecriptive Bongs. Mr. F. L. King was the pianist Mademoiselle Ilma de Murska charmed her bearers with "Jour d'amour," from "Le Pre aux Clores;" "Una voce," from "II Barbiere;" "The Shadow Soi.g," from Dinorah ;" and Proch's "Air with variations," composed by that master rxpressly for her. Besides theBS solo pieces, ehe gave others from operas in concert with the other members of the company. She was enlhuBiaBtically applauded, and was fre- quently encored. She and Mr. Hill left at the beginning of the next week for Sydney, from whence we are informed dnce then tbat they have-taken their departure for San Fiancisco. Signor SUBÍUÍ was also a passen- ger by the same vessel. An excellent enter tiinment, for gentlemen only (Herren* abet d), wns given by the Melbourne Gi mian Liedertafel at Hockin's Assembly. rooniB on the evening of Monday, January 8 The Melbourno quartett party, consisting of MessrB H Curtis, Montague Ju^er, and H Chapman, gave movements from the Op G7 in _. major of Pleyel, and from tho B dut qunrtettOp 71ofIlaydn. They also played with excellent effect the whole of Mandela Hohn'B quartett in E flat Op 12 The audience was greatly delighted with these quartett per forniances and also with the solos for violin, flute, and piano, played respectively by Mesera Curtis, Siede, and Hunter The rest of the programme waB filled up with part Bingiug of a biith order, together wich solos by members of the German Liedertafel The new Italian Opera Company, who have been lecently playing in Sydney nnd Brisbane, are to open here on the lith prox at the Theatre Rojal, in Marchetti's ' Ruy Blas " RACING. A race meeting waa held on the Kensing- ton park course on the 30th December. The- . weather was uncertain, and the attendance was not large The Hurdle Race was won çy* Ebony. DevilBhoof won the Two year old Stakes from start to finish B Sharp was second. The Champion Handicap waB won by Peerless, with Hailstone second, and Sweetbnar third. Colac won the Steeple- chase by a fluke, through Firetail makiog a mistake in the course Mozart won the Handicap Spurt, and Red Rover tho Handi- cap Trot Ihe attendance on the Melbourne racecourse at the V R.C. Champion Race Meeting was very numerous, though not so large as the previous year. A great many were prevented from attending the meeting by ihe threatening aspect of the weather, which at one time promised a very wet after- noon. Thirteen boises started for the Hurdle Race which was won with great ease by Dal.BiDUii, Aaron was second, and Gaffer Gray a good third. The Two year old Stakes biought out ten etaiters The winner was the favourite, First King by King of the Ring fiom MiBctue! , Lockley was second ana Kavaou third. Topper won the £100 Plate, Foodie was second, and Benham third Ten horses started for the Midsum- mer Handicap, which was won by Barmaid, by Fame, Rapid Bay was a close second, and would have won the race but be ran unkindly at the finiBh Seven horses started for the Champion Rate, for which BiiEeis was made first favourite The race was won with the greatest ease by Fride of the Hills 3 .IB by Talk of the Hill, who ran m the van all the way Aldinga kept him company for about two miles and a half, when he retired, and Volo and Calamia drew np to the leader Volo was beaten to a standelill in the straight, and Calamia could never make Pride of the Hills extend him- self Briseis was never m the race, and Richmond, who was much fancied, had not the BlighteBt chance The three milea'journey WDB done in 5m 34_s, the fastest time yet made for a champion race The steeple, chase was won by Saucepan, by Panic, carry* ing lOet 31b All Fours with 12at. was second. Filibuster, by Panic, won the Three year old Handicap, King Winter was second, and Tradition third. CRICKET. THE ALI, ENGLAND ELEVEN MATCHES. The encketmatch between the All-England Eleven and Fifteen of Victoria commenced on Boxing Day, but owing to the inclemency of the weather only a couple of hours' play could take place on that day, and the match was postponed until the following Thursday The weather on the resumption of the game was all that could be desired, and continued delightful until the CIOBO of the match on the Saturday evening, the result being a victory for the colonials by 31 rune, after one of the most interesting displays of cricket evt-r seen in the colony. The English men having non the tOBS, Bent their opponents to the wickets, who made a good stand, totting np 100 runs in their first innings, of which 41 were contributed by Midwinter, 34 by Horan 21 by Alexander, 20 by Blackbam, und 12 by Gibson (captain). The batting of Midwinter and Horan-especially the patient display of careful and excellent cricket by the latter-waa particularly admired Midwinters total included some of the finest hits Been on the ground, and obtained from Shaw's bowling The Eleven in their first luninga only succeeded in scoring 135, owing to the splendid bowling of Allan, Midwinter, and Ken dall, and the excellent fielding of the colonial team, who were evidently on their mettle throughout the match, aud intent on not being behind Sydney m scoring a victory cgionat the Lngliehmen. The Victorians commenced their second innings late in the afternoon, when the light waa bad for the batsmen, and at first the wickets fell in an claiming manner, eight men being bowled for 10 runs. On the Saturday morning however, Horan (47 not out) and Blackhatn (16) made a fine stund, and a total of 105 was secured, leaving the All England Hieven 161 rnuB to obtain to win. They were only able, however, to put together 120 althtugh they had only four wickets down for 02 Some of the Englishmen notably Charlwood, Gleenwood, Emmett Selby, and Uiyett-gave a fine exhibition of batting, and the game throughout waa one well worthy of the large attendance it attracted. Although the victory of the Vic tonaría was bailed with enthusiasm, and a testimonial collected on the ground for pre sentalion to Allan, Midwinter, and Horan, it is but fair to the spectators to say that they were most impartial throughout ia their distribution of applause. The Hieven afterwards played a match at Ballarat against 22, which was drawn, and easily defeated a 22 at Geelong in one innings They next went to Sydney, where they played a return match with 15 of New South Wales, and were again defeated, this time with ridiculous ease, being nearly beaten in one innings The Eaglishmen scored only 35 in their first innings (when they had not recovered from the effects of the voyage to Sydney), and in their second inningB put together 104 New South Wales made 124 m their first innings, and in their second obtained tbe 17 necessary to win with the loes of one wicket The re Bult of the match encouraged the Sydneyi.es to play the TngliBh team on equal teimB, and an eleven aside match waB commenced, but it soon became evident thut the colonials had overrated their ability to cope tuth the Lnghsbmen, who quickly ran up the fine total of 271, Uiyett getting 05 Pooley 37, and Selby 32 The Now South \\\ ales team made 82 in their Qist innings, and 140 for six wickets m their second when the game wau drawn The I leven left Syd ney for New ¿»aland on the 17th inst. They return to Melbourne in March, when they thty will play a combined eloven of this colony and New S uth Wales Owing to the presence of the All England Eleven, the matchcB at Melbourne for the possession of the principul challenge cap have excited com paratively very little interest The Rich mond Club at present hold the cup, bat judging from the state of the match which the possessors are playing with the M.l bourne Club, they will have all they can do to return the prize.

NEW SOUTH WALES. Considerable alarm is felt in Sydney owing to the importation of small pox into tho city The disease was brought to the colony by the steamer Brisbane, the captain of which is to be prosecuted for bringing bis ship up the harbour with the complaint on board When the existence of the disease on the steamer was discovered by the Government, several days after her arrival, the passengors weie hunted up through the city, and sent into quarantine, and with them all tbe lumpers who were engaged on the ship.

They met wits but little water and food. The blacks were veiy hostile, and attacked them several times. In one of the blacks' camps they found the remains of a white human-being, evidently partly eaten. Tbey eventually struck the coast, along which they discovered a nutnbar of wrecks.

' A new customs convention has been entered into between South Australia and New South Wales, in reference to the border duties. In lieu of the collection of these duties on the frontier, South Australia baa during the last three years paid a lump Bum to the New South WaleB Government. This Bum was originally fixed at £13 500 a year, but was afterwards reduced to £11,89718.. 8et., owing to a change in the Sydney tariff. Upon keeping a tally of the river trade at Wentworth' during' the last few months, the New South WaleB Government found that it represented duties to the value of about J.-i(',0(l0 a year. Therefore New South Wales OBked for a yearly contribution of £35,000, and the South Australian Government have assented to it for one year.

TASMANIA, A peculiar difficulty has occurred ia Tas. mania. LBst session the Government got an act passed consolidating the law relating to juries. It set aside the old jury lista, bat made no provision for new ones till the end of the present year. The effect was that there were no jury Hats from which juries could be empanelled. The objection was raised at the Launceston Criminal Sessions, and the Chief Justice deciding in favour of it, all the prisoners for trial had to ba ro< leased. The Government, in this state o! affairs, found it neceBSory to Bum moa a special seBBion of Parliament to correct the blunder. Parliament met on the 18th inst., and in the Legislative Council or. *he 20.h inst, Dr. Crowther stated that the Government weald not answer any questions, produce docu- mente, and transact any business other -than amending the Jury Act. Several members expressed surprise and indigna- tion, and to mark their disapprobation carried an adjournment until Monday, the 22nd inst. The question baa been raised as to whether the session ia legal, the Parlia- ment having been prorogued to a later date. The judges have declined to advise the Council whether the session ia legal, on the ground that the duty of the judgea ia limited to declaring on questions laid in cases before the Supreme Court, and it wouldbe improper to deliver an extra-judicial opinion. Parlia- ment alone could dispose of the question. The Colonial Treasurer on the 9th inst. opened the tenders received for the £25.000 worth of debentures which are to be issued at 5 per cent, and tbo result was au improve- ment on the last occasion. Upwards of £14,000 worth were disposed of at a fraction above par. The Governor of Tasmania, on tbe 10th inst., succeeded in landing the largest salmon yet caught in the ¡Bland. It weighed 8_lb.

The customs receipts for 1876 are £188,840, apahiBt £181,651 for 1875, or £1,131 in favour of the year just closed. The excess over the estimate ia £13,100, a rospe-ctablo figure considering the Brrmll totals. The im ports and exports also tell favourably. Two years ogo the mineral products were mi. During last year there were exported 9,U50oz. of gold, and a clashing at Nine-mile Springs recently yielded l.OOOoz. more. BeBidea the large quantifies of tin ore waiting the packers, there were exported 1,072 tons of tin, and 58G tons of tin ore, the gross value of the exports under the new mineral in- dustry approximating £120,000.

The mate, Mr, Whitton, furnished the following parti- culars :-The Airóla sailed from Liverpool two and a half years ago for a trading voyage in the South Pacific, under the command of Captain Scott, and waa captured by the Trench about 12 months ago, for trading among the islands of the lower Archi- pelago without protectoral flag. She was -3ent on to Sydney, and the captain im- prisoned at Tahiti, where be escaped, and rejoined his vessel at Melbourne. The Airóla started from Sydney on her last voyoge 3rd July, and went on to Sivage Island, where she traded two or three days On the 10th, while standing in close, the wind fell away light, and then came on from the sea, and drove the _ vessel on the reef on the west side of the islands, where i she became a total wreck. The crew and all cargo movable were saved without difficulty. The captain and two of the crew stayed on the scene of the wreck, and the rest came to .Samoa. The Airóla belonged to MeBsrs. J. Dewolfe and Co., of Liverpool. Sub inspector O'Donnell has reported to Mr. Price, warden of the district, reapecting ths Kumaru diggings. His report is favour- able as to the prospects of the miners, and he estimates a total population of 1500 on the diggings, of whom 3 000 are miners. The body of Captain Lindsay, of the barque William Ackers, which was recently wrecked \- off Dunedin, has been washed ashore near the wreck. At the official inquiry it was found that the loas of the vessel was occa- sioned through the captain keeping his vessel too close to the land ; and the loas of the captain and seven men was mainly, if not entirely, the result ot the deck cargo getting adrift and destroying the boats.

With reference to the present state of Affairs at Samoa, the following communica- tion from the Rev. S. J. Whitmee has been recently published : " I have just received letters from Samoa, from which I find the Steinberger game is about played out on those islands. In my letter which you kindly published laBt month I said there was fear of wat arising between the Government, which had been formed and sustained by Steinberger's influence, and the anti Steinberger party. This opposition party bad previously been afraid to act, because of the report that they would incur the vengeance of the U. S, Government But about Septem- ber or October last they determined to attempt to remodel the Government, do away with the , Hag and laws given them by Steinberger, and, in conjunction with the representatives of (Great Britain and Germany, and other foreign residents, establish a Government upon the 1 oasis of the old constitution which Stein- berger threw overboard. The then existing Government determined to resist this, and \- they went so far as to seize Boine of the pria «¡pal chiefs before the other party was . organised, and hold them prisoners. They also sent a force to put down a rising in one ; , part of the island of Upolu, which was for a j time successful But a more formidable rising agaiuBt the Government took place on , the island of Savaii ; and at the date of the 1 ¡previous letters the Government was trying lo put this down. There was a general Jerment all over the islands, and war was imminent. Just at that time (October) the \- (German vesBel-of-war Hertha arrived at the 3?ort of Apia. The captain of this vessel, ? . rand the German consul, Mr. Weber, seeing the Btate of matters, gave their influence on Hie Bide of the people, who were demanding > lb at the Government Bhould be remodelled, Ü hey forbade the existing Government to retort to force, demanded the liberation o the chiefs who were hold as prisoners, and the culling of a general representative meet ting of all Samoa to Bettie on some future form of government This bad the effect -of giving courage to the anti-Steinberger fiarty, and making the Government col apse. The Hertha and the German consul ?ii ere away at the Tongue Islands at the .date when my letter left (November li), lîut the Government had given in, and the ' (Opposition were preparing for a meeting to lemodel the Government and laws. The 1 Steinberger party declare their intention to «carry their Hag to some secure place, and 4 wait for help from America.' The new * '"U.S. consul, finding Steinberger not to be in . ? such good odour among the bulk of the ? -.people as he had been led to suppose, and , '¿ho Steinberger cause hopeless, has left \- -Samoa. I have copies in the Samoan dialect . - of the documents addressed by the German y «captain and consul to the Simoftu people, ' ¡but they are very long, and I have had time * runly to glance over them. I may send you a i letter anothor day on the action of the Ger j anana in Samoa and Tonga. Meanwhile, I à ímay say, as far as I can see, I think they are ñ ? acting in an honest manner. No doubt their if jprime object is to protect in the islands Ger. B ¡man interests, which are very great, espe B oially in Samoa. But, as far OB I at present | ¡understand their action, they are doing this g -un a manner which will be for the benefit of » 3he natives." II Recent advices from Tabite state that the g JTrench squadron in the Pacific, inoluding g the ironclad La Galissonnitre, carrying the S,S SftE of Vice-admiral Perigot, reached Papeete ñ mn the 6th of September last, and remained í 4here until the 12th of October, when the 1 « íálagebip left for the Mediterranean, via Hong Kong nnd tho Suez Canal. During tho stay J of the squadron at Tahite the capital was wery gay, and the Messager describes a bril- liant ball given to the officers by Qaeen ¿"omnre the Fourth, at which, we are told, ¡lhere was quite a competition between the ÏTahitian and European costumes of the Hadies as to which should boar away the ipalm for elegance.

Mr. Goldie, who has recently been explor. mg m New Guinea around Port Moresby, has returned to Sydney on account of ill health, bringing with him a large botanical and zoological collection of a very interesting character. Fifteen cases of living plants have been sent to England, while preserved specimens have been forwarded to Baron Mueller, of the Melbourne University, for description and comparison The zoological portion of the collection, consisting chiefly of buds, with a few quadrupeds are being iden- tified and described by Mr Ramsay, ourator of the Australian Museum Mr. Goldie started from Fort Moresby, but did not pane* trate farther inland than about 20 miles from the shore. He was enabled, however, to observe many interesting facts, aa well aa to Btudy the manners and cuBtoms of several tribes of natives, whose confidence he in every instance won by kindness. A splendid grazing country, with many grasses identical with those found in Australia, well watered with numerous small rivers, and dotted with stunted eucalyptus, waa found to be the general character of the coast district, beyond which a mountain range was eeen to nee far inland Here and there were seen villages, surrounded by extensive plains, on which the natives had large cocoanut and banana plantations in cultivation. Two vil- lages on the coast- Hula and Karapuna-had splendid harbours the latter capable of shel- tering the largest fleet in the world A small Bpeciesof kangarooaboundaonthe undulating plains, which the natives are fond of hunting m large parties, by driving them into an amphitheatre enclosed with neta, and setting fire to the grass and spearing the animals as they run out The nativea were found to be acquainted with the nature of firearms, which they regard aa useful only to kill birds They aro too much afraid to touch a gun, and tbey especially fear a revolver, which they look upon as a weapon only to kill men witb. They are by nature great beggars and arrant thieves, but any detected theft among themselves is punished with Beventy, while they regard thieving aa a virtue it done BO that it cannot be disco, verod. A dog which occompanted Mr. Goldie in his travels was the source of great terror to the natives, who were puzzled to understand ita nature, and whenever the explorer met suddenly a party of inland nativeB hunting kangaroo they instantly dad, more from fear of the dog than of himself. The natives met with were all physically powerful, and capable of carrying heavy burdens for fivo or six miles without a halt, at a speed which a European could scarcely keep np with by walking, but they would never pass the boundary line of their tern, tory, one tribe being fearful of the other. The flora became more and more denBO and splendid the more the traveller penetrated inland, while the species became more nume- rous , but the fauna did not present a corresponding variety, except in the class of birds. Snakes are few The peculiar pig of Now Guinea abounded here and there, butte: iliea of gorgeous hues flitted in the heated air, while a little way inland the traveller met with an insufferable torment in the shape of a minute reddish inaect which covered the body from head to foot with pimples, causing the greatest irritation It was found extremely unhealthy on the coaet, and the mission station at Fort MoreBby has been entirely abandoned by Luropeans; a few Rorotonga native teachers remain, but great sickness abounds even amongst them. It waa observed aa remarkable that the sea breeze waa invari- ably unhealthy, while the wind from the interior waB salubrious Mr. Goldie was accompanied by a native of the New He- brides, and o European who joined him at Somerset, and he ia opposed to exploring in large parties, as that arouses the suspicion of the nativeB The obstacles throughout are the hostility of the natives and the deadli ness of the climate. The former may be removed by the employment of tact and kindness, the latter will ever prove a barrier until the traveller ranches the elevated land of the interior. NOTLS TROM THE SEA. The barque William Ackers, a vessel of 290 tonB, bound from Invercargill to Lyttel* ton, was wrecked on Waipapapa Point, a dangerous headland between Dunedin and the Bluff, early on the morning ol December 12\. She had a cargo of 185,000ft. sawn timber. After leaving the Bluff, the vessel met with a head wind, against which she was beating when she was felt to touch the reef at Waipapapa. In trying to bring round she miBBed stays and drifted right on, the sea breaking 10ft. over her. The lifeboat was launched, but no sooner was she in the water than a sea struck her, causing her to roll so much that she became completely crushed. The barque was heavily laden, and the deck load came adrift and caused much confusion and injury to life and limb Several of th9 men, Boeing the planks adrift and floating, got astride of them and drifted away to penah The last seen of the captain was about this time. He is believed to have had an arm broken Those saved are Cankey, the first mate , IUdly, an A B. Beaman, and Captain Josa, a passenger, whose family reside at the Bluff. They had to Bwim ashore, the barque having drifted within 200 yards of the land. They were in a very exhausted state. A large dog also managed to reach the shore in safety. It is believed that eight persona lost their lives. The barque began to break np rapidly, doubt* less owing to tho rocky bottom she was labouring on. The heavy Boas have since completely rended her, even her spars and yards being broken in pieces and scarcely a piece of canvas to be seen. At the official inquiry it was found that the loss of the vessel was occasioned through the captain keeping his vessel too close to the land, and the loss of the captain and seven men was mainly, if not entirely, the result of the deck cargo getting adrift and destroying the b ata In iast month's Summary an account was given of the loss of the West Australian Go- vernment B a Georgette, but at the time the mail left there was still one boat missing with several persons on board.

Since our loBt monthly communication waa despatched, the New Year, with its holidays, festivities, and pleasuring, has been usherod in, affecting and disturbing the ordinary routine of buaineBB to an extent acarcely known in colder climates. T hat the month of January was therefore well advanced before trade waa allowed once moro to settle down in its a-ual groove need not be looked upon as a circum- stance of Buch rore occurrence aa to oréate any surprise. When the year cloaed, however, speculation was so active in one or two of the leading staples, the wonder ia that business waa permitted to remain quiet even for a single day, for although there is lees excitement to be observed this month m regard to sugar, the ni tide has monopolised the attention of the trade to aa great an extent aa ever, and to all appearance now this feeling ia likely to in- crease rather than fall off. As we are writing Mauritius telegramB to the 4th or 5th of January are now due.and these are anxiously looked forward to, aa it ia calculated that in- formation will then be received of the effect produced on the market there by tho later London advices, of which they must be in possession, reporting a furtbor ad- vance in 1 urope of £5 per ton at least, and at so critical a period, when BO much IB involved, all interested in the market are naturally anxious to obtain such intelligence as will guide them in their future movements Telegrams to 5th January have just been received, reporting an advance in Mauritius of £4 per ton, but although all holders here look for higher rates in conse- quence, the actual effecton the market has not yet been developed Speculation has also been initiated in cornsacks m consequence of tho sudden and unexpected advance ad- vised from Calcutta in these goods, now be come the chief Bource of supply We Bay the information waa unexpected, because mail advices, scarcely three weeks old when received, led us to believe that the price might recede in the course of the month a couple of rupees, instead of rising seven or eight rupees, as has occurred, but the explanation of what appears to many a puzzle has yet to come. The nae there, however, baa not yet affected values here to any great extent, the pre* Bent quotation here is 8a. Gd., while at the rate advised in Calcutta they will stand 10a Gd. coat and freight, or nearly Ils to lia Gd. in store. The circumstance will not. however, be altogether a matter of regret if by that means shipments be kept back so that the market, which has been a very do pressed one, may be allowed to recover, and really it ia scarcely credible to suppose that shippers will think of sending any further supplies of an article costing Ile to Ila, Gd to a market at which 8a Gd is the highest quotation. A move- ment in woolpacks has followed the other, and as the value here at present ia not more than 2s 8d, to 2s Od, while the coat laid down by latest telegrams cannot be Ieaa than 3B 4d., it will be coen how neceaaary it ia to keep back for a long time to come shipments of theBO also Kerosene oil thiB month has been completely neglected A speculative movement in brandy has led to considerable transactions, but baa failed as yet to bring the price np to what this Bpint will now coat laid down here , that, however, has been for somo time paat no unusual circumstance, the nee on fine brands established this month 3d, will cover, or 4d. at the very outside, but second brands have gone higher in propor- tion. Trade otherwise has been quiet and unmarked by anything of the alightest in- terest. One of the satisfactory features ia the almost complete immunity from failures with which the month has been characterised. Country business is on the whole satisfac- tory, bills are well met, and the demands for assistance comparatively unimportant, and, with the etception of meetings held in one or two eatatea which have been long known to be m the hands of tbe creditors, not a single fresh failure of tbe slightest consequence can be referred to. Money ia still without alteration, and at a time when the rate in England has for many months been at a minimum point, the rate here is maintained aa hi_h aa at the very dearest time. The money market is entirely ruled by the banks, and hitherto we have been strongly of the opinion that the public were beat served when these inotitutea agreed to a uniform charge rather than that the rates of interest and discount should be left an open question, Batiafied that our banking institutes would see that, in serving the public, their own interests were best served. We confess however, to a considerable amount of disappointment at now finding that, though for many months past no neceBBity whatever has existed for the extreme rates charged, no sign has yet been evinced of any deBire to grant a con- cession on the rates ruling, but that, on the contrary, m the face of remonstrances, and the fact that the bankB, OB a rule, were never m a better position to grant the desired concession, they still porsist ia keep- ing up the high rates complained of. The wool Bales bave progressed satisfac torily. In the course of the month Messrs Goldsbrough and Co have Bold 10 500 bales, Messrs Hastings Cuningham and Co 5 463 bales, Mesera J. H. Clough and Co 3 250 balee, Mr. M Synnot700 balea, equal to 19 D18 bales in all while 1,925 bales were disposed of at the Geelong Bales. The summary of wool sales published in Goldabrough'a monthly circular shows that 80,884 bales bave been disposed of in Melbourne during the present Benson to date, of which MeBara R Goldsbrough and Co have sold 40 027 bales Messrs Hastings Cuningham and Co 21,101 bales, MeBsrs J. H Clough and Co 9,804 bales, Mr. Monckton Synnot 3,732 baleB, and Mr. D. Melville 220 bales. In addition to these Balea, 18 338 balea have been realised in Geeloug, thus making a total of 99,222 bales disposed of, the total offered being 120,290 bales The season ia now almost over, and after the close of this month the quantities to be offered will be comparatively unimportant. The f armera have had splendid weather for the harvest, much too fine, however, for the colony, which wanta rain, The yield of wheat per acre has not yet been ascertained, though it is feared it will boa good deal less than was calculated on The yield m South Australia IB estimated not to be more than six bushels per acre The telegraphic cable ia, on the whole, now working satisfactorily. The follow- ing statement of the buBiness done for the paat year, -when the interruption to the cable occurred, as compared with that of the pre- vious year, is given by the South Australian Be pister -The gross number of cable messages forwarded by all the colonies last year " waa 2,983, and 3,386 were received, the total number transmitted being, owing to inter- ruptions to the communication, 3,340 less than in 1875. The value of the received traffic is put down at £30 978 ia. 6d, and of that forwarded £38,417 10a lOd The South Australian proportion of the international buBiness amounted to £8 829 12s 44. It should be mentioned that the Penang and Madras cable was interrupted from March 28 to November 30, and that the Port Darwin and Banjoowangie cable was silent from April 24 to August 6 The result waa, of course, a Berioua interference with the inter- national business, besides the reduction of the receipts on the T ranscontmental line. The falling off in the South Australian revenue from tina source oa compared with last year IB about £3 000 The intercolonial conference on the subject of duplicate cable communication will meet in Sydney on ThurBday, the 25th. Transactions in the markets generally have not been of much account and with the ex- ceptions already referred to have been really unimportant, Bulk ales, notwithstanding the arrival of the NemeBis and other ship- ments of new season's, have not been much noticed, and much disappointment has been created by the heavy shipments advised, which have had the effect of cauBing a decline in pneo, and it is feared that still lower rates will yet have to be faced. Last year ship- ments were light, and a Blight profit was realised. That circumstance has apparently tempted importers to go this yoar to the oppoBito extreme, and the rosult will, in all probability, prove as unsatis- factory as tlie other was the reverse. In bagging, speculative purchases to the ex. tent of 1,200 bales of cornsacks and about 700 bales of woolpacks have been recorded. Operations in candles have been confined to purchases by the trade. Breadstuffs have advanced m price Supplies of new wheat and Hour have como forward very sparingly, and tho price baa naen in consequence la. per bushel on the former and 40s per ton on the latter. In feeding grams, oats have re- mained steady, but maize has" improved, lilabtmg ponder has bad speculative at- tention, and the price has advanced nea ly 70 per cnt Transactions in malt have been of more consequence. Kero- sene Oil has been neglected Rice, dreesod qualities have risen considerably. In sugar a vet y extensive business has boen done. Of refined qualities the company's siles ag- gregate 2,000 tons, while the Bales of other sorts consist of the cargo of the John Watson and large parcels of various other de-scrip tions. The arrivals of grocery qualities com prise the John V\ atson, Lucy S Wills (partly refining), the Greyhound, Bothwell Castle, and Oleander, all advised as on the way from Mauritius, BuumeeB m teas has not been extensive. Tobaccos have not been marked by any special demand. Timber has bad fair attention In one day 2 000,000ft. Baltic flooring were quitted at an advance. In brandies re- ported transactions comprise 700 hhd , be- sides ordinary routine sales, The arrival of the mail steamer Bangalore at Adelaide was telegraphed on Thursday, the 4th inst, and on bundey, tbe 7th, she arrived in Hobson's Bay. On the 1th of January the Normanby arnvod at Sydney with the TorroB Straits mails, and on the same day the Australia, with the Californian and American mails, also reached Sydney.

The auction Bales havo been held regularly throughout tbg mouth, and about 21,683 bales have boen sold, tbuB making a total of 011,222 bales disposed of since the opening ol the season in Octobor. Considorablo quaniilltB aro still coming forward, and regular sales will probably be hold tor tour or flvo weeks longer, though of courto Ihe catalogues will ba muoh r.« duced. Unwashed wool tully maintains Its value, and com- petition for this description has been well sustained, both for shipment and scouring. Washed flooco, In good to ruperlor condition, has also remalnod firm ; but interior to average Borts must bo quotod a shade lower. Scoured continues to rulo at ao-out last month's rates. As Ia usual towards tho CIOBO of tho season, a largo proportion of tho lota offored are in Inferior to ordinary condition, and hence the gonerally lower rango of prices. Tbo UBual quantity avallablo tor Bale In Melbourne has been supplemented to a considerable oxtent by consignments from tho other colonies, tbo groat in- ducements offered hore for disposal having attracted the attention of growers and shippers In New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. Shipments from New Zealand also are beginning to arrive; and it Ia evident that this market Is now fully recognleed as being tho first in the colonies for tbe eale of wool, Operations for America have continued during tho month, but on a moro reBtrictod sculo, owing to tho reduced quantity of Bultablo wool in too market, nearly all tho bist clips having boou disposed ot either by Balu or ebipniout befo.o tbo end of D.combar.

Tho suminor Is now howover far advanced, and a favourable chango to cooler weather may Boon bo expected. Buyers are looking forward to tho Fobruary London sales, and It Is to bo hoped that November rates will be maintained. Tho contlnuod difficulties botwoou Bunala and Turkey, advised by telegram, may havo a disturbing effect, but at this dislanco from the scono c1 operations we cannot as yet conjecture their in Cueuce on the wool market The Indications generally point to firm prices, as manufacturers aro evidently run bare of stocks, and must purchase freely to moot their requirements.

Thoro has been vory littlo business t-ansaetod In this market sinco our lost report, noaily bolt tho timo boviog been given up to the Christmas and Now Year's holidays, and nothing having occurred since to cause any general activity. The mining market as a wholo continues in the samo depressed state pre- viously notod, and most ol tho Sandhurst companies, oa will bo seen by referonco to tbo quotations below, bavo suffered a further considerable fall in market price. Thero has, however, been rather moro Inquiry for aomo of tho companies in othor dlstricta, Walhalla, Ballarat, Egerton, and Clunoa having each some fow companies which havo hoon in roquest, and tho quotations for which show a Blight improvoniout in value«. Among the principal changes in quota- tions for mining stockB wo note a heavy fail in Gardon Gully United, and most of the companies on the samo line of reef, owing to failing off in yiolda and disap- pointment in tho dolay in gottlng tbo second foraiation of pa] ablo Btono. Tho roducllon In nominal prico of BharcB in theso companies is vory groat, and ovon at tho reduced ratos salea aro difficult to effoct ; nor can any pormsneut improvement bo anticipated till good Btono bo struck in aomo of the deep claims on tho lino Walhalla companies have bad continued doman-, but busineea boa boon limited by tho unwlllinitnoaa of boldora to part with Hharoa. Long Tunuol Extendod bavobcon lnapeclal favour,and risen considerably. City ol Ballarat havo also had good support, and clu.aat blghor prices. This mino ia atill in tbo progressive atago ; ita BUCCCBS Ia anxloualy looked for, and would do much to encourage ronowod alluvial mining in tbo north-west of Ballarat During tho lost fow da>a Egerton and Now Black Horse Companioa havo boon In request at advanced rates. It ia understood that the long-ponding litigation between the prosent and former ownora of tlio Egerton Company'a mino Is now finally settled, tho ault boing withdrawn, and each party paying their own cost«. New North Clunes bavo bad lncroascd demand, and rcaiiaed higher pilcos Stawell companioa very littlo dealt lu Tho North Cross mino Is reported to bo looking woll, and Bhoros in request ; but Magdala, PAtrlck, aud Nowington havo bceu depreeaod, no auccoaa having } et attended tho operatloiiB of iluso fompanios. It Ia unsatisfactory to have to noto that tlio total yloltl of gold and tho amount of dividends continue to show a falling off. The market for investment stocks has not been vory active, but pricos have in most cogoa been well maintained, and for Bet oral stocks tbo ten- dency hoB been upwaida.
