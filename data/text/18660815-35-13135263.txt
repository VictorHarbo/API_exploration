One signing) officering Paralo. WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 15, 1866. IN the Legislative Assembly, x yesterday, Mr MACIHMISON postponed for a fortnight, the motion of which he had seen notice relative to the resumption of State Aid to Religion Petitions were presented by Mr. Cowl PU, from the Bishop of Sydney, praying for leave to bring in a bill to empower the members of the United Church of England and Ireland to meet in Synod, by Dr LANG, from Mrs Eliza I Lockyer, praying relief in consideration of the public services of her deceased husband In reply to Mr 1 GAN, Mr Proud said that the subject of the present condition of a portion of the * Circular Quay xx is now under the consideration of the G ox eminent, with a view to the placing of a sum of money on the Estimates for the effecting the required repairs The following formal motion was agreed to by Mr AiiJeAMUxÂ», for the painting of the petition presented by him on the 31st July, from the inhabitants of Goulburn, on behalf of the widow and children of Mr li li M Cann Mr Cow run mox ed for the correspondence in relation to the appointment of Mr 1 Thomas Betteridge, as police magistrate at Walgett, which appointment he censured on the ground that this gentleman was unknown as to his qualifications for the office, and that preference ought to have been given to some of those well qualified gentlemen who had been deprived of their offices of gold commissioners, in consequence of the recent change in the management of the Gold Fields Mr MARTIN said, that Mr Iscltcridgc had been recommended by the Colonial Secretary for the office in question as a gentleman for some time in the Commission of the Peace in which he had been placed by Mr Cowper's Government, and as well qualified for the discharge of magisterial duties The appointment Had, given great satisfaction in the district "With reference to the displaced Gold Commissioners, it had been intimated to those gentlemen that they would be considered as having preferential claims for future employment in the public service After a few remarks from Mr Lunn, The motion was agreed to Mr Cox w Kit mox ed for the correspondence respect- ing the heavy guns ordered from England, in compliance with the vote of the House on the 15th June, 1866, adopting The report of the select committee on defences Mr MARTIN said that the correspondence on this subject had been laid before the House on the 26th March last, but that, if there was any further correspondence, it should be produced The motion was agreed to Dr LAND, in moving the second reading of the Chinese Immigration Repeal Bill, reviewed at some length the circumstances of the colony since the passing, in 1861, of the Act which he sought to repeal, showing the altered state of public opinion upon the subject and the groundlessness of the apprehensions then entertained as to the influx of a considerable Mongolian population He admitted that he had supported the bill of 1861, but he confessed that his view is, founded upon subsequent experience and observation of the character of the Chinese had entirely changed, and that he was desirous to undo what he felt to be a very false policy in the leg station of this colony Mr LUCAS opposed the bill, and defended the Act which it was sought to repeal, contending that it had worked well, and urging the danger under on unresUictetl system of an unduly large proportion of Chinese, and the impossibility for a Chinese and European population ever to harmonise in the same country Mr ronsTiii supported the bill, as purging the statute book of a law which was a disgrace to our legislation, and whirlwinds moreover ineffectual to prevent the immigration which it was desired to restrain Mr DE SALIS supported the bill, as removing an absurd restriction upon the immigration of a large and useful class of labourers and consumers Mr CUMMINGS opposed the bill, speaking in strong terms of disparagement of the character of the Chinese population Mr MACIHEUSON supported the bill admitting the Chinese to be a useful and industrious class of people xx horn it should be the policy of the colony not to discourage Mr GARRETT opposed the bill as undoing a well considered measure of legislation, and condemned the see Baw policy evinced in the present measure Mr Josi i II cordially supported the bill as a return to an enlightened policy, ridiculing the apprehended danger of a disproportionate Chinese population, and condemning the narrow and party spirit in which the former Act had been passed Mr DONN EI LI opposed the bill upon social considerations, founded upon the immoral character of the Chinese as a people Mr TOULONOP gave credit to the promoter of the bill for his moral courage and fortitude in avowing his change of opinions, formed during a period of political excitement, upon this question It was not a question as to encouragement of Chinese immigra- tion, but one of imposing restrictions upon the mind ' gration of any foreigners The experience of the interior of the colony showed that it was the proper policy of this colony to encourage rather than discourage Asiatic labour he cordially supported the bill. Mr. PARKES recalled the attention of the House to the fact that the law which it was now sought to re- peal arose from a generally admitted necessity existing in the minds of some of the most intelligent persons in the community Admitting the sober and industrious character of the Chinese, he could not in a community striving to rise in the social scale admit the desirableness of introducing into it a merely ser tile class, and that too in a community the principle of whose institutions was equality of political rights The Chinese as mi alien race could contribute nothing to our elevation into a nation They formed no associations in the country, and the probable tendency of the encouragement of their immigration would be to establish a permanent burden upon the charity of the community the nature of the immigration, in one sex only, made it a barrier against civilization which ought Btexdfnstlj to be resisted The bill which it was sought to repeal had received the general approval of the constituencies, it had xx worked beneficially, and we should leave well alone Mr CALDXMLI cautioned the House not to be led away by the eloquence of the previous speaker, which failed to touch the only point involved in the bill before the house, which was the policy of restricting the immigration of Chinese While he did not wholly approve of Chinese immigration, he would not seek to place restrictions upon it, but should rather strive to place it under proper regulations He trusted that the House would take a less narrow view of this question than had heretofore been taken, and would pass this bill Mr DIGNAM did not approve of the Chinese as a class of residents, and should oppose the bill. Mr. R.AN supported the bill, and acknowledged his conviction of his error in the course which he took upon the former occasion when this subject was under discussion The second reading was negatived by 18 to 16, and the bill so as therefore lost The House adjourned at ten minutes to 9 So the die is cast, and the fate of Europe is submitted to the arbitration of the sword The words of our telegram are few, but their import is tern Die Thousands of men, mostly in the morning of life, are said to have fallen on one side and on one field the imagination revolts from the dreadful scenes of carnage, agony, and ghastly desolation Most of those fallen soldiers were the reluctant instruments of ambition, and the blood they have shed has been given to a cause they did not understand, and perhaps would have disowned When we search for the origin of that hatred which modern dear potism sometimes, encounters, we can find almost its justification, certainly its cause, in the demands constantly made of this tribute of blood in a few hours a reckless Soxcietgn can cause the death of a hundred thousand men, and fill his country with mourners, whose voice is only indeed heard amidst the cries of triumph, and only regarded by that Ear which always listens The news we have received could not excite much astonishment, Although no expectation. was expressed, every one entertained a lingering hope that there might be some means at the last moment found to avert the scourge from the nations of Europe Yet the prog pest was dark and still darker to the last hour We were, therefore, prepared to find that the roar of artillery had overwhelmed the voice of reason and shut out diplomacy from the adjustment of these quarrel of which we have seen the beginning, but of which who shall see the end ? It seems that the deadly strife was attended with great vicissitudes, that now Austria, and now Prussia, now Italy, and now Austria, had each victory on its side 'The final report leaves no doubt that Austria is so far beaten That Empire, however, has always had the character of (tenacity, steadiness to a purpose when once formed, and if it recedes from Kal) and lose the last traces of its power, it will only be by reluctant steps The appearance of the Emperor of FRANCE on the theatre of war is, perhaps, more earl) than might have been anticipated if we may give credit to his having received Venice as a deposit What will be the upshot of this acquisition of course no one can tell It will depend upon the events of the war It may be a security against the destruction of Italy should reverses befall her armies It may be a check- mate to her ambition should she be crowned with success It may be as a pawn for the exchange to France of that coveted line which divides her from the Hinno These are all conjectures, which time alone can appreciate One thing is certain, that France having appeared upon the stage, she will not return until the map of Europe is reconstructed, and until the treaties of Vienna are effaced To understand the position of the parties it is necessary to turn to their geographical position Berlin, the centre of the Prussian Empire, has on one side Hanover, Hamburgh, and the Danish Provinces, and on the other Saxon and the adjacent Principalities In the centre she proposes to establish an undisputed and sole authority), and whatever may be the draper) of (he monarch) constructed, or however the royalties within the circle of its sway shall maintain (their style and tide, undoubtedly their existence as independent States is seriously compromised The great interest with us, after the sympathy paid to the common sufferings of Europe, is to know what will be the position of England in reference to the Continental war in the last accounts (he tone of the Press was all for peace It was asserted by most journals that England had no direct interest in the conflict which had not been swamped and destroyed by previous events, and that, having tolerated the virtual supercession of the treaty of Vienna, it would be a useless task to seek to gather up its fragments and restore its form. It must, however, be a shame to the old English party to see their country. lose weight in this great strife and utter no voice in behalf of the right or in opposition to the wrong In fact, the difficulties of Continental affairs are such as to leave no very clear choice to a British statesman Does he intend to resist the enterprises of NAPOLEON by war? He has been already told that it is useless to attack them by the pen "Speak with your pistol cocked or sa) nothing" Such has been the language on more than one occasion, and it perhaps defines as simply as possible what are the true circumstances of the nation Then how can she take part against Austria in favour of Prussia when Austin i, although deeply responsible, has shewn more national honour and a less exorbitant ambition Had Austria stood firm to the Treaty of 1852 Prussia might have been defeated b) diplomacy, but on this point she wavered and finally surrendered to the views of her more artful neighbour, and so came to that moment when, having seized the pine in common, they had to fight for its exclusive possession On the other hand, England is not uninterested in the existence of German strength If France shall become stronger by cessions to the Rhine, it is desirable that a powerful neigh- bour should be at her doors and counteract her aggression. The sympathies of England Mc gone largely with Italy, at least so far as popular feeling affects the direction of politics But France has always held views respecting Italy so- far out able to the development of strong national life Sooner or later jealousy of that strength will cause complications with the Italian kingdom. Already the rumour reaches us that Italy is wrath that France has interposed But France will not permit Uah to possess Venice unless France is satisfied that she will lose nothing in the balance of power, and so the plot thickens, new interests appeal, new actors come upon the stage, and new issues will have to be determined 'His circle of war naturally enlarges itself, and the starting point is soon forgotten in the novel events which change the -views and inflame the ambition of men England will, however, turn her attention to her naval strength, and so be prepared for the only part she is qualified to perform in the great drama, the first acts of which have opened with such awful incidents Hi who weighs all events and holds all forces in his hand, can alone foresee upon what catastrophe the curtain will fall.
