COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Friday Evening. Export entries were passed to-day at the Customs, on 10,50. ounces of sold for shipment, of which 10,438 ounces were for England, by the Columbian and 66 ounces for Hong Kong by the Anna Lange. The escorts which attired this afternoon from the gold-fields brought down the following quantities- Those- which are despatched fortnightly are distinguished by an asterisk prefixed to the names of the goldfields : Name of Gold.

Considerable anxiety has been expressed with reference to the time of the departure of the steamer, The Columbian has not yet arrived on the way down, and, therefore according to the terms of the contract, it is impossible to determine at what time the 48 hours detention will terminate. The Postmaster General has issued a notice that the mails will close on Saturday afternoon, but we think very grave reasons exist against any departure from the contract. The Victorian authorities do not act for themselves alone, but as trustees for the other colonies, and they must consider well before they permit the establishment of a precedent detrimental to their interests. The following account of what are stated to be positive arrangements is given in the leading columns of the Sydney Morning Herald: "Captain Keatley, the mail agent of the Simla, finding on arrival at Melbourne that there was no chance of reaching Sydney by the contract date, very considerately waited on the Governor and Colonial Secretary of Victoria, to request their concurrence in the detention of the Columbian-a request that was granted with a ready courtesy that demands acknowledgment. This arrangement being notified on arrival to Captain Stevens, the mail agent on board the Columbian, the orders for the detention of that steamer were promptly issued, and the mail bags which had been put on board have been can led back to the Post Office. The Columbian will therefore remain in Port Jackson for the forty eight hours which, by the contract time, she should spend in Hobson s Bay, and our Melbourne friends will not detain her longer than is absolutely necessary to put their mails, passengers, and species onboard. The mail agents have the power, according to the contract, to determine the times of departure, and in the present instance Captain Stevens has peremptorily exerted that power, much to the convenience of the citizens of Sydney." This statement is not only not borne out by facts, but is in port directly opposed to them. In the first place, Captain Keatley has nothing whatever to do with the Columbian's mails : his duties commenced and terminated in his relations to the mails carried by the Simla. No such arrangement as that spoken of was made with the Chief Secretary of . victoria ; but on the contrary, Mr. Wotton stated it to be his intention to despatch the Columbian as early as possible after his arrival at Sydney and to forward a supplemental mail by a steamer of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company. The plain course for the Government to adopt is to abide by the contract, and thus to avoid all responsibility. A new era has dawned on the Company and hereafter it may be discovered that the interests of Australia and of the Postal Service are identical. Hitherto much consideration has been shown on one side, and none on the other. The up-country trade has been brisk to-day, indeed this branch of trade generally would be improving but for the fact that wholesale dealers limit their purchases for the present to parcels in quantity scarcely more than retail, and thus produce little or no effect upon accumulating stocks. In preparing our usual summary for transmission to England we have little to say that is encouraging in a commercial point of view. The Gold Market shares in the general dullness and, although prices remain unchanged, , they are entirely nominal-at £3 14s. 6d. to £3 15s. for Castlemaine and Sandhurst ; £3 16s. for Mount Korong; £3 15s. 6d. for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Creek, and Avoca ; £3 153. to £3 15s. 9d. for Ararat and Pleasant Creek; £3 16s. to £3 17s. 3d. for the i Ovens and £8 17s. 6d. for Ballaarat. The first escort for the year was a very low one. The quantities from all the gold fields were greatly below the respective weekly and fortnightly averages, in many instances not amounting to more than one-half. This extraordinary falling-off in the returns is undoubtedly owing in a great measure, to the recent reductions made by the gold-buyers in their buying prices. Subjoined is the list, the fortnightly escorts being distinguished by an asterisk prefixed to the name of the gold- field : ozs. dates. - Castlemaine. 3-12 0 Sandhurst. 5,397 0 Beechworth. 7,000 10 Heathcote. 849 10 Ballaarat 19,28 10 "Maldon . 854 10 "Creswick's Creek. 2,263 10 Rushworth. 520 10 Dunolly . 3,442 0 Buckland River. 1,238 10 Maryborough . 1,323 10 Yackandandah . 1,390 0 Total 38,00 0 The shipments amounted to 14,052 ounces only, the whole being for Sydney.

The Money Market opened for the year a quietly as could well be imagined. Dunn; the last two weeks in December there had been some pressure, but the 4th instant having passed off well, and without any other stoppage than that previously made known, of Mr. Nicholas Riordan, a very perceptible had ensued. The arrival of the mail with the startling intelligence of the compelled suspension of the Bank of England Charter Act, am the existence of a monetary crisis, more rapid in its growth and more widely spread that any, perhaps, since 1895, has produced a great sensation in this market. The fact that stocks of imported goods are greatly in excess of our wants, and that many firms have become hampered by the impossibility of real! Bing, is admitted on all hands and for some time past the banks have been checking transactions, by the determination they had, shown to diminish the quantity of commercial paper held by them. The effect of this is the speculation is prevented, and the market preserved in a more healthy condition than during any former period of glut and low prices There is no scarcity of spare capital, as the land sales of the past month amply; testify, but for commercial purposes that is none available outside the banks. The last movement in the monetary world came into operation at the commencement of the new year. The whole of the banks now gran interest on deposits ; those which have recently come into the movement, at the following rates On the monthly minimum balance of current accounts, if not less than £200, 2 per cent, per annum on sums deposited subject to three months' notice of withdrawal, 3 per cent, per annum on sums deposited subject to six months' notice, 4 per cent, per annum and on sums deposited subject to twelve months' notice, 5 per cent, per annum. Exchange on England is, at all the bank at par for 60 days' sight for amounts under 50., at a per cent, premium for 30 days' sight Freights on gold, by direct steamers or sailing vessels, 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London insurance, 11 per cent. by the Overland route, | per cent. that is, 7d. per ounce t nearly as possible; insurance, li to 12 l cent. A very general and painful sensation WE produced on Friday, the 8th inst., when the second editions of the Melbourne journals made known to the public to suspension of the extensive and olde tablished house of Dennistoun, of Glasgow The firm of Messrs. Dennistoun Brother and Co., of Melbourne, although a distinct house from the Glasgow establishment, an /he branches in London, Liverpool, New York, and New Orleans, was thought J first to be involved, and the resident partner awaited the delivery of their advices before determining what course to adopt. On the morning following the delivery of the in ii they declared their ability to meet all demand on them, and their firm belief, gathered from a perusal of their home advices, that the position of the Melbourne house would not 1 compromised. The commercial history of 1857 has been in many respects, precisely what might have been expected. The year was ushered i amidst some expressions of apprehension c to the probable result of the continued in pouring of British goods to a market already fully stocked, Trade was sound, and coin ('once, which had been shaken by the diva ters of previous years, was becoming re-open Wished, but the horizon was declared to I " not altogether clear." The number ships arriving with heavy cargoes was the small cloud whose appearance gave rise to the forebodings that were uttered at the same time the colonies were rejoicing in the eat blishment of a steam postal service with the home country-a service whose certain regularity, and saving of time would cm "Uli evils, by bringing the producing and in consuming markets nearer to each other, 1 one month at least, unfortunately, the a prehensions excited have been fulfilled, when the promised good has proved an evil rather than otherwise. Ship after ship has passed 1 cargo into the Melbourne warehouses, uat stocks have been trebled, and the floors at cellars made to groan under somewhat tween one year's and eighteen months' to sumption. Mail after mail has been c tained, vessels have been disabled, and t whole service has been plunged into such confusion and uncertainty. While public a private advices alike gave warning to her shippers of what must happen, the uncertain attending their delivery, robbed them of the proper effect. Goods were poured in fact than over, and the last English mail received gave no hope of any abatement for the present. Had it not been for the extraordinary pi productiveness of our own resources, a term lesson would have been taught to those w compete for the supply of our wants. But of exports have been maintained up to a to! above the average of the last three year Up to the evening of the 19th December, the had reached the declared value of £14,023,5! against £14,487,841 for the previous ye while the imports had increased from the c clared value of £13,177,484, in 1856, £14,826,805 during the same period. It is calculated at first to excite wonder in the breasts of the colonists that she ments should be sustained in the face the repeated warnings that have been SJ from this side. The first note was sound at the commencement of the past year. Since then every succeeding mail has conveyed the intelligence that the commercial public were looking for something amounting to a positive cessation of shipments, and have so expressed themselves in the advices sent home. The September mail hence took horns one of the strongest remonstrances of the year, and yet we find it announced in The Times that the commercial advices from Australia were considered good, and the same sentiment repeated, more directly and with more circumstantial try, in the Home News. As it is known that both by this and the preceding mail, many account sales were rendered showing a considerable deficit on cost and charges, it is wonderful how reports so utterly in opposition to facts should get abroad. It is time, however, that shippers should know that we have now in stock enough British goods to supply the consumption of the next 15 months; and that if the rate of shipments in September, October, and November has since been maintained, we shall speedily have another three months took added to that already in our warehouses, The recoil of such a state of things cannot but be disastrous to shippers, if the only remedy be not at once adopted generally, namely-a reduction, or something amount- ing to a cessation, of shipments. The colony is rich, and able to pay the fair value of its imports; but if they are forced into our ports, in quantities altogether out of proportion to our population, somewhere about half the cost will be the local value of British goods. The commercial history of the year 1857 will be conveyed more clearly to the eye of the distant reader by the statistical tables given in other columns, and which are prepared from the data supplied by the Customs returns. The revenue returns for the year and quarter ended the 31st December, 1867, show a comparison not unfavorable to the year that has just ended. The revenues have been maintained, while the disbursements have decreased. We give below a detailed state ment showing the revenues for the two years side by side.

There is an increase on the Special Funds of £45,050, and on the Special Accounts of £218,012. Under the following heads of General Revenue there is an increase, to the amounts annexed. Port and Harbor Dues, £5,045 ; Postage, £12.052 ; Fees of Court, £8,109 Land Revenue, £257,916; Miscellaneous, £3,590. There is a net decrease on the Customs to the amount of £03,137; on the Gold-Fields Revenue, £12,295 on Licences, £9 1,876; and on Fines and For- feitures, £2,683. In the Customs Revenue, there is an increase on beer of £21,332 and on I sugar of £12,358 ; while there is a decrease in spirits of £5,675 in wine of £9.558 in tobacco of £22,870 in tea of £27,290; and in the gold export duty of £86,229. In other items the increase or decrease is trifling. The decrease in the Gold-Fields Revenue is trace- able almost exclusively to the falling-offinthe business licences. The miners' rights, which should show an increase in proportion to the in creaseofthepopulation,showadecreaseof£131. The decrease in the revenues derived from licences is made up of the following items : Publicans', a83, 759 ; spirit merchants', £9,372; bonded warehouses, £4,660. Comparing the quarter with the last quarter of 1866 we find a net increase in the general revenue of £190,355. This increase, like that on the year, is chiefly derived from the sale of Crown lands; while there is a decrease in the Customs of £66,442; in the Gold-Fields Revenue of £2,608; on Licences, of £2,187 and on the Miscellaneous Items of £6,758. in the Special Funds there is a net decrease of £36,020, arising from the fact that no payments on account of the Toll Fund became due during the period and a net increase on the Special Accounts of £26,684. We append a table which gives an account of the progress of the colony for the last eight years.

Two sales have been held since the Simla's arrival, the reports of which will be found among the market reports in another column, " Referring to our previous remarks, we subjoin tables showing the imports and exports for the year 1857 compared with those of 1856, and for the month of December of both those years, also the usual tables referring to bonded goods, and to deliveries of dutiable goods for consumption : IMPORTS AND EXPORTS AT THE PORT OF | MELBOURNE.

They amounted to £2,691, instead of £1,858, as given. in a very small portion of our summary of the 15th December the name of Amsberg was incorrectly printed for Amschel, in a list of insolvents whose estates had recently been sequEstrated. There is no firm of Amsberg and Co. at present in Melbourne, but a highly respectable firm of that name has long been established at Adelaide, with an agency in Melbourne. MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRICES CURRENT The Argus Office, Friday Evening. The arrival of the two walls of October and November, and the preparations for replying thereto, have so wholly engrossed the attention of merchants during the week as to leave but little time for attention to pilKr matters of business, and there has consequently been but little doing since Christmas in the Import market. The up-country trade continues brisk and steady. The wholesale houses connected with this trade are very busy in small parcels, and are moving off their stocks. Could tower arrivals booked for gradually decreasing stocks would give some hope to the importer, and remunerative Bales might be looked for. This appears, however, unlikely to be the case at least for some length of time. Goods of all desire tloiiB keep pouring in, despite often repeated advices and while this continues, no possible hope of Improved prices can be held out. Liquors -The demand for draught ales ma con thiULd steady. The advanced season of the year has however, induced many holders, more particularly of tip less favorite brands, to urge sales by reduction of prices, and having thus induced a larger than ordinary consumption of ales of this description, the price of the most approved sorts have declined. Cash sales of Bass's No. 3 are reported at Of. 4). per head.. and from this date all others take their relative value ' Draught porter continues an article of but light consumption, and sales can only be effected Ini parcels of very moderate extent, and unless of host brands at very low figures. Thoatocka of bottled beer laid'In before Christmas not being yet consumed, and arrival having continued, have caused a decline in prices. Byass's ale and porter, in equal proportions, Is hold for Its., but Bales have been effected at from 10s. to 10s. 6d, per dozen Sp.rits. Thai market has been generally very InseRT ; the few transactions which have occurred having been almost confined of small sales of brandy, while other sorts have been wholly neglected. During the past week, however, there has been a better trade duties as regards sales, prices not having been benefited. It must, however, be mentioned that the prices quoted for so no time past have been reported as im minal only, and these rates jollier now procured, further de' chine can scarcely be expected. Sales of brandy to considerable extent are reported : Martello at 15s 6d paul's at 155., Vine Growers 14s. (6d, to 16s . In the inftiiorsoit»wohoarof nosaluaofamount.

Inferior sorts are, however, by no means affected in value, and continue all but unsaleable, re- i gardless of price. Candles are still dull of sale, although in rather better inquiry. Sales of Price's No. 1 have been made by auction at 1s. 11d. to 1s. 22d. ; holders are, however, generally firm, and holding for higher rates. Oilmen's Stores of nearly all descriptions are in much improved demand, the excess of stock has hitherto prevented advance in prices, rates are fully supported, however, and should supplies become at all moderate, the present, if not improved rates may be reckoned on Fish of good quality and condition has been somewhat scarce of Into ; the arrivals of the past week have, however, well supplied the market, but as the demand is good, no likelihood of decline in quoted rates for really prime sorts exists. Considerable supplies of Sardines have arrived, and sales to some extent made at 11s. for halves, and by auction at 9s. 6d. per dozen. Fruits, dried, having been of ready sale previous to the late arrivals from Cape Town, stocks had run very low, and we believe the whole of those parcels have passed into consumption. A sale of] 500 boxes having been made, the price of which has not, however, transpired. Currants have (lightly improved in do menu, and for a small lot of good quality 6d. per lb. has been paid. Nuts are still scarce, and wanted. As, however, supplies of now fruits, nuts, &c.;, will shortly be in the market, prices will depend on extent of arrivals. Salt is very difficult of sale, The trade are fully supplied, and until stocks are worked off there is no prospect of amendment. Groceries, &o.; During the week several parcels of tea have been placed by auction at full prices, fair ordinary congous bringing 92 10s, to 92, 16s. per chest ; ordinary gunpowder, 2s. 10d,, and young hyson, 2s. 6d. per lb. Calicos are inquired for especially low priced descriptions. For better sorts, however, there is fair demand, as a parcel of good ordinary Ceylon plantation just landed, ex Simla, has been sold by auction, at 10d. per lb. in bond. The sugar market has been somewhat dull, with a downward tendency. A parcel consisting of about 3500 bags Mauritius was sold by auction in the early part of the week, middling brown to low yellows bringing 402. 15s. to 44!. 10s. per ton. Several cargoes, both from Mauritius and Manilla, are to hand during the past week: and as others are shortly looked for no improvement in present rate of prices can be looked for. Good brown sugars have not been plentiful amongst the arrived parcels, and being at this season In request, for stations, &c;, realise higher rates in proportion than finer sorts. Cossinoros are in the hands of one firm, and hold for higher rates. Sales of Sydney refined sugar (snowdrop) have been made by auction at 582. 10s. per ton. Rice A temporary briskness in demand for this article induced a speculative feeling, and an attempt to rally prices was made, though without permanent effect. The stocks are very excessive, and, though holders are very firm, there is no prospect of further improvement in value. Good Patna rice is worth 152. to 162. 10s. per ton. Hops have lessened in demand, and prices are if anything easier for best Kent and Sussex. Foreign hops, and English old growth, continue all but unsaleable. Tobaccoes the absence of arrivals, Stocks are fast working down ; the Customs latest return shows only 762,500 lbs. remaining in bonded warehouses and as this article is held chiefly by two firms, prices are likely to advance. Timber. Deals, owing to heavy arrivals, continue to decline in value ; the present low rates attract attention, and, although at low prices, there has been, brisk trade doing. Flooring boards, cross-cut dams are wanted ; indeed, lumber and all other sorts in use for building purposes are tolerably saleable. For, bulk timber there is good Inquiry being wanted for railway works. The aspect of the market for metals is unfavorable to importers, large supplies of iron have again come to hand, and with the market previously heavily over- stocked, further decline in prices is probable. Bar, bolt, and shoot, boiler-plate, and galvanised and corrugated iron are all heavily over- supplied, and particularly dull of sale. Tin plates have further declined in value, owing to heavy arrivals, and are difficult of sale, ovonatmuch reduced pricos.JIShoot lead has been shipped to the neighboring colonies In considerable quantities, not, however, sufficiently to relieve the marks', or benefit prices, which continue unchanged.

Mechanics' and skilled labor appear to be still in excess of the employment offering, DoaeaUe servants, both male and female, thoroughly competent to the duties they undertake, readily find situations and as there has been a change in the Government system of forwarding only . "assisted" immigrants, the large number of females Backing situations, the duties of which they were wholly ignorant of, has ceased to oversupply the market, and wages are again rather advancing. Married couples even find less difficulty in procuring situations; indeed, the market gone rally is in a more healthy condition than it has been for some time past.
