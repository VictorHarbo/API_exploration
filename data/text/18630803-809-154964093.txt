MISCELLANEOUS. Tub Immigrants nrrived per Caducous, number ing three hundred nnd ninety-six, nro in excellent health, there having been hut one death, that of an infant, during tho passage. They aro classified as follows : — Forty-nine married couples, t.vo hundred and fifty-two single women, two single men, nnd forty-four children. Tho ship is in good order and very clean, thus accounting in n great measure for the healthy state of tho imsscntrera. During one of the heavy N.W. squalls that visited Hobson's Bay on Friday night, the ship Glencoe drove foul of the barque Salacia, carrying away the jibboom and doing other minor damage. The Glen- coe suffered more, having carried away a consider- able portion of the bulwarks and stanchions on the starboard side, as also studding sail booms. During the afternoon of the day previous the ship Donald McKay lost an anchor and 30 fathoms of chain, and several vessels drove considerably. To Captain Ollaud, of tho barque Bosphorus, We nro indebted for Mauritius papers to tho 23rd of June. A copy of oiiu of the 17th of June, in speak ing of Madagascar, states that the wife of tho late king is now reigning, and that the old dutiable rates on imports and exports aro to be again levied, thus entirely excluding free trade. Tho Bosphorus has had strong N.W. gales since passing Cape Leuwin. Captain Ollard reports that on the day of his dep.ar 'turo from Mauritius tin.' P. find O. Company's mail steamer arrived, lint was placed in quarantine, tho rumored reason assigned, being that smallpox had made its appearance amoiigstsonie of the passengers. TheBarque A. H. Badger, from Calcutta, has brought in excellent order and condition for the Acclimatisation Society the following animals: — Two axis deer, two hog deer, four Indian pheasants, and four grey partridges. The steamship Edina left Dunedin at G p.m. on the 22nd ult., and Bluff Harbor on tho following day at 2 p.m. She brings 88 passengers, and 202 oz of gold. During the whole of tho passage head winds had to bo contended against, more especi ally from tho 23rd ultimo, tho day of leav ing tho Bluff, until tho 20th, whon very heavy westerly and north-westerly galea wero ex perienced, during the soverityof which tho mainmast lioad was spruug. Tho passage hence was also marked by adverse gales. We are indebted to Captain Rolls for Invorcavgill papers to the 2lst ultimo. The steamship Alhambra was sighted by tho Edina at 7 a.m. ou the 23rd ultimo, between Bluff Harbor and Dunedin. The Minna was loading cargo at Mauritius for Melbourne at our last advices. Tne Hamburg soiioonek Alfred II., from tho Capo of Good Hopo, ha8 merely put in here for a frosh supply of wator. Slio is bound for the South Sea Islands. Wo havo no later dates by hor, sho having brought no papers. The s.s. Western left Warrnambool at six p.m. on Friday, and arrived at Melbourno wharf at ten a.m. on Saturday. Experienced to Cape Otway fresh winds from N.W. to S., and honco to Mel bourne strong N.W. galo. Mauritius Shipping. — Tho brig Racer arrived at Booby Island on the 19th May, at fivo p.m. ; landed one bag : of bread.
