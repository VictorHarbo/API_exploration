' DA 1'RTING SUPERSTITIONS. : ' Superstition and extreme conser vatism on the part of auy people are always ludicrous to those who are a few degress ahead of them. Farmers will read with incredulity and amuse meut of the difficulty, with which modern dairy methods were introdu* ced into Siberia :—' In tho Altai re gion the, superstitious peasantry re ferred to'' separators as ' devils,' and laid upon them the. blame for a famine that occurred^ and lasted for three vnarn 'IViwnivTa fJio am\ i\t t\\\a tW,,.A year the people attacked the creamer ies, owued principally by Danish im migrants, and when uot driven off with firearms, earned' off th? sepem -tors, which they threw iuto the near est river. Unfortunately, this raid on the separators was. followed by the end of the famine, and a harvest much better than that of previous years. This coincidence confirmed the peasantry iu their belief that' the separators were of diabolical origin, atid strengthened their resolution to 'inake ^u «--u-I of them. This singular boiiuf had 'duiio. much to retard the development of dairying in the Altai country.'
