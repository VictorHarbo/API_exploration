My family doctor advised mo to consult a specialist in skin diseases, and ho was very pleased whou he learned that I had put niy9elf under your treatment. This wau ac the beginning ot this year, and though my case was an ex tremely distressing one, heing aggravated through my vocation as chef do cuisine, 1 nevertheless begun imme diately to improve under your treatment, and within a few months got entirely rid of all traces of this terrible . disease, being now quite restored to perfect health and comfort for the last three month. You are sUlbcrrj to give full publicity to this case, and any person desirous to Jienr moro about It is welcome when calling at my wife's address, 496 Station-street, North Carlton.
