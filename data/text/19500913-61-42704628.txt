I FROM MANY LANDS OUR NEW AUSTRALIANS. (From our. Special Representa- tive.}-" ; CANBERRA, Sept... 5.-Of more than 72,400 travellers -who. arrived in Australia, from overseas dur- ing .the March quarter of this year 51,400 were, people, who,in- tended to remain here , perman- ently, according to figures re- leased by the Commonwealth Statistician. Thua it will be seen that the target of 200,000 aimed at for the whole year by the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Holt) seems likely to be reached. Al- lowing for departures from. Aus- tralia, the net permanent gain to population through migration was 46,200. To what extent the migration movement is going to reduce the predominantly British character of Australia's population-it has been our boast that we are "98 per cent British"-we do not know. It depends upon how long the ' movement continues. But of the 51,409 permanent new ¡arrivals during the quarter ended March, 33,122 (64.4 per cent.) 'were non-British, whilst 18,287 (35.6 per cent) were British. The number of males who ar- rived to settle In this country totalled 29,950 and females 21,459. Persons not "gainfully occupied" (mainly housewives, students and children) numbered 23,197. The others were classified as follows: Males: Craftsmen, 8,333: rural, fishing, hunting, 3982; operatives, 2883; labourers, 2629: commercial, clerical, 1914. Females: Operatives, 1340; com- mercial, clerical, 1321; profes- sional and semi-professional, 952; domestic, etc., 926. The migration flow commenced to assume important dimensions in 1948, when we made a net gain In population of 48,468. Gathering impetus, due in large measure to the energy- and en- thusiasm of Mr. Calwell, who was then Minister for Immigration. It brought us a net gain of 149.270 in 1949-87.855 males and 61,415 females. Ot these, 46,800 arrived in the last quarter of that year. MA NT POLES AND ITALIANS. Arranged according to country of last permanent residence, the largest inflow ' of migrants was from Germany, but few of them were Germans-they were "dis- placed persons." They numbered 16,612 iii the quarter ended March, as compared with 13,679 from Great Britain. In the last quarter of 1949, however, there were 13,623 new permanent ar- rivals from Britain aa against 5905 from Germany. According to nationality, next to the British by far the largest number of new arrivals are Polish (including "Stateless Poles"), and then come Italians. Adding the number of British people who came from other countries to those who came from the United Kingdom, the total "British" permanent ar- rivals in the March quarter num- bered 18,831.
