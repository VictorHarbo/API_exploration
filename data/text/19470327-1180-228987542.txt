Editorial â€” 1 PREJUDICE AMD THE "FURRINER" THE complaint by a visiting' Danish journalist that Australians "don't like foreigners" has probably enough of the bitter truth in it to give us warning. Hostility to newcomers is an immemorial human prejudice, but at the present stage of our history it is a prejudice which Australia can't afford. It look the people of Britain many years to overcome (he old belief that "furriners" are mostly infidels, scoundrels or weaklings. It is possible that even in Denmark the stranger who comes from abroad is some times regarded with suspicion. If Australia has inherited some of the same prejudice, the sooner wc begin lo fight it the better. New and faster means of air transport are daily making the globe shrink to a point where people of "alien" countries have almost become suburban neighbors. To hug old racial animosities in such a contracted world is stupid and harmful for all of us. The barriers that divide Ihc nations should lie broken down as fast as distance itself is being conquered. As Australians, wc must realise the plain fact that our future depends on population, and that population depends on immigration. We must learn to forget unreasoning prejudice when we welcome migrants, whatever their race. For mutual understanding and appreciation arc the world's only hope of peace.
