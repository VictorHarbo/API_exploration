life PUBLISHED DAILY. I am in the place where I am demanded of conscience to speak the truth, and, therefore, the truth I speak, impugn it whoso liaL" FRIDAY, APRIL 22, 187-, The case of the Phoenix Foundry Company v. the Queen deserves attention because of the principle involved in it. No one will deny, we think, that in all transactions between the QUEEN, in her representative capacity as the embodi- ment of the state and her subjects, the various Governments which wield the powers of the Crown should display the utmost fairness and consideration, and as much liberality as is compatible with justice to the community. Anything like sharp practice or quibbling, or endeavours to take advantage of the letter of the law and the rules of practice, should be studiously avoided, as tending to bring contempt on the very principle which is supposed to he at the root of national government, viz., a desire to deal out substantial justice to all. It is only owing to the imperfections which human legislation shares with all other human efforts, that law and justice are not synonymous terms. In order to uphold certain methods of procedure which many of our jurists-wrongly, we think-consider necessary to the impartial and orderly trial of the issues submitted to the courts, the most flagrant and monstrous injustice is frequently done. It often happens, however, that no notice is taken of various points, which, if insisted on, might stay the progress of a cause or reverse an equitable verdict on some technical point, unless they be insisted on by one or other of the parties to the suit. Now, we submit that the Government in all actions brought against it should do all in its power to have the cases tried on their merits, and never, except in cases of evident fraud, where no other method of defeating the attempts is available, endeavour to gain a victory simply by means of legal subtleties. But we go further than this, and say that in framing its legislation with re- spect to all matters likely over to be in dispute between the Crown and the subject, a Government should be care ful not to infringe in any way on what we may call the natural rights of suitors, by unduly circumscribing the time within which actions may be commenced, or by enacting any other provisions which bear on the face of them an evident desire to escape from Equitable liabilities. In the case of individuals, it is no doubt desirable to limit the period during which actions may be brought on disputed accounts, because when a man has a possible liability hanging over him, his credit is damaged, and his enterprise proportionately discouraged. But it must be admitted that the statute of limitations is merely a concession to expediency, and is incapable of defence as an abstract principle that principle being that a debtor should always be held accountable for his debts. But the excuse which is urged as a reason for curtailing the duration of responsibility in the case of the individual, cannot logically be said to apply to the state. The industry of the whole body of the people is not checked by the fact that there are some outstanding claims against the Government, while it may be fairly urged that it is of more importance to the community that right should be done to the uttermost " farthing" than that a Treasurer should be easy about his accounts or a few extra thousands remain in the national exchequer. As we said before the consideration of these points was forced again on our attention by the case of the Phoenix Foundry Company v. The Queen, tried at the recent Circuit Court held in Geelong. The action was to recover £922 17s. 3d. paid to the Customs authorities. It appears that in the prosecution of their business-one branch of which consists in levying a toll on every man, woman, and child in Victoria, under the name of pro- tection the plaintiffs entered into a contract with the Crown for the supply of sundry locomotives. In the course of carrying it out it became necessary to send to England with a view to encourage native industry, we suppose-for the tubes used in the construction of boilers. On their arrival there appears to have been a difference of opinion between the importers and the Customs department as to the duty to which they were liable. With a consistency and knowledge of their business which does them infinite credit, the authorities admitted one shipment under the 10 per cent, scale, while on the second 20 per cent, was demanded, and paid under protest. The officials appear to have had no doubt that the articles in question were liable to duty, and in passing we may say that, on reference to the tariff, we have no doubt their last charge was the correct one but the company, with that singular dis I like to submit itself to the operation of the same fiscal laws it is so willing to impose on others, demurred altogether to this view of the case, and declared that its boiler-pipes did not come under the operation of the act that £3 to say, that pipes brought out specially to complete certain parts of locomotives were neither " brass mountings or fittings," nor " fittings for pumps, engines, and " machinery," nor " hardware, iron mon " fiery holloware, or other goods not " otherwise enumerated." A bold contention truly, and one which shows to what lengths genuine protectionists will go when their pockets are touched. This notable scheme went awry, and on the merits in this instance we are perfectly satisfied that the most substantial justice was done. But it is to the way of doing it that we object. The plaintiffs were nonsuited, because, by the 21st and 22nd sections of the Customs Act 1867, all duties become revenue after the lapse of three months from the date of payment, and cannot therefore be recovered. Now, we admit that the counsel for the Crown could not avoid pressing for a nonsuit on this point, because it was necessary to do so in order to carry out the provisions of the statute law. We think, however, it would not be very difficult to find cases in which objections have been taken by the Crown in this colony, founded on some of those bewildering reports which are supposed to constitute and contain that sacred mystery-the common law, the object having apparently been to ride off victorious on a quibble. But in this case the fault lay with the law, not with its administration. It is monstrous that the subject should be deprived of all legal redress by such a provision as this three months' limit. No doubt, had the Pheonix Company known that such an unjust condition had been attached to its right of appeal to the law, earlier steps would have been taken to try the question at issue ; but it appears to us that the directors can hardly be blamed for never suspecting the existence of such a trap. They would naturally suppose that their remedy against the Crown was at least as full as against their follow men, and never dream of finding HER MAJESTY through the statute-book turning round when an application was made to settle the question in dispute between them by the machinery of her courts, and saying, " Gentlemen, it is true I may " have filched your money, but that is " a question I decline to discuss. You " cannot legally make me pay it back, " so I don't intend to do so. A fig for " honesty and honour !" The present state of affairs is not at all creditable to the colony, and the sooner it is altered the better. The case of Dr. COWPER, of Roke- wood, offers a good illustration of the necessity of an alteration in the Medical Practitioners Statute, so as to leave coroners free to instruct any medical practitioner instead of the one " who " shall reside near to the place where " such inquest or inquiry is holden " to make a post-mortem examination. The 15th and 16th clauses of the act, indeed, are clearly in antagonism, for while clause 15 prescribes the sending for a medical man " near to the " place," clause 16 says : " The core " ner or justice, either in such sum " mons as aforesaid, or by an order in " writing, may, at anytime before the tor " minationofthoinquestorinquiry,direct " any legally-qualified medical practi- " tioner to perform a post-mortem ex " animation." Relying, however, upon the direction of the 15th clause, certain members of the profession have from time to time made it their business to complain when the first of these clauses has appeared to have been disregarded, so that some coroners are, we believe, under the impression that it is impera- tive upon them to instruct not only a " near," but the nearest medical man, to examine a body for medico-legal purposes. The result has been, in by no means a few instances, to occasion a miscarriage of justice when the result of a criminal investigation has depended upon the medical evidence for it has been frequently pointed out that the skill requisite to examine a body so as to render the evidence derived from the examination at all valuable, is not a part of ordinary medical knowledge, but that it requires special training, special study, and much experience to qualify a man to speak confidently In tho case of Dr Lowpi n, indeed, it may be objected that as he was a drunkard, his is not a typical case to show the unreasonableness of supposing that all medical men are good at making a post mortem examination But it was dis strictly stated at the trial of COWPER on Tuesday, that he knew perfectly well what he was doing when he made the examination, and yet, in the face of the fact subsequently disclosed by a second autopsy, that the base of the skull was fractured, and that blood was extravasated on the brain this doctor of medicine of the University of Glasgow and licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, swore the deceased died from fatty degeneration of the heart Vic- are not going to say that every imperfectly experienced autopsies would make such a bungle of his work or furnish such an incorrect report as Dr Covv i ER did, but we have reason to know that this practitioner is not a solitary representative of this kind of map city Similar instances of ignorance, horribly ludicrous in their gum blundering have come within our knowledge in this city, and if the details of them could be published, they would furnish the best possible arguments for such an alteration of the law is is now proposed It is some thing remarkable that, considering the division of labour which now obtains in the medical profession, and the tendency there is in the public mind to run after specialists, the specialty of post mortem making should not by this time have been sufficiently recognised Consider mg the question on the grounds of public safety, it is still more remarkable that the mere clamour of a few interested persons, having an eye for fees, should so far have weighed with the Legislature of this colony as to cause the continuance of an evil which has so frequently been made obvious It is gratifying to know that the hon the Chief Secretary has discovered another object worthy of his ambition This gentleman has been so successful in his public life that there was some danger of his ceasing, to take any further interest in it through a feeling of satiety produced by the multitude of honours it has show ored upon him. He has gradually worked his way through the higher offices the state, until his efforts have been crowned by the attainment of the very highest which it is within the power of Parliament to bestow He has been at different times Commissioner of Public Works, Commissioner of Customs, Treasurer, and is now Chief Secretary for a number of years he has, with very short intervals of rest, occupied a position on the Government bonds and who could blame him if, after having attained the full fruition of a colonial politician's hopes, he should be found ready to exclaim, " Vanity of " vanities, all is vanity," and to cover lest ? But it is not so His ardent spirit is still aiming at higher achieve ments his cry is still ' Excelsior . People will naturally conclude that it is no low or petty object the Chief Secretary of Victoria intends to strive after and we are happy to be able to give them the assurance from his own lips that in this they have only done him bare justice If they will turn to the report of the speech delivered by the hon gentleman, when returning thanks for his election, they will find what it is he has set his mind upon -" I have " every determination,' he says, "to come " mand the respect of the gentleman who has been elected to act as " my colleague in the representation of " Richmond in the coming Parliament There, " the cat is out of the bag Mr FRANCIS has enjoyed the approbation of the Victorian people, but it is manifest that his career must remain in complete until he has won the approval and basked in the smiles of an INGLIS As Mr SirpHPN is only happy in looking up to his honoured chief, so that chief only lives to deserve the approbation of Mr INGLIS . We regret to find that the appeal we made to the public some time ago on behalf of the Boys Trading Brigade has not met with that ready and generous response which the importance and merits of this young and struggling institution demand "VA o do not think that the nu portance is sufficiently appreciated of the effort now being made to give a number of the waifs and strays of humanity who for no fault of their own, have been wanderers in our streets morn if they an opportunity of earning an honest he eli hood, or Surely some would shake off the apathy which seems to possess them and contribute the small sum which is necessary to save the interesting experiment from collapse We published yesterday a letter from a gentleman who has visited the place where business has been com- menced He seems favourably impressed with what he saw, and bogs his fellow citizens to assist in placing matters on a satisfactory foundation The first necessity of course is money, and there are thousands in this town to whom a pound or two is a matter of no importance Lot those who have children of their own think what might have been the fate of PROVIDENCE had been less kind, and show their thankfulness by assisting the unfortunate whose cause we plead But money is not everything required to make the thing a success public interest must be excited in the young traders and their doings "If," says our correspondent, " people would reserve there bottles " for the members of the brigade, " who would call regularly for them " they would do a substantial good " to deserving boys But some may think that by so doing they would prevent outsiders from earning a living in this way They should remember, however, that they might thus confer an absolute benefit upon them. One of the objects of the institution is to prevent the present promiscuous trading, which only has the effect of encouraging old thieves and producing new ones We see, too, that any old clothes or boots would be thankfully received, so that all except the very poor may do something towards this really good work As " T B, somewhat caustically l marks, "it seems comparatively easy to " raise large sums for the improvement " of churches," but apparently there is a great difficulty in procuring a few. pounds to assist those who, if kept from evil now, would probably furnish a portion of w»0 various congregations in the future Here is a good opportunity of practically pr" " moting morality," instead of tartar. about it Will not the clergy press the claims of the Boys' Trading Brigade on the attention of their congregations a, Constitutional government is on its trail in Denmark, and if it emerges safe and sound from the fiery ordeal, no one need despair of the commonwealth for all time to come the political situation in that country is peculiar, if not altogether unique In December last, a majority of the members of the Lower House presented an address to the King, praying him }°cttismiss the Ministry and this act was accompanied by the resignation of the latter His MAJESTY, however, refused to accept it, and commanded the Prime Minister and his colleagues to re "am at their post Thereupon the Opposition declined to discuss any mea sure brought in by the Government, and referred all bills to a select committee, where they were quietly shelved On the 20th of January, the hostile majority renewed its offensive operations by moving fresh vote of censure, which gave rise to a tin roe days debate, which for violence of language, bitterness of feeling, per gone attacks, and angry recrimina tions, has rarely been surpassed in the Danish Legislature " Do you " think, said the Minister of Justice, "that after having stood against two " addresses to the KING, half a dozen " votes of want of confidence, and a refusal to pass the bill for ways and 41 means, that the Cabinet should retire " before such an unnatural combination " as that of a nobleman who defends the " temporal power of the Poi E, and " speaks of IÍENRVCINQ with the leaders of an extreme Left ? Your object is " to force the Cabinet to retire Well, I " tell you at once that the Cabinet will " not do so And he concluded by challenging the Opposition to impeach himself and his colleagues before the supreme tribunal of the nation The Minister of Education, in reply to an assertion that the people day by plowed of the conduct of the Government, tauntingly remarked that he supposed by " the people was meant the majority in that Chamber, and that that majority was represented by its leaders In that case, said he, the people of Denmark are summed up in MM LARSEN and BLUe, horse an " ex cobbler and the second a country Schoolmaster One speaker went the length of warning the Opposition, that if they did not mind what they were about his Government would force through the house it does not clearly appear how a provisional finance bill and a provisional measure for the restriction of the franchise Eventually the vote of censure was caused by a majority of 26, but the Ministry remains namoi able, and the ttt of parties meet day after day in the something, else and glower at each other, and do nothing Possibly when the LtgsHiad, or Supreme Council of the Nation, meets, which it does every second year, it may demise some means of put ting an end to this extraordinary dead lock, but, in the mean time all practical legislation is arrested and if Chancellor or NSTIEKNA has any descendants living in the neighbouring kingdom, they will no doubt find an additional reason for admiring their ancestor s sago admonition to his son Nevers, vn fill, (mantilla yi Kilfeera homines reports The steamship Aldinga having on board the New Zealand mails for England has made a splendid run to Adelaide of 35 hours and was enabled to tranship the mails into the Baroda before that vessel left Glenelg fine Aldinga left the Heads at 4 a.m. on Wednesday and armed at Glenelg at 7 p.m. last evening.

A second row of shores, 10 in number, has also been fitted on each side, so that the Cerberus, notwithstanding her enormous weight, is fixed as rigidly as in a vyce The pumps did not commence working again until noon yesterday, and it was 9 o'clock last evening before the dock was dry As the water receded from the vessel the foul condition of the sides and bottom was fully discussed, and the immense growth of shell- fish and seaweed in which the hull was encased was something surprising Such a coating of fungus, with its patches of mosaic work in Brussels, must have materially retarded the vessels progress when under steam, and the individuality of the twin screws was altogether lost in the glutinous filmy seaweed with which they were draped the shell fish were plentiful and large some of them being nearly the size of a youth's hand The appearance of the Cerberus in dock is not so striking by any means as that presented by the Nelson, with her towering sides and spreading spars on the contrary, being low in the dock she looks dwarfed, and the colour of her paint suggests the idea of her having been built with the surrounding blue- stone The dock was visited yesterday after noon by a considerable number of people.

The ball given under the auspices of the committee of the Civil Service Cricket Club at the Town-hall last evening, was not so well attended as the efforts of the working committee deserved There can be no doubt that Mr J B Simmons the hon secretary worked most energetically to make the affair a success but he was only ably supported by a section of the committee and the consequence of was that the attendance did not exceed 500 persons This was an advantage in one respect, as the dancers were not incommoded The hall was decorated with flags and floral emblems The band, which had been supplied by Mr Nicholson, of Collins street and was under the direction of Herr Plock gave a selection of entirely new music culled from the van ous opera bouffe which are now so popular His Excellency the Governor, attended by Major Pitt arrived about half-past 9 o'clock and was received by the Hon J G Francis (in the absence of the Hon A Mackay president of the Civil Service Cricket Club) and was at once conducted to the Major's room No time was lost in opening the ball the first set of quadrilles being formed as follows -His Excellency the Governor and Mrs Francis, the Hon J G Francis and Mrs Casey the Hon E Langton and Miss Learmonth, his Worship the Major of Melbourne and Miss Mary Frances Colonel Ward and Miss W.ardell, Major Pitt and Mrs Ward Dancing was kept up with great spirit until about half-past 12 o'clock, when supper was announced in the upper room of the Town hall Mr Gunsler, of Collins street, had received carte blanche for the refreshments necessary and he carried out his contract in first class style The ap I earance of the supper table was greatly admired and on this occasion the guests found seats provided for them instead of having to stand, as has been the case usually Mr Francis occupied the chair, but no toasts or speeches were indulged in, and a rapid move was made to the ballroom, where dancing was kept up until an early hour in the morning. The following tenders were opened by the Board of Lands and Works yesterday, and declared to be the lowest Completion of excavation at south wharf, river Yarra, Messrs Thomas Walker and Co, £13 510 18s , completion of basin and aqueduct at Yan Yean, Messrs Overend and Robb, £17 7919s , erection of circular chamber at the Melbourne Observatory, Messrs Adams and Hardie, £150 4s , re shingling roof of office at Public Works Department Messrs Adams and Hardie, £120 10s The tenders for the construction of a wing wall at St. Kilda were referred to the Public Works Department for report We learn from the St Arnaud Mercury that Mr Colin Campbell, who was returned for Crowlands at the recent election, has been invited to a banquet by his constituents at St Arnaud. Pressure of business affairs, however, has prevented him from accepting the invitation. Letters patent were granted yesterday by the hon. the Attorney-General to Mr. G B Marland, of London, for certain improvements in rotary pumps, which are also applicable to motive power engines and water meters The first of these improvements consists in rounding off the upper part of the entrance to the discharge port, so as to provide a clear passage for any substance drawn into the cylinder which might otherwise tend to choke it The second consists in the use of a dividing plate for feathering the stream of water as it enters and leaves the cylinder, the third in a novel method of packing the piston, which has a series of radial proves on its sides extending to its periphery for receiving strips of leather which consequently only wear on their edges, the fourth, in the arrangement of the suction gas ice in a curved line outside the cylinder, reaching to a vertical pipe at right angles to the discharge port, and the fifth in the substitution of metallic packing for the leather when needed for a motive power engine Letters patent were also granted at the same time to Mr Samuel M'Caughey, of Coonong, in New South Wales, for an invention of improvements in excavating machines These machines have a scoop shaped excavating tool, which shovels the earth on to an elevator from whence it is discharged into a suitable travelling receptacle attached This continues until the receptacle is full when the excavator is lifted out of the ground and the machine driven off to the place where the contents are to be deposited By a peculiar arrangement of mechanism, the motion of the elevator is made dependent upon that of the excavator, so that when the earth ceases to be excavated the elevator remains stationary and vice versa The machine, as a whole is ingeniously constructed, and seems likely to perform the work for which it was designed in a satisfactory manner Mr Waters conducted each application An undersized young man of the ordinary dissipated larrikin type, named John Denman, was charged in the City Police Court yesterday with being in a public place with intent to commit a felony The prisoner was arrested while in the act of robbing a drunken man named William Donovan, at the Friendly Societies' Gardens, on Tuesday last Before this case was gone into one of the witnesses pointed out a powerful young man among the spectators whom he identified as being also implicated in the robbery The man was at once arrested and placed in the dock, when he proved to be the brother of the prisoner Denman The evidence showed that Denovan was lying helplessly drunk under a tree in a retired part of the gardens when a band of five young men came up and proceeded to rob him A lady gave the alarm, and an elderly gentleman, named It It Coe, ran up and seized the larger prisoner, who struggled violently, and with the assistance of the others, effected his escape A Mr LT Leo caught the smaller prisoner, who was secured, though not without some difficulty One of the gang attacked Mr Lee with a belt, and ho m defending himself broke his stick over his assailants head For some time it appeared as if Messrs Coo and Leo were likely to fare badly at the hands of their enemies, for the mob increased to about a dozen, and Mr Coe was struck several times before the larger prisoner broke away from him. A policeman, however, came up, and John Denman was secured After the prisoner was removed some of the gang came back, and would have treated Messrs Coo and Lee roughly but that a mounted trooper came up and protected them An attempt was made to show that the prisoners were respectable, hard working men, but the Bench thought the charge proved, and sentenced them to six months' imprisonment each, with hard labour The courage shown by Mr Coe in arresting the larger prisoner was greatly admired as he was certainly more than 30 years older and the prisoner had all the appearance of possessing great agility, combined with strength BA William Stewart Gordon and John Christie were placed in the dock at the City Police Court yesterday, charged with conspiring to defraud one Robert Henry Anderson of the sum of £50 On the application of Detective Forster, the prisoners were remanded for eight days The prisoners, it is alleged, had v cruised for a partner to carry on a business and thus met with the prosecutor They each put in £50 to start a business which money the prisoners appropriated to their own use It is likely that several charges of a similar nature will be brought against the prisoners A carter named Ralph Wilson in the employ of Messrs Hall and Gillespie, of Flinders street, was prosecuted in the District Court yesterday, at the instance of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Constable Pollard stated the defendant was driving a horse that was quite lame, and totally unfit for work Mr Graham Mitchell, veterinary surgeon, examined the animal, and found one of its hoofs cracked, and the flag of the foot very fluffy An attempt had been made to relieve the bone by placing a leather sole between the hoof and the shoe but it was impossible to prevent the animal from suffering great pain For the defence Mr Hall, one of the defendants employers, stated the horse had a bad fall about three months ago and since that time had been kept in the stable, in order to allow a large v found in its leg to become cured They had been recommended to give it some gentle exercise and on the day in question it had been sent out for exercise, as the load in the cart did not exceed 12cwt or heart The Bench fined the defendant 20s and 20s costs Stephen McNamara, a young man, one of a party of three who, on Easter Monday, endeavoured to prevent the sports of the children of the St Mary's Church of England school in the Royal park, was brought up before the Hotham magistrates yesterday Evidence was given showing that M Namara and his companions tried to throw down the children as they were racing, and assaulted the teacher and the Rev. Mr Potter when they showed they were determined to protect the children. The Bench fined the prisoner £4 with 10s costs, or in default one month's imprisonment The fine was not paid and he was therefore sent to gaol Denis Gaynor, a a well known criminal who had been apprehended on "a previous evening for picking pockets in the crowd which gathered at the election, was brought up at the same court and remanded for one week to give him an opportunity of proving that he had means of obtaining his living On the 19th just a blacksmith named Neil Wright, living at Campbellfield, went with a Mr McCormack to look at an unoccupied hotel in that neighbourhood The doors were found to be looked, and none of the rooms was found the body of a man man advanced stage of decomposition The door of the room in which the deceased lay was fastened on the inside, and it was necessary to burst open the door to get inside The hotel has been unoccupied for the last two years, and occasionally travelling men have got into some of the rooms to sleep there The deceased was about 65 years of age, and dressed in a coloured shirt dirty drab tweed trousers, and grey socks LjingbeBido the deceased was a blue grey tweed paletot coat, a pair of shoes, a black hat, and a double breasted tweed vest A razor in a case was lying beside the deceased. The room was quite clean. In the vest pocket was found a pawn ticket bearing the name of W. Laing, and the date of 10th January, 1871, for a pair of trousers, on which 2s had been lent by Henry Allen, pawnbroker, 00 Stephen street The pawnbroker had no knowledge of the deceased except that he thought he was a German The clothes appeared to be carefully taken off the deceased, and there was no evidence of a struggle buying taken place. The deceased was about 5ft. 8in, high ; his hair was grey. The flesh had fallen off the face from decomposition. A post-mortem examination of the body was made by Dr. Neild. There were no symptoms of poisoning. The cause of death was disease of the heart. In Dr. Neild's opinion the deceased had been dead over a month. An inquest was held on the body by Mr. Candler on the 22nd inst., when the jury returned a verdict that deceased died from disease of the heart. On New Year's Day a furniture van containing a number of people backed into the Yarra in the Survey Paddock, and one or two courageous persons spoiled their clothes in rescuing half-a-dozen women and children from drowning. A subscription was started for the purpose of compensating them for their loss, and one sum of 10s. was sent to this office. No one has claimed the money, and we have handed it over to the city poor box. The Mount Moriac Annual Race Meeting was held yesterday, when, although the entries were not very numerous, there were some exciting finishes. The weather was delightful. Some 200 or 300 persons, including a goodly sprinkling of the fair sex, were on the ground. The stewards worked with a will, and as a whole the meeting was a success. The first event was the Maiden Plate, one mile and a half, for which four Mr. M'Callum's Valentine, Mr. Monaghan's Bailiff, Mr. Davis's Little Dick, and Mr. Burnett's Beeswing started. After going about a quarter of a mile Beeswing bolted, and never showed up again during the race. Valentine and Bailiff raced well together, but the cognoscenti could easily see that Valentine had the race in hand. After changing places several times he came with a rush at the finish and won hard held, by a couple of lengths. The next event was the most important of the day -thcMountMoriacPlato of 2sovs., a selling handicap, two miles. Mr. J. Monaghan's Barwon, 8st. 12lbs. ; Mr. D. O'Toole's Novice, 8st. 12lbs. ; Mr. P. O. Toole's Phreeney, 7st. 12lbs. ; Mr. J. Shannon's Don Pedro, 7st. 12lb., faced the starter, and were sent away very evenly. Phreeney made the running, Barwon going second, and the favourite, Novice, apparently waiting until Phreeney had taken the steam out of Barwon. The latter, however, proved to be too good for either of them, and having beaten off Phreeney, came in a winner two lengths ahead of Novice. Barwon, entered to be sold for 25 sovs., fetched 31 sovs., and thus reduced the stake of 15 sovs. considerably, he being brought in by his owner. A Hack Race was won by Mr Dwyer's Prospect, by the sale of which the committee realised £4 15s. and an Open Handicap was won by Mr. Fletcher's Will-if I-can, beating Mr. Toole's Phreeney and Shepherd's Spring Jack. A protest was entered by the rider of Spring Jack, on the ground that the two others had run inside a post ; but this had not been decided when our reporter left. A fire occurred at the farm of Mr. William Crook, Ceres, on Saturday night, when two stacks of hay, one stack of straw, chaff house, and other property, valued altogether at £150, were destroyed. It is not yet known by what means the fire took place. It was also reported in Geelong yesterday, that a large stack of hay, the property of Mr. O'Keefe, of Meredith, had been burnt on the preceding day. Our Ballarat correspondent writes -"It was freely stated some weeks ago that a number of electors' rights had been obtained from the electoral registrar for the purpose | of enabling dead and absent men to vote at the election about to take place, and Mr. Sergeant denounced the practice to-day at the declaration of the poll. But beyond what be there stated, he says he is prepared to prove that he was offered 100 of such rights for a £5 note, and refused to have anything to do with them. He further says he can prove that a man and a lad, supposed to be the man's son, were engaged filling in a book' of those informal and illegal rights during the election yesterday, and was handing them to the dummies. He (Mr. Sergeant) challenged him with it, when he at once put the book in the breast pocket of his coat. There would seem to be a necessity for investigation into the truth of these extraordinary statements," Our Sandhurst correspondent, writing yesterday, says-The dispute which has continued in the mines of the Imperial Hustler's and Royal Hustler's Companies during the past month came under the notice of the Bench at the City Police Court this morning, when a miner engaged in the Royal Hustler's claim was charged with causing suffocating fumes to be driven into the mine of the Imperial Hustler's Company. Evidence was given that a man was seen engaged in feeding a fire in the Royal Hustler's mine with something that sent forth most noxious fumes, and caused the men in the Imperial Hustler's mine to beat a retreat, and desist from their work. As no one, however, was able to swear that the prisoner was the man seen feeding the fire, the case was withdrawn, and the prisoner discharged. A second charge of a similar nature, against the mining manager of the Royal Hustler's claim, was remanded for a week." " Another case of diphtheria was admitted to the Castlemaine Hospital on Monday, the Mount Alexander Mail states, "but not of a very dangerous type. One of the nurses at the institution has been prostrated by the disease, which is highly infectious. The danger the attendants at the hospital run in cases of this kind is very great, and deserves to be recognized in a substantial way, seeing they run such a risk, To allay the fears of the inhabitants of the locality, however, it may be stated that the remedies adopted by the medical staff of the hospital have hitherto proved successful, whore applied in time. During the year so far as gone there have been but few deaths in the institution, thus showing the care and attention bestowed on the patients by the medical staff." A wretched case is reported by the Bendigo Independent:-"On Wednesday morning, a coloured girl named Emma Todd, gave birth to an illegitimate child in a fowlhouse in the bush, near Kangaroo Flat. Horfathor finding her near her confinement turned her out of the house, the unfortunate girl then went to a neighbour's and sought admittance, but was refused. She then went to the fowl- house, where she was confined, no person being near to assist her. She wrapped the infant up in her apron, and returned home. The child was then alive, but died shortly afterwards. The girl Todd was confined some 18 months back of another illegitimate child." The Bendigo Evening News reports: "Within the last day or two there have been a few anxious inquiries by bankers and others as to the whereabouts of one of our legal managers, and on Thursday morning a warrant was taken out for the apprehension of the missing man. It is the old story of paying moneys to his own instead of the companies' accounts, The missing manager is one who has for a number of years held a foremost position in the ranks of our citizens, and his absence is greatly regretted. Over speculation is the cause, we hear." It will be remembered that a short time ago some atrocious murders were committed in the neighbourhood of Gulgong, which were considered at the time to be the acts of a lunatic. A man named Breen was arrested and it now appears, according to the Gulgong (N.S.W.) Argus, that it is likely that Brown will be considered unfit to be put upon his trial, on account of mental aberration. It is reported that he is a raving madman, and attempted the life of one of the gaol officials. -.' The Rockhampton Bulletin gives the following particulars of an accident to an acrobat : " The rate announced by the Loyal troupe, which took place in Pene's gardens, terminated in a very serious accident to the principal performer, Mr George Loyal, who accidentally fell to the ground from a height of about 20ft, through the breaking of a rope, while performing the preliminary part of his great bicycle feat ' A wire rope of about a hundred feet in length, and 20ft from the ground, was stretched between two trees, with a small platform at each end This narrow pathway had been walked over with safety by Miss Zilla at an earlier part of the day, but after Mr Loyal had taken a few steps upon it, with a head, balancing pole in his bands, the wires give way, and he of course fell to the ground with a heavy thud, fortunately without breaking any bones " Previous to leaving Sydney a letter, of which the following is a translation, was addressed, the Empire. states, by M Rochefort, the part of himself and his companions, to Mr D Buchanan, ML A -"Hotel de France, Sydney, April 1, 1871 Sir-Allow me, for myself and my friends, to thank you for having placed our situation in its true light before your honourable countrymen The Versailles Assembly wanted to proclaim monarchy we wanted to preserve the Republic, to the establishment of which we had sufficiently contributed to give us the right to defend it, and we fought for it Such is the truth Lottho conquerors insult us and misrepresent our m tensions, it is an easy matter for them, since the fighting men of the last days are nearly all shot, transported, or outlawed, and our enemies alone can be heard But when the veil shall be torn asunder, and it become known what streams of blood have been shed by the bayonets and mitrailleuses of the drunken soldiers w hen the number of women and children put to death without pity after the victory of the reaction shall be known-it will be seen with certainty by which camp the excesses were committed, and what powerful interest the monarchists had to conceal, under their calumnies with regard to us, the dreadful crimes which they have perpetrated Pray accept, sir, with all our gratitude, for your generous forwardness to defend us, the expression of our most devoted feelings HENRI ROCHEFORT The thermograph, an ingenious scientific instrument shown at the Sydney Metropolitan Exhibition by Mr. H. C. Russell, Government astronomer, is thus described by the Sydney Empire -"It is, as its name implies, a self registering thermometer, an instrument for recording automatically and continuously the temperature of the air, so that every change, as well as the time it takes place, is recorded facts which are of the greatest importance in. meteorology, and in many manufacturing processes The thermograph merely requires winding up and putting on a fresh sheet of paper on the cylinder each day The means by which this is accomplished are very simple, and the principle upon which it works quite new Heretofore, temperature has only been self recorded by the application of photography or mechanical arrangement to the ordinary mercurial thermometer, but in this instrument Mr Russell has introduced a compound brass and steel bar, similar to what is used in the compensation balance of chronometers, as the indicator of temperature, and has thus removed the greatest difficulty in the construction of such instruments The exhibition instrument consists of a cylinder covered with paper, which is made to revolve once per minute by clockwork, on one end of it is fixed a disk of metal, which, instead of being found, is cut into a curve, and starting from the nearest point of the centre, gradually increases round the circumference to the point which is furthest from the centre at each turn of the cylinder This, with reference to any point above it is, therefore, an inclined piano, and as such it moves under the projecting end of the compound brass and steel bar, and, of course, touches it during some part of each revolution If the temperature increases, the brass which is on the inside of the bar expands more than the steel, and lifts up the end of it, and the incline on the end of the cylinder has to go further before it touches it At what ever point the compound bar and the in close touch, a current of electricity instantly passes through the magnet, which is on a sort of trap telling carriage, and at once brings a pen on the paper, which, after marking a line to the end of the incline where electrical contact is broken, is lifted off the paper by a spring, and remains up until the next contact of the incline and compound bar The carriage which holds the magnet and pen is moved slowly along the cylinder by the clock work, and thus shows the temperature at each minute, and any change appears as a curve on the outline of the inked shading " An au ship, with wings worked by steam, and capable of being driven 100 miles per hour, has, it is said, been constructed at last. It is the production of Mr. L B Hunt, a talented and enterprising mechanic, of Auburn, state of New York, and is thus described in the New YoiLSun -"The car destined to carry the passengers is of wood, 30ft long, 8ft high, and 18ft wide This is attached to the engine room, 20ft above, by four wire cables, and the motive power is steam, one of Slisby's rotatory 40-horse power engines being used The engine is so constructed as to turn upright shafts, one within the other, working in opposite directions, to which wings made of sheet iron, slightly concave o, are attached 'these wings are eight in number-four a foot wide next the shaft, 60ft at the extreme end, and 12ft long, being attached to the outer shaft, and four of a similar shape and of the same dimensions being attached to the inner shaft, 40ft above the other When the machinery is act in motion, these wings lift the vessel, and the whole apparatus is steered by a sheet iron ladder, parallel to the shaft of the engine at the right of the machine, 40ft long by 5ft wide From the car to the top of the shaft the vessel measures 48ft, and it has cost 12,000 (dollars It weighs six tons, is capable of carrying six tons more, and will afford accommodation for 40 persons " This, though placed in quotation, is a somewhat abridged account of this extraordinary vessel But it contains all that is material, without going into more minute details It should be observed, however, that no trial has yet been made of this vessel, although one is premised at an early day Apropos to the question of cremation," writes hon, "someone has resuscitated the story of COle weight of candles having been manufactured from a quantity of adipocoro found during street alterations near St Mary's Churchyard, Islington It is not quite pleasant to contemplate the chance of being supplied with what would be literally corpse candles instead of stearine or lookout, but that is nothing to the idea of assisting in the transmutation of some body's cast off garment of flesh into a portion of your own without its having at least passed through the turnip or potato stage and in these days of advanced economical chemistry, artificial butter and German Sausages, the thing is as possible as it is awful Here then is anothoraigumont for Sir Henry Thompson. A correspondent of Nature writes -"On Saturday, January 31, at the Crystal Palace, while Mr. Vernon Rigby was singing Boot haven's 'Adelaide,' I heard what I thought was strangely out of place an accompaniment to the song played on the highest notes of a violin, sometimes closely following the air note for note, at other times being one third lower. I soon found that this proceeded from one or two sensitive gas jets, notwithstanding they were at the end of the winter concert-room farthest away from the orchestra. The very per feet manner in which they responded to every note no matter how piano, was curious It happened that the gas pressure had just been increased Had this occurred earlier the effect of Mdme Norman Neruda s fine performance of Mendelssohn's violin concerto would have been totally destroyed as far as regards a large part of the audience This shows that it is a matter of no small importance in a concert-room to have the size and number of the gas burners properly proportioned to the gas supply The drama of the Geneva Cross was repeated at the Theatre Royal yesterday evening Miss May Howard sustained the favourable impression created by her first appearance and doubtless m characters affording more scope for her powers she will be able to appeal more readily to the sympathy of her audience Mr Greville afforded amusement by the introduction of some low comedy which relieved what was monotonous in the piece though in charity to the author it may be supposed to be original gag The Emerson Minstrel Troupe is having a successful season at St George's Hall. The entertainment is replete with fun which though of rather a boisterous kind and lacking refinement is certainly success farm amusing the audience Some of the jokes are ancient and fall upon the ear like a twice told tale but any deficiencies in this respect are more than balanced by the energy and gusto exhibited by the performers In our advertising columns will be found a number of communications from successful and unsuccessful candidates at the elections returning thanks for the efforts made by their supporters on the polling, day We have received from Messrs Sands and M Dougall the Mail 1 ibles for 1871 compre sending, all the routes viz , via Suez via San Francisco and via.
