We shall take an early opportunity to deal more fully with the return. In the meantime, we purpose to consider the correB-' ponding Victorian return. - Manifestly, with lapse of time, we may expect to find, in colonies like these, a growth in the number of native-born citizens exceed- ing the increment of foreign nationalities. That will take place where there is assisted immigration ; but it will be relatively greater where no such aid to growth of population exists. In Victoria, the total population in 1871 was 731,328; in 1881, it had increased by 130,818, the total being 862,346 The total of specified birth- places in Victoria was in 1871, 729 0.4 in 1881, 857,055. Ten years ago, the Vic- torian born population was 329,527, or 45 21 per cent, of the whole by last year it had increased to 499,199, an advance of 169,602, the percentage proportion to the whole being 58 21. Other colonies had contributed to the Victorian population as follows, according to last year's census : New South Wales, 9,826; Queensland, 1,120; South Australia, 9,928, an increase in ten years of 2,004; Western Australia, 104; Tasmania, 11,876, an increase of 2,579; New Zealand, 1338; Fiji, 95 ; Australia generally, no colony being named, 3,727, an increase of 2,087. Thus, the total Australian-born population of Victoria was in 1881 539,053, being 182,479 more than at the previous enumeration. On the other hand, the population of British birth is in every instance smaller. There were 142,906 people born in England, which is less by 21,381 than the number in 1871 and whereas in that year the proportion of English- born people to population was 22-54, last year it was only 1666. There were last year 4547 Welshmen, a falling off in numbers of 2007, and in per centage to population of from "9d to "53. Scotchmen numbered 48,153 in the census of 1881, which is 8057 less than the number returned ten years before; and the proportion to total population was 561 against 771. Irish-born citizens totalled 86,733, or a decrease of 13,735; the per centage to total population being 10 11 compared with 1378. The foreign elements of the population apart from Chinese, show very slight altera- tion in the ten years. There were small increases in the colonists owning a French, Dutch, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian, Russian, Austrian, Swiss, Italian and Spanish nationality, but the gain in no case exceeded 200\. Lobbbb had occurred in the following nationalities : Belgic, German, Portuguese, European countries unspecified, United States. The Chinese, which in 1871 numbered 17,857, in 1881 had dwindled to 11,799, a numerical decrease of 6058, the per centage proportion to the total proportion being 138 instead of 245. We have omitted to note some other minor figures, but the proportion of foreign to British subjects may be gathered from the following totals British subjects in 1871 696,674; in 1881, 833,559 increase 136,885-the proportion to population having advanced from 95 24 to 96 66 per cent. Foreign subjects in 1871, 34,854 in 1881, 28,787; a decrease of 6067, due to falling off in the Chinese population, the proportion being 3-34 per cent, against 476. Thus it will be seen that the population of Victoria has become somewhat more British in character, but notably more Australian. At present, of course, many of the Australian-born people are children, and the conduct of the daily affairs of life is shared by the adults of British and of Australian nationality. But in the process of time the British-born element, whether aided by assisted immigration or not, will dwindle to infinitesimal proportions, and Victoria will be legislated for, and marketed for, and taught and wrought for by her own Sons. It will be interesting study to watch her development in these circumstances. And with regard to the New South Wales data, we shall compare some of the particulars here touched upon with those there noted. Jauch a comparison cannot fail to be instructive. Last Saturday we commented on Sir Henry Parkes' alleged success in Canada. It seems however, from what the Herald says, that he had no special difficulties to encounter that in fact, if it is possible for a trade in wool to spring up between Canada and Australia, no Canadian duties on wool stand in the way. If there is no obstacle to remove the Premier's visit is not likely to start an inter- change of commodities which has not already been established. Our contemporary cites the general Canadian tariff, assented to on May 15, 1879 and refers to alterations, the latest of which was made on March 21 1881. Wool was, however, in the first instance, placed on the free list, and the subsequent charges did not remove it thence. In these circumstances, it is by no means clear what the Premier has done, and the suggestion is that some mistake has occurred in the message announcing the arrangement. An instance has just occurred of the operation of ordinary commercial considerations in breaking up large estates. . Land is held here for its value as an article of sale rather than for any distinction its possession confers. Consequently, when it pays the owner better to sell than to retain, he will sell his large estate will be partitioned among a number of holders, nor is it likely that a second process of aggregation will occur. Certainly, the estate " broken up" by the method of sale was not a very large one-it was the Lansdowne Estate, near Goulburn, of 700 acres, but we read that an adjoining property, Gundary, of 13,000 acres, is also to be subdivided and submitted to auction. The Lansdowne lands sold at from £67 5s. per acre for improved lots, while unimproved areas, taken principally for grazing purposes, and as depot paddocks for stock, brought an average of £32 12s 6d per acre. All through the country, in course of time, large freehold estates will be disintegrated, as the growth of population confers value upon them. And if it be said that in the process the owners will benefit at the expense of the State, and will receive the advantage of a vast unearned increment, the answer must be that it was not possible, under our land law, to interrupt the augmentation of holdings, nor very feasible in any case, granting the existence of free sale, to forbid the purchase of as many acres as a man has means to buy.
