The mansion now occupied possesses a most commanding view, and is beautifully and healthily situated ; the grounds are large, afford- ing every facility for out-door exercise, occupation, and amusement. The internal arrangements are assimilated, as far as possible, to those of a genteel private family, having no appearance of restraint or of the depressing f features that too frequently present themselves in establishments of the kind, and which very often prolong, if they do not entirely prevent the recovery of the patient. The proprietor, during his many years' experience in his establishments far the Insane at Huningham and Harbury Hall, Warwickshire, England, as well as in the colony, has invariably found that cheerfulness, occupation, and amusement, combined with judicious medical treatment, are productive of the most salutary results, and, in confirmation of this statement, gives the fal loving statistics of his treatment since the opening of his establishment in this colony, viz. 60 per cent. on the gross number of patients admitted have already been discharged, cured, several more are now here state of convalescence, and several others have been discharged so much improved as to be safe with their friends.
