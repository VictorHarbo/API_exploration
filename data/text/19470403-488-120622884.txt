PREJUDICE AGAINST FOREIGNERS . Newspaper's' excellent editorial. The following excellent editorial— ex- cellent because of the soundness of .its reasoning— appeared in Thursday's 'Sun' last week under the 'heading ofl 'Preju- . dice and the Furriner': — The complaint by a visiting Danish iournalist that Australians 'ilnn't- lilro foreigners' has probably enough of the bitter truth in 'it to give us warning. ? Hostility to newcomers is an imme morial human prejudice, but at the pres ent stage of our history it is a prejudice which! Australia can't afford. It took the people of Britain many years to overcome the old belief that 'furriners'1 are mostly infidels, scoundrels or weaklings. It is possible that even in Denmark the stranger who comes from abroad is sometimes regarded with sus picion. If Australia has inherited some of the same prejudice, the' sooner wei begin to fight it the better. .. New and faster means of air transport are daily making the globe shrink to a point where people of 'alien' countries have almost become suburban neighbors. To hug old racial animosities in such a contracted world is stupid and harmful for all of us. TKe barriers that divide the nations should be broken down as fast as distance itself is being conquered. As Australians, we- must realise the plain fact that our future depends on population, and that population depends on immigration. We must learn to forget unreasoning prejudice when we welcome migrants, ? whatever their race. For mutual under standing and appreciation are the world's ' only hope of peace'. '
