NEW YORK AND LONDON LOANS There can no longer be any doubt as to the competition, between America and Great Britain for predominance in foreign loan business. At present London has a slight lead )n tlio rivalry. Lust year it hml n Hear advantage — the total of New li'ork issues to oversea borrowers being 357 833,000 dot., against London's sterl ing equivalent of 41X,547,600 dot.— but tills year tlio American position lias been improved by several substantial issues, including two of 40,000,000 dol. 'each for tlio Dutch East Indies, a third of 27,000,000 dol. lor Argentina, nnd a fourth of 30,000,000 dol. for the Purls-Lyons-. Mediterranean Railway Company. In financing for tho British Domin- ions and colonies, London retains, of course, a long lead which there Is no reason to think it may lose. Tito two Queensland logins raised in New York since uctoDcr lust, unci <l » i«;r tuu funding loan of 100,000,000 dol. placed by Canada in tho same market six weeks ago, remain tho only important ex ceptions. A comparison of the terms for sev eral loans arranged. within the past nlno months, suggests that London will soon re-establish its old reputa tion as a market easy to negotiate in, and content with moderate profits. America is very accommodating in the financing of domestic needs, but it fre quently shows extreme caution and an exacting spirit ill . the rates and condi tions provided for in its dealings with foreign borrowers. BRADFORD TOPS The market for Bradford tops re mains firm. Sixty-fours are quoted in the latest cabled report at 58d; 5G s at 32d, and 40's prepaid at 13%d. WHITE STAR PROFITS The shipping companies that are gloomily complaining of extreme de pression in their trade cannot claim the White Star Lino as a fellow suf ferer — at least, not at present. Tho latest annual report of tho Lino shows an increase in gross profit irom £1,372,200 to £1,030,000 in tho year, and the net profit comes out at £319,000, as compared with IG7G.400 in 1920. Including £30,885 brought forward, tlio total -available was £350,445, out of which interim divi dends amounting to £750,000 were paid,: leaving £100,445 to carry for ward in tho current year's accounts. Tho company seems to tako an en tirely cheorlul view of its prospects nnd of tho shipping position as a whole. In the past twelvo months it has been carrying on a vigorous policy of overhauling and reconditioning, nnd has added, by purehaso of the Homeric, a 35,000 ton ship to its fleet. Another White Star monster is the recently commissioned Majestic,' of r.e nftft To hrlnir these two great ships into tho service when the Atlan tic traffic is being restricted by tho operation of the American immigra tion law is certainly an indication of business courage, however It may otherwise be regarded.
