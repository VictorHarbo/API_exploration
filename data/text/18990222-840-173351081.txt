Gkntlkmicn,— Tlio dissolution of Parliament has ngain placed iu your hands tho choice ot' a repre sentative. Believing that I still retain tho confidence of a majority of you, I again offer myself as a CANDIDATl'i for your suffrages ut tlio forthcoming general election. If you again do mo tho honour to oleot me, I will loyally assist to carry out tho polior us foreshadowed by tho Hon. .T. R. Dickson, and enunciated in his published manifesto. For further particulars of my views and intentions I cordially invito you to uttondmy Hcotings, which will bo bold as follow:— Loug Pocket State school, Itulooroopillv, TO-MORROW (Thursday), February 23 ; IndooroopiUy State school, Moggill road, MONDAY, February 27 ; Oxtoy Hall, TUESDAY, Fobruury 28 ; and othor places to be notified. Hoping I shall again be honoured with your coniidonce. I urn, gentlemen, Yours faithfully, SAMUEL GRIMES. rj O THE ELECTCKS OF TOOMBUL. GjBNTLlSilliJt,— At tho request of many of your number I have consented to try and win -tho seat for Toombul on behalf of the Labour Opposition, and of all opponents of tbe party at present holding the reins of power. The combination now holding tho seat of Government is practically tho same party that has controlled tho destiny of the colony since its foundation. I ask, bus tho result been satisfactory ? In apite of the fact that our wealth pro duction is ever on the increase, we have arrived at tho top of the poll as a debt-owing and tux- Miff'/ring community. In my opinion this is complete evidence of incompetency and inisinunagemout. And I think a Government selected from the Labour Opposition could have done better. I hope, therefore, to liuvo tho support of a sufficient number of my fellow-citizens to place me in a position to use (in concert with others) what ability I possess iu an honest endeavour to bring about a more satisfactory state of things. Industrial and commercial matters have perhaps to some extent recently assumed a better aspect. But this, I claim, cannot be attributed to the brilliant and honest adminis tration of the Government, but rather to the increased ability of the people of other lands to buy our surplus products, and of confidence in our wonderful resources. Tho erstwhile cry that the Labour party would destroy confidence at any rate has been confounded. I am strongly in favour of reform in our Electoral Laws, on the basis of a complete re cognition of tbe absolute right of every adult (not a lunatic or criminal) to one vote, and one vote only. And also of a more Hiinple uud effective method of clectoralregistrution. I attach great importance to making the conditions more favourable for people to settlo on tlio land ; successful land settlement being tho primary factor in all true prosperity — the conditions should be such that a lit'oon the soil will he attractive to our own sons. And in faoo of the faot that our own children shun tho life under present conditions, I am opposed to further costly attempts being made to bring the penniless unemployed of other lands here, to meet only disappointment. Expansion of our Educational system, of our Local Government legislation, the eutire exclusion of coloured aliens from tho colony, tho introduction of' tbe referendum, and some means of better conserving the public health, are all matters demanding earnest and serious consideration. I hope shortly to address you from the public platform, and put my viows.ou these and other subjects more fully before you. I urn, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, J. S. COLLINGS. jgLECTORS OF NUNDAH Gkntlkjckn, — The time bus come when you are called upon to elect a representative. Three years have passed since you conferred upon me the high honour, and I now come bofore you to seok a renewal of the trust. I have at various times appeared before you for the purposo of explaining my actions in Parliament; it is, therefore, not accessary for ine hero to refer to that matter. In now seeking re-election I do so as a supporter of the Dickson Administration, because I con sider that to be in every way tbe best for Queensland now. I accept the manifesto recently issued by Mr. Dickson. I consider it provides for such matters as will make for the prosperity of the colony. Federation is a subject of great importance, and if accom plished may mean cither much good or much mischief to Queensland. It has now reached a stage which makes it imperative that we should deal with it, and in my opiniou the only proper way in which that can be done is to submit the question to a general vote of the electors — such submission I approve. I am in favour of a judiciously vigorous works policy, particularly in the "direction of railway construction, and I shall heartily support the extension of the newly-opened liuc to Enoggera, to the fertile district about Terror's Creek, tlie duplicature ot tho line to Sandgate, and its extension to Brighton. I am very muoh iu favour of provision being mudo in the new Local Government Act for tbe better recovery of arrears of rates ou vacant lands. I consider it of first importance that energetic stops be speedily taken to improve tho Brisbano Harbour, and towards tho prevention of Hoods, which have in the past wrought so much damage. Auythiug effective accomplished in this direction must bo of benefit to the Electorate of Nuudab, so intimate are its rohitious with tho metropolis. I am in favour of a properly regulated systom of immigration, preferably the nomination system. Our great want in Queensland is population, and a steady inilow of immigrants of a good class would tend to lighten our burden of taxation und inoreuse the volume of our imports and ex ports. This will carry with . it opposition to the influx of coloured people, excepting Poly nesians, who pluy un important part in our industries. Auy properly devised legislation towards tho improvement of our agricultural industry will receive my constant hearty sup port. That industry is the mainstay of our district, aud as I am intimately conneoted with it, your interests and my owu are identical. I shall take an early opportunity of publicly addressiug you on these and other matters, iu various centres in tho electorate, of which due notice will be given.— I have tho honour to be, gentlemen, yours obediently, THOMAS BRIDGES. rjlO THE ELECTORS NORTH BRISBANE. I MOST RESPECTFULLY OFFER MY SELF AS A CANDIDATE FOR YOUR SUFFRAGES XT THB BALLOT BOX OF PUBLIO OPINION. My Name and Individuality bear a great reputation, and give tno the opportunity of defeating all intending Candidates. After you have made my acquaintance, and criticised mo as to tho qualities £ possess, you will have no compuncti.on in giving me your hearty support, and place me at tho TOP OF THE POLL, AND BY SO DOING WITH MY AS SURANCE I WILL NEVER ALTER IN QUALITY. You will not only benefit yourselves indi vidually, but establish a worthy example' that will bo followed by the whole of the smoking community of Queensland. GIVE ME A PLUMPER.

I, the undersigned, hereby notify that I have this day received from his Exocllonoy tlio Governor a WRIT of ELECTION, com manding me to proceod to the Election of a Member of the' Legislative Assembly of Queensland, for the Electoral Distriot of BULIMBA. I further notify that SATURDAY, the Fourth day of Maroh next, having been ap pointed the day, and Bulimba tho place, of Nomination of Candidates, I will bo in atten dance at the School of Arts, Balmoral, be tween the hours of 12 o'olook uoon and 4 o'olock p.m. on FRIDAY, tho Third day of March next, being the day noxt preceding the day of nomination, for the purpose of Receiving tho NOMINATION PAPERS of CANDIDATES, and that I will, at 12 o'olock noon on the following day, at the same pluce, publicly declare tho names of the Candidates who may be nominated ; and further, that, in tho event of tho Election beiug contested, a POLL will be taken at the followiug Polling Places, on SATURDAY, the Eleventh day of March noxt, commencing at 8 o'clock in the forenoon, and finally clos ing at 5 o'olock in the ufternoon of the same day. POLLING PLACES: Brisbane, Bulimba, Bulwer (Moreton Islaud), Capalaba, Clevelaud, Coorparoo, Hemmant, Junction of Clevelaud and Lytton roads, Mount Gravatt, Wellington Point, Wynnum, Yerouga. Dated at Brisbane, this Sixteenth day of February, 1899. G. V. HELLIGAR, Deputy Returning- officer. mo THE ELECTORS OF FORTITUDE JL VALLEY. Gentlemen, — In response to the Wishes of many Electors, who are desirous that I should Represent them in the new Parliament, I have much pleasure in Placing my Services at Your Disposal, and request your Support and Votes, to return mo as one of your Members. LOCAL INTEREST. My long residence amongst you has made me a Valley man, and the greatest portion of my property is also in your electorate, it is therefore reasonable that I should do my best for your district, as woll as for tbe whole of Queensland. FLOOD PREVENTION Is a matter that concerns your part of tho City very much. I think that the only effective scheme would be an overflow channel opened from a point near Goodna, leading tho flood waters away out from the river, and discharging into the bay somewhere beyond Wellington Point. I do not approve of making an immense inland lake or dam in the upper part of the river as ut present proposed by engineers, because there is danger in a dam breaking loose in flood time. HARBOUR TRUST. Tbe whole question of control of tbe river should be in the hands of a Harbour Trust, and they ought to have full power to raise an annual rate for their requirements, and also receive a handsome endowment. PROTECTION. I think that Queensland requires some moderate protective duties like the present customs tariff, otherwise our markets would be flooded out with goods mode in cheap labour countries— and our own workmon thrown idle from that cause. CAPITAL AND LABOUR Are indispensable to each other, and should nevor fall out. All their dispntos ought to be referred to a Court of « CONCILIATION JUSTICES, whose award should be final, and obtained at merely nominal costs. IMMIGRATION. I am desirous of seeing a steady stream of immigrants arrive here, not as labourers, but us farmers and enterprising men, more or less capitalists, who would push themselves for ward in the openings thoy would find in mining, grazing, growing sugar-cane, &c.; Both town and country will benefit by the presence of such a class. FEDERATION. Federation is sure to oome in the near future, but I trust that tho interests of Queensland will be carefully preserved. Our chief trouble will be with froetrade New South Wales and protectionist Victoria. EDUCATION. The Stato school system is very efficient, but I think that children who are taught in private or deuomiuatioual schools should be eligible to wiu scholarships if they can pass tbe examination the same as Stato 6chool scholars are required to pass. UNIVERSITY. I wish to see a university established so as to enable our young rneu to obtain here what at present tlicy have to go abroad for. COLOURED LABOUR. The time is coming when coloured labour will not be so urgently required as at prcsout, because the cane plantations are beiug rented by small fanners, who grow the euhe, and sell it to the mills to tlio benofit of both parties. LAND SETTLEMENT. Every facility should be given to people de sirous of settling on the land. ELECTORAL REFORM. In every electorate there should bo a place, say at a police statiou, where forms could be obtained, filled in, and then forwarded by the police to the Principal Registrar. FREEDOM OF CONTRACT. I am in favour of everyouo in tho com munity beiug free to carry on business, to employ, or be employed, without any party daring to intcrfero with them. It is our British birthright, and I hope to seo it main tained. PRESENT GOVERNMENT. As a liberal'Conservative, I am disposed to support the present party in power. Their views are souud, aud their expressed inten tion is to do tho best thoy can for Queens land. If I am elected I shall do my best to endeavour to realise your highest ideas of good government for the country we live in. £ am, gentlemen, Yours fuithfully, J. WATSON. IMPORTANT NOTICE.
