INTRODUCTION. "The, past month has been a remarkably quiet one. There is scarcely any politi- cal news, and pending the dissolution of Parliament, candidates for seats in the next Assembly do not seem to be in any particular hurry to declare themselves. Their reticence is no doubt to be ac- counted for by the fact that the earlier they announce themselves the greater in all probability will be the cost of their contest. It is now understood that Par- liament will be dissolved the first week in March, that the writs for the elec- tions will be issued as quickly as possible, and the new Parliament will assemble during the first week in May. Some time ago it was announced that the Government of New South Wales intended to do all that lay in its power to increase the commerce of that colony by abolishing the ad valorem duties and thus greatly simplifying the fiscal policy of the country. A measure carrying this in- tention into effect passed both Houses of Parliament, and came into operation on the first of the present month. One of the consequences of this action upon the part of the sister colony is, that the Go- vernment of Victoria have found it neces- sary to abandon tho border treaty entered into in June last for the free transit of the goods and manufactures of each colony across the Murray. With Sydney virtually a free port, it was pretty evident that the requirements of Riverina would be supplied from there instead of from Melbourne, and indeed there is every probability that were the treaty continued, the Sydney merchants would successfully compete with those of Vic- toria in Victorian territory. The Go- vernment have taken, action under the sixth clause of the convention, which pro- vides that, notwithstanding the treaty entered into, "it shall be optional for New South Wales or Victoria, on the Legis- lature of either colony passing any measure altering the customs or excise duties at present in force in such colony, to retire from this agreement on giving 30 days' notice of its intention so to retire." It will be remembered that the annual sum of £54,500 which it was settled should be paid by Victoria to New South Wales, was estimated as the balance which would be due to the sister colony on the impor- tations and exportations of each colony across the border. Under the new tariff of New South Wales, however, the pro- bability is that the balance would be all the other way, and therefore, if the ar- rangement were continued, not only would New South Wales take away our trade, but Victoria would pay her for so doing. The necessary notice was given on the 1st inst. What rendered it more particularly necessary that the Victorian Government should act promptly in the matter, was the fact that a large American film had started a to- bacco manufactory in Sydney, and that preparations were being made to swamp Victoria with their goods. This, of course, would have seriously interfered with the revenue of this colony. Such an occurrence was foreseen when the treaty was entered into, and provision was made whereby upon giving ninety days' notice no tobacco manufac- tured in New South Wales would be admitted in Victoria except in bond or upon payment of the duty levied in this colony upon similar goods. This notice was given a short time since, but it was found that before it could take effect the mischief would be done, for although the Premier of New South Wales assured Mr. Francis-the Chief Secretary of Vic- toria-that there was no occasion for alarm, as no unusual quantity of tobacco was leaving or was likely to leave Sydney, it was found that on the 17th of December several waggon loads of this article was despatched to a Melbourne firm, and on the 21st inst. 10 tons crossed the Murray and arrived at Wodonga. With re- ference to this matter the following telegrams have passed between the authorities of the two colonies : " Sydney, Jan. 21.-It is reported to this Government that the Customs officers of Victoria have seized a quantity of tobacco, exported from this colony across theMurray at Albury, under the provisions of the Border Duties Convention. We feel, however, that this act of illegality has been committed without the know- ledge of the Government. (Signed) COLONIAL SECRETARY." The Chief Secretary of this colony replied on the following day in these terms :-"Mel- bourne, Jan. 22.-To the Colonial Secre- tary, Sydney.--I am instructed that no tobacco had, as you informed me yester- day, been seized or stopped after crossing the border. Therefore your, correspondent must have been moved by his own apprehensions. But I am advised by the Commissioner of Cus- toms that a large quantity-over 10 tons -of manufactured tobacco has been de- tained this morning at Wodonga, pending proof of legality of importation and of duty having been paid, when, where, and by whom, inasmuch as you informed this Government there was no quantity of such article coming this route, and that very little was ever intended to cross the border.-J. G. FRANCIS, Jan. 22, 1874."' The tobacco in question has come on to Melbourne in custody of the Customs authorities, who are awaiting further information from the Government of New South Wales. A large quantity of tobacco is upon the road, and great efforts will be made to cross it into Victoria before the determination of the treaty, which takes place on the 30th inst. The revenue returns of the colony for the year and quarter ending the 31st of December last are of the most satisfac- tory character. The revenue for the year amounted to £3,902,024 0s. 4d., and that for the quarter to £987,771 18s. 4d. Comparing these returns with those for the corresponding periods of the pre- ceding year, it will be found that there is a comparative increase on the year of £137,112 12s. 3d., and on the quarter of £92,456 11s. 3d., the income for the two period, being respectively £3,704,911 14s. Id., and £895,315 7s. Id. SOCIAL. ïfli Excellency the Governor loft liol bourne on the 3rd inst. for Hobart TOAVII, on a short visit to Mr. Du Cane, Governor of Tasmania. His Excellency, who appears to have greatly enjoyed his visit, returned to Mclbounio on tlio 23rd hist., in excellent health. Mr. A\ "d, Governor of AVestom Austialin. lias been visiting this colony. Ho was a passenger by the last mail steamer norn King George's Sound, and remained here until last Satin day, when he left for fi e .*,. H18 Excellency inspected most of we public institutions of impoi tunee in Mel. fi"i'ime' Pnd Paid a visit to the Ballarat gold iicitis, where lie was cordially received, m» i^8 tlle co^P'etion of the new Govern inent-rjouse. temporary provision has been made for the accommodation of His Ex oellcncy the Governor. The lease of the Í», 4Yov«Tracnt._iouso at Toorak falls in _iLbo 31st, March, and as favonrablo «¡mis cannot hematíe with the proprietor for the renewal of the tenancy, the Government have taken Beleura-house, Schnapper Point (Mr. C. Bright's establishment), for six months, as a temporary residence for His Excellency. The Bishop of Melbourne is about to leaveforEngland, and when Bishops court is vacated, it is understood that His Excellency-will take up'hiB residence there. The R.M.S.S. Ellora, bringing an extra mail from Europe, arrived in Hobson's Bay on the 5th inst. after a somewhat protracted passage, the result of unfavourable weather. The Ellora will remain in these waters. Her principal business for the future will be the conveyance of the mails between Melbourne and Sydney, and in the intervals the regular passenger traffic between the two ports will furnish her with occupation. The H.M.C.S. Victoria, Staff-CommanderH. J. Stanley, R.N., recently made a cruise in the vicinity of Wilson's Promontory and the Gipps Land Lakes, with the Chief Secretary, the Commissioner of Customs, the Treasurer, the Minister of MineB, and some members of Parliament, partly with the, view of in- specting the works at the entrance to the lakes, &c;, and partly to examine into the truth of the report forwarded by the Chief Secretary of Tasmania, to the effect that four mon, Victorian citizens, had been left upon an island near Curtis Island, in the month of June, with the understanding that they were to be picked up at Christmas. This island, described as lying to tue south- eastward of Curtis Islana, was examined from the ship at closo quarters and on all sides, and proved to be a barren mass of granite, perpendicular upon all sides, with only one place upon which a landing could be effected, and from which there was no access to the higher part of the island. Moreover, the island is not a seal island, so that there could be no inducement to men to camp upon such an inhospitable place, and that at the wrong season of the year, so that the whole story appears to be a fabrica tion. The inventor, who is now in prison, probably hoped to be let out himself to insti- tute a search. In order to make more sure that there was no truth in the report, Curtis Island itself was approached closely, but here also there were no signa of anybody being or having been on the island. The results of the Matriculation and Civil Service Examinations, which were held in the Melbourne Town-hall in December, have been made known. Out of the 390 can. didates 122 passed tho matriculation, and 214 the civil service examination. Four passed the former with credit, two of the candidates who attained this distinction being daughters of Professor Hearn. One of these young ladies is to be congratulated on having passed an examination which has seldom been surpassed. She passed in all in nine subjects, and with credit in six, including Greek. In all, eight ladies passed the matri dilation examination, and 14 or 15 the civil service. It is anticipated that the Castlemaine and Maryborough Railway will be opened for traffic by the end of March, and that the Dunolly section will be completed about two months later. This portion of the line is in an ad- vanced state. The first sod of the last sec- tion of the Ballarat and Maryborough line will most probably be turned by the Commis- sioner of Railways early next month. Mr. Higinbotham, the engineer-in-chief, will proceed to Europe very shortly at the request of the Government to inspect the principal lines of railway now constructed, and to make himself acquainted with the latest improvements which have been introduced in railway engineering, and the construc- tion of carriages, &c.; He has not applied for leave of absence, but was asked by the Go vernment to pay the visit of inspection, as it was thought that the interests of the public would be benefited by his doing so. He will leave Melbourne by the March Cali- fornian mail, and will visit America, Eng- land, and the Continent before he returns, He will be absent about a year, It is not yet decided who will act as his deputy. It will be necessary when Parliament meets to pass a short act empowering the acting-engineer, in-chief to certify to Government con- tracts, &c.; A number of important reforms are being introduced into the administration of the Lands department by the Minister of Lands. In order to give some relief to the assistant commissioner of Lands, who is at present quite over-weighted, Mr. Casey has resolved to create a separate blanch, callod the Occu pation Branch. It will deal with everything relating to the settlement and alionation of the lands. Mr. H. Byron Moore, the assistant surveyor-general, will have charge of this branch. The survey branch of the depart. ment has long been in an inefficient condi- tion, and a radical change is to be made in it. Mr. A. C. Allen, late district surveyor at Ararat, will be promoted to the position of inspector-general of surveys, and he will also be entrusted with the preparation of the maps. The surveyor-general will thus be relieved of a great portion of his profes- sional work, and will be enabled to devote himself to the administrative duties which have obiefly occupied him for some years past. The business of the department will be divided into five branches, which will be presided over by Mr. Hodgkinson, Mr. Skene, Mr. Moore, Mr. Allen, and Mr. Monah, Recently anumber of pastoral and selectors' licences were forfeited in the Wimmera dis- trict, as penalties for dummyism, and it is now announced that three pastoral licences and 15 licences of selectors in the Benalla district are liable to forfeiture on similar grounds. On the 5th February reasons against the forfeiture of these licences will be publicly heard by the Minister of Lands. The names of the runs and pastoral licen sees aro as follows :-Tallygaroopna, Frank Grey Smith : Taminick, Evan Evans ; Seven Creeks, Michael Elliott. The report of Dr. Thuddicum upon samples of Victorian wines forwarded to him from the International Exhibition by Mr. G. C. Levey, has excited much unfavourable comment, and Mr. Levey has not escaped censure. Apart from the question of the lituess for the task of Dr. Thuddicum, it was certainly a great mistake on tho part of Mr. Lovey to permit those remnants of the exhibits to bo analysed at all. The majority were wines of a delicate character, and their ?exposure upright in the building for seve- ral months was a test to which they should not have been subjected. The fact of the strongest haning stood the test serves to confirm the impression that the others suffered injury by exposure. Moreover, it seems certain that samples examined were not the wines they were supposed to bo. Dr. Thuddicum, for example, reports very unfa- vourably upon a sample of red wine "bur- gundy" said to have been exhibited by the Hon. J. G. Francis. Now all the exhibits sent home were chosen by a committee of experts appointed in Melbourne by the Royal commission. The report of the commission states that the wines exhibited in Melbourne by Mr. Francis weie chasselas, gouais, ver deilho, mataro, and two vintages of hermi- tage. There was no bm gundy amongst them. Five of the wines sent by Mr. Fiancis to the exhibition in Melbourne weie selected to be sent to the London exhibition, and four to both London snd Vienna. Mr. Francis was also awarded a silver modal for his wines by the Victorian commission. It is evident that some error must have oc- curred in this case, and very probablyin many others. In connexion with this question the fact has been made public that some time since an application on the part of Dr. Thuddicum was made to the Victorian Go- vernment to the offect that he should be paid a fee of £200 for ícporliiig on the wines of Victoria, and this offer was declined by the Chief Secretary, in a letter addicssed to the agent- geneial, bearing date the 28th of March hist. The caisson for the Alfred Graving Dock, which has just been completed by tho Langlands Foundiy Company at a cost of about "15,000, was being placed in position last week, when owing to the shifting of the ballast, it lurched over and sank. It is ex- pected, however, that it will bo raised without much difficulty. The caisson has not yet been handed over to the Public Works department, and the arrangements connected with it aro left entirely under tho control of tho contractors. Before it is handed over every compartment will have to be thoroughly tested and proved water- tight. It is anticipated that the dock will bo ready for use in about a month. II.M.C.S. Nelson will bo the first vessel to enter. Mr. Thomas niginbotham, the engineer in.chief of railways, will procoed to Europe very Bhortly at the request of the Govern- ment, to inspect the principal lines of railway now constructed, and to make himself ac qnointed with the latest improvements which havo been introduced in railway engineering, and the construction of carriages, kc. He will leave Melbourne by the March Cali- fornian mail, and will visit America, Eng- land, and the Continent beforo he returns. He will he absent about a year. It has been determined to establish an agricultural college at the Terricks, and the Secretary of Agriculture has gone up to the Loddon district to select the 1,000 acres it is intended to reservo as the site. As soon as he has pegged out what be considers the best land the reserve will be proclaimed. Captain AV. H. Snee, of the nead-quarters Staff, who went home some l8 months since to study the latest improvements in gunnery, returned by the mail steamer Pera, which also brought Judge Forbes and several re- turned colonists. It is understood in legal circles that Judge Forbes will not resumo his judicial duties, or that, if ho does so, it will only be for a short time. Judge Skinner is likely to remain on the Western Circuit, and Judge Bunny will not bo removed from the Castlemaine district. The Central Board of Health has caused the publication of some interesting facts respecting the disease of leprosy as it exists in this colony. The total number of known cases is 15, Avhile in January 18G6 there were 31 persons suffering from the disease. The decrease in the number of cases seems to have been due to mortality amongst the sufferers, no cures having been effected ; but on the other hand, no instance has occurred in which the disease has been communicated by contagion, although at Castlemaine lepers have during the last 10 years been admitted to the public hospital. It should be observed that all the lepers in the colony are Chinese, Avho brought the disease with them from their native country. No European has ever been attacked with leprosy in Victoria. In the opinion of the board there is no danger whatever to be apprehended from coming into contact with lepers, and the board has resolved to communicate with the various hospitals and beneA-olcnt asylums, pointing out the nou-contagiousncss of the disease, and the claims which tho few unfortunate lepers still remaining in the colony have upon the charitable institutions. The Hoads and Bridges department are pushing forward the plans for the road and railway bridge that is to bo thrown across the Murray, between Echuca and Moama, to connect the colonies of Victoria and New South AVales. When completed, the plans AA'ill be forwarded to Sydney for the approval of the New South Wales Government. The bridgo will bo built at the joint expense of the two colonies. The screw steamer Otago, which has been recently purchased by Messrs. M'Mockan and Blackwood for tho New Zealand trade, made a trial trip to the Heads on Friday to test her engines and boilers. She has been enlarged and greatly improved by her new owners, and may almost bo termed a new vessel. The engines were found to work admirably, and the rate of speed maintained throughout the trip was very satisfactory. A large party of gentlemen were on boord as the guests of the firm. On Monday the foundation-stone of a new building, to take the place of the old wooden erection which is now the local habitation of the trades' socioties, was laid by Mr. Cur- tain, M.L.A. for North Melbourne, on the ground granted long ago to the trades, at the corner of Victoria and Lygon streets, Carlton. The front portion of the building, which will be first completed, will face Victoria-street, having a frontage to that thoroughfare of 72ft, and a frontage to Lygon-street of 43ft. It will be -10ft. high, and there Avili be a ground and upper floor. The style of architecture' will be simple Italian. Behind this building, and built in the same style as tho rest, on the side ex- posed to Lygon-street will be a large hall, about 100ft. by 50ft. Avith various smaller rooms, but this portion of the design will not be carried out yet. The portion to be gone on with Avili contain on the ground floor a library, committee'rooms, &c.; On the upper floor-trade societies' meeting room, and other rooms for meetings. The cost is estimated at £3,000, and the additional cost of adding the great hall, &c;, and finishing the design AYIII be £-.,000. At a general meeting of the Pastoral Chamber of ¡Riverina, held in Melbourne on the 14th inst., a report was submitted in which the following observations wero made respecting the loss of weight on wool whon sola in London :-" Several of the morabors of the chamber who hod rocently returned from England represented tho great laxity of supervision as regards tho woighing. On inquiry it was found that the important duty of weighing the wool on landing and on delivery after sale was entirely left to the dock company and Avarehouse-keeper, and that tho merchants to whom the wool was consigned did not even have a clerk present at the weighing to protect the interests of the wool-grower. It was a well-known fact that wool gained in weight while in warehouse ; it was therefore desirable that the wool should be reAveiguod aftor sale, but this reform was strongly resisted, as being against custom. It waB evident that all the warehouse-keeper looked to AVBB to make up tho landing weight or dock weight, and of course it was impos- sible to say what became of the surplus weight. But all representations on tho loss in weight, as also on tho other prac- tices which had been remonstrated against, wero necessarily disregarded, as thoy wero made without the Bupport of united action." The report Avas adopted, but no action was taken upon it. The president of the chamber, Mr. AV. A. Brodribb, Avas re elected, although he expressed a wish to retire. It AVOS resolved that the next annual meeting should be held in Melbourne on tho second Wednesday in January. The annual meetings of the leading Charit table institutions of Melbourne have been held during the month. A good deal of dis- satisfaction has recently been expressed re- garding the management of tho Melbourne Hospital. The committee and resident medical officers have not been working well together, and the consequence has been that complaints of neglect on the part of the latter have been frequent. The subject was alluded to at the annual mooting by Sir Janies M'Culloch, who took the chair. ¡However, Sir James was able lo say, from recent personal inspection, that the Melbourne Hospital was, on the whole, conducted as well as any of the similar institutions in London. The chairman also took notico of tho fact that the private contributions to tho hospital funds had considerably increased during the year Avhich had just expired. As showing the importance of this charity, it may be stated that the number of cases treated dur- ing the year was 25,300. Of these 3,720 had been admitted to the Avards of the hospital, and 21,040 had received medical and surgical assistance as out-patients and casualties. Of tho patients treated in the in- stitution, 2,857 had been discharged cured or relieved, 531 had died, and 338 remained in the hospital at the close of tho year. An attempt to introduce the homojopathic system into tho hospital was discountenanced by the meeting. Mr. T. J. Crouch moved a resolu- tion with tho view of giving effect to the proposal, but by a large majority it was resolved that the consideration of the subject should be postponed uutil the olection of the medical stall in 1875. At the annual meet- ing of the Benevolent Asylum, at which his Honour Sir Kedmond Barry presided, the report and balance-sheet showed that the institution had been conducted very satis- factorily during the past year, excepting the fact that the committee had been obliged to refuse a large number of deserving cases through want oE room. The report and balance-sheet were adopted, and a motion I was also carried for the formation of an endowment fund from legacies, bequests, and special gifts. The annual meeting of the Blina Asylum was held on Monday, and from the rcpoit presented by the committee it appeared that the affairs of the institution were being satisfactorily conducted. The Medical Society of Victoria held ils annual meeting on the 14th inst, Avhon Mr. M'Gillivray, late resident surgeon of the Sandhurst Hospital, was elected president for the ensuing year. Tho retiring president, Dr. Fetherston, read an addreBS, m which he revieAved the year's transactions of tho society, and offered some reflective observa- tions on the leading medical topics of tho day. He congratulated the society on its continued advancement, mentioning that the list of members now numbered 107, of whom 19 had joined during tho past year. A melancholy case of drowning occurred on Saturday. A woman named Mary M'Gib bon jumped off Prince'a-bridge into the River Yarra, at 5 o'clock in the.morning, and threo men put off in a boat to save her. The boat upset, and a young man named Wade was drowned. The others and the woman were saved by two other boats. While the s.s. GreatBritain was at Brisbane, whither she had gone with a batch of Govern- ment immigrants, her surgeon, Dr. Puddi combe, died suddenly. Ho was seized with a lit, continued insensible, and in a few hours expired. Arthur Harding Walters, the manager of several mining companies at Castlemaine, who lately absconded after embezzling a con- siderable amount of shareholders' money, has been arrested in New Zealand and brought back to this colony. Ho waa last week brought up at the Castlemaine Police Court on three separate charges-first, of embezzjing from tho Devonshire Reef Gold mining Company ; second, of embezzling from the Lewis s Amalgamated Sebastopol Reef Gold-mining Company ; and, third,- of conspiring with John Russell Webb to cheat and defraud the Devonshire Company. Webb, who had been a clerk in the employment of Walters, was also before the Court. By ar. rangement, all the cases were adjourned until Friday, bail being allowed. A medical man named Cooper has been committed for trial for perjury at Rokewood, under peculiar circumstances. At an inquest held some time previously on the body of a man named Owen Flynn, at Grassy Gully, the defendant, who had made a iwst mortem examination of the body, swore that the cause of death was fatty degeneration of the heait. It transpired, however, that the deceased shortly before his death had had a fight or scuffle with a man named Guinane, and suspicion being aroused, the police exhumed the body, and got a second medical man, Dr. Foster, to examine it. Dr. Foster could not find any fatty degeneration of the heart, hut made the discovery that there was a large clot of blood on the brain, caused by injury to the skull. A serious stabbing case occurred on board the R.M. steamer Ellora, one night soon after her arrival, and while she was along- side the Sandridge Railway Pier. The vessel was to sail early in the morning for Sydney, and the previous evening most of the crew had been ashore. Everything was quiet onboaid till about midnight, when, without any preliminary disturbance, and apparently with no provocation of any kind, one of the sailors-a Spaniard named Joseph Martinas-drew his sheath knife and attacked several of his shipmates who were in the fore- castle. Three Manillamen were the victims of this brutal frenzy, two of them escaping with comparatively slight wounds, but the third was very seriously injured. MartinaB took advantage of the confusion which en- sued to hide himself, and it was not till nearly i o'clock that lie was found by the police, secreted in the jolly-boat, hanging to the davits, the vessel having been several times previously searched in vain. He was at once secured. The three men were re- moved to the Melbourne Hospital. One of them, Philip Flores, was found to be suffer- ing so seriously from a stab in his left loin, that his depositions were taken in the pre- sence of the prisoner. Flores is still in a rather critical condition, but is expected to recover. THE POLITICAL SITUATION. Parliament being in recess, and many of the Ministers away holiday-making, there is little to record in the way of political events. In consequence of the great change lecently made in the tariff of Now South Wales by the abolition of advalorem and other duties, the Government of Victoria have deemed it necessary to terminate the Border Customs Treaty between the two colonies. The treaty will cease to exist on the last day of the pre- sent month. As soon as the treaty ceases to operate the drawback system will bo extended to the Murray. Some additional places have been proclaimed as ports on the border. It is understood that Parliament will be dissolved in the first week in March, and that the elections will take place so as to allow of the assembling of the new Parlia- ment upon the first or second Tuesday in May. _ THE ELECTORAL ROLLS. Tho official returns showing the number of electors for tho Legislativo Council and Assembly on the rolls for ^873.4, as compared with tho number on the rolls for 1872-3, have boen compiled. The net result of the changes which have taken place in the various divisions of the electorates is, that the voters for tho Council have increased in number from 22,586 in 1872-3 to 23,736 in 1873-4, a gain of 1,160, while tho numbers of tho electors for the Assembly have in- creased from 128,071 to 142,305, a difference of 14,234.

THE REVENUE. The revenuo returns for the quarter and year ending 31st December are of a satisfactory character. As will bo seen fiom the figures given below, theio has been an increase upon almost ovory item of revenuo. The revenuo for the year amounted to £3,902,024, and that for tho quaiter to £387,771, showing an increase on the couesponding periods of 1872 of £92,456 for tho quarter and £137,112 for the year.

The provisional arrangement by which non-vested schools Avhich came under the 10th clause of the Education Act received aid from tho'state expired at the end of the year. Some time since a circular was sent out by the Education department to the committees of non-vested schools in locali- ties where there Avere no state schools, offer- ing them the alternative of loosing thoir school-buildings to the state, or of receiving a capitation payment under the provision in the 10th clause. Replies havo been re- ceived in nearly all the instances of a satisfactory kind. In the majority of cases the committees have agreed to lcaso thoir school buildings to tho state, tho proviso in some cases, however, ' being insertod in the leases, that the buildings may bo used by the particular denomination ior Sunday school purposes on the Sunday. This condi- tion Avas roforred to the local boards of advice, and on their recommendation was agreed to as the denominations could obtain no other buildings for their purposes, tho facts being that in somo instances tlio build- ings weio used as churches. Nearly all the Roman Catholic schools have come under the capitation clause, but this arrangement will be only of a temporary natuio until stato school buildings can be erected. The erection of stato school buildings is being proceeded with as rapidly as pos- sible. A series of neAV legulations under the Kdu. cation Act havo been issued. The salaries of teachers aro fixed according to a scale varying from £80, whoro the averago attond. ance is boloAv 20, to £130 Avhere tho averago attendance is not less than 75, but under 100, Avitb £10 added for each incroaso of 25 in the averago attendance of scholars up to 350, after Avhich tho increase is £10 for each ad. dition of CO to the averago attendance. Tho maximum payment Avhich any teacher can obtain by way of results will bo an amount equal to one-half of his fixed salary. There will bo annual examinations, at which every pupil teacher will be expected to advance at least one class, and thoso who undergo two such examinations Avithout promotion Avili be Hablo to dismissal. There is to bo a head training school in Melbourne, and dis trict training schools, not exceeding 20 in number, in various parts of the colony. Stu- dentships Avili bo aAvarded to candidates of approved characlor, and exhibiting special promise as teachers. Students will be provided with board and lodging free of cost. The course of instruction in the train- ing institution will bo free, and will oxtend over two years. For adm.ssion to the first year's course of training candidates must bo recommended by an inspector, and must bo either first-class pupil teachers, matriculated Btudents at tho University, or persons who have passed the literary examination for a licence to teach. A material alteration will probably be made shortly in the regulations relating to the teaching of ''extra" subjects by state school-teachers. It is likely that school- masters will bo allowed greater freedom in making their own arrangements with parents and guardians in respect to the fees to be charged for instruction in some or all of these subjects. The Minister of Instruction is favourable to singing being included amongst the list of free subjects, and form- ing part of the regular school curriculum, and an arrangement has been made pend- ing the sanction of Parliament to effect this object. _ GOLD AND THE GOLD-FIELDS. The past year has scarcely been such a I prosperous one for those interested in the gold-mining industry as its predecossor. In tho Ballarat district everything continues remarkably dull, and although the mines are being worked with most commendable per- severance, the returns for some time past have been comparatively small. Very great activity still prevails upon the Sandhurst gold-iield ; large sums of money continue to be invested there, and good returns are constantly being obtained. There has also been a considerable improvement lately at Mount Blackwood and at Pleasant Creek. The average number, of miners employed upon the gold-fields during 1872 was 54,059, and for the past year D2,541, or 2,107 less than during 1872. For the laBt eight years there has been a constant decrease in the number of men engaged in gold mining. This de- crease is in a great measure owing to the largely-increased uso of machinery, and also to the fact that many of tho diggers who were mining by themselves in old work- ings, and earning only a baro subsistence, have cither selected land and aro culti- vating it, or else have betaken them- selves to some other moro lucrative pursuits. The following table givos the averago number of miners employed, and tho quan- tity of gold produced for tho last eight years: Year. Number of Miners. Yield of Gold. 1808 73,470 oz. 1,630,581 1807 06,867 1,493,881 1808 03,181 1,474,187 1809 68,037 1,307,903 1870 00,307 1,281,841 1871 68,101 1,803,879 1872 64,051 1,317,102 1873 62,544 1,219,407 From thiB statement it will bo seen that the yield of gold for the past year has fallen con siderably short of that for the previous and preceding years. The comparative deficiency is greater than was at first anticipated. Up to last year there has, since 1870, been a steady increase in the annual produco of our gold-mines ; but the returns tor tho twolve month ending the 31st of December last are over 30,0000z. less than thoBe for 1870, and fall short of the yield for 1872 by 67,G95oz. The total amount of gold exported during last year was l,249,909oz., of which l,115,987oz. was tho produce of Victoria, and 133,922oz. the produce of other colonies, principally of New Zealand. During the year there were received at the Melbourno Mint 221,870oz.. but of this quantity 9G,G53oz. came from othor colonies, leaving only 125,217oz. of Victorian gold received tor coinage. ThiB would give tho gross yield of our mines for the year at l,24l,204o_. ; but on the 31st December, 1872, the banks held 196,943oz., and on the 31st of December last only 101,705oz., showing a balance against the year of 95,23Boz., which, deducted from what appears to bo the gross yield, would reduce the net produco to l,145,9GGoz. To this must bo added 103,441oz, which, though shipped by the lnst mail, was entered for oxport beforo the end of the year, and this brings the total yield for the year up to l,249,407oz,, or G7,695oz. less than that for 1872. The falling off has principally occurred in tho alluvial mines, and it is somewhat remarkable that during the year just closed there have beon no discoveries of any importance in this branch of raining. It would almost soom that for the future we must be principally dependent for our gold upon tho yield from quartz reefs. The aggregate mining dividends for tho past year are considerably less than for the year 1872, though still larger than for any other previous year. The following table shows the mining dividends for tho past three years, distinguishing quartz from allu vial : Year. Quartz Mines. Alluvial Mines. Total Milling Dividends. 1871.. 1872.. 1878.. £ 090,335 889,081 841,850 £ 241,085 180,254 118,905 £ 932,000 1,009,335 900,324 It will ho seen that the dividends for last year wore nearly £100,000 less than those for 1872, and that tho falling off was principally upon tho alluvial mines. The districts from which last year's divi- dends were derived, rank as follow in order of amount distributed, viz. ¡-Sandhurst, £517,37-1 ; Pleasant Crook, £121,897 ; Gipps Land, £88,575 ; Clunes, £54,481 : Mary borough, £53,100 ; Smthesdale, £43,002 ; Cas- tlemaine, £9,353:-Daylesford, £23,310 ¡ Bal- larat, £20,851 ; Blackwood, £G,562 ; Wood's Point, £5,500 ; Diamond Creek, £3,750 ; Cres wick, AC20 ; Blight, £2,500 ; Lauriston, £2,010 ; Beechworth, £2,4G8 ; Dunolly, £1,650 ; Steiglitz, £700 ; Majorca, £115. Amongst the largest amounts paid by individual companies are the following six, all of which are from quartz-mineB :-Great Extended Hustler's, £107,100; North Cross Roof, £70,500; Long Tunnel, £72,000 ; Johnson's, £G3,700 ; New North Clunes, £53,464 ; and Goldon Fleece, £4G,000. Although tho yield of gold has fallen off, thcro is- dividing tho produce amongst the numbor of men employed very littlo difference in their average in- dividual earnings. In 18G0, the value of each miner's earnings, judging from the gross icsults, and calculating the gold at £1 an ounce, was 31s. per week: in 1807i35s.; in 1868, 36s.; in 1869, a trillo leBS than 31s.; in 1870, a fraction moro than 32s. per week ; in 1871, about 34s. Gd. per week ; m 1872, a small fraction over 37s. per week, and in 1873, rather more than 36s. Gd. per week. Blackwood still gives obundont ground to hope that it will prove what has moro than once boen predicted of it, a first- class quartz gold-field, the latest discovery, that of a gold bearing reef in the Eldorado mino, being presumed to havo all the appearance of a permanent payable lode, and to prove the extent to which the reefs there aro ramified through the country. Creswick is expected to, make a better show soon, and to prove the continuation of the loads already worked away to a long distance from their sources. At Clunes mining matters were dull, owing to a serious quarrel between the Lothair Mining Compony and the Clunes Miners' Association, but this has now boon brought to a termination, concessions having been mado on both sideB. In Ballarat East quartz-mining goes on and progresses steadily, tho yields for the last fort- night from those mines that havo crushed being eminently satisfactory, if not ex- traordinarily rich. Of tho Ballarat proper alluvial mines there is not much to bo Bnid. A rumour is current that there is evei y appearance of a speedy and great im movementin the Winter s Frchold prospects, but the official reports say nothing about it, although the shares arc rising in the market. The Hand and Band Company are pushing forward their works fast, and are moro favourably Bpokon of; and thcro is also a probability of Borne improvement in the Golden Reef mine. From Lauriston news has been received that the North Energetic Company had struck a large body of rich stone at the 90ft. level. This reef lins produced such large quantities of gold that any new discovery on the line may be of groat importance. Thcro is also good news to hand from the Elaine district, relativo to the discovery of alluvial gold in tho locality where it was expected to ho found, and where what may bo called fruitless search had already boen made for it. From the information now to hand, it is cortain that rich washdirt has been struck, equal to at least an ounce to the loud, but as to the extent of it,[that must romain a mystery until the miners follow it up. It is not oven known as yet whether it is a gutter or not. At Stockyard Creek the Prospectors' Com- pany has declared a first dividond of Gd. per share, amounting to £800. The Golden Bar tributers are getting up some rich stone, in which coarse gold can bo seen freely. None of the claims on theBennison-flat are getting payablo gold, except Wilson's, ana as a number of shafts havo been bottomed with, out finding cold, the minors are getting dis. couragcd. The Bennison Company had their first washing to-day. Only about half a machino .vas puddled, and it yielded very little. The following rovisedscalo of charges at tho Melbourne Mint has come into forco with tho new year:-"1. On parcels containing less than l.OOOoz. standard at tho rate of Cd. per ounce (standard), 2. On undividedparcols containing not less than l.OOOoz. standard (to bo melted and assayed in one lot), at the rate of 3d. per oz. (standard). AU fino silver over and abovo 2 per cent, (instead of only that in oxcoss of 4 per cent as fixed by order in Council of 12th June, 1872) contained in rofinablo gold will bo paid for at the rate of 5s. nor ounce. Tho charge for issue of gold bullion (regulation i of 12th Juno, 1872) will remain unaltered." AGRICULTURE. - During the past month ono of tho sharpest droughts tho colony has experienced has been ended by the occurrence of a heavy fall of rain. Previous to the 12th inst., tho dato of the change, tho boat had boen genorally oppressive ; ' the atmosphere for days to. gether had been intensely clear, and whon cloudy Aveather occurred in turn, it afforded no relief to tho parched up vegetation. In our last monthly report mention was mado of the probable effect of the hot woather upon some of the later wheats ; the oarlior cro£B Avere at that time considered safe, and to u certain extent the expectation bas been verified. The threshing machine boa since shown that even in some of tho earliest localities tho yield of Avheat has been much roduced by the pro* longed absence of rain boforo harvest. Neither on the Goulburn nor on tho Loddon have the results boen good. Tho grain wos dry and shotty, perfectly fit for tho mill, but the quantity is short, and in somo districts losses havo occurred in carting, owing to tha excessive diyneBS of the grain. On ttie Mur. ch¡8on the following yields havo been real« iscd, viz., whoat, 17¿ bushels por aero ; oats, 23 ; wheat, 19 bushols ; oats, 29 ; wheat, 15 bushels ; wheat, barley, and oats, 22 bushels. Occasionally a small patch of fallowed ground has yielded a fine return ; thus from 10 acres of such land 400 bushels of oats were taken, whilst only six bushels per aero wero reaped from virgin Boil that had not been falloAvcd. In tho district of Dean, a cool one, the results of threshing havo been disappointing, but about Creswick some good yields arc reported. At Mount Pleasant, crops that were expected to turn out 38 bushels havo not given more than half, vvhilo some of tho adjacent districts havo fared worse. On the Richardson, and in certain Íiarts of the AYimmcra, especially whoro tho and Avas bearing ita second crop, some very fino yields have have been obtaiuod, and from that country such yields may be ex. pected for several years, tho climnto being gencially favourablo for wheat. Some ot tho German farmers vvho carno from South Australia, and Avho have settled in tho last jnontioncd districts, havo shown what may be done there both in growing and harvest- ing wheat ; they have stripped crops yiolding 38 ouBhels por aero, at tho rate of 20 acres per day, and at a cost of 12a. per nero ; to do this 10 horses had to be usod alternately. Mon who have used tho strippers havo got their crops safely housed, but those in the same locality who reaped have had their crops damagodi by the rains. At Kyneton and at Lancefield tho quality is better than usual. A month hence, perhaps, a guesB may be hazarded at tho average yield, but tho approximate statistics published by the Govornmont do not usually maleo thoir appearanco until April or May. The rise of woollen manufac. turo has led to the growing of teazles both in the neighbourhood of Geolong and of Mel. bourne. Flax has been grown in various localities ona small scale, but mechanism, it is considered in South Australia, must bo employed to pull it, the price of labour being too high. A machine intended to Bolvo tho difficulty has boen tried before a committee of tho Adolaido Chamber of Manufactures ; but the second trial WOB not as satisfactory as the first, and tho field is still considered open to invontors. Tho fino rains havo re- newed tho growth of tho grasses in all parts of Australia, and have relieved for the pre. sent the anxioty of stockownors. MEAT-PRESERVING. A mooting of persons interested in tho question of meat-preserving was held at Scott's Hotel, on the Cth inst., to test somo meat preserved by the process patonted by Mr. Lconi. The advantages claimod for this process are, that whole carcases as well as joints can be preserved. No expensive plant is required, and the cost of boiling machino, y, tinning, &c;" boing avoided. Sevoral trial shipments of meat preserved by Mr. Leoni'a process hos been mado with ovory BUCCOSS. A boiled leg of mutton, that had beon pre* served for very nearly six months, AVUS brought from the kitchen, and on boing tasted was found to be quite sound, though neither tho texture nor the flaA'our was such as to multo it equal to fresh meat. It was stated by Mr. It. P. Negus, the agent for the inventor, that the carcases of 20,000 sheep per week could easily be prcsorved at a cost of Is. per head-a rate that would givo a handsomo profit. No return had been received of the meat sent to England, but highly satisfactory reporta had been given of that used on board tho mail steamer Banga- lore on her trip to India in September last. After somo discussion, tho meeting dis. perscd without coming to a decision as to forming a company to work the patent in Victoria. THE LABOUR MARKET. Tho principal feature in the labour market at presont is tho unprecedented dearth of female house servants. Tho rate of wages quoted is nominally, the same as it has boon for some months past; but houso servants are not to bo obtained in sufficient number to satisfy the demand at any prico that Avould bo offered. Any servant girl, on on. toring one of tho registry offices, has at onco the pick of a hundred situations, tho em- ployers being only too glad to obtain a servant of any description to bo particular as to qualifications. The number of persons willing to undertake the duties of houso servante is daily decreasing, and as tho native-born girls invariably prefer half tho wages at any occupation whoreby thoy would retain their liberty, the prospect for housekeepers in the future is anything but a hopeful one. Tho clothing factories aro all in full woik, and are likely to bo BO for several months to come. At this business, young Avomcn can carn just enough to livo on and dress, having their ovenings at their OAvn disposal. Tho fascination of thiB life is so great that it is no uncommon thing for houso servants to leave comfortablo situa, tiona where they wero earning high Avogos, to work at a Bevving-machino, at a rate of remuneration that would barely support them. In the building trades businesB is easier, but owing to the Government work going on at present, the men aro pretty fairly employed. The rates of wages, however, aro now steady at 10s. per day in Molbourno ; on the outHkirtB of the suburbs tho mon demand a higher rate. In most branchos of trado thoro is good employment for compe- tent tradesmen. The rates paid for country labour havo come within moro reasonable limits as tho hat veBt proceeded, and a still further reduction may bo looked for soon. The labourei s employed on tho Government raihvay pier at A\ .lliamstown have struck for an inórense of wages, and their demand has been acceded to.

MIE ALL-ENGLAND ELEVEN. The English cricketers havo had rather a . busy time of it. A few days after tho ter- mination of their first match-that with the Victorian Eighteen-in which they wero beaten in one innings, thoy went to Ballarat to play against tho District Twenty-two, the local men having the valuable aid of Allan and Cosstick as bowlers. .There was a splendid turf to play on, and the ground being unusually small, the batBinen had much tho best of it. Tho largest scores over made in the colony were got on this occasion. Tho Eleven mado tho enormous total of 470 runs. W. G. Grace contributed 120, and his brother 112 ; but both batsmen gave several chances, which wero missed by the fiold. Oscrof t, i un out, was next with G5, and Green wood was «edited with G2. The local playois also made an unusually high score-276. W. H. Figgis got 53 and Watson 33. 'The match was a draw, as tho players had only time for an innings each. The Ballarat men aro not satisfied with tho result, and aro ondeavour ïng to arrango for another match. The Eloven next went to tho mining township of Stawell, where they wero treated to a ground which no batsman could approve. Tho Eloven went in with the foregone con- clusion that thoy could do nothing on the bumpy wicket. They wero disposed of in their first innings for 43, and only made 91 in thoir second, enabling the Twenty-two, assisted by Cosstick, B. B. Cooper, Conway, and Wills to win, with 10 wickets to spare. W, G. Grace's scores were 14 and 10\. A good deal of coaching adventure over baa roads brought the Eleven to Warrnambool, where they scored their first victorj'i the Twenty-two being beaten with nine wickets to fall,' though' assisted by Allan, Conway, and* "Wills. W. G. Grace made l8 on this occasion. The first innings' score of his team was 104, of which Jupp contributed 58 and not out. The English- men are now in Sydney, where they have again been overmatched. The New South AVales Eighteen beat them, with eight wickets to spare. There is a very pronounced tail to the English team, and it is con- sidered that it will be easily vanquished in the return match Avith the Victorian Eighteen. The English cricketers have not made themselves as popular as the members of H. H. Stephensons and George Parr's teams, and many stories of internal dissen- sions, ko., have been circulated to account for their defeats. The explanation should rather be looked for in the improved colonial cricket, _ and tho presence of at least three players in Mr. Grace's team who are not up to AH England eleven form. RACING. The New Year's Day meeting of the Vic- toria Racing Club was by far the most suc- cessful midsummer meeting ever held on the Melbourne course. The weather was beauti- fully fine, the heat of the sun being tempered by a pleasantly cool breeze from the south. The grand stand was very well patronised, the number of ladies present being very large. The arrangements made by the com mittee of the club were most successful. A great change was noticed in one important department-the luncheon provided by Mr 'Gunsler waa very much superior to anything of the sort that has been done on this course for some years past. The committee have seen the mistake they made in ignoring the representatives of the press, and now every convenience is afforded the reporters for giving a full account of the racing. The days' sport commenced with the Hurdle Race, which was Avon by W. F. in goodi-tyle. Maori was second and Brolga third. The Sylvia colt won the handicap for three year-olds. Lapidist was second and Atalanta third. The Two-year-old Stakes wa3 won by Blink Bonny, who fairly outpaced the field. The Hook was second, and Explosion a poor third. Stockbridge, the faA'ourite, was a bad fourth. The Midsummer Handicap was carried off by Little Dick, The Arrow being second, and Blue Peter third. The Steeple, chase was won by Momalong, this being the first Victory Mr. G. Watson has scored on ,the Melbourne course for a long time. Adonis was second, and Rocket third. Morris fell at the double in front of the stand, and hurt Harding hadly. Don Juan Avon the Canterbury Stakes, after a good finish with the Sylvia colt. Lapidist waa a poor third. The Plate of £100 was won by Constance, Latona being second, and Tooth picker third. The annual race meeting of the AVilliams town club took place on the 3rd inst. . The attendance was veiy fair, and the racing better than it generally is at country meet- ings. The programme commenced Avith the Maiden Plate, Avhich was won by Ella, a handsome sister to Dagworth. Benjiroo won the WilliamstoAvn Handicap, King Tom being second, and NeAvbold third. Blue Peter, who was much fancied, never showed in front during any part of the race. The Hurdle Race was won easily by Ulysses. Thirteen others started. Ella Avon the Werribee Park Handicap Avith the greatest ease. Constance was a bad second, and Victorian third. The Selling Flat Race was won by Prince, and Constance won the Consolation Stake. The Ballarat Miners' Races were held on the 13th inst. The attendance was much better than it usually is at this meeting, and though the animals engaged were of medium quality there was a very good day's sport. The Selling Hurdle Race was won by Titbit, beating six others. Only three horses started for tho Trotting Race, which was won by John Brown. Tho Miners" Handicap was won by Jack Sprat ; five others started. The Selling Steeplechase was won by Clansman. Prince won the Selling Flat Race, and Jack Sprat the Corner Handicap. On the 19fch inst., Mr. T. J. Ryan's stud of racehorses wero sold by public auction at Kirk's Bazaar. The attendance was good, and though there was not much excitement shown in the biddings, the prices realised were fair. The Ace, five years old, by Ace of Clubs, out of Gwendoline, waa bought by Mr. G. Pyers, of the Wimmera, for 875 guineas.1 Kingfisher, six years, by Skyscraper, was bought by Mr. J. Morrison tor 200 guineas. Leo, four years, by Leonidas, out of Ranee, was bought for the stud by Mr. T. Oddie, of Chepstowe, the price being 360 guineas. Lancer, five years, by Leonidas, out of SuBan (imported), was picked up cheap by Mr. Wm. Winch, for 250 guineas. The colt, two years, by Kingston out of Persiani, by Sir Hercules out ot the imported Persiani, was purchased by Mr. G. Pyers for G00guineas. Brigantine, four years, by Lucifer, was knocked down to Mr. W. Yuille for 100 guineas, and Rosalie, three years, by Peter Wilkins, was bought by Mr. W. P. Bowes for 140 guineas. A hack called Tho Swell was purchased by Mr. J. .Vagner for C1 guineas. The stud realised the sum of 2,570 guineas. Mr. T. J. Ryan will be missed from our turf. His colours were always favourite ones Avith the public, and his horses ever went to win. After the sale of Mr. Ryan's stud, Mr. Dakin's horses Fugleman and Protos were disposed of, the Eurchaser being Mr. H. Power. Fugleman rouglit 150 guineas, and Protos ISO guineas. The imported siro Yelverton was sold at tho same time at the very lovv price of 70 guineas. ' _ THEATRES. Tho pantomime "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," has had a most successful run at the Theatre Royal. In spite of the heat and closeness of the weather, the house has been crowded every evening. The pantomime "AustraliaFelix," at the Prince of Wales Theatre, has also met with considerable success, though the attendance has never been so large as at the Theatre Royal. On the 22nd inst. Mr. Garnet Walch, the author of the pantomime, took his benefit, and received the compliment of a good house. MUSIC. During the last month, with two most no- table exceptions, there has not been much doing in the Avay of music. The Melbourne Philharmonic Society have held their annual meeting, and the report submitted shoAved the affairs of the society in a satisfactory condition. They havo nowput Mendelssohn's "Elijah" in rehearsal, for performance on Good Friday night. After this concert it is understood that Mr. David Lee, for many years conductor to the society-a very capable conductor and good organist-will go for a 12 months' tour in Europe and America. By fcho latest advices from Bombay it appears that Madame Arabella Goddard had been prevented by ill-health from giving a single concert since she loft Mel- bourne. She had left Ceylon Avithout per- forming once. On arriving at Madras she bad to bo sent on to Bangalore, where two concerts were advertised to be given on the 11th and 12th December. Mrs. Smythe and Signor Susini accompany Madame Arabella Goddard as vocalists, It is not known here if these concerts took place as advertised. Tho near approach of the opera season 1874 has sot people hore on the qui vive, and a few days since the resident director of the opera company, Mr. AV. S. Lyster, furnished us with somo information concerning the noAv prima donna, who is to arrive hore about tho 11th March next. Siguora Pal. mieri was horn in London in 1872, has re- ceived an entirely Italian training, made her deb (it in Leghorn in 18G2, and since then has played at the Scala, Milan, three seasons ; tho Carlo Fénico, in Genoa ; the Vittorio Emanuelo, in Turin ; the Teatro Regio, in the sumo placo ; the Pergola, in Florence ; the San Carlo, at Naples, for throe seasons ; the Opera-house, in Trieste ; the Teatro Bel- lini, in Palermo ; the Theatre de la Monnaie, in Brussels, and at La Fénico, at Venice. The war put an end to an engagement made to sing at Les Italiens in Paris, and it was after this that she was ongaged for the third time at the San Carlo, in Naples. In addi- tion to Signora Palmiori, the strength of the present company will be further increased by the arrival, by the same steamer, of Signora Persiani, Signora Magi, Signora Baldassare, and Siçnor Baldassare. The new opera season, it is expected, will commence on tho 10th March. A very ingenious instrument of French invention has lately been Bhovvn hero by Mr. Haselmayer, a conjuror. It is called the " Pianista," and upon being sup- plied with pioperly-preparcd booka of music and adjusted to the key-board of a piano- forte, it is made to play correctly by simply turning a handle. On the 22nd and 24th of the month, Mademoisollo Jenny Claus, a young lady \\*iolir_ist, of very superior talent, gave her farewell concerta at the Town hall. She was assisted" by Mr. Buddee, Mr. Montague, and Monsieur Rekel, in- strumentalists: and by Signora Tamburini Coy, Miss Christian, and Mr. Armes Beaumont, vocalists. There was » largo attendance, on each occasion. Tartini's " Sonate du Diable," Mendelssohn's Trio in D minor, and tho Kreutzer Sonata of Beetho- ven, were the noteworthy performances at these entertainments. The Claus and Rekel Company go from hence to New Zealand. The Metropolitan Liedertafel gave their first entertainment for this year on the evening of the 26th. Most of the members of the Italian Opera Company, who have been in Austialia for the last three years, aro at pre- sent in Tasmania. HANDBALL. \- The old-fashioned sport of handball has been brought prominently before the public during the past month. An intercolonial match has been held between three of the best players of New South Wales and three Victorians. The former were the winners, but the play of the Victorians showed that it was only want of condition that lost them the match. A great deal of interest has been excited in this manly game, and a club has been formed with every prospect of success. THE VOLUNTEERS. . Everything is very quiet in volunteer circles, and will bo until preparations are commenced for the Easter campaign. THE WEATHER. During the month the weather has been extremely variable. The great heat that at one time threatened the destruction of all vegetation has broken up, and several fine rains have fallen, which have completely altered the appearance of the country and besides done an immense amount of good by putting out the bush fires that were burning in many parts of the country. Since the rain set in there hos been a prevalence of southerly winds, and on many occasions the nights have been almost cold. The highest temperaturein theshade, 93'8, wasrecorded on the afternoon of the 20th ; the lowest, 49-8 on the early morning of the 22nd ; the highest reading of the barometer, 39'051in. occuired on the morning of the 23rd, with light S.S.E. breezes; the lowest, 29'720in., on the evening of the 20th, with moderate northerly wind. Rain fell to the amount of 0'03in., making the total rainfall since the beginning of the year 214in., aa compared with 0'96m during the same period in 1873, 3-29 in 1872;2'17 lu 1871,1"43 in 1870, 0'54 in 1869, 2-11 in 1868, 0'70 in 18G7, 0'53 in 1806, 016 in 1805, 1'93 in 1864, 1-50 in 1863, T25 in 1802, 2'24 in 1861, 1'29 in 18G0, 1-53 in 1859, 0'88 in 1858, or an average of 1-82111." NOTES FROM THE SEA. "The immigrant ship Surat, Captain John- son, from London to New Zealand, waa wrecked on the Otago coast on December 31. About 10 o'clock the previous night she struck on a submerged rock 10 miles north of the Dog light, but after a aevere bumping got off. She was very leaky after this, and was hove to all night, all banda being kept at the pumps. Next morning the vessel was anchored in a little bay. near Catlin's River, and some of the passengers were landed. Soon after it was found that the vessel was sinking, and the cablea were slipped and the ship run ashore in Catlin's Bay. The re- mainder of the passengers were landed, and all the crew, with the exception of the first mate and two men, who wero taken off the ship next day, went ashore. Nothing was saved except a little bedding. The chief part of the cargo consisted of railway iron and plant for the Kiakoura Woollen Factory. The accounts of how the Surat struck, how she came to be so close in shore, and the subsequent events on board aro most conflicting. It appears, however, from a report pnblished in the Otago Times, that the wind was moderate at the time, and blowing off the land, and that only half an hour before the vessel bumped on the rocks, the captain and one of the cabin passengers (Mr. Booth) had ascertained what was sup- posed to be the ship's exact position, and marked it off on the chart. At noon on the 31st inst. the ship was in lat. 47° 34' south, long. 167° 27' east. Dog Island was sighted at 2 p.m.; at 8 p.m. the course steered by standard compass was N.E. by E., half E., .Dog Island bearing W. by N, 20 miles. The ship was under plain sail, and the yards cheeked about a point and a half or two points. At a quarter-past 9 the ship struck on the Brothers and got off. The pumps were sounded, and it was found that the vessel had only mado four inches of water for the first hour. At half-past 11 it was found that the water had suddenly in- creased to 20in. At midnight there were 4ft. of water in the hold, and the ship was run for Bloody Jack's Island. The starboard anchor was let go in seven fathoms, but it was observed that the ship was settling down, and nothing was left to he dono but to land the passengers. Very few of them managed to get ashore with more than the clothes they had on, and the majority of them were in bed when the vessel struck : and when the confusion began, a few had barely clothes to cover them. In landing, some of them ran a great risk of losing their lives, and most of them reached the shore cold, wet, and miserable. Nearly all the passengers' statements are to the effect that after the Surat struck, and before she was beached, there was con- siderable confusion and disorder on board. AttemptB on the part of the passengers to signal the passing steamer Wanganui were stopped, revolvers were produced, and ?violence threatened. The water gained, not- withstanding the working of the pumps in- cessantly by the crew and passengers, includ- ing the mairled women and girls, all of whom took their turn at the work. When it was determined to beach the vessel, and tho boats were lowered, the men behaved most creditably, according to the accounts wc have heard. The women and children and the old men were all put in the boats befoie the other men followed, and except in the case of one woman there were no accidents. The French warship Vire brought the shipwrecked immigrants to Port Chalmers on January 4. They were lodged in the banacks, where Sir James Fergusson, Governor of New Zealand, visited thom. The wreck and cargo of the Surat have been sold for £7,050. If the weather continues fine, most of the cargo will probably be saved. A committee had been formed at Dunedin for the relief of the immigrants. The sum of £G62 has been collected for distribution among the sufferers. The losses of the pas- sengers are £2,500. One man had 2G4 sove- reigns in a box. i The passengers' luggage and effects were sold with the wreck, not- withstanding the protest of Bome of tho pas- senger. An official inquiry was held into the loss of the ship. The evidence showed that the captain and the officers (with one exception) wero diunk. Tho Government intends taking legal proceedings against the captain for selling the passengers' luggage with the vessel, notwithstanding the protest of the passengers. The Marj- Ann, schooner, 160 tons, Cap- tain Stephens, was lost off tho Clarence Heads, New South WaleB, on January 4. She struck on a sandbar, and became a total wreck. Her crew wero saved. The schooner Alice Jane, from Maryborough to Noumea with timber, has been wrecked off Port Hacking. The brig Rose of Australia, from Melbourne, was totally wrecked in Wreck Bay, but the crew wero saved. The Clarence and Richmond River Company's steamer Diamantina was wrecked inside Port Mac- quarie bar on January 22. Sho was beached after striking the rocks. RECENT DEATHS. MB. W. J. T. CLARKE. Mr. William John Turner Clarke, whose name has been almost a household word with Victorian colonists for many years past, as the richest man in Australia, died at his resi- dence, Rosemeath, Essendon, on the 13th inst., in the 73rd year of his ago. For the last four years Mr. Clarke's health had been in a very critical condition, and his death had been long anticipated. Mr. Clarke was bom at Bridgewater, in Somersetshire, England ; and at the age of 29 emigrated to Tasmania, where he arrived about the year 1830. Ho went out to that colony with the intention of following farming pursuits, and took with him, amongst other proporty, some valuable live stock, including several well- bred cuttle andborscB. Aftersomemoreorlessprosperous years in Tasmania, Mr. Clarke made his first venture in Victoria, and about 34 years ago he took up the Station Peak run in the Werribee district, in partnership with the late Mr. W. II. Pettett and a Mr. Francis, who was shortly afterwards killed by an insane shepherd. Not finding sufficient scope for his operations there, he purchased the Woodlands Station, in the Wimmera dis- trict, now the property of Wilson Brothers. Subsequently to his purchase of the Wood- lands Station, he obtained under a special survey some 30,000 acres of land at Bulla Bulla, near Sunbury. Most of Mr. Clarke's Victoiian ventures prospered, and gradu« ally he grew to be a very wealthy man. Several of the best business stands in Mel- bourne belonged to bira, and he owned pro- perty in eveiy direction. He held land in almost every one of the Australian colonies. He bought the property of the Messrs. Fisher at Mount Schanck, in the Mount Gam- bier district, South Australia, where he carried on a fine grazing business, and he was also the possessor of the Chalmers' Moa Flat Station and other properties in New Zealand. Ile continued all through to hold considerable property in Tasmania, and had a permanent establishment about four miles from Hobart Town. His freehold property in Victoria alone, in addition to that obtained under the special survey, amounted to over 100,000 acres, which ho had purchased from time to time. His pro- perty, landed and personal, was estimated at his death to be worth from £2,000,000 to £3,000,000. Mr. Clarke was for a number of years a member of the Victorian Legis- lature. On the inauguration of responsible government, he was returned to the Legis- lative Council as one of the representatives of the South Province. This seat he retaiued until 1800, when, business calling him to Eng- land, he tendered his resignation. In Septem- ber, 1862, a vacancy occurred in the represen- tation of the same constituency. The candi- dates were Mr. Clarke and Dr. Enabling, and the former was elected by a majority of 639 to 202. For many years Mr. Clarke's health had not been good, and he was consequently unable to attend very regularly to his Parlia- mentary duties. Continued indisposition obliged him in October, 1865, to ask for leave of absence from the Legislative Council ; and his indisposition continuing, he finally, on the 7th November, 1870, re- signed his seat, Mr. Clarke never took a leading part in political or commercial aftairs, but he was for several years vice chairman of the Australasian Insurance Company, and recently goA-ornor of the Colonial Bank of Australasia. His family consists of three sons, AVilliam John Clarke, of Sunbury ; Thomas B. Clarke, of Quorn hall, Tasmania ; and Joseph" Clarke, also of Tasmania. Jilt. AVILLIAM IlOBEnTSOÎÎ, OP COLAC. . By the death of Mr, AVilliam Robertson, of Colac, Avho expired at his residence at Colac on the 18th inst. at the ripe age of 75 years, the colony loses one of the founders of its fortunes. AVhen a young man ho vvas at- tracted by the offers of land on easy terms, and the assistance of convict labour, made by the Colonial Offico to induce emigrants with capital to locate themselves in Van Diemen s Land, and the result was that he and his brother John accepted those offers, and, in 1822, arrived in the sister colony. His brothers, Daniel and James, subse- quently followed his example. AVilliam's first step was to select 2,500 acres of land in the neighbourhood of Campbelltown, where they remained in partnership until 1831, when they decided to sell their property, which they had made valuable. They then entered into business in Hobart Town, by which they profited exceedingly, varying their occupations by farming a small estate they purchased near Melton Mowbray. Mr. Robertson was amongst those who contri- buted the cost of Batman's voyage, the object which was to get a large slice of the newly discovered territory of Port Phillip. There is no need to repeat the well-known story of the first settlement of Victoria. Suffice it that Colonel Arthur, in Tasmania, and Sir Richard Bourke, in New South AVales, de- clared Batman's treaty with the natives invalid; that Batman's partners eventually abandoned their claim, under which Mr. AV. Robertson and his associate asserted a right to the whole Geelong district and half the Indented neads, and that they subsequently got a certain amount of compensation. Mr. Robertson shortly afterwards crossed the Straits and visited tho country of his adop- tion. On this occasion during his travels ho first saiv the Warrion country, and the richly.grassed plains to the west of Colac. Here ho settled, and bought 7,000 acres at auction. About this time he also became the owner of 7,000 acres near Bolinda, on the Deep Creek, now part of the famous Sunbury estate. In 1843 he purchased the run of Captain Foster Fyans, together with his stock, even then cele biated for ita high quality. He also bought several other adjoining runs, and forthwith devoted his main attention to his Colac property., Subsequently he purchased 34,000 acres of splendid land on his runs, and by buying the best bulls and cows that could be got in the colonies, and importing purely bred Herefords and Durhams from home, lie secured to himself the possession of stock unsurpassed in A'aluo in Victoria. It is to his lasting credit that, eager as he was to get land, he never unfairly availed himself of any of the, facilities afforded by the various land acts, but always bought at open auction, .Vhilo carrying on this enormous business Mr. Robertson chiefly resided in Tasmania, but some 10 years ago, after a prolonged viBit home, he decided to establish himself AA'holly here. This he did in good style by building a house on his estate, where, in 1867, he had the honour of entertaining H.R.H. the Duke of Edin- burgh. Although he took no part in politics in Victoria, he had much to do with political life .in Tasmania, and was among the leaders of the anti- transportation movement. He has left a family of four sons and two daughters- the latter both married. The eldeat son, John, was educated in England, and underwent training in the Agricultural College of Cirencester. The second son, AVilliam, is a barriater, a B, A. of Oxford, and represents Polwarth and Grenville hi the Legislative Assembly. While at college ho enjoyed the honour of being the first Aus. tralian who pulled in an Oxford University eight. The thud son, George, also graduated at Oxford, and distinguished himself in the cricket field as one of the Oxford eleven. The fourth son, James, was at Rugby. The deceased gentleman was always a man of great activity, and so great was his sympathy with manly sports that not a month since he sent aw ay his son George from what proA'ed to be his deathbed to play for the honour of the colony with the Eighteen of A'ictoria against the All-England Eleven. Mr. JAMES ELLIS. The obituary of the month includes Mr. James Ellis, late proprietor of Cremorne- gardens, London and Melbourne. The de- ceased's career was singularly checkered. Five and twenty years ago Mr. Ellis was the presiding genius of the Cremorne-gardens in London, and achieved great celebrity among those who thronged to that favourite place of amusement. Reverses came, and 1852 found him in Melbourne, and again a caterer for the public pleasure. In this capacity he was connected with the cele- brated institution known in those wonderful times as the Salle de Valentino, where during a certain period the musical entertainments were conducted on an almost unexampled scale of excellence, and where, too, ho succeeded in acclimatising bals marqués after the London mode. His heart was, however, bent upon creating in Melbourne a pleasure garden corresponding to those with which be had been connected at home, and eventually lie succeeded in establishing "Cremorne-gardens," on the site now occu- pied by Mr. Harcourt's private lunatic asylum. It was surprising how much his industry and energy led him to accomplish in this direc- tion, how well the gardens Avore laid out, how creditable the decorations, and how ex- cellent the arrangements. For a Avhile the place was very popular, andagreatpoint of at- traction to pleasure-seekers, butit wa8difficult of access, there were then no railways in the colony, and eventually the speculation failed, although a line of "gondola" steamers was established on the Upper Yarra for the purpose of promoting passenger traffic in this direction. During later years Mr. Ellis was favourably known in Melbourne as a refresh- ment caterer, and nothing ever done in that line has surpassed his performances in connexion with the Intercolonial Exhibition of 1866. DEATUS IN TnE HOSPITALS. The following are list3 of the deaths (ex- clusive of natives) that have taken place in the Melbourne and Alfred Hospitals since our last summary, specifying as far as they aro known the names of the deceased persons, their ages, places of birth, dates of arrival in (he colony, the names of the vessels in Avhich they arrived, and the causes of death : MELBOURNE H0SHTAL, Arnold, Ellen, aged 38, native of Ireland ; arrived in 1861 by the Victoria ; died January 23, of phthisis.

Parliament re-assembled after the Christ mas recess on January 13, and has been princi- pally engaged since in discussing a series of motions relating to the action taken by the Government with respect to certain charges preferred by the Goulburn volunteers againat Captain Rossi, their commanding officer. A section of the Assembly was very indignant at the way in which the Government dealt with the matter, and desired that the Governor should dismiss Captain Rossi. The matter was partly debated liefore the recess in connexion with the report of a select committee which had inquired into the cir- cumstances of the dispute. On the re- assembling of Parliament, Mr. Parkes moved that the report of the select com- mittee be rescinded. A very irregular and acrimonious debate ensued, but the Go- vernment has been victorious. The com- mission appointed by tho Governor to inquire into the case has recommended the removal of Captain Rossi from the command of the Goulburn volunteers. The only other matter of importance which has engaged the attention of the Legislature has been a proposal to abolish the duty on gold. The Government admitted favouring the motion, but wished to defer taking action until the results of the late reduction of duties was known. Eventually, the previous question was carried by a majority of one. The revenue returns for the auarter and the year have just been published, andaré satisfactory. The year's income is moro than half a million in excess of the previous year, and it has amounted altogether to £3,330,000. The remarkable feature, however, in the returns is the very large contribution made by land sales towards the revenue. The gross landa revenue last year exceeded the grosa customs revenue, and it furnished fully one third of the whole revenue. This result ia very largely due to the eager desire of the squatters to secure the freehold of the best parts of their runs. The determination of Victoria to terminate the Border Treaty is not regarded with much interest in New South Wales, excepting by the Riverina settlers. The California Mail Company are ex- periencing some difficulty in carrying out their contract- strictly. The steamer Macgregor was a day and a half longer on her trip to Fiji than she ought to have been, and'the Mikado did not turn up in time to carry the mails this month. Her place has been supplied by the City of Melbourne-a colonial boat. The Mikado arrived in Sydney on the 24th, and is pronounced a superior boat to the Macgregor. At the luncheon given in connexion with the annual race meeting of the Tattersalls Club, His Excellency Sir Hercules Robinson defended horseracing, which, -when properly carried out, appeared to him one of the most legitimate sports in which men of means could indulge. His remarks have been criticised in some circles, but the great ma- jority of colonists applaud them heartily. The people of Sydney have been much in- convenienced by a strike among the cabmen. It terminated after a week's duration, huton such terms that it is feared the questions in dispute will again crop up. The ironworkers have been also on strike, this time because the masters insisted on only one meal during working hours. The mon ultimately suc- cumbed, because public opinion was adverse to their demands. The seamen are agitating for the eight-hours system. The shipowners assert that if these demands are insisted on, tliey will have to send to the East for coloured seamen. Dr. Vaughan, the new Roman Catholic coadjutor archbishop of Sydney, has on several occasions publicly announced his design of maishalling all the spiritual forces at his command to contend against tho modern idea of national education. In an address delivered to the members of the Christian Doctrine Confraternity of St. Mary's District, Sydney, his Lordship said : -" No index points more infallibly to a nation's tendencies than the system it adopts of religious and secular education. When its education ia essentially Christian- leavened in all its branches with Christianity-a nation is advancing on the road of progress, civilisation, and salvation ; when its Chris- tianity is divorced from its teaching, and is tlnust on one side to shift for itself, or, at all events, is mado to hold a merely secon- dai}- or subordinate position, a nation, whether it wills it or no, must inevitably drift in the direction of religious an- archy and political decay." In another address the archbishop stated that many men, disgusted with the errors of Anglicanism, and distrusting a church that wns falling to pieces, were turning back to tlie great teachers of the faith, and he in- stanced the names of Dr. Manning and Dr. Newman. Some of the utterances of Dr. Vaughan have occasioned considerable ex- citement. The Protestant bishop of Sydney has publicly denied that the influence of the Anglican Church was on the decline, and has intimated that, " If there is to be a war, his watchword, and that of those who were with him, would be ' Ready, aye ready.' " A most extraordinary case of buBhranging has occurred near Goulburn. A Mr. James Slocoinbe was stuck-up by an armed bush- ranger, who tied him to a tree, and blind- folded him. After robbing him of his watch and purse, the fellow deliberately commenced to cut his victim's throat. Finding himself wounded, Mr. Slocombe struggled so vio- lently that he broke the cords by which he was tied, and ran for his life. The robber fired two shots at him, one of which would have entered his hip had it not first Btruck a pocket-book in his tail coat pocket. A man named Hawthorn lias since been arrested for the outrage. He admits the robbery, but denies having attempted to commit mur< dor. Three Communist prisoners havo reached Sydney. Thoy were stowaways in the Egmont, on her last voyage from Noumea. Two other convictB from Noumea escaped to Brisbane in an open boat. The police have declined to interfere with them. H.M.S. Basilisk is in Sydney. She arrived from Levuka on January 6. She has been engaged for some months in perfecting surveys in the coral seas. She will be docked immediately, as she struck a reef at Levuka, and injured her bottom. She will after- wards resume her survey of the Now Guinea coast. A fresh expedition to New Guinea is talked of in Sydney. The foundation-stone of the Goulburn Anglican Cathedral has been laid. The metropolitan (Dr. Barber) and three other bishops assisted at the ceremony. £826 was collected on the occasion. A daring robbery has been committed at theSydnoy Museum. A case containing about £400 worth of unique gold specimens was adroitly opened during visiting hours, and the contents abstracted. The Botany water has been analysed by Professor Smith, with a result which shows that while that supplied from the Lachlan Swamp is still pure, that which is pumped from Botany is by no means so good as it used tobe. In quality, therefore, as well as quantity, the main supply to Sydney is now clearly defective. SOUTH AUSTRALIA. The revenue for 1873 exceeded by nearly £200,000 the estimates of receipts formed some 12 months ago. The total incomo, exclusive of a sum raised upon Treasury bills, is £936,851, whereas the estimate was £749,000. The Customs yielded £360,000, instead of £200,000, as estimated ; railways and tramways, £155,000, instead of £117,000 ; and telegraphs, £75,000, in place of £50,000. It is calculated that the Tieaatuer will begin tho year with a credit balance of at least £125,000. Immigration from the mother country has now been regularly resumed. Tho Earl of Dalhousie, the first of what it is hoped will be a long line of immigrant ships, has arrived at Port Adelaide with 385 passengers on board. Of these the great majority are adults, able to enter at once upon the task of bread- winning. There is not much harvest- ing work left for them to do, but they Avili experience no difficulty in obtaining employ- ment. The rapidly-increasing importance of Port Adelaide as an entrepôt for shipping has directed attention to the necessity of facili- tating tho navigation of Gulf St. Vincent. It is probable that additional lighthouses will be erected. The mail steamer Ellora, on her last trip, incurred some riBk of running on the Brighton rocks through mistaking the Glenelg light, which has been recently changed from green to red, for the Sema- phore light, lately transformed from red to green. ? Severe bush fires have occurred in all parts oftthe colony, and thousands of pounds' worth of property have been destroyed. As a rule, pastoral country has suffered moro than agricultural. Tho weather has been intensely hot. In the North the monotony of the summer has been broken by tho occurrence of floods of extraordinary severity. AB much as oin. of rain have fallen, and the residents in several townships have been put in peril, not only as regards their property, but also as regards their lives. The wreck of the Iron King, now lying on Troubridge reef, has been disposed of for betAveen £400 and £500. An inquiry has been held into tho circumstances of the wreck, and the result has been the suepen of Captain AVhite's certificate for six months, the suspension of the first mate's master's certificate for three months, and a severe reprimand to the second officer. The casualty is clearly traceable to the neglect of the master to allow for tide, to ascertain the preciso distance of tho Troubridge Light- house, and to take soundings. Disappointment has been felt in mining circles at the result of the Northern Terri- tory quartz crushings. Dissatisfaction pre- vails m the north at tho manner in which the Government is being administered. Very little is doing on the reefs at Port Darwin, OAving to the price of labour and the disor- ganisation of the Companies. The Govern- ment have been requested to introduce 200 coolies as an experiment. Some months ago the Hon. T. Elder, a wealthy colonist, at his own expense equipped and started an expedition, under Mo jor Warburton, to try and make its way from Central Australia to the settled dis- tricts of AVest Australia. Nothing having been heard of the expedition, and the party sent out by the Government in the same direction having returned a month or two, without success, Mr. Elder has despatched Mr. John Ross, the explorer,with five men, to follow the tracks of Major AVarburton, and, if possible, to make his way to AVest Aus- tralia. The Government have placed at Mr, Ross's disposal the camels and stores left by Mr. Gosse at Finniss' Springs. . The net profits of the Bank of Adelaide for ihe year amount to £32,800, and it is pro- posed to declare a dividend of 10 percent. The net prolitB of the Mercantile Marine Insurance Company for the half-year amount to £18,000. The deposits in the various banks haA'O increased by half a million during the year. QUEENSLAND. A Ministerial crisis ensued immediately the new Parliament assembled. The Go. vernment nominee for the Speakership was i ejected, and the Opposition candidate, Mr. Walsh, elected. The next day Mr. Palmer, the Colonial Secretary and Premier, resigned office, and Mr. Macalister, the leader of the Opposition, was sent for. The new Ministry consists of Mr. Macalister, as Premier ; Mr. Stephens, Minister of Lands; Mr. Hemmant, Treasurer ; Mr. M'llwraitb, Public Works ; Mr. M'Devitt, Attorney-General; and Mr. George Thom, Postmaster-General. The Assembly passed three months' supply, and adjourned to the end of March. The new Government promise a liberal land policy, cheap railways, reduced telegraphic rates, im- migration on a large Beale, the gradual aboli« tion of tho ad valorem duties, and rewardB for gold discoveries. Seveial of the Ministers have been re-elected without opposition. Rapid progress is being made both Avith the noithern and the southern, railways of the colony ; and in the north it is expected that about 15 miles of new lino will be ready for opening by the middle of the year. In the south it is expected that trams will be run- ning on the Ipswich and Brisbane Extension within the next l8 months. Chiefly in consequence of tho low price commanded by Queensland cotton during the past season, the area of land under cotton this year is unusually small. Sugar has quite taken tho place of cotton now-a-days as the Queensland staple crop, and the crushing of the present season, now all but finished, ia most successful. The tin mines still yield Avell. Tho quan tity of tin ore sent from Stanthorpe has now readied an average of from 120 to 130 tons a week. Conflicting accounts are received from tho Palmer River diggings. The blacks are repoited to be very hostile. TASMANIA Considerable excitement has been occa- sioned in the northern part of the island by the determination of the Government to collect the i ail way rate in the Launceston and AVeBtem Railway district. The payment of this rate Avas guaranteed as a condition of the construction of the railway, but the íesidents are IIOAV anxious to avoid payment. The Government have been compelled to institute legal proceedings to obtain pay- ment of the rates. Public meetings havo been held in soveral parts of the district, and resistance has been talked of but not attempted. Several of the nortueni magis trades have resigned rather than enforce the laws exacting the rate. Mr. Gieen, a Vic- torian railway engineer, is examining the main line railway route at the request of tile Government. A shocking case of suicide occurred a few days ago. As the evening train from Delo- raine was appioaching AA'estbury, a man rushed on to the line, and put his head on tho mil. The driver was unable to stop tho train, and the man's head was severed from his body. WEST AUSTRALIA. Mr. Weld, the Governor of AVest Aus- tralia, is absent from the colony. He has visited Melbourne, and is now in Sydney. He will probably proceed to New Zealand. The Victorian miners employed by the Government as prospectors are actively en gaged in the Bearch for gold, but as yet no- thing definitely satisfactory has been heard from them. The crops throughout the colony aro much above the average, and farmers are hard put to to find cause for grumbling. The want of labour is occasionally much felt, and it is stated that 10s. and 12s, a day has lately been paid to labourers forVumnimt out vessels, and similar work. NEW ZEALAND. As Parliament ia not now in session, the political news is unimportant, Mr. Vogel the Premier, was entertained recently at x banquet at Dunedin. His Excellency the Governor was present, and mado a speech kt which he spoke in .high terms of Mr. Vftjol'g abilities. The Superintendent of tliNAfo. vince of Otago, who was in the chair, pr#. posed Mr. Vogel's health. He mentioned that £500 had been subscribed to purchase _ testimonial for him. Mr. Vogel, in replying to the toast, went into the whole question ol the position of the colony. He declared that a great misapprehension existed as to the debt of the colony. The amount of debt on June 30 on colonial account was £G, 465,000 and on provincial account £3,156,200. The'nro vincial debt was ultimately a colonial liability" but at the same time it was secured primarili upon the land revenue of the colony, which between 1st July, 1872, and December 2» 1873, exclusive of receipts on gold and native lands, amounted to £1,370,000. The colon» need not, therefore, be afraid of a liability ot £3,000,000 with such security at its back On June 30 there remained to be negotiated £2,352,000 of loans already authorised, mik. ing a total of £11,974,000. Beyond that there was required £1,886,900 to complete 7GÍ miles railway authorised last session, thus making £13,860^00 the amount oE debt which would oxist after 767 miles were com- pleted, when £1,000,000 had been expended upon immigration, when £200,000 had been spent in acquiring native land, when £400 009 liad been spent on roads in the North, Island, and when £300,000 had been spent on the gold-fields. That debt would include £6,000,000 spent on public works, of whick only £2,000,000 had been spent on the 30th June last. In 1870 the land revenue »mounted to £174,000; in 1871 it was £230,000 ; in 1872 it was £500,000 ; in 187:1 it was no less than £1,111,600. During last year l8 immigrant vessels brought 2,824 souls to Otago alone. Cable messages report favourably on emigration from Great Britain to this colony. Eight ships would leave during 'December with Government emigrants. Wages aro rising, labour is very scarce, business generally is very good, and the revenue shows a large increase on the pre- vious year. It is proposed to construct a large graving dock at Auckland, capable of accommodât ing the San Francisco mail steamers. The Commissioner of Customa intends makins an early examination of the coast of each island, with the view of determining sites for new lighthouses. It is announced that contracts for 60 more miles of railway will be shortly entered into. The French war ship Vire arrived at Port Chalmers on December 29, from Campbell Island, having surveyed the island, and made a platform for instruments for obserr ing the transit of Venus. The weather was very misty. Captain Jacquemart, com. mander of the French man-of-war Viré, wh» assisted in taking the immigrants from the wreck of the Surat and landing them at Port Chalmers, was entertained with his officera at a ball at Dunedin. He was pre- sented with a valuable silver coffee service, but as the rules of the navy_ would not allow him to receive a present direct, the matter had been referred home. The Viré Bailed from Port Chalmers for New Caledonia on the 13th inst. Dr. Berggren, professor of the University of Lund, Sweden, has arrived at Christ- church, and intends remaining 12 months in New Zealand, investigating its botany for the Swedish Government.

On January 2, the captains of all the steamers at Wellington were served with I formal notice from the Steamers' Strike Committee that the seamen would work no longer, except at an advance of £1 per month, making their wages £7, and working only eight hours instead of twelve. A compromise was fust offered by owners of £7 per month for 12 hours, but the men rejected it, and insisted on £8 per month it they worked 12 hours, to which the owners acceded; | Dr. Coughtrey, the surgeon of the immi grant ship Chile, on her last voyage from London to New Zealand, has been charged with cruelly ill-treating a female immigrant named Ann Vesey, by putting her in irons, chaining her to the capstan bar, and other- wise ill- treating her. The fact that the woman was handcuffed and subsequently fastened to the capstan was proved beyond a doubt, but it occurred under very different circumstances from those detailed by the prosecution. The evidence shows clearly that the doctor took no personal action in the matter, and that no moro force was used by the ofliceis of the ship in placing her in iions thun was absolutely necessary for that pui pose. In consequence of Mrs. Vesey's violent conduct, the defendant ordered her to be secured to the capstan until a place of isolation could be constructed for her accom- modation. The evidence showed that on its completion she was at once removed to it, and the handcuffs taken off her wrists. The woman was a most violent and dangerous character, for several of the witnesses swore that she had placed them in bodily fear, and that they were afraid she would do thom some grievous bodily harm. The police magistrate of Auckland dismissed the case, v ith costs. Native matters aro quiet, and the Kingites show a daily increasing willingness to renew friendly relations with Europeans. A store has been opened by a European in a pre- viously disaffected district. A Maori pah, near Napier, has been accidentally burned, and the tribe left homeless. Mr. M'Lean, the Minister for Native Affaira, had sue« ceeded in effecting the purchase of 22,600 acres of land in tho Horowhenua district, and settling the dispute amongst the tribes there. FIJI. News has been received from Fiji.to the 3rd inst. Mr. Consul Layard had arrived, and the annexationiats wero making every exertion to lay before him their views upon the undesirability of a continuance of the existing state of things with the local Government. The consul has received ad- dresses from the mayor and citizens of Levuka, and also a deputation from the planters. At the end of December the group was visited by a hurricane, which drove» number of small craft ashore. H.M.S. Pearl, Commodore Goodenough, was caught in it gale off Kandavu, and iost her sails. A heavy sea stove in the commodore's cabin. The Imperial Commissioners, Commodore Goodenough, and Mr. Layard have enterca upon their inquiries, ana the settlers fer- vently hope that they will recommend an- nexation by England. It is stated that the King has intimated to Commodore Good- enough that he is opposed to annexation. COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. MAILS. ' The P. and O. Company's R.M.S.S Nubia, Captain W. B. Hall, after taking on board bec mails, gold, and specie, and embarking her passengers, took her departure from Hobsou» Bay on her outward voyage, shortly after 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Friday, the 2nd instant. The R.M.S.S. Ellora, Captain Culling, with the mid-monthly mail from Europe, arrived in Hobson's Bay on the 5th instant, at half pnst 9 o'clock in the morning. The R.M.S.S. Pera, Captain R. Methven, reached Hobson's Bay with the regular De- cember mails from Europe, on the cveiuns o£ the 10th instant, at 7 o'clock. MATE OF MADE. The last mail left us in the inidst.fif.ihe Christmas and New Year's holidavs *yucn business was almost at a standstill. The year opened quietly, and for some time the utmosv dulncsa pervaded the market generally ; suu Bequently an improvement began tosctm, and for the space of a fortnight considerable activity prevailed. During the past vvecc, however, complaints of dulness have aram become numerous, and more difficulty mt» been experienced in making sales to any ci- tent. Speculation has as yet been dormant. and with the exception of one or two special- ties, which rose into favour m conse- quence of the season's requirements, trans- actions have been confined to supplyins mero actual wants. Breadstuffs have pre sented a rising tendency throughout, ana though the circumstance may be IOOKC" upon as singular just as a most satisincioij harvest has been garnered, it is easily ac- counted for by the fact that stocks of oia wheat and flour were entirely cleared oui before the new commenced to coT¿e market, and since then euPP.ll08.hSVflÄ foi ward so slowly as to be quite "'»«"'S for the wants of the trade, and n. go»J deal of inconvenience has beon causea < .horeb.. Values have risen gradually, flour having advanced 15s, to20a. per ton; the me on wheat, however, has been more in pro "ortion, say 8d. lo 9d. per bushel, and may «at advance further. This has been all the more felt as the price was high enough ' Ivcfore the rise commenced, and especially as ¡t was" fully expected that values would be . subjected to a considerab'e fall before any «nward turn could possibly occur. The -uiality of the wheat this season is really 'Very superior, but the yield may not be as much os was at one time anticipated. There sa no fear whatever of there being any de- ficiency, but it may be questioned, owing to the scarcity which exists at present, whether er not we aro likely to have much of asurplus. Of feeding grains, stocks have-also been reduced to a minimum, and both oats and maize havo in consequence risen considerably. As the oat crop has proved a comparative failure this season, erices are likely to continue dear, while maize at the present time is higher than it Tjas been for years past. Dundee goods havo onco more come into favour. Last month we noticed heavy purchases of woolpacks to be held. Since then, however, owing to the abrogation of the "Bordor Treaty," which malees such goods liable to a duty in New South Wales of 3d. per pack, n demand sprang up for Riverina, tvhich holders, in consequence of a fall in the price at home, havo been nothing loth to .iheet, and upwards of 400 bales have changed bands, entirely on exceptional business, aB the season's demand cannot commence for several months yet. A large trade has also Jieen done in cornsacks, the sales for the month aggregating 710 bales, over and above what may have been done Avithout the busi- ness having reached us. A good inquiry has been maintained for candles, but though at one period an advance seemed imminent, yet no change in prices can be reported. ' Cements have improved in valuo, and prices more in consonance Avith the cost laid SoAvn are now for the future likely to bel obtained. Coffee is sufficiently high already to lie affected by tho news to hand of the extreme rates ruling in Colombo, as well as all the other growing districts. Fruits since the commencement of the year lave been in some instance subjected to BOiucAvhat heavy -reductions. In kerosene oil operations are again of some magni- tude, sales to the extent of 19,000 cases to arrive and on the Bpot have been effected within the last few days. Rice has been neglected, recent arrivals, the cargo of Saigon by the Noemi, and the Moulmein by the Amiral de Montaignac, Btill remain unsold. A portion of tho latter, however, say, a fourth of the shipment, has found a purchaser. Of salt about 350 tons -have been disposed of. Operations in sugar amount to 58,000 bags and mats. Transac- tions in teas comprise portions of the cargo per Chanco, Rose of Australia, and other Bhipments,amountinginalltol3,500packages. Brandies, owing to the excessive snipments advised from time to time, do not move. Advices aro exceedingly favourable other «vise, but in the meantime wo can report no improvement. A feature in the trado of the month is the opening of a new sugar refining establishment The works have been erected by the well- known firm of Messrs.-Joshua Brothers, who have spared no expense in obtaining all the most recent scientific appliances, in order to make the new enterprise a success. Two mads have come forward this month from Europe. The Ellora, bringing dates from London to 14 th November, reached Hobson's Bay on the morning of the 7th inst., and tho Pera, bringing advices to 28th November, arrived here on the evening of the 16th instant. The ship- ments for the month to Molbourno are estimated at £568,000, showing an increase over the previous month of £81,200. The increase to the other colonies for the same period aggregates £283,600. Our advices by the same oppor .unity, from Calcutta, reach to 10th Decem- ber, from Foo-chow to 29th November, from Java to Gth December, from Singapore to 4th December, from Colombo to 18th December, from Saigon to 8th December, and from ttangoon to 29th November.

BANKS AND PUBLIC COMPANIES. Commercial Bank of Australia.-The fol- lowing half-yearly report will be presented at the general moeting, to be held on the 3rd prox. :-"The accompanying balance-sheet shows a marked improvement in the bank's business under every heading, and the di- rectors feel much gratified in being able to submit so satisfactory a result. The increase in the noto circulation and the deposits has chiefly occurred during the last month of the year, consequently the full benefit of that and the augmented capital of the bank will not be experienced until the present half year. The successful issue of the new shares at a fair premium, and the improvement on the ordinary profits of the bank, have placed the large sum of £37,01810s. 7d. at the dis- posai of the directors, and it has been con- sidered desirable to avail of this oppor- tunity to expunge from the balance-sheet the items of preliminary expenses and sta- tionery accounts, which together amount to the sum of £6,800. These accord- ingly have been written off in full, and the £2,000 per annum hitherto applied to their liquidation will henceforth lie avail- able for the augmentation of dividends. After paying a dividend, at the rate of 8 per cent, per annum, increasing the reserve fund to £43,000, and providing for contingencies, the sum of £4,718 10s. 7d. is carried forward to credit of profit and loss for the present half-year. The dividend on the new shares, which were not fully paid up until 1st De- cember, will be paid for three montliB. During the half-year a branch of the bank has been opened at Kingston, in the Ballarat district, and an agency at Avenel, on the North- Eastern Line. Handsome and com- modious freehold premises have also been erected for the bank's businesa at Carlton and Nagambie. A branch-will be opened at Mooroopna, in the Goulburn Valley, this month. Land Mortgage Bank of Victoria.-The following report will be presented at the half-yearly meeting on the 29th inst. :-" The fross profits, inclusive of £1,376 13s. lOd. alance brought forward from last account, amount to £17,908 Us. 7d. After payment of all current charges, interest on deposits and debentures, and making provision for bad and doubtful debts, there remains a balance of £7,124 7s. 3d., which the directore propose to distribute as follows :-To dividend of 10 per cent, per annum on the paid-up capital (£100,000), £5,000; to reduction of bank pre- mises and furniture account, 20 per cent., £24510s. Gd.: balance to next account, £1,878 16s. 9d. ; total, £7,124 7s. 3d. The directors re- gret to mention the death of Mr. W. P. Muir, who had been manager since the formation of the company. As a mark of respect for tho deceased, and in recognition of his ser- vices, the directors recommend that a grant of £500 be made to his family. Mr. William Sincock has been appointed manager of the company. Tho dividend will be payablo here on and after the 1st proximo, and in London on receipt of advices." The Australian and European Bank (Limited).-The prospectus of a new bank under this title has been issued. The sub- scribed capital is £1,000,000 in 100,000 shares of £10 each, with power to increase, but the first issue in Melbourno is not to exceed 25,000 shares. It is intended that the paid-up capital of the bank shall not exceed £5 per share. This bank will adopt the principle of London discount houses, in not requiring the opening of an account. The registration of the bank was made on 21st inst. Victorian Woollen and Cloth Manufactur- ing Company.-The half-yearly meeting of the Victorian Woollen and . Cloth Manu- facturing Company was held in the Town hall, Geelong, on tho 13th inst. The directors' report stated as -follows: "The directors have pleasure in Btating that the working account, after allow- ing for repairs, depreciation; and wear and tear, shows a satisfactory profit of £3,532 15s. 8d. The balance at credit of profit and loss account last half-year has been reduced by dividend £1,200: reserves, £1,500 ; interest and bad debts, £313 0s. Id. ; but with the workings of the past six months the present balance stands at £4,799 19s. 3d. The erec- tion of the new engine was completed in August laBt, but, unfortunately, it liad only been placed in position a few days when a fire occurred in the drying- room, by which da- mage to a considerable extent was sustained and a delay of some weeks took place before the necessary reinstatements could be made to resume work. The loss occasioned by the fire was arranged with the insurance com- panies concerned by payment to this com- pany of £4,000, and your directors deter- mined, in order to reduce fire risk to a raini num, to erect new willey and drying rooms apart from the main building. The former has been built as nearly fireproof as prac- ticable ; the latter has yet to be erected, The extension of the factory sanctioned at the last general meeting is progressing ; the addition to the main building will be a room 141ft. 8in. by 140ft. Oin., and the greater portion of the requisite machinery is expected to arrive in a few weeks. This extension ne- cessitates the purchase of a much larger stock of wool thanforpreviousyears. The manager's estimate for the season is £20,000, to meet which considerable bank accommoda- tion will be necessary. Although the accrued profits are now considerable, your directors recommend a present dividend at 8 per cent, per annum only, believing it will be to the interests of the shareholders to allow the greater portion of the profits to accumulate, to be added to capital as against the new buildings and machinery (estimated to cost £8,000); and, in furtherance of this view, your directors anticipate that within 12 months thoy will be able to make a second issue of bonus shares. The debentures of the company (£7,000) will fall duo on the 1st of March next, and your directors ask au- thority to issue fresh debentures as they may .deem advisable, to the extent of £10,000, to be secured by mortgage of the freehold land, buildings, and plant of the company." The report and balance-sheet wero adopted, and a dividend of 8 per cent, per annum was declared. The directors were empowered to issue debentures on the security of the company's property, to an amount not exceeding £10,000, to enable them to meet the debentures becoming due in March next. The Southern Insurance Company,-The following report will be presented to the ordinary general meeting of shareholders on the 2nd prox.:-"Your directors submit here- with the statement of accounts and balance sheet for half-year ending 31st December, 1873\. The separate account for 1872 has been closed, and shows a net profit on the trans- actions of that year, amounting to £17,95519s. lid., as under :-1872 : Receipts-Underwrit- ing account, £46,064 8s. lOd. ; transfer fees, £55 7s. 3d. ; interest, £4,921 10s. 9d. ; total, £51,941 6s. lOd. Payments Underwriting account, £39,806 15s. 7d. ; less previously charged to 1871 account, £5,821 Ss. 8d_£33,985 Gs. lid.; balance credit,£17,95519s. lid.; total, £51,9416s.lOd. Notwithstanding a succession of heavy losses experienced immediately following the date of last general meeting of the company, the state of the underwriting account is such as to enable your directors to recommend pay- ment of a dividend at the rate of 7h per cent, per annum. In view of the restricted busi- ness now being transacted by the company, your directors have discussed the propriety of reducing the present paid-up capital, and, after mature consideration, they are of opi- nion that an amount of £75,000 will afford ample security for all engagements upon which the company is likely to enter for some years to come. It is accordingly pro- posed that a return of 5B. per share be made forthwith, leaving 15s. paid up on each share." Melbourne Masonic-hall Company.-The half-yearly meeting of the shareholders was held on the 7th inst. According to the report of the directors, it appeared that the amount of revenuo for the last half-year was £266 11s., as against £275 for the previous half year. During the half-year an overdraft of £50 19s. 3d. had been paid, and there was now a balance to the credit of the company of £58 7s. 3d., which formed the nucleus of a. fund for further reducing the mortgage debt, which was set down at £1,950. The report and balance-Bheet were adopted. BANK RETURNS.

The Argus Ofllco, Tuesday Evening. In Uio import markets this month only a moderato \- amount of business has beon transacted. An- im- proving tendonoy has, howovor, beon apparent slnco tho commencement of tho year. Bulk ales have boon noticed. Bottled alos and stout havo been moved off to a fair extent. Dundee goods havo mot with moro attontion. Boots and Bhocs havo not been so much dealt In, Candles aro, if anything, better. Cements havo improved. Cliemlcals aro alow. Chicory, coffeo, confectionery, cordage, blasting powder, hops, malt, ollmon's stores, provisions, quicksilver, timoor, tobacco, have not beon cha- racterised by much animation, and sales as a rulo havo been trilling and unimportant. Fish go off slowly at easier rates. Fruits aro all lower. Broad BtuUs and feeding grains havo risen in valuo. In metals sarao Items havo Improved, but on the vvholo thcro is littlo change. In oils, kerosenso has of late attracted attention, but with that oxceptlon little oleo has transpired. Of Bait considerable parcels havo been sold by auction at low rates. In sugar an exten- sive business has beon dono at Bllghtly botter prices. A moro oxtcnslvo business has also boon dono in tens. Wines and spirits havo not mot with much favour. Alo nnd Stout.-Tho markot for bulk ales has boon very slow throughout tho month. Stocks of old aro now reduced lo a minimum, but even woro it other- wise, the near approach of now beor would provont dealers doing anything moro in old brow than supply- ing mero actual requirements. Tho month oponed with tho quittanco of about 150 hlids of Byoss's at £7 10s. in quantity, and £8 to £810s. in small lots has slnco been ruling. A shipment of Oulnncss's bulk stout was disposed of at £7 6s. in a Uno. Bottled alos havo been In moderato request, at unaltered ratos. Tcnnant's lias been selling to tho largor dealers at 128. Foster's has realised 13s. For Blood's wo quote up to 129\. Od. in small lots ; Bass's triangle is worth 12s. 3d. Altkon's lias been hold for 12s. ll'Ewan's is in fair request at 11s. 0d. For Byass wo quote 11s. to 11s. 3d. Jctfroy's commands 11s., and Arrol'ssolls at 10s. Od. to 11s. Bottled stouts have boon sclllntr, though not at such extremo figures as formerly ¡ tho reduction, how over, is very trilling. Edmond's pig brand has realised 13s. 3d. Burke's has beon disposed of at 13s. 3d. O'Brien's dagger brand has been Belling of lato at 13s. Foster'« has realised 13s. Blood's has boon quoted at 12s. Od. There aro no medium brands olTcrlng, but sales of Byass's aro making at 11s. to 11s. 3d. Jeffrcy'B and Arrol's aro being quitted at 109. Oil. to 11s. Bagging.-A considerable business has been dono this month in Dundee goods. The abrogation of tho Bordor treat}-, and tho fear that lill erina squatters would get In for the 3d. duty, directed attention to woolpacks, and holders owing to the reduction in price at homo being nothing loth, cloBO on 400 bales must have changed hands at 3s. Oil. for calcuttas and Ss. lOJd. for Dundees ; for a small lot of the latter also 3s. lid. was lately «aid. Cornsacks havo likewise been more largely Bold, the very excessive shipments to Adelaldo compelling holders there to look for a niaikct hore for their surplus Importations. Soma vciy considerable parcels have been got lid of, and though low er rates have been nccoptcd recently, yet as tho reduction is not in proportion to the declino at home billi lower figures may bo expected to rulo ; about 711 bales havo been run off lu parcels and on speculation in tlio coitrso of the lost threo weeks, and though 12s. was obtained In tho beginning, l18, (id. to IIB. 9d. in quantity would not now bo rciua<_. Bran bags hav c gono off at 7s. Od. to 8s., but only in trade parcels. In gunnies there Is not much to report. A parcel of 50 bales waa quitted by auction at 0s. 10d., and wo quote up to 7s. Boots and Shoes.-Tho market has been moderately active. Under tho hammer some fair salos, have boon made. At the moro recent of theso the follow lug pi lees were realised. On Thursday, tho 15th hist., 175 pack- ages imported and about 2,000 palra colouial-mado wero cleared off. Thcro was a largo attendanco of bujors. Mcn'sK.S. brought 7s. Od. to 10s.: do. bluchers, 0s. to' 8s. Od.; do. calf oxonians, 4s. to 7B. Od.-, women's kid E.S., Os.

On Thursday, tho 22ud, n large quantity of leather ' ware, also 05 packages boots and shoes, and about 3,000 pairs colonial-inado do., wero got rid of. Tuero was a numerous attendanco of buyers. Kip leather fetched 1B. 8Jd. per lb.; kangaroo do., 4s. . 4d. do.; calf, 3s. 9d. do.; basils, 0s. per dozen; Men's E.S, boots,8s. tolls. Od.; do. laceups, 10s. to Ila. I0d.; do. bluchors, 5s.

Od. to 5s, Od.; do. 4-0 CT., Is. Od. to 2s. 3d. . Candles havo been in good trado request, Ijut nothing moro ; though a movement aroso which was expected to lead lo considerable transactions, at same time volucs wero expected to improve, but tho' demand has since died out and ' prices romain unaltered. Apollos, Vietoriaii-made, maintain thoir name for quality; of late, however, thoy havo not been so much offered by auction, but sales havo boon making very f rcoly privately at 10_d. and lOJd., according to parcels, with a further concession on largor lines. Goudas havo mot with a ready sale under tho hammer at lid., but for D.l-O.'e, holdors, though asking Hld., havo been compelled to tako HW. Cements.-Tho price of Portland has shown an im- proving tendency throughout tho past month, though not'yot in proportion to tho riso fn tho homo market rates and freights. For somo months past, our quo- tations stood at 208. to 21e., but theso were quito nominal This month, howovor, sales wore reported at 20s. Cd. to 21s. Od., and within tlio last fortnight a parcel of 500 barrols Knight, Bevon, and Co.'s was quitted at 22s. 0d. American plaster has also hod only a nominal quotation of 25s. No shipments havo been offered tilla week. Howovor, an arrival Is re- ported, and prices will assume a moro doflrdto cha- racter. Chemicals.-AA'o noto a very qulot market. Soda Crystals have been selling at £11 5s. Carbonate has ruled at £25. Caustic soda has been quitted at £23 10s. for 00 per cent, and £27 10s. for 72 per cent, a reductloiVon last month's prices. Flowers of sulphur havo nominally ruled at £10, but thoro Is no Inquiry at tho prico and no business is reported. Tartarlc acid is sluggish, but values have been maintained at 2s. 2d. Cream of tartar brings Is. 3d. In proparod opium nothing whatever has como boforo us ; our latcBt quotations wero 20s., and wo havo heard of no chango since ; tho trado is entirely in tho hands of tlio Chluesc. Chicory.-AA'o noto a moderate trado inquiry nt 4jd. for colonial crown. Coffee,-There isa good business doing, notwith- standing tho extreme rates ruling. Stocks aro not excessive, and shipments which have como forward of lato havo met with a ready salo. A considerable parcel which reached hero by the EUora, and likewise that by tho Pera, havo changod hands at very full rates, a fair concession on our trado quotations having been accepted. Good to best plaiitatatlon Is moving off to supply trade wants at Is. 3d. to Is. 3_d. Java is salcablo at Is. 2_d. to Is. 2Jd., whllo nativo Co) Ion linds buyors at Is. 2d. to Is. 21d. Our advices from Colombo reach to 18th December, at which period 120s. per cvvt. was oskod for plantation. Confectionery.-There has been less doing slnco tho new year. For assortments of KolIIer'B 10Jd. is re- quired, but sales at auction have boen mode at 10_d. Victorian-made assorted havo bcon quitted at 8}d. to Od, Candled peel is worth Is. Id. for orango and lemon, but citron is still vory scarce. Jujubes aro disposed of at Is. Id. Cordage-Trado has bcon exceedingly quiet, and oven for oxport ordors havo como forward of lato vory slowly indeed. Prices and values havo boon main- tained unaltered. Best Manilla hemp-mado Victorian ropo has been moving at £68, and cordage under ono inch lias brought 8jd.: second quality of samo material has been quitted at £50 and 7_d. por lb. re- spectively. Flat ropes havo booti disposed of at £70 to £84. Now Zealand flax-mado ropo has boon soiling at £40 for largo BIZCB, and Old. lias boon got for lines and cordago sizes. Seaming twines aro in slow sale at Is. 2d., whllo Bhop tvvlnos aro quoted at lid. to Is. Id. New Zealand flax, according to samplo, is bought at from £17 to £23. Fish.-Thoro has boon nothing exciting in this market ; a moderato business has been dono at last month's quotation. Ling has bcon disposed of at 5i)d. to Od. AVhlto herrings aro not in stock ; they aro wanted, however, and sales could bo mado at 33s. for half-barrols. One-pound fresh herrings in this aro soiling at 8s. 3d. Red herrings in tins aro dis- posed of at 82s. lib. salmon is quitted at 14s. and 14B. 3d., but stocks aro boyond requirements, and eales aro not so readily effected. Ono or two weeks ago, a lino of 250 cases stained labels brought 13s. 0<1\. Sordines havo been in favour throughout. Con- siderable parcels havo been got rid of at 9s. Od. for halves and 5s. Od. for quarters, lib. lobsters aro worth 12s., but there Is littlo demand, lib. oysters aro valued at 7s. Od. to 7s. Od. A parcel of damagod was cleared off at 7s. Fruits are all lowor Blnco tho now year. New cur- rants, very primo, havo boen sold at 4.d. Old fruit has realised all priceB from 4d. to 4Jd. Raisins havo oleo declined. Elcmcs and Valencia raisins have boen placed at 7_d. Sultanas have not altered ; sales aro making at 7_d. Muscatels havo dropped to 10_d., and over this cannot now be got, though saleable al nearly doublo tho prico named just provious to the new year. On figs wo also roport a reduction ; quotations stand at Od. to 8d., according to size of package. Flour and Grain.-Tho market for breadstuff, has presented a rising tendency every week since wo lost wrote, and on the price of flour thore Is at tho present momont a difforenco of 15s. to 20s. on tho rates quoted last moil. Tills, however, Is only the natural result and what might havo been expected in a markot so thoroughly drained of old stock beforo tho now wheat commouccd to como to hand. Supplies, more- over, havo como forward so slowly as to cause groat Inconvenience to all tho trado, on account of tho diffi- culty experienced in obtaining oven sufilclout to moot ordinary requirements. As a rulo, transactions havo not been of much uccount, owing to tho paucity of Bupplios. Business tor the month, however, opened with tho quittança of 180 tons old flour, at £1217s. Od. for parcolB, whllo for bakers' lots £13 7s. Od. to £13 10s. was obtained, and tho price has slnco gradually risen to £14 5s. to £14 10s. for email lots, no parcels being obtainable. Wheat, in Uko monnor, which was quoted at 6s. lOd. jost month, has advanced to 0s. Od. and 0s. 8d., and It may go still highor, but that will ontiroly depend on how supplies may como forward. Although tho quality this season Is very Uno, still circumstances favour tlio idea that tho yield will not bo so largo : at all ovonts, wo do not anticipate much, if any, surplus. Feeding grains havo also been in short supply, and as a conscqucnco vory oxtromo prices havo boon ruling. Oats at one timo sprang from 4s. Od. to 5s. 8d. for common feeding and 6s. Od. for good. At theso rates, transactions como to be reported, but tho quality of tho oats was really so inferior, that in an ordiuory season thoy positively would not bo looked at for horso feed. Tho crop Is known to bo a failure, and unless supplies from other sources reach us, wo may anticipate vory extremo prices throughout tho year. The first parcels of now Victorian offered havo realised tis. 8d. to 5s, id. Of malzo, wo aro loft without auy stock whatever, and tho prico has been worked up to OB. and 0s. 3d., at which, howovor, tliero is not much doing, and 59. lOd. would bo taken to-day. Now Vic- torian-grown Capo Darloy has como to hand thiswoek, and sales havo boen making at 4s. Od. to 5s.; as yet only S.OOO bushels havo been sold in tho open market. Bran has boon selling at Is. 5d. Pollard has bcon quitted readily at Is, Od. Victorian-mada oatmeal baa steadily realised £31. Gunpowder has been quite noglccted, no attention having bcon directed to tho article. Only tho most trifling Bales havo boon making of blasting powder, and though wo continuo to quoto last mouth's rates, yot this is no criterion of what would bo accoptcd did any of tho larger buyers show a dosiro to operate. Hall's has been quoted at CJd. Kame's has boon offering at Od., and other brands at 5 Jil. to Od. Ship- ments from England aro increasing again, and that clrcumstanco Is sulliclcnt to prevent any Im- provement. Hops.-Though wo roport a bettor markot this month, values oro oaslor. Outaldo tho ordinary trado demand inquiries havo boon experienced which havo led to tho disposal of somo very fair lines, chiefly yearlings. Tho season, howovor, has hithorto pro- gressed without much Blgn of improvoinont boing evinced ; tliiB, however, is accounted for by tho oxtromo rates at which now hops openod out. Tlio very best quality of now 1873 havo been soiling at 2s. 2d.; good samples havo been quitted at Is. lid. to 2s. ; nnd poor qualities havo been ofTored at Is. Od. to Is. lOd. Yearlings havo bcon moving in small lots to brewers at Is. 2d. to Is. 6d.. but of lote about 150 pockets havo bcon takou up In quantity at lid. to Is. Id. Tasmanian 1873 havo also been sold at from 8d. ' and only to Importera directly engaged in tho trade, < thoro has boen no room for tho disposal of largo ', parcels, but a vory steady trado demand has ruled at ' 11s. 8d. Tho larger buyers havo beon offorlng Us., 1 but only in exceptional cases havo sales been modo at this figuro, holdors gcnornlly requiring Us. 3d, The first shipment of now Is oxpoctcd shortly. . Motols.-Vory littlo of speciol importanco has trans ' plrcd. Pig iron has maintained a uniform trado quotation of £0 to £9 10s. Galvanised ¡ron has bcon ' moving off steadily. Scotch 20 gauge is quoted at ¡£81, but supplies aro trilling. Ordinary brands of 1 EngliBh oro_alcablont£32. ond best brands aro quitted ' at £33. At auction a small pared of Crown brand was ' disposed of ; 0 x 20 C realised £31 10s. ; 7ft., £31 10s. ; ' Sit., £32 to £32 10s.; and 9ft., £33. Bar and rod ,' iron, worth £17, moves but slowly. Sheet iron lias commanded more notico ; assortments of Nos. 8 to l8 havo lately brought £18, and tho higher Nos., varying from 20 to 20, have been quitted at £22. Plato iron is firm at £10. Hoop iron, tho wool season having passed, ÍB less noticed ; wo quote £18. Fencing wiro has commanded moro attention, and sales hovo been making ot £23, £24, ond £25 for Nos. 0, 7, aud 8. Hill's Acorn and othor brands havo realised our quotations. Shot Is worth £38, but though in tho midst of tho Beason thoro is littlo in- quiry. Shoot ¡cod is quoted at £31. Tln-plotcs aro not noticed ; wo quote 10 per cent, advauco on In- voice, but that Is quito nominal. Muntz motol has bcon disposed of at UJd. Ewbank's nails aro rising in valuo ; thoro is a good demand, but no stock ; 10 to 12. per cont, on list prices could roodlly bo got for any invoices offering. American nails, on tho othor Ininti, aro slow, and even at 20s., at which thoy aro offering, there uro no sales making. American hard- ware IIOB been somowhat sluggish. Colllns's and Shorpo's heavy oxes hovo been offering at 81s.,but thoro Is littlo or no responso. Amcsí shovels oro salcablo at 73s. to 74s. Day's D-1I. shovals, 31 to 30 inches, are hold for 60s., and othor moliere'can bo purchased ot 60s. In hollowaro thoro is nothing doing, though offered at 12J por cont. off list. Oils of oil descriptions hovo been cxtromoly dull and difficult to movo. Evon kerosono has boon neglected until within tho hist 10 days, when somo rather largo holders hovo thought It prudont to quit btock freely both on tho spot and to arrive. Of conreo loner rates have bad to bo tokon. Business for the month opened with ii nominal quotation of Is. 8_d. for Dovoo's, at which Uguie about 2,000 cases Mero sold f.o.b.; tlio Bains v\eck, liowover, when attempting to placo moro tho prico completely broko down. 2,000 coses Dovoo's were Bold for local use ot Is. 7Jd , ond 10,000 coses diamond vero disposed of, to arrive, at Is.

Advices from Now York, reaching to 16th November, roport that 31,000 cases havo boen despatched to tho colonies for tho mouth. About 25,000 coses hove orrhed slnco wo wroto last. Castor oil, dutv poid, has been moving off at 4s. 10.. Linseed has been selling ot rather eoslor rates, drums being quoted nt 4B. 9d. and hulk at 4s. 2d.

Con- sumers, rather than pay tho extreme prices required,' hold back, and mako no attempt to operate]; holders ask OB., but no sales havo transpired. Elco.-Thcro has boon no movement whatovorin tho article. Advices from Calcutta roaehlng to loth December etato that tho crop will not bo moro thau tho fourth of last year's yield, and that tho prico of Secta was oxpoctcd tobo 6rs. Hore, however,busi- ness in tho article has been very slow, and until, stocks becomo much reduced no groat improvement can bo expected. Trado sales of Patna havo boen mak- ing at £20108.

This market continues to exhibit a very quiet as- pect. An Improvement had boon expected aftor tho long vocation-for tho Christmas and Now Year's holidays-but when business was resumed on tho 5th January, itwas evident that, as regards mining trans- actions at least, tho expectation was not Imme- diately to bo realised. AVlth tho oxcoption of occasional and short-lived spurts in somo few com- panies, mining business generally has boen cha- racterised by oxtrcmc dulncss, and in tlio largo 1 majority ot cases quotations havo been quite nominal. Somo fow improvements in valuo have, howovor, taken place, and among the principal wo note Gardon Gully United and othor companies on 1 Bamo lino, and Hustler's Reef and Extended Hustler's, tho latter of willoh had bcon un- usually dull for somo timo previously. Should any I , considerable Improvement talto placo in tho loading mines on this lino, tho market would probably bo im- mediately and vory favourably affected. Among tho companies which havo receded in vahío aro Long Tun no1, which havo, howovor, partially recovered, Lothalr (ou ing to striko of minors), Magdala, Nowlngton, and Golden Flecco, For investment stocks thoro has uccu a fair demand, and at full previous rates, oxcopt in tho caso of Victorian debentures, which aro cosier, principally becauso of tho plentiful supply of other colonial bonds at lower rates. Bank shores command a ready market. Insurance havo advanced In value In gas the full has boen arrested. M. nnd II. B. Hall- way shares unchanged. Tho balance sheet of tho Commercial Bank has been Issued, and shows steady and good progress ; besides clearing olf tho largo balanco of preliminary expenses, they add £15,000 to reserve fund, poy dividend at tho rate of 8 per cent,, and carry foruaid a good balance. Tho balauco-shoot of tho Bank of Victoria has not yet bcon issued, but it Is understood that tho post half-year has boon a vory prosperóla one. A bonus of 10 por cont. on their salaries lately poid to all tho clerks Is a pleasing indication of it.aiul it Is probable that tlio shareholders will also receive a bonus m addition to tho usual dlvl dond.

Consequent upon tho advanced season, mid tlio naturally anticipated scarcity of cargo, coupled with the anxiety of consignees to make up their needful quantities of freight, rates homewards hav o exhibited not only a weakness but a decline upon several articles, which, could the latter reason hav o been ignored, might not as yet have occurred Present quotations, and nt which engagements have
