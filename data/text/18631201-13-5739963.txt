Vf., on tho 10th of the fo'bwing month, and tho meridian of Cape Good Hopo on tho 1st ult., In 1st. 48deg S., and that of Cape Leuwln cn tho 19th In tho same latitude. Since then «ho has been detained by light easterly and baffling wind*, and hog been close to Capo Ota ay itnco Friday morning lost. During hor Blay in London tho Dover Castle underwent a thorough overhaul, and rocolvcd new mas's, spars, and rig- ging, which add greatly to her sailing qualities. She has BIBO received double topsails. TUB ship Aurora, from New lork, anchored In Hob son's Bay during Sunday night. S ho left New York on the 22cd August, was forty-three days to the Equator, duiing which alto wai becalmed for sixteen do)s ; had then fino breezes until the 20th ult. ; since then she has been dttalned by cilms and baining winds. The ship Commodore Perry, of the Black Ball Line, anchored in Hobson's Bay at about noon yesterday. She left Liverpool on the 28th August, crossed the Equator on the 20th September, in lon. 28deg. 13min. W., and the meridian ot Cape Good Hope on the 1st ult., in lat. 46 deg. 50min. S, and that of Cape Leuwln on the 19th, also in lat. 48deg. S. Captain Owen reports that between losing the S.E. trades and the meridian of the Cape he met with fifteen days' light S E. and E.S.E. winds, which forced him down to lat. 46 deg. S. before he oould commence his easting. From that until making this port had a fine run, with N.N.W. and W. winds generally prevailing. On arrival in port, the passengers presented Captain Owen with a handsome testimonial, thanking him for his kindness and urbanity. It is with pleasure we state, with the concurrence of the immigration officer, that the Commodore Perry is one of the cleanest vessels he has ever cleared in this port, and that the arrange- ments for the accommodation of the single and un- protected females is everything that could be desired. As a proof of the order in which she has been kept, we may add that although she has considerably over 400 passengers, they have all enjoyed remarkably good health throughout the voyage. InoKCLAna OK Tim MKIISKY.-Though it is well known thot thoro are several Ironclads in course of construction In various parts of tho kingdom for foreign Governments, and though ona of them has already saied for Russia, and auother for Denmark, without iccasbnlng surpiise, tht public suspoct that any vessel el war built on tbo Mersey must be in- tended for tho Confederate Government. For a oon Blderablo timo past, mysterious assertions havo behn circulated respecting two ironclads building in Mossrs. Laird's yard, and the Federal sp los havo never lost sight of them. A fow days ago, it was cur- rently reported and behoved that one of tbesavossols bad sllpp.d owoy to sea clandestinely to join com- pany with the Florida, off the Irish coast. That such was not the case, a visit to Messrs. Laird's jord mido evident. Thoro at present lie the two suspected vessels eldo by side, with the French flag floating over the one noarest oompleilon. Moisrs. Laird miks no mj'Btory about El Toitsson and El Muunasslr, ss the sblps are named. They are un- doubtedly built on French account, and it is under- stood that the French vice-consul has given the Col- lector of Customs satisfactory oxp'anatfona respecting them. El Touason, which was launched some time ago, will be ready for a trial trip ia a menth or six weeks. El MounaBsIr was only launched on Saturday, but already a portion of hor machinery is on board. Perhaps there are not two more formidable frigates afloat. They aro 230 fett over oil, 42 feet beam, with 10ft. Oin. depth of hold. Tonnage, 1,860 o.m., horse- power 350. Ihoy aro very flat-bottomed, with ex- ceedingly fino end', and will sit low In the water. Ibelr draught, when loaded, will be about fifteen foot : estimated speed eleven knots. The atom is so formed that the vessel may be used as o ram, and the Btcrn, which overhangs, affords protection to the screw and rudder from shot or collisions. Tho rig is that of o barque, the masts, which are tele- scopic, and the lower yards being of iron. The armour-plating on the Bides of the vessel is four inches and a half thick amidships, and rather loss at tho ends. The plates, tbo joining of which togother Is impercep. tlb.'o, arc fitted Into a teak backing of great strength The deck la ot five-Inch teak, protected with iron. The bulwarks let down In case of action, In order to allow the turret guns to firs over them. Thoy havo two cylindrical turrets on Captain Coles' principle-one before and tho other abaft the engine-room, hoavlly plated. These turrets aro made for two guns each, The plhtbouse Is formed of teak and Iron. At olther end of the vessel oro raised decks, which afford excel- lent accommodation for the olllcers aud crow. In tho captain's cabin provision Is made for two heavy stern guns, aid heavy guns con be trained from the fore castle deck. These vessel« havo capacity for 890 toni of coal. All the machinery is below the water line. Mltchell'B Moiltlme HegUuer, Sept. 6. | TUB MMIOHANT SKHYICK or DKNMARR.-The Danish merchant sorvlee, which has considerably Increased with n the last fow years, consisted In I860 of 5,053 véasela, gauging 240,310 tons.

The steamers were 60 In number, measuring 8,172 tem, with engines of 3,737-horte poa er. Ot the total ser- vice, the shipping of the Dnchy of Holstein measured only 46,822 lons, whilst moro than 200,678 tons be- longed to the kingdom properly sneaking and to !
