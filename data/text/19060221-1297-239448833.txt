THE MOVING POPULATION. SLIGHT GAIN LAST YEAR. DEPART URL': OF CO LAIRED RACES. OVER son LESS CHINESE. An interesting account of the movement of population during 1905 between tho 'Common wealth and countries outside Australia has been prepared by Mr. W. II. Hall, Acting-Gov ernment Statistician. Tlio tallies have been compiled for tile Fede ral Government from returns collected bv tlio Customs Departments under the plan of Heal ing the Commonwealth as a whole, and of ro- cording all arrivals at a .ship's first port of call, and all departures at the last port sailed from when leaving Australia. They siiow a total uf 48. 836 persons arriving from places outside Australia, and a total de parture of 16.620, being a gain by arrivals of 2216\. This, although not very largo, is au In crease on 1904, when it was 13S9. and is much better ilian in 1903, when there was an excess of departures of 7249. The following is a state ment of the gains and losses of llie Common wealth by excess of arrivals over departures during tile last fivo years:— 1901, gain 4610; J9U2, gain 2100; 1903, loss 7219; 1901, gain 13S9; 1905, gain 2216. During 1905 there was a gain of 2221. mains and' a loss of live females. About 40 pur cent, of the movement of population was between Australia and New Zealand, the majority pt the persons going and coining being tourists. Af ter New Zealand comes the United Kingdom, which claims a little under 20 per cent, of tile movement. From both countries, howovcr, there was a slight gain, from the United Kingdom of 961, and from New Zealand, of 2271. Canada at tracted 54 persons from Australia more than arrived from tliat country. Ou tho other hand, thoro was a gain from the South African colo nies, Natal and Cape Colony, tho excess of ar rivals therefrom being 140. The excoss of de partures to Hougkong, 927, comprised Chinese returning to tholr country. Thero is a largo apparent excess of arrivals, 766, from Now Cale donia, but the persons shown as arriving thoro- from aro shown outwards to Franco. To llie South Sea Islands and New Guinea there was an excess of departures amounting to 705, but the great majority of those were kanakas front Iho sugar plantations who wcro being repatriated. The United States, lileo Canada, has drawn population from Australia, tho excess of depar tures therefor being 599. Nearly SO per cent, of tho Immigrants and emigrants wore British siibecls. Of other places, French and Germans were the only ottos largely represented, and their arrivals and departures paelieally balanced each other. Willi a few minor exceptions, all tho colored races show excess of dopnrliircs. Tho Chinese departures exceeded llie arrivals by 813, the Ja panese by 167, and llio Polynesians by 1015. .Al together the total excess of departures of col ored persons was 1286, so that there was n gain of whites of 4502.
