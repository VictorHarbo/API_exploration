DOWLING-STRJEET, WOOLLOOMOOLOO, SYDNEY, NEW SOUTH WALES. ON THE PRE3IISES. LE. THRELKELD & CO. have been ? instructed to sell by auction, on the pre mises, D.)wlin«-street, iVoolloomooloo Bay, Syiiney, on Tlmrsday, November 12, at 3 o clock (.if not previously disposed of by private contract) The Premises known a3 the WOOLLOO MOOLOO STEAM SAW and MOULDING MILLS. This important Property is well and favourably known as one possesed of every requisite fora large and profitable trade, while from its com pactness and the improvements which have been constantly introduced into the machinery can be worked at considerable less cost than any similar establishment where an equal amount of work is turned out. In its arrangement everything has lx:en done n itii a view to the saving of labour, and the promptness with which orders to any extent may be executed. It consists of a large block of Freehold Land, having a frontage of ISO feet to Dowling-street, 180 feet to Duke-street, and 100 feet to a reserved lane leading from 'iie to the other ; and being in the immediate vicinity of the new Circular Quay, Woolloomooloo Bay, which is now all but completed, it may be truly said to be in a position not to lie surpassed in the whole city. The Plant, which is complete in every part, has been laid down at a very great cost, and is throughout of the best description, A three-ton Derrick is so placed on the wharf as to be available for putting every log of timber either on the sawpits or the traversing carriages, which latter run along a line of rails laid down through the premises, branching off to each machine, when with very trifling hand labour it is deposited and carried oil' again when sawn, in like manner. The Buildings consist of a two-storey range 57 x 2(i, beneath which on the ground floor are the Saw Tables and Frames as follows:— A Saw Tabje by Parsons, with feed motion and all the latest improvements; one of the best in the colony. A smaller Saw Bench for jobbing work. A Vertical Log Frame, iu which from 15 to 25 saws are worked, and A Vertical Deal Frame, which cuts from L500 to 2,000 feet a day. ' On the First Floor of the range is— A very superiorTonguing and Grooving Machine, with a great variety oi irons for every conceivable style ot moulding, imported from England at a large eust, and greatly improved since it has been in use. A Moulding Machine for joiners work, sashes and small mouldings, with all the necessary irons. An improved Tenoning Machine, ? A Morticing Machine. A Boring Machine. A Saw-Bcuch for ripping out joiners' work; and au Upright Gig Saw, with Saddle, for cutting chair backs. , , o. The Second Floor is a large Carpenter s Shop, well lighted, fitted up with 10 benches, fixed and otherwise, and au apparatus for heating glue by The Enginc-House is conveniently situated at tneendof this building, and contains a 20 horse power Engine of the best construction, made by P N. Russell &. Co., with 25 horse flue boiler, dia meter of cylinder 18 inches, length of stroke 3C inches: and attached to it a water-heating appa ratus, by which the getting up of steam is greatlj facilitated. The economy with which the furnace is fitted is worthy of special consideration, no othej fuel being used to keep in motion all the machi nery on the premises than saw-dust, shavings, &c.;, and a very small quantity of the smallest coa screenings AfctAdied to the Endue- House is the Fitting SHOD Him .DUICKSIJUUI n l^fci uuwu. mm 'v»'«»«1 inviL' and all the necessary tools for keeping sverything in repair; and adjoining is the baw Sharpeuer Shop, in which is a superior screw Bunch and a full complement of saws, both cir cular and vertical, sufficient for all the require ments of the establishment, ? Above this is the Turners Shop, fitted with four good lathes and a small saw-bench for cross-cutting for the turners. - . , , At the other end of the yard is the Bosmaker a Shop, 52 x 23, and above it a Cabinetmaker's Shop the same size, also fitted with carpenters' benches, Adjoining is a Store 45 x 22, for finished joiners' and cabinetmakers' work, and in the same range are the Turnery Store, Door and Sash Store, and the Moulding Racks. . , There are also extensive Covered Backs for drying cedar, capable of holding a very large Quantity of boards, making the whole one of the most complete establishments pf its size in the colony. It being in full operation at the present moment is a guarantee that.it is in perfect working order the belting in nearly every instance, having been lately renewed. The trade attached to it, too, is of considerate importance, the woik turned out being known all over the country as of a superior AUCTIONS v eScription; and the '.large 'amount, of ..business one both in the time of the late proprietors and uring the last two years down to the present hour 8 a sufficient indication of what the mills are capable, and of the requirement there is for them ffi eastern portion of the town. But if they be required now, hovr much more so will they be on Sw completion of the new C.rcular Quay, which wilitakc place before the end of the present year, whenthe vast swamp which at Jow water has so long been a source of annoyance to the neighbour hood shall have been reclaimed, and the space de voted to the erection of warehouses, shops, and dwellings, which will be needed immediately the wharf & thrown open for use. The ex ension of King-street, which is fully determined on, will abut on to the property, thus bringing it into he very heart of the town, increasing tenfold its value for all business purposes. Such an opportunity as the present is rarely, met with to obtain a valuable Saw-Mills Plant in an eligible situation, with a first-class trade and con nection, ready made to hand; and. as it was for merly purchased under peculiar circumstances at less than its original cost, so now will It be sold regardless of its real value. The terms will be of the most liberal character, one-half the purchase-money being allowed to remain chargeable on the property at 7 per cent., and »hfi remainder in easv payments. 2b0ws304 HWEIUraEHT ADVERTISEMENTS REAL PROPERTY ACT NOTICES.
