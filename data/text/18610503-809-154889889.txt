From every part of the colonies he is lily consulted, not only by those afilicted with e ordinary maladies incidental commonly to the iman frame, and to this colony in particular, it in all those diseases which have baffled the ill and science of the most eminent surgeons d physicians of the day ; the well-known name Dr L. L. Smith, which has now become as niliar to the ears of the Sydney, Adelaide and ctorian public, as household words, has natur y caused those suffering from these more seri s diseases to consult him as a derniere resource. ? ' : L. L. Smith has thus gained not only a com- ; tency and independent position in this colony, t he has also gained the highest amount of .???'?* actical and theoretical experience in his pro -sion. To those residing' in the Bush, desirous of con lting and i.eing under his immediate treatment, ? r L. L. Smith begs leave to state that he has for ; _ , eir convenience established one of our largest ' ivate institutions in the colony, namely, ' A LOCK- HOSPITAL, ?.

Indomitable perseverance, steady at- -: . ntion to his patients, together with the adv&n-; '! ges of extraordinary experience in his profes an, and one of the largest medical libraries in e colony for reference, has been the sole secret n ?
