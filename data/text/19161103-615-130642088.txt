A CLE MENT'S TONIC LETTER. Many Officials in the Melbourne Tram way Service can Confirm This Testi mony, which all Victorian Railway Scrvice Men should Read, In certain periods of the year the weak-chested man or women goes down to influenza and other chest ailments, yhey cannot be too careful. Here is an instance where influenza was followed by pleurisy, but this great medicine, as usual, worked wonders in restoring health. Read this letter (written from 42 Bladen-street, East Brunswick, Mel bourne, 2/4/'12) CLEMENTS TONIC LTD. " The end of December, 1911,1 caught cold, and was laid up with pleurisy, which became serious. Two doctors attended me ; for three days my tem perature was 104 deg. My life was despaired of, but through tho doctor's advice I live to-day. He advised my wife to get Clements Tonic for me, that 'there was life in that medicine.' 1 am convinced that when he said • LIFE IN CLEMENTS' they were the truest words he ever uttered. I am sure I would have been in my resting place only for that grand medicine. My wife paid 2/3 FOR THE SMALL BOTTLES. HAD SHE PAID £40 she , I would have had GOOD VALUE FOR 1 THE MONEY. I have seen a lot of testimonials about Clements Tonic in books and papers, but what I find fault I I with is that EVERY WRITER HAS UTTERLY FAILED TO GIVE A PROPER VALUE OF THAT MEDI CINE. You may use this as you think fit." (Signed) CHARLES ROCK.
