K the money could not be borrowed at 4 per cent, he thinks the Go- vernment should guarantee the interest. To develop an estate properly £100,000 might be required ; but an income of £50 per year from each farm would pay the interest and provide a sinking fund, which would enable the holders to secure their, farms free of debt in twenty- two years at ^he outside.. In the case of an estate capable of providing 140 farms of 160 acres each,'he thinks it would be reasonable to expect the gross value of the yearly out- put to-average between j £70,000 and £80,000, if the cultivation were judiciously varied, iln Canada, where he has lived, too much dependence is placed on grain growing, with the result that the risk is greater than it should be, and much of the land is getting worked out. "I am sure," he states, " that no difficulty Would be experienced in securing men who would put from £300 to £400 worth of stock on each farm, winch would be equal to the security . an English landlord has, or ex pecte.*
