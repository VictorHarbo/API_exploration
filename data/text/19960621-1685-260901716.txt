He said the operation had involved “wide-ranging co operation with other coun tries” and “a number of agencies” as well as the Australian Security Intelli gence Organisation, the Australian Federal Police, Victoria Police and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. However, he had called for an investigation into why the operational details were revealed in the media so extensively.
