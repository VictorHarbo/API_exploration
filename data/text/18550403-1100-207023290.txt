MISCELLANEOUS SHIPPING. The following vessels are expected at this port from Melbourne:—Albion, early; Scotia, early; Nonpareil, about sailing; Freak, early ; White Swan (steamer), Highland Lassie, Colchester. The Ocean Chief, the first of the Black Ball Line of Packets direct to this port, arrived in the Cove at 0 p.m. yesterday (Sunday) evening, after a splendid run of 72 days 7 hours from Liverpool, bringing news to the 10th January inclusive, being four days later than that received by the Lightning, which arrived in Melbourne on the 20th inst. The Ocean Chief is of a similar build to the Indian Queen, which left here on the 17tli, the only apparent difference between them being that one has a flush, and the other a poop deck. She brings, in addition to a huge cargo, 384 immigrants, all, with the exception of four, under the bounty regula tions, classified as follows, viz.:—Married men, 55; married women, 57; single men, 100; single women, 58; and 114 children. There were five female and four male deaths during the voyage, and six births—one premature. The immigrants appear robust and respect able, and their appearance, as well as the cleanliness of the ship, does credit to themselves and their gallant captain and officers. It may be doubted, indeed, whether such a respectable body of immigrants has ever before entered this port. This is the second voyage the Ocean Chief, has made to these colonies, her former one to Melbourne last year being accomplished in 72 days. Then, as well as now, she was the bearer of late and important news. On perusing the log which was politely tendered to the representatives of the press by Captain Tobin, we find that the greatest distance run in one day during the passage was on the 27th February, being 303 knots. The ship was then 40 days at sea, and was in lat. 47 ° 13' south, Ion. 19 ° 7' east, the wind blowing from the W.S.W. This day large icebergs were in sight. On the 26tli February, Match 7th, and 11th, 300 knots were run. The shortest distance run was seventy miles, on the 22nd February. The average number of miles per day, during every ten days of the passage was 150, 158, 161, 170, 240, 239, 192\. Captain Tobin reports experiencing throughout the voyage light winds. Saw a large steamer on the 13th February, in lat. 29 ° 11' south, Ion. 32 ° 14' west; supposed her to be the Great Britain, from Melbourne. The Black Ball Line seem determined to maintain their name for quick passages, this one being the quickest to Yan Diemen's Land on record. The Ocean Chief will therefore add another laurel to the crown, which the spirited and enterprising proprietors of the line have so justly earned and deserve.—H. T. M. The Lady Jocf.lyn.—This vessel, on her homeward passage, was obliged to put into Falkland Isles for a supply of live stock, on account of bad weather, expe rienced soon after leaving Melbourne, causing serious loss. She did not touch at St. Vincent. The Lady Jocelyn experienced very adverse weather during the passage. Prevailing easterly winds from Port Phillip to Cape Horn, throughout the regions of the S.E. trade winds from N. to N.E., (which necessitated the ship putting into Bahia for coals, at which port she was de tained two days more than was necessary for such pur pose, on account of being put in quarantine, although no sickness existed on board. Experienced good N.E. paaes ana favourable weatner since, sue ieii m with, icebergs on her passage to Cape Horn, and reports from the Falkland Isles affirm the existence of great quanti ties of ice in lower latitudes than usual this year. The GirsEY Bride.—This fine new ship, one of the Liverpool packets, is expected to clear at the Customs on Saturday, and sail on Sunday morning. She will take home a fair number of passengers, and a consider able quantity of gold-dust. ENGLISH SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE. SHIPPING LAID ON FOR THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES.
