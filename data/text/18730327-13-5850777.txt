SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. INTRODUCTION. There has been very little excitement in the political world during the past month. Parliament stands prorogued until the 15th of April, but it is not likely to meet until early in May. The late Governor, His Excellency "Vis- count Canterbury, having left the colony by the last mail, his Honour Sir W. F. Stawell, Chief Justice, was sworn iii as Acting Governor on Monday, tho 3rd of March. He left for England by the Somersetshire yesterday, and our new Governor, Sir GEOROE BOWEN, is now on his way from Sydney to Vic- toria. It is expected that he will arrive and be sworn in on Saturday. Ho arrived in Sydney by the Hero, from New Zealand, on Monday night, and thero found awaiting him H.M.C.S.S. Victoria, with the lion, the Commissioner of Customs on board, ready to welcome him. The recommendations of the late Inter- colonial Conference are already beginning to bear fruit. A telegram was received from the Secretary of State foi" the Colo- nies on Tuesday, intimating that, in ac- cordance with the recommendation of the delegates in conference assembled, and communicated to the Imperial Govern- ment by telegram, Her Majesty's Go- vernment would immediately introduce a bill to remove the restriction on inter- colonial tariff arrangements. This cour- teous deference to the wishes of the colonies will be thoroughly appreciated here, and it proves the wisdom of tho course adopted by the representatives of Victoria at the Conference, who opposed a much more comprehensive proposition which was laid before the delogates, to the effect that it was necessary that tho colonies should have power to make in- dependent fiscal treaties with foreign powers. In the concession which has been made, the colonies have got all tlicy could reasonably ask for, and it now remains to bo seen what they will do with tho privi- lege which has been accorded to them. It is not at all improbablo that those who are afflicted with the protectionist craze may protest against the products of a neighbouring colony being admitted to compete upon something like equal terms with their own produce. Stranger things have been witnessed in Australia, but we roust wait for the full results of the pro- posed chango until the promised measure has passed the Imperial Parliament. Great regret was felt hero that the con- sideration of thefuturepostalarrangements between Great Britain and the Austra- lian colonies had been necessarily inter- rupted by the Ministerial crisis which had taken place at home. Now that the crisis is over, it is hoped that no time will be lost in settling the matter in accordance with the recommendations of the Conference. Webb's service via New Zealand and San Francisco has broken down, in consequence of the United States Legislature having refused the subsidy asked for, upon Uie receipt of which Mr. Webb confi- dently relied. It seems probable that the arrangements for another service by this route will be left in the hands of the Government' of New South Wales. If tho communication «iii Gallo and Suez is arranged to tho satisfaction of this colony, it is very likely that Parliament may also resolve to subsidise a powerful steam service via the Cape of Good Hope, principally with the view of giving in- creased facilities to the passenger traffic between Great Britain and Victoria. The new four per cent. Victorian loan is being slowly but gradually taken up, and the Government are under no appre- hension as to the result. Thoy havo moro funds from this source now in hand than they will require to oxpend on public works authorised to be constructed out of the loan during 'the ensuing finan- cial year, which commeribes on the 1st of July next. Thero is now standing to the credit of tlio new stock £012,900, of which £110,160 has been subscribed for by the outside public. Tho balance is represented by trust fund's and Govern- ment five per cent, debentures which have been converted. A copy of tho proposed treaty between Victoria and Now South Wales, relative to the collection of customs duties upon the border, will bo found in another column. It will probably be presented to the Legislature of New South Wales during next week, and as soon as a mea- sure authorising it is passed, it will be- come law, and a^ very fruitful source of annoyance to the residents of both colo- nies at and near the border will bo re- moved. Sii' Charles Gavan Duffy has taken the public into his confidence once more. A fow evenings since ho spoke at a dinner of the St. Patrick's Society. Ho thought it necessary to explain why he accepted the distinction of knighthood at the hands of Her Majesty's Government. Sir Charles pretends to imagine that the honour was conferred upon him because the Earl of Kimberley considered Vis- count Canterbury did not treat him well in refusing him a dissolution, when by a vote of the Legislative Assembly ho was driven from office. The public hove re- gard this as another of Sir Charles's hal- lucinations. The acceptance by tho Hon. A. Michie, Q.C., of the office of agent-general has created a vacancy in the repre- sentation of the Central Provinco in tho Legislative Council. There aro two candidates for the seat, Mr. T. J. Sumner, a leading merchant, and Mr. A. K. Smith, a member of the City Council. . Tho contest is likoly to be a close ono. SOCIAL. . Viscount Canterbury, the Viscountess, and the members of nis Excellency's family, left Victoria by the P. and O. Co.'s steamer Mooltan, which sailed on the 2nd Mnrch. The leavetaking was very simple. A large r number of ladies and gentlemen went ^ down to Sandridge to seo tlio Governor off. Many were deprived of the opportunity of witnessing the embarkation. It was fixed for noon, but the mail steamer was delayed on the passage fiom Sydney to Mel- bourne by bad weather, and aid not arrive in Ilobsoii's Bay until late in the forenoon. The departure was therefore put off until the evening, but a'portion of the public did not hear of the change, though warned before- hand that a change would probably be made, and poisons trooped down to Sandridge at tlie wrong time. The Governor embarked at 5 o'clock. The garrison force, under Captain Stubbs, constituted the guard of honour. fA salute was fired by the Metropolitan Al tillery, on Sandridge* beach. The Chief Secretary (Mr. Francis) and the other Ministers, as well as Sir Willilnn Stawell, the Chief Justice, accompanied His Excellency in tho steamer v.hith conveyed linn and his family to the nnil ship lite crowd on the pier cheeied the Gov ernor y ery warmly Sir William Stawell, the chief justice, vv is sworn in as administiator of the govern mont on Monday, the 3rd of Mareil The new Governor,

When the Land Act of 1862 was in operation, portion of the run was thown open for selection, but steps were taken to secure it for the Ware family, and some 11000 acies were taken up by one means or another. Only £1 per acre was given for it and it is now stated to be worth over £50,000 so that a handsomome profit would be realised for it if it were sold.

He was standing under a burning tree, when the tree fell in a direction which he did not expect. The upper branches struck him on the head and knocked him down. Mr. Mac knight was born in Scotland in 1819, and was a grandson of the late Rev Dr Mac knight, of Edinburgh. He came to this colony m 1841 and duimg tho following year took up a station at Campbell s Cteek near Castlemaine. Early in 1841 he went to the Western distnct, and shortly afterwaids settled near the spot at Dunmore, where he died. Mr Macknight recently became the purchaser of the station, which was formerly owned by him in conjunction with Mr. Irvine. Mr. Macknight was well known as an accomplished gentleman and his intelli- gent and urbane disposition won him many friends. His views on many subjects of in terest to landholders have been rendered familiar fiom letteis written by him in the Economist, The Australain and other journals. He had also broken a lance in favour of the principles of total abstinence, of which he was an ardent advocate.

Messrs It GoLDSimouoii and Co report -" Wool -At the date of our report of last month tho season was nearly over, and since then tho sales hold havo boen comparatively unimportant, tho total catalogued bolng 2,307 bales, and tho sales effected, Including some lots held over from lost month, being about 1,700 bales The prices realised show a further rcduc tion, tho unsatisfactory advices from the English market having had a depressing effect During tlio month telegrams have continued to arrive from Lou don w ith further particulars of the decline which has been established at tlio Fobruory and March sales, and there is now no reason to doubt that a ro duction which has bcon variously estimated at from 2d to 3d per lb when compared with Novcmbor rates, has been established A decline to this extent was almost generally oxpectcd at the Viay sales, as it was evident to the truie that a maintenance of the extreme values current during a portion of 1872 could not be oxpectcd Bilyera on this side wero preparing themsohes, and reducing their pi lees for some time past in anticipation of this, but thoy certainly did not expect that tho reduction would bo made so early as It has been, thcro being a confident belief that February rates would bo, at least, equal to thoso of the previous sales of November It was known that stocks were very limited, and it was thought that manufacturers would bo obliged to operate to keep their machinery in work Lven in England, almost up to tho day tlio sales commenced, confident anticipations of firm prices were prevalent, and our correspondents, wilting on tho 24tit January, look hopefully forward to the result of the iobruary Bales, though thoy seem equally con fldent that a reduction must bo oxpectcd In May Tho reduction was suro to como sooner or later, and it would appear that it ina simply been established three months earlier than was provided for Probably now that a moro healthy tono has been brought about, and wool has assumed moro nearly ita legitimate value, the futuro sales of tho year may progresa quito aa well as was ox- pectcd, tlio only disappointment being to those who got their wool forward for the earliest sales of tho year, in the hopo that they might thus bo ablo to secure a repetition of tho almost unprece- dented figures which were current in February, 1872 Tho Indications look promising for a fairly prosperous year, and when wool is obtainable at prices which will afford tho manufacturer a roosonablo remuneration for his capital and labour, we have littlo doubt tho trade will he
