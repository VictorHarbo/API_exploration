The following Circular accompanied the Votingpapers at the PoU of Parents and Guardians of Children attending the State Schools taken in 1832 :— TO PARENTS OR GUARDIANS OF CHILDREN ATTENDING THE STATE SCHOOLS. You are probably aware that since the passing of the present Education Act in 1S75 it has not been allowable to read the Bible during school hours, aud that the Act requires that the parents of at least ten children shall send a written request to tha Minister for Education before it can be read even out of school hours. The difficulties of regular Bible-reading before school hours under the present Act are very great. The Bible i=i consequently only read in 41 schools out of 471.. This small number does not include any of the largest schools. Moreover, the Sunday-school Union has proved by statistics that a very large number of the children in the colony attend no Sunday-school. It ia but too evident that very manjr children are being allowed to grow up without Bible teaching. We belie*o this to be dishonouring to GOD. and certain to cause results disastrous to the moral welfare of the colony. We believe also that most of those whose children attend the State schools would like Bible instruction of a systematic kind to be given, so that the children should understand its history, truths, and moral precepts. Such teaching is given in Government schools in London, and genera Uy throughout England, and no complaints are made of the system. It has been carried out in schools in Adelaide not under Government with entire success, almost all the children attending the Bible lesson. No denominational teaching would be allowed : selected portions similar to Uiose adopted by the London School Board would be read; no parent who objected would be required to send his child to the Bible lesson; and children so exempted would be otherwise instructed during that lesson, which would, therefore, be perfectly voluntary. We strongly feel that the wishes of the minority ought not be suffered to overrule I'uose of the majority. The object of this poll is definitely to ascertain the numbers of the parents for and against this Biblereading- In adopting this nlan we are foUowing llie example af the sister colony of New Zealand, where the results of the poll have revealed the fact that a vast majority of tne parents are in favour of Biblereading—in Hawke's Bay, over 4 to 1; in Otago, over 7 to 1; and in Canterbury, 11 to 1. Signed on behalf of the Committee, MORGAN LLOYD, Hon. Sec. Bible in State Schools Society. April 14. 1RS2. the following was the question asked:—No. 2. "Are you in favour of selected portions of the Bible being read and explained daily in the public schools (with leave to parents who object to have thenchildren exempted from such tsaciiing) Witli request for reply, "Yes" or "No." Given below is the exact wording of the present Education Act and the Regulation in force, that the public, and especially the parents directly interested, may judge as to the general fairness of the Circular issued by tne Bible in State Schools Society:— Clause 9. In every public school four and a half hours at least shall be set apart during each schoolday for secular instruction only; and such school* may open in the morning a quarter of an hour least before the time fixed for such secular instructions to commence, for the purpose of reading portions of the Holy Scriptures in the authorized or Douay version. The attendance of children at such reading shall not be compulsory, and no sect arian or denominational religious teaching sLuIl I13 allowed in any school. REGULATION XII '—BIBLE- BEADING. 96\. The teacher rosy read portions of the Holy Scriptures in the authorized or Douay version to such of his or her scholars as may be sent by their parents for not more than half an hour before 9.30 a.m. The attendance of children at such reading shall not be compulsory; and co sectarian or denominational religious teaching shall be allowed in any school—the teacher must strictly confine himself or herself to Bible-readir. ^. 97\. Should the parents of not less than ten children attending any school send to the Council a written request that the Bible may be read in the schoolroom as above provided, the Council may require the teacher of such school to comply with the request. The following statement shows how the parents of children attending our State Schools voted with regard to Bible-reading in the public schools. The votes are arranged according to the new Electoral Districts :— Yes. No. For. Agst.
