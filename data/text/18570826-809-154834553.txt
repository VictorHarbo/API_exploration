The voyage has been a tedious one. Soon after leaving Liverpool she had light winds, which lasted for 21 days, during which time she made only 000 miles. She is the ship advertised us tho 12tli May Packet of the Bluok Ball Line, to sail from Liverpool ub the Eurocly don, the namo being changed in consequence of change of ownership. The Mermaid, Northumberland, und Austral, the latter for Geelong, have arrived from London. The Itoyal Mail ship Emeu was not to leave Sydney until the 11th September. Tim Monica.— The Hue ship Monica, Captain Jackson, ar rived yesterday, after an excellent passage of 8G days. This is the first sailing ship that has supplied us with later English news since the resumption of the mail steam line and Captain Jackson has politely furnished us with files to tho date of sail ing, viz., 23rd May. She brings 430 immigrants, classified as follows :— 50 married couj.'ios, 189 single women, 151 children. There has been no sickness during the passage, and tho extra ordinary cleanliness of the ship with so many souls on board, as also the very healthy Etate of the passengers, reflects the highest credit on the surgeon and officers of the ship. Captain J»ckson, on his last voyage to Melbourne, made the passage out in 69 days. On the present occasion, he was 18 days to Madeira, 32 days to the line, 52 to the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope, and 77 days to Capo Otway, No vessels connected with the colonies have been spoken. The Triton, an American clipper, of 2000 tons, sailed from Liverpool for Melbourne, on the same day, with 700 passengers.— Sydney Herald, 19th August. Lamentable Occuiibexce. -The arrival of the Dauntless, yesterday morning, brought us the melancholy intelligence of the death, by drowning, of Mr James M'Coll, master of the Osprey, better known in his former capacity of mato of tho Wonga Wonga. The vessel was on her way to Monganui ?when tho accident occurred. The details to hand are very meagre, but it would appear that tho Osprey was caught, etrly on the morning of l-'riday the 10th instant, in the com mencement of tho late gales ; and that tho deceased, in exert iug himself to save his vessel from tho effects of the squall, was knocked overboard by the boom. The Osprey, at the time, was far out from the land, a gale blowing and a heavy pea running; nothing, consequently, could be done to save the deceased, who, unfortunately, was not a swimmer. The Os Srey, in a dilapidated condition, was brought into Monganui y the mato and crow, whence she was taken to tho Bay of Islands. Mr M'Coll was well and favorablyknown as a young man of energetic habits and obliging disposition, and his un timely fate is universally deplored. — Southern Cross, 21st July.
