MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL; j Tlio mouth wliioli lins elapsed since the pre paration of our last summary of news, haa produced littlo of importouco affecting business operations. Every description of market hns equally suffered from the prevalent languor, n>,rl ttin fact is forced unon us that speculation in trado has elmost deserted us. Tho import- 1 ing oud wliolcsalo firms ore moro cautious than over in their dealings, and in tho face of tbo .

( Tho market for local securities has bton for many weeks past much depressed, and since the data of our last mail summary almost, every description of stock has declined. For the last fortnight business on tho Stock Exchange has almost been nominal, and last irtok could scarcely bo said to have existence, mi "tanner in which many of tho mi,,. Tho .. . -"n managed has dismisfr' ing compares have uv. ' _u many who would else havo nc«" '-.caned to speculate ; and, as a matter of cour- coutonted arc not too disminating. Almost the only transactions worth referring to hare "been in Colonial and National Bunk shares, nnd_ in tho stock of some of tho Gas Com panies nnd the Hobson's Bay Eaihvay. The oiodus from tho mining districts has additionally depreciated mining stock, nnd veiy fotv sales have been effected. Some of tho companies have adopted tho plan of letting on tribute, a system which many aro of opini will work admirably, both to tho advunta of tho shareholders and tho Iributees. How- ever, it is not, at any rate for the pro soot, likely to experience a fair trial as while wo writo it would seem as if tho whole male labouring population were about to leave us for Now Zealand.

There has been but a very limited amount business done this month in tho markets for imported goods from the causes already stated. Previously tho soft goods houses had not to anything like tho sarno extent as those engaged in other branches of trade experienced tho heaviness of commercial affairs gcnorully, but latterly they havo not been exempted from tho rulo which has so prejudicially operated against tho interests of their neighbours. Tho country storekeepers are over-stocked, nnd with decreasing means of quitting their goods their resources will bo severely tested. The English shipments of drapery ' nnd apparel havo been very heavy to all tho colonies, and the Otago market as wo have seen is by no means to be reckoned upon as a suro outlet for surplus stocks. The market lor alo and beer which bad been weak for a long time past has lately displayed indications of improve ment j tho homo advices notifying moderate shipments and a better demand having arisen, Bass's No. 3 in bulk which had declined to 18 is now in fair inquiry ut IS 10.-, Allsop's ruling a shade lower, and Marrian's and somo other bx-ands equal to it in reputation being held for 17 10s. Beer in glass has also ad vanced, Byass's and AUsopp's in good demand at 9s Gd to 10s, and Guinncss's stout, bottled by Burke, .commanding a ready sale at 10s Gd. Tho demand for building materials has been Tory limited of late, but holders aro san guine as to their prospects if shipments aro only moderate. Deals havo freely arrived lately, and for 9x3, 5jd to 5j|d was first obtained ; they bavo however sinco become dull of sale at tho lower price, tho country trade having completely stopped, largo quantities of Scotch flooring are recently to hand, nnd somo good parcels wcro sold at Inst quotations. Tho stock is still licnTy. Thoro is uo demand for doors and sashes. American lumber tongucd and grooved commands from 112 to 112 10s, nnd clear pine have been Bold at from L17 to 118 per thousand. A slight demand for Now Zealand has caused un improvement in tent canvas. Candles linvo receded in consequence of tho largo quantities arriving ; Belmont full weights are now quoted at 13d, and Neva Steariue 15d. Tho strike of the Newcastle coal miners not having ter minated, coals command a very high figure ; our quotations are from 50s to GOs, but theso must bo considered nominal only. Tho market is barely supplied with coffee, and Ceylon is chiefly in one hand; fornativo 8d is asked, and plantation 101 d to 10-ld. Provisions arc at present lower than they havo been Binco the commencement of the year, but a re-action is confidently anticipated. Tho low price of fresh meat lias seriously interfered with tho market for imported baths and bacon. Sin clair's hams aro at present quoted at from Hid to Is, and Coey'a lid to llid ; most other brands are at a nominal figure." Sinclair's hol lies are in moderate demand at lid ; and middles, 10id. For butter there is scarcely enquiry, and tho arrivals by tho Lightning and Matilda aro to a very heavy market. It is cortainthat tholocal production has superseded tho necessity for imported butter, and tho sooner English exporters aro ruudo acquainted tlin rnnl ill- CI ff »' ......i luw mo uwnur. oorao very lair samples havo been sold at auction nt from 3Sd to 6d ; nnd tho now stock, for which holde'rs continue to ask lid, will assuredly not roaliso that figure which is tho present quotation for fresh. The market for ehecso has beon greatly injured by largo parcels being forced into sale, nud tho consequence is that notwithstanding modcrato shipments tho best samplos will not bring more than lljd or Is. Sinco our last summary was despatched tho market for spirits has fluctuated consider ably. Brandy which hud shown symptoms of weakness has recently rallied, not because of an improved demand, but through the advices received by tho Northam further confirming previous reports as to the injuries to tho viucs in the Cognao district from tho hail storms which lmd occurred there. Tho stock" is heavy, and it seems that tho consumption is de creasing ; Martell's dark in bulk has been sold at 10s nnd _ Henncssy's at 9s Gd, and both brands are in great demand at theso prices. For case bramjfj there L? very little enquiry' — .cnova is almost unsnleamo, and wo havo heard of holders bying up at tho present quo tations. Both JDKZ and koy brands linvo toon offered recently at below 12s. Old Tom is dull of sale, and prices havo slightly reoeded. Bum of both high and proof is not -much inquired for, tho present quotation is 3s Gd. "With the exception of a limited demand which has arisen for low class port, .there is no ma terial movement in wines. Tho market is be coming baro of Mauritius sugars. Tho cargoes which havo recently been placed on tho market havo realised high figures, ration and counter particularly. Last week an advanco was established at auction of L5 per ton on tho former, and from LI to LI 10s on tho latter. Tho now crop is said to be very large anil in splendid condition, so that tho market is soon likely to bo easier. A solo of Cossipore yester day at L47 10s is reported in our ordinary commercial columns. Tho stock of tea has not been materially reduced during tho month, prices however have not declined. Tho Ame rican news received by tho mail lias caused holders of tobacco to decline selling except at their own prices. Barrett's twist is in' one hand, and is held for Ss. Very few sales havo taken place, the demand not being urgent, and an impression existing that tho civil war will not bo protracted. Twist, of other brands than Barrett's, is nominally qnotcd nt 2s to 2s Gd ; half-pound lumps, Is Gd to Is lOd ; and ten's, in J boxes, Is 4d to Is 8d. Tho market for oils and paints is very dull. Colza, in drums, is quoted nt 5s ; and in bulk, 43 Gd ; Chinese, in this, 4s 9d to 5s. Boiled linseed, in drums, 3s 8d ; raw do, 3s Gd. Turps, 4s Gd to -Is 9d ; best white paint, L3S ; red lead, L2G ; colours, L2G to L28. A better inquiry existed for galvanised iron early in itlio month, but it has since considerably abated. In motels generally there is no change to report. There is no sale for alkalies just at present; soda crystals have beon quitted at auction nt L6 10-. Tho condition of the market for breadstuff- and horsefeed is disclosed in - tho following summary for tho month prepared by Mr. IV. Lawranee : — Immediately after tho closing of iu.'t English mail, tho market for breadstuffa showe":! an inclination to improve. Millers' stocks became lo" - ' ' ' 1 IP . " "i olid tn£y Weiv | forced into iieat markcl> nn(i in consc. qfit-ico a steady improvement in wheat and flour continued Until tho 10th inst., wlion the arrival at Sydney of tho Curlow, with a cargo of wheat from California, checked business. This arrival was followed by tho H. W. Alroy nt snmo port, and the Alcyone hero. The advices reach down to 29th July, at which time in all about fivo cargoes of breadstuffa nnd grain woro loading and dispatched for this port, nnd seven for Sydney, the quantity being about 5000 tons breadstuff's for this port, and a quantity rather under that for New South Wales. The result of this iinpotation from California is traccnblo to a sudden rise in wheat in the neighbouring colonies early in February, and un attempt at speculation, founded upon the wot weathor, which retarded our harvest, and did damage in con sequence to the crops. From that date till tho 1st May prices woro well maintained, -when n sudden riso in inland carriage, and a pressure to realise stocks in tho up-country districts, prices gnvo way. Heavy markets ruled until tho 1st inst., as noticed. It is possible that adviceB which would have gone forward to California in Mny, reaching there in August, might have caused a restriction of orders, but it is too problematical to placo much reliance on this issue. If the shipments aro not in excess of the quantity indicated, they will not seriously affect this market ; were tho' entire importations surplus at tho end of tho year,- it' would be'whnt this colony should never have — less "stock in hand;" yot it is pretty ap parent that tho importers cannot look forward to any very remunerative profit, as the prices ruling and likely to rule during the tinio given for tho execution of tlic orders in California,' will bo fdnnd too high for the prices ruling hero on their arrival, uuloss some unlookod for change takes place. In horsefceding grain prices have somewhat fluctuated, . but tho indications nro downward. Tlio wea thor still continues wet anil changeable; however,- reports from nil tho agricultural dis tricts nro favourable, nud an abundant crop of cereals is in prospect, but tho present appear ances indicnto that the harvest will be a month Inter than usual. Parliament met on tho 30th ult., and most of the timo since has been oc cupied in discussing tlio legality of the Govern ment, some timo ago, granting. -occupation licences for agricultural purposes without the authority of an act of Parliament. On tho 22nd proximo tho Ministerial budget will be tabled in tho Assembly. Considerable interest is excited on tho subject, as before understood that n revisod tariff will also bo submitted, with tlio purpose of imposing import duties on many -articles of consumption, grain nnd bread- stuffs not excepted; but as differences exist . within the Cabinet and their supporters with out in theso matters, it is difficult to anticipate tho changes contemplated, or how tlicy are to bo brought about. Flour: Tho imports for past month are to nil . average extent, during tho present they are rather in excess, and consist of 1200 tons colonial, while the exports aro on tho increase, during the present month they will exceed in all 500 tons, a considerable portion being for Now Zealand. The 1G0 tons Californian, per St. Jean, barely realised L13 per fton net, being old flour, and mark and brands unknown, the price given was considered its value. Prices of flour advanced, until the 17th instant, when tlio advices from California checked business, but as yet has not : influenced prices in nny .degreo. Should export orders continue, it is fidly expected no great reaction will take plops, as they may neutralise tho effect of the Cali fornian shipmonts now afloat, as stocks in meantime aro by no means heavy. Barrel flour is worked out, and there aro no advices of ship ments of this sort, whilo at samo timo there is a probability of our having to draw an oxtrn month's consumption from present stocks and theso imports in the prospect of a lato harvest. Wheat : Imports .for past and present month nro moderate, and wcro not sufficient to nicot tho demand, tho onlv parcels of foreign for somo timo being about 1GOO bushels per St. Jean, and 20,00 bushels per Aloyono ; prices Blightly advanced, reach ing 5a 6d to 63 for Victorian and Tasmnnian, and 6s Gd to Gs 9d per bushel for South Australian. Tho imports advised or antici pated from California havo checked operations in moantimo ; if tlio quality of wbont coining forward is anything good, thoro must bo buyers found tor it, if not on millers' account as gene rally understood. A parcel of this description recently to hand per St. Joan, only fetched a prico equal to our most ordinary sorts of milling. Oats : Imports continuo moderate, and drawn from tho neighbouring colonies, with tho excoption of 2000 bushels recently to hand from California, which was quitted at Gd per bushel under last month's quotations. Barley : Somo importations of this grain lrnvo come forward from San Francisco also, but the market is dull, nnd tlio demand seems very languid. Maize : Imports are to a fair extont, and prices remain unchanged. Gram : Tliero is none held in first hands. Bran has been largely dealt in speculatively and for exporta tion, and prices linvo ndvanccd considerably. Oatmeal is in fair request ; prices are unchanged. Malt : Imports aro to a fair extent, prices have slightly, advanced, and holders seem more firm in their demands. Hay is un changed, hydraulic pressed is in good domnnd for exportation. Potatoes linvo fluctuated, but UJU11 IIIU iillviU U1U lUUrUUBCU 111 VU1UU( vulUllO aro unchanged.

Clough and Co.'s monthly report, dntod Melbourne, 24th September.— . .Wool: Our last report was per Benares, dated 24th ultimo, Binco which very few sales liavo taken place, nearly the whole production' (scoured and liand-washed wools) . being shipped on account of the ownoi-; prices therefore, here, are entirely nominal. The advices just received, of .the opening of tho London July Sales bIiow a considerable loss, to shippers, and will 110 doubt havo tlio effect of causing a reduction hero on tho prioos paid during la3t season. Tho now clip has com menced to arrive in Melbourne, and ilio brands wo havo already received into store nro both better in growth and condition than they wero last year, and it is 'reported that this will ho the case with this season's clip generally ; tho growers thoroforc in submitting to lower prices, will, to some extent, make up tho difl'ercnco by tho increased weight of their wool. The usual weekly sales hero will commence at our ware houses after arrival of English mail (duo here in October), which will bring advices of tho con- | elusion, or nearly so, of tho July- August series of sales, nnd tho opening prices hero will, of , course, depend entirely upon tho tenor of the , same.

A question of considerable importance to the commercial world connected with the Now Zealand goldfield has arisen. Tho Export Duty Act contains no provision remitting the duty on gold tho produco of tho other colonics im ported hero and re-shipped. As the Otago Government already charge an export duty, gold sent hero and ro- exported would, under tho present law, pay two imposts. In order to mako an alteration in tho law to meet the case and so retain our trade with Otago, which else would bo s'oriously in danger from tho com petition with Sydney, tho law of -that colony having provided for tho ro-sliipment of im ported gold, duty free, tho Collector of Cus toms lias introduced a bill in tho.Lcgislatiro Assembly. Tho second reading of the measure stands over until afior the recesB ; hut in the interval the Government will remit the duty on extra-colonial gold upon tho shippers giving security for its payment should it bo afterwards required from them. -Nothing definito has been arranged with regard to tho future of the Melbourno and Suburban Bailway, niattcr3 remaining very much as they were when wo last referred to this undertaking.
