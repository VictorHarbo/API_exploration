LAUNOESTON EXAM IN:E R. TUESDAY, JUNE 6, 1871. As if to make up for the want of punctuality; last month, the mails due this month have arrived-at least at Adelaide-several days in advance of contract time. Of course, all interest centres on France, and it is a matter of deep: regret to note that thes situation in that 'un happy country remains almost unchanged. The city of Paris is still held by, the insurgents in spite of the attempts of the Y?rsailles army to compel their capitulation, and the Germans still contin?o' in sight of it, ready: for action immediately the word is given. A' fearful thing it is thus to behold a people engaged in civil war, and especially a people in the condition of the French, with -the wounds of the German invasion not yet closed, The worst enemies of France-worse, by far, than ever the Germans were-are the inhabitants of Paris themselves, or rather the rabble of Paris, who have instigated this frightful .civil war at the very mo ment when France , needs the cordial union and co-operation of all her people to enable her to make headway against' the sea of troubles into which she was plunged by the unwarrantable declaration of war with Prussia. The situation is very aptly figured in a late cartoon in CCharivari, which repre sents France as prostrate on the ground, with two Frenchmen fighting by her side.. " Pick me up first of all," exclaims, she, "and then you can quarrel afterwards." "Th inhabitants of the ill-fated city are rehearsing: over again all the horrors of a siege-- ilood shed, starvation, disease, and slow, torturing death-and with a more hopeless prospect than the :former defenders of Paris; whilst the city which underwent without much. injury the bombardment of the Prbs sians is in danger of having the finest portions of it laid waste and in ashes by Frenchmen besieging French non Paris, the pride and yet the bane of France, now takes up arms against her own, and fills to the brim the cup of misery. And however undesirable it may be for the Germans to interfere with the internal government of the country, they will be compelled to do so if these frightful anarchical doings be much longer continued. Things cannot go on thus much longer. In some way or other law and order must be restored. It is dilflcult to see far ahead in' the midst of such confusion, but it is by no means im probable that these disturbances may open a way for the restoration of Napoleon III. not withstanding the mistakes of his policy and the disasters of the war. Supported by Ger. man bayonets, and by the large armies which were taken captive in the early part of the war, he may yet regain his lost position-and keep it too. Of one thing there is no doubt, namely, that whatever Government comes into power, must hbe one that will rest upon a physical force basis, or', it will ,not , stard.. , History; has already abundantly demonstrated this.: And, after all, Napoleon, is perhaps the man' best qualified to maintain a? position so sur rounded, with danger as that of '` ruler of France. The news by this mail does: not, as we have said, show much change: in the position of affairs. ' All attempts 'to conciliate' thie insurgents have failed-indeed it was absurd and useless to attempt such means with mrhe like athem, Reasoning 'is 'utterly thrown away upon them. Their 'cause, however, is said to have become critical. They have sustained heavy losses,'and, as might be expected, dissensions among the communal leaders have weakened their,a~ithority. Pro' visions are also failing.,~' eanwhile the Ver sailles army, 150,000 strong, is . gradually occupying the northern suburbs of Paris. We can only hope' that this state tf things may speedily put an end to these disturbances, and that France may soon be at peace once more, both within and without. Turning to home matters, we find that the now Budget is ''exceedingly unpopular, and ..that the, people. of ,England have ' been signifying , in very,:, un, mistakeable ' modes, their aversion::to in. creased 'taxation. They have ltasted the sweets of reduced taxation' and they halve a very decided objection to the least a'pproach of a return to the old state of affairse. "These demonstrations have had the effect of irdui cing Ministers to prbmise' that the moroeob noxious features of the financial" scheme ]lall be amended, and they will be the better ablo to fulfil this promise .seeing:; that the revenue returns have yielded ?. ore than was iaiticipated, and, poly leave half a million instead of onoe? million deficit to be provided for. It is worth7 if note 'that on' divisions the Goveiznment majorities aire not large, thereby confiraming the report that the ..Gladstonte' 'hi' stry is losing ground. mAotion for the die estab l ihmentfr"'h Se Church of Enghindf has been rejcted by. 374 votes to 80. Narly from the House on tiis division; but still the figures show` that ' there is at present. an overwhelming "njority a against such a proposal. Time, how. ever, works wonders. The Woman Suf- e frogo Bill shared a similar fate, though in this instance the majority was considerably s smaller. Coming to social topics, we observe 1 that the great International Exhibition has beoon opened, and that tlio news of the safoty'of Dr. Livingstone, the great African explorer, lias been confirmed. Fresh disturbances have evidently broken out in Ireland, for' the Haeas COpri?.s AotL.hsn;,beonstisponded in the county of Westmeath. It issatisfactory to know that the Alabama question is: in a fair way, of solution. + Thel American Government have signed a treaty riipointlnb'g finale arbitrators to" decide the Alabama claims, with power to take evi. deuce. This .is, tobo bindding on both Governmmots. ,. The foreign news is scanty.. Immense floods havo occurred in Amirsica in the States of Miaisisippi and Louisiana, caiusing groat ,destruction of property.. Some differences have arisen between Denmark and Prussia relative to "immigrants from Schleswig to Demark being called to military duty in the army." Our telegram does not state whether in the Danish or Prussian army, but in all probability the former is roferred to, for even should the Prussian Government con- template such an injustice Denmark would scarcely dare to remonstrate. We " do not - suppose, ''hboweve, any, thing' very seridous will, come out of these; Thlie Sltan .f Turkey and the KXhedive hu?e settled.theoi little quprrol amicably.. Boyond these items: there. is little, else worthy 'of remark. ' .... The news of the totalloess of tlioe spliedid new steamer the Queen of ~he Teanes, ot'e ir return maiden voyage from Melbourne to London, wilt throw: at ~least a partial gloom over many persons in: Australia, and' over 1some too in .Tasmania (several well- known residents .of Lannceston, with their families, having been passengers by thoe ill-fated vessel), for though our telegram states that all the passdigers' were" saved; still, rdlatives and friends at a distance cannot but feel anxious until assured of.their heallt andl satety, after. the exposure and 'privations to which tho? probably had to sullmit. The further, advance in wool, and tlhe larger sales on account of the renewal of Con tinental competition, will be welcomed 'by sheepownors in these colonies. We observe, however, that wheat; which, .'haccording to the t latest advices by tlhe 'prOious, mail, had risen,; lias receded, though our telegram does not say to what extent. : Sv r Michael O'Biri, wio last week was r sentenced to two years' imprisonment for,, o malioiosaly smashing' tbirty-sovon panes of . glass in Dr. Miller's house, is not a lunasto be is a conflrnrld' criiminal, 'and the safety of sooioety requires that bho, should be treated be S'sinuch. The lehaind :Judge, in sentencing him, Is read over the long array 'of offtnoes recorded d against him since his arrival in this colony, 'and correctly enough designated his character as desperate. ' It is really too bhad that such it unmitigated rascals should be permitted to prey on 'the community. O'Brien's- police a character disclosed the' following faots." He was tried in Ireland on 6th March?' 1845, on a charge 'of mirder, 'but was foned guilty of manslaughter, and during that year was transported to this' colony. .How he hasecon Ii duited himself "here may be' inferredi from e the following record : d Oct. 26,ld47'-,At'Flsgal, fouar ddsys' solihts a" .? :conflAemeotiort ;isrkig away S with rations.
