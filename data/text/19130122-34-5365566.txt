This wonderful remedy k prepared from a small plant growing on the borders of the great Egyptian deserts, the healing properties of which have been known for hundreds of years It is Nature's own antidote, and acts like a charm in cases of Sandy Blight and all diseases of the eye. Being a vegetable preparation it has a soothing effect, causing pain and inflamma- tion to disappear, and working a cure where all other remedies fail. ' Testimonials have been received from all parts of the world, and the following from Australia will prove the estimation in which it held by all who have tried it: "The Egyptian Eye Salve you sent me has acted like magic on my States eyes. She has been suffering from acute inflammation of the bus for the last five years, and has tried many remedies without Te ceiving any benefit, but with the Egyptian Eye Salve the result is different, and she is now cured." "Please send me another box at 'once, having proved its value, I do not like to be without at" Signed, R. E GARDINER Corowa, NEST.
