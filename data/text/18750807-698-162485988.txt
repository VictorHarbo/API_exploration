Nymph, which arrived from£England on^29th July, although a smalleV vessel, is ill every respect a sinter ship to the Blanche, which vessel she relieves. She left Spithead on 7th February, Sladeira 23itl February, and touched at St. Vincent's, leaving on Oie -^th Maroh, crossed the Equator on 17th March, under steam, in longtitude 17.29 W., reached the Cape of Good Hope, on 27th April, where she remained until 27th May. In run-, ning down her easting she was compelled to heave to frotn violent westerly gales on two occasions ; arrived at Fremantle on the 3rd July, and sailed again on the 5th ; arrived at Adelaide on the 13th and took her departui-e for this port on the 24th, and has thus made thfe trip from h6r last port in five days. That- she is a very ? smart vessel under* canvas may be ^gleaned from the fuct that between pipe Otway and, Sydney she logged. 240 knots in .18 horn's. The steamship St. Osvth, appointed to sail from Sydney to London on Saturday, 7tk Augi.it, has. in addition to 1950 tons coal; 'sufficient to enable her to steam the 'whole voyage^ the fol loning cngugements : — ^Saloon -passengers — Mrs. Allison, Misses- Allison- ^3), Master Allison, Mr. , and Mrs..

Cargo :— 2320 bales wool, 700 casks tallow, 219 casks cocoanut oil, 210 casks nickel and tin ores, 350 tons smelted copper, 380 tons smelted tin, 700 bags copra, 260 bale; leather, 500 bags flour, 2350 cases meats, 170 tons bark, 270 hogsheads rum, 30,000 treenails, 60 cases glue, 45 cases pcarlsliell, with sundry other cargo. The latest addition to our colonial fleet arrived on 29th J uly, from London. . The Woollahra, barque, purchased by Captain Bremiier, is a vessel of a very high* class, ana has evidently been fitted with all the most modern appliances, and is a valuable acquisition to our mercantile marine. She left the Downs on the 15th, and passed the Lizard on the 18th of April. Had light N.E. trades. Crossing the Equator on 2'th May in longitude 25* W. The S. E. trades were picked up in latitude 4* S., and were parted with in latitude 24* S., hut proved very poor throughout. Passed the meridian'of the pa^je of Good Hope on 28th June; -in latitude 48 S., on which parallel she made her easting. On 23rd J une sighted a large iceberg. On 25th June, latitude 47- S„ longitude 5'11 W., experienced a very violent gale from the X.W. Cape Otway was passed on 27th July during a strong S.W. gale, which has accompanied the ship to arrival. In working up this harbour with the steam tug Manly towing, she got ashore on the reef off Bradley's Head.' -The! vessel had gone in stays, wind stroftg from the westward, and had got well filled on 'the starboard tack when the steamer plucked her so. much to windward that the barque got aback, and, the steamer parting the hawser, the vessel shot astern, and her heel took the ground near the obelisk marking the measured mile distance. Assistance was fortunately at hand. The steam-tug Prince Alfred, being in Woolloomboloo Bay, promptly came' to her aid, and safely towed her off, appa rently without her having sustained any damage. Theship Midlothian aurived on 1st August fromGlasgow bringing a very large cargo of general merchandise. She left Glasgow on the Mth April, passed Greenock on the 30th, . and had fresh westerly breezes until reaching the N'.li. trade's, which were pitted 'up in 31* X. Crossed the Equator on the ?8th May in longitute 43«W.'- The S.E. trades, -which proved fresh, com menced on . that day and lasted until reaching 27' S. was off the Cape of, Good Hope on the 27t)i .Tune, and was detained there for'. 14 days by light airs and c&ims.; She ran down her east ing' between ' . the parallels of , 43 and 44, strong westerly winds prevailing with high sea, the vessel shipping large quantities of water, founded Cape Otway on the 27th July, and off 'the Howe encountered a! titrongS. S.W. g«le and heavy «ea. which looted for two days, the ship being hove to under easy canvas for 36 hours. Captain Murray reports having spoken the ship Pleiades from New Zealand bound to London, on the 2nd June, in' ,12.41 S, and 31.13 W. The ship Falstatf frail 'Liverpool, passed 'Tosca on the 14th Jtwe. and had favourable winds -until the 25th, when she picked up the N.E. trades in 38 N. Crossed the Equator on the 11th June in longitude- 25 W. . Had fresh S.E. trades and passed, the meridian of tjip Cape of GoodJJope on the 8th July; ran down .her easting in a .parallel .of 45., fresh northerly winds prevailing.' Passed through Bass9 Struts on the 28th inly, and on the follow ing day experienced h strong gale veering from S.E. to S.W. blowing ham with v. high confused sea, the vessel shipping large quantities of water, ran before it, and ' ultimately made the land off Nobby's, on -the 40th, at 4 p.m. Passed a ship on the 29th July, showing T. M. R. G. The Falstaft', now on her first voyage, is an iron vessel of 1410 tons register. She was built by the Barrow Shipbuilding Company, and is a handsome specimen of naval architecture. Her present passage of 76 days from Tusca is a sufficient proof of her sailing qualities. * The fine Ship British Sceptre, Captain Jahnke, which arrived from London on 1st August, is the vessel and captain, which reseucd-the survivors of the ill-fated immigrant ship Cospatxick, burnt at sea in December last. Captain - Jahnke has on board a Valuable chronometer, besides a number of addresses which were presented to him 6n his arrival in London as a recognition of his conduct on the melancholy occasion. Of the present passage Captain Jahnke reports that he left Gravesend on the 11th April, and cleared the Channel on the 13th with a fine easterly wind. After getting well to the westward, had a continuance of southerly and westerly winds, which with very poor N.E. trades, only caniM her to 40 X. and 91 W., in -8 days. Here the vessel was becalmed for 18 days, ? SI other sail being in sight during that time, aad she did not cross the Equator until the 27th day, being then 47 days out. 8he crossed in 25 W. and had no K.K. trades until reaching 4 8. They proved moderate and were lost in 29 ff. and 33 W, Qn the 8Ut June met with an easterly wind, which lasted five da vs. the ship Star of China, bound to New Zealand with passengers, btmg in company ; rounded the Cape of Good Hope on. the 27th | ran domi her casting on Apftr&llel; of 46*30 ; on 7th Juiy while run ning.before a heavy gale and high seathemaintopsail sheet earned away, which brought the vessel to the wind. ? The gale blew with hurricane force, the crane of lower foretopsail yard, parcel i of upper foretopsail yard, and the foretopmsst being considerably damaged. On the 15th July, during a heavy S.W. gale, shipped a heavy sea, which carried away the binnacle aud' compass, smashed the skylight, and filled the cabin with water, tortu natcly the two men at the wheel were made fast to the mtzzcu boom, or in all probability thev would have been washed over board. Passed through Bass' Straits on the 29th July, and expe I ripneed favourable weather on the coast. | Tni: SEAr. Rock Light.—' The material for the erection of the new light to be placed on the Seal Rock was safely landed on the reel from the Baliina (s.) on Tuesday last. The same evening a g-.'le set in, but fortunately not before the business of landing had been completed. The work will now be rupidly procecdcd with and this dangerous reef will very soon be illuminated by a first class light. 1 Totai. Wreck of the Snrp Naval Brigade. — By telegram received on Tuesday afternooii, from Brisbane, we learn ot the total loss of the abovenamed vcsseToa No. 1 Island Falkland Beef, and that all Hands had been saved. The Naval Brigade was a barque, of 554 tons register, and arrived- at Xown8V^'e with passengers from Qneenstown (Ireland), on 6th June. She had nbt taken 'her departure up to the 17th July, and was doubtless bound to some Easkra port in ballast. She is owned by Messrs. Taylor, lieUiel, and Co., London. , Messrs. Mason, Brothers, are the agents for the ship Midlo thi&Jvfrom; TJlfcko'w:, w-hich arrived on Sunday. , 1 Th? ship Surrey is 'y« In quarantine,' and it is uncertain when she will be released. Her emigrants are classified as follows : — 10 married- couples, 104 single men, 76 single women, and 61 ! children. There have been but few fixtures for foreign ports during the past month, and present quotations maybe regarded ns almost nominal.

Telegrams from India, China, and San Francisco quote the selling prlt-es of cool to be unrcmuneratlve.

Floating Wreck. — A small portion of 'floating wreck has been picked up by Captain M'Arthur of the schooner Maid of Erin, on the passage from Tasmania. The schooner put into Hummock . Island for shelter, and while there a vessel's skylight was pitted up. It is made of hardwood, and measures ubout 4 feet by 3 feet, and is: in a state of good preservation. The canvas cover is painted white, and has a fringe all round it. The skylight lias been brought across, with a view to identification. The head of a topmast and two knees were found lying on the beach, but beyond these and the skylight no other wreckage was visible.— Argus, July 29. ' The ship Harkaway, from London for Sydney, was spoken by the Loch Katrine about 300 miles to the vVestwurd ol' Tristau d'Acunha. — Argus, July 27. Wreck of the ship Isabella. — Tlie schooner Cui'iMinbene lias arrived in port, bringing with'' her the master, mate, and eight seamen from the Isabella, who -were' picked up by Cap tain M'Gee eight miles north of Cape Upstart, on the 11th -July. The Isabella, belonging to Plymouth, was bound from Newcastle to Hongkong, laden with, coals. She had on board, besides the ! crew of sixteen men, twelve Chinese passengers. On the 4tli . July she struck on the Bellona Reef, which we believe is in the \- neighbourhood of New Caledonia, but. in the absence of the Ilnrbour-master wc are unable to refer to the charts. The vessel ! was evidently out of her course, and the captain accounts for j this by an error in his chronometer. ? The crow left the Wreck and landed on fan island 15 miles distant from the scene of the disaster. ? Here, as it was found the boat was overloaded, six of the men re-. 1 maihed; but as we are told tbcre was no water, and the. men had to eat the flesh and drink the bjood of the birds they .killed, we : fear unless they are speedily rescued their chance of life will be a , small one. Tlie Chinese decided to remain by the wreck, having a \-- boat hanging at the davits, and -if the vessel holds together they ; will be ablc(t-- exist on the provisions on board. But tiie boister i ous weather that lias lately prevailed will not, we fear, have long 1 spared the unfortunate ship, and those left behind are by this i ; time. In all probability, gathered to their forefathers. Telegrams | ' have'been 'sent -to Brisbane, and Hie Government will, no doubt) 1 take measures for the rescue of the six seamen and any other sur : vivors.1 — Port Denison Times.

ARRIVAL OF THE SCHOONER SOUTHERN' ClfO.SS DISMASTED. The schooncr Southern Cross left Newcastle, bound for Sydney, on the 27th ultimo, with a fine N.W. breeze, which la.-tcd until making Cape Three Points. The wind then suddenly shifted to S.W., blowing a violent gale, in which the' schooncr 'lost all her head sail. The gale lasted, without any intermission, until tiie 31st, by. which time the-vessel had driven 150 miles from the land. A terrific sea was prevailing the whole time, nnd when the gale ' abated the vessel rolled very heavily, bringing dpwn the foretop mast; the maintopmast also came down bv the run, the heel being driven through the deck. The head of the mainmast has been carried away near the bound, and the bulwark-; fore and aft have all been -washed away. A new -suit of sails were also blown away during the gale.
