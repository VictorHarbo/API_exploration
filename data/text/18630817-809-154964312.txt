COMMERCIAL. Age Office, Saturday Evening. Thero were no expert entries passed to-day for gold nt the Customs,, Tho import market during the past week has boon characterised uy the quietness usual to tho period intervening between tho telegraphic intimr.tion of tho arrival of the mail nnd the subsequent delivery of tho letters, increased, if possible, since by the unsatisfactory nature of tho advices ijpueived, we hnve consequently few changes in any way favorable to report, but rather the reverse, the improvement evident in many articles previous having been dis sipated. There is, moreover, a feeling of distrust existing at present, which induces a commendablo degree oi cave and prudenco in undertaking ordi nary risk, which affects business, and though nt the moment this may appear prejudicial, it must in the end prove highly beneficial. The Northam was telegraphed from Adelaide, on Sunday last, at ten o'clock p.m, and arrived in the Bay on Wednesday forenoon following. Tho shipments for Juno showed an increase of £70,000 over the previous mouth. With the exception of some description of metals, which, in consequence of largo expoit orders, have advanced considerably, scarcely an)' other move ment is perceptible. Kerosene oil is very slightly better. Flour and grnin remain stationary. Tea, coffee nnd sugar, present no change. Malt is a shade less firm. Salt and candles are completely prostrated. Butter is easier. Hams and bacon look as if they had seen their lowest. A heavy purchaso is reported in geneva. No other article calls for further notice. Tho British nnd foreign nrrivals comprise two vessels from England, ono from Hamburg, and tho Mail steamer. Ale and Stout. — Bulk ale is not in any improved demand, sales continuing limited to tho mere sup ply of trade wants. Bass's No. 3 has been sold at £7 5s, in small lots, thus sustaining tho slight advance recorded last week. Allsopp's is offered at £7, but a largo parcel could be got at less money. Joules' cannot bo bought under £8, at which a fair quantity is got rid of amongst tho trade. No altera tion has been made on Marian's, which sells nt £7 7s Gd for 50 hlul lots to £7 12s Gd for smaller quantities. Colonial Company's we do not quoto under £7, though a concession would be made to part with a quantity. Carlisle Company's realises £7 12s Gd to £7 15s ; Ind, Coope and Co , £7 for heavy, and £8 for light ale. Sales are being mado of all thoso brands, though to moderate extent. Scotch ale cannot be placed over £6 to £G 10s. 100 hhda (faulty) English nlo wero disposed of at £3 to £3 10s. Wo note a slight decline upon bulk Btout, Whitbrend's being now offered at £G 15s. Wo have not been advised, however, of any corre sponding reduction on Taylor, Walker and Co.'h, which we quote at £7 to £7 5b. Bottled nlo is not in largo request, at 9s 9-1 to 10s for best brands, Joules' being sold at 9s Gd, Colonial Company's at 9s to 9s 3d, and other descriptions 9s to (is Gd. Bottled stout shows evident signs of weakness in some sorts. Henry White and Co.'s is firm, at 10s to 10s 3d, but few sales making ; Blood's is held for 10s ; Edmonds' pig brand brings 10s 9d ; Machen's is disposed of in trade lots at 9s Gd to 10s ; Bridges' we quote 9s ; Dnnphy's is offered at 9s. Byass's has been sold as low as 8s 9d — is more generally offered at 8s lO.Jd, and there nvo many holders at 9s. Shipments continue on too large a scale to expect an improvement in beers, even though the consumption may increase as the season advances ; thero arc — beer in bulk 3823 hhds, and in glass 12.G27 four dozen cas:s. Bagging. — Thero is nothing doing in corn sacks, which remain at lGs to 10s Gd. Gunny bngs sold for 10s nt auction. Woolpacks have been placed at n decline since the mail enmo in, 5s ljd having been accepted at auction, the nominal price is 5s Cd. Shipments of botli descriptions nro much in creased, while 150 bales sacks are advised from Calcutta, with 75 bales of guunios. Candles have not tho slightest chance of improve ment. From England 135 tons have been exported, and 9000 boxes have been sent from Rotterdam, tho consequence is that the market, previously uot strong, has sinco been completely prostrated. Auction is the only resort for an outlet, and sales are there made at very low rates. On Tuesday 2000 boxes, all faults, were sold at 9M to lOJd for full weights ; and light at 7Jd to 7Jd per packet. Privatoly, Bel monts, in sound condition, have changed hands at ll^d. Our quotations are for English and foreign 111 to lljd. Tho Neva Stearino Company's being Is ; light weights, 8Jd to 9d. Victorian Steariue sold for 9,}d. Coffee. — There is no change observable m this article, transactions are not large, the trade only boing buyers, at lid to lljd for plantation ; 9Jd for natives ; nnd 9fd to lOd for Java. Chicory. — Sales are limited, at 3Jd to -ld per lb, in bond. Chejiicals of all descriptions are difficult to move, with the exception of crystals of soda, which com mand £8 153 to £9. Caustic soda is offered at £18 to £20. Flour of sulphur continues at £20 to £21. Patna opium is held for £200. Confectionery is unaltered, sales to the trnde boing made at lid for assorted ; Is for jujubes ; can died peel, being stiff at 13d to 13§d. Cement. — Portland is only hold by tho trade, which sell at 23s to 25s ; American plaster is now quoted 22s; Roman is. neglected. Cordaoe. — European tarred rope is scarce. Ma nilla is held for £17. A parcel of assorted 1 to 4 inch sold at auction for £44 ; among other things destroyed by the earthquake at Manilla we notico that of one of the largest rope factories. Fine twino has been disposod of at Is. Tea twine, 13^d ; nud colored twine at 14Jd.' Fish. — Horrings are firm at 2Gs to 27s for hnlf bavrels, nnd 10s for firkins ; shipments of new will not commence before August, and prices, if they do not go up, will at least continue firm. Red herrings are worth 34s to 35s per dozen tins ; shipments of new ling are expected by the Lightning. Fruits. — Currants are dull and heavy, trade snlos only can be made at Gd. Sultana raisinB have been sold at 7§d ; loose muscatels are worth Gd ; layers, Old to 7Ad for fine. Figs realise C-J-i. Flour and Grain. — Tho cry of ' wolf ' has come too often from tho Adelaide sido. Notwith standing continuous advices of a largo exportdemand there, an advance in Hour, and a great scarcity of wheat, no impression has ns yet been made here, and prices remain as formerly quoted ; we can, however, positively state that tho exports from South Australia are on u larger scalo than was anticipated in the early part of the season. Tho estimated fjunntity which could be spared for exportation was 55,000 tons, while up to August 42,000 have been sent away, thus leaving only 1 3,000 tons to meet tho requirements of upwards of four months ; the demand for the Mauritius, the Cape, New Zealand, and Queensland boing at the moment very largo. During the week snlos hero have not been extensive, though a much improved trade demand has been experienced at £14 for ordinary Adelaide town brands, silk dressed ; country brands, £13 10s to £13 15s. Hart's, Magarny's, and Dnfnold's being held for £14 10s. Victorian, Merri Mills, brings £13, and Moyno Mills sells at £12 10s. A parcel of 100 tons of the latter was disposed of, but the price was not disclosed ; wo understand, however, that less than our present quotation was accepted. Wheat is not plentiful, Adelaide realises Gs ; and for Port lairy 5s Gd isaskei; feeding sorts- bring 4s 9d. For feeding barley 4s 3d to 4s Gd, according to sample, is required, but sales are limited. Oats : Fine colo nial for milling bring Ga ; feeding descriptions come very sparingly forward, though wanted at os Gd. Danish are valued nt 5s ; Scotch and English, 4s Gd to 4s 9d, tho attention of dealers is Bull monopolised by damaged parcels offered at auction to the exclusion of sound, and few sales of the latter in consequence como under our notice. G000 bnshels Irish and Danish, sea damaged, wero this week placed at 2s 9d to 4s. Maize is in good demand at 4s 3d to 4s Cd. Gram realises £12 10s to £13. Bran has advnnced to 1b 2d and Is 3d. Colonial oatmeal sells at £31. Scotch oatmeal is not so firm, and worth only £2G. Colonial pearl barley has been reduced to £30 and £31 ; Scotch being valued at £27 10s. Shipments of outs in June are almost nil. Gunpowder. — Blasting ha3 not advanced farther ; 7^d is the price of best brands. Shipments are 005 cwt. Hops. — The demand is not great ; best 62's com mand 1b lOd. Shipments are 1007 cwt— a large increase. Reports of the new crop aro very flatter ing, though qualified by tho remark ' that seldom has tho crop of hops been in greater joopardy than at present,' and as stocks had been very much re duced, a very serious advance in price must follow, ' should the apprehension which we have such good ground for expresEing become confirmed, not to say realised.' Malt. —The activity in this article previous to he moil coming in hae.eince been checked, and the slight advantage then attained has been lost. Bins could not now be placed over 8s lid, tho unexpected extent of shipments advised being the solo cause of their retrogression. Theso amount to 31,700 bushel*. MktaIjS. — Pig iron there is little doing in ; it is generally held for £3 10s and £3 15s ; hematite, £5 and £5 us. In consequence of large export orders, the stock of zinc has bi-eu cleared off the market, the price rapidly going up from £30 to £:!4, nt which range sales have been made, any lots Htill remaining in second bauds held for £30. Gal vanised, corrugated and plain iron, hnve, in like manner, advanced 80s ; Hamilton's 2G-gauge having linen sold at £31 to £35 10s, and plain at £34 10s to £35 10s ; previously damaged corrugated was nold at £31 to £33, aiid plain at £18 to £25. .An invoice of bar iron, 120 tons, and hoop iron, 30 tons, was placed at a satisfactory figure, which, however, did not transpire. Sheet load brings £28. Keith's D R shovels, all faults, realised 37s Gd per dozen ; Collins' long-handled, 27s Gd. At an extensive sale of ironmongery, the following prices wero obtained : — Clout nails, GAd to 9Jd per lb ; roHO do, 19s to 27s per keg ; Ely's caps, 3s per 1000; Canon's cart boxes, 20s per cwt; 1C tin plates, 33s per box ; tin plates, various, 31s to 39s per box ; cotton candlo wick, '2$ lid per lb ; Col lius's axes, all faults, 41s to GOs per dozen ; do minors' axes, do, 3Gs do ; do picks, do, 45s do. Oils. — Lmiseud is in slow sale at 0s Gd ; castor meets with trade buyers at Gs. Koroseno has been iu moro request sinco the mail arrived, and has hardened again ; Couzzoiib's is valued at 2s lOd ; Orion tal at 2s 8d ; transactions, howovor, have not been extensive. Colza brings 5s 9d to Gs ; olivo is unnoticed. Oilmen's Stores. — Bottled fruits have receded slightly, having been disposed of at 12s Gd to 13s. 1 lb jams have also declined a shade, lls Gd boing now accepted. Pickles are in fair request at 8s to 9s 3d. On Tuesday large parcels of stores wero disposed of at lower prices. Sardines have beon in request, holders requiring Gs Gd for quarters, and 9s Gd for halves. 1 lb salmon is valued at 17s. Black pepper brings 4Jd per lb, and sago is sold at 4}d to -l£d. Provisions. — Butter continues in a most unsettled position. Privately, sales of sound and good have been mado at Is, but ill- conditionud parcels aro quitted at auction at low rates. Shipments are 1200 firkins, 1000 of which are on board ouo vessel. Dealers, under the conviction that hams and bacon have seen their lowest, evince more disposition to buy ; thero aro holders of Sinclair's at Is 1 Jd and Is OJd, but snlos have boon made at halfpenny loss ; Coey's hams havo been placed at Is O.Jd. York hams aro offered at Is ; and bacon at 11H. Fine North Wilts cheese sell at Is ljd to Is 2d ; Dun lop's bringing Is OJd. Quicksilver is without alteration, at Is lOd for California, and Is lid for Spanish ; there is very little demand, and sales consequently aro vory li mited. Rice. — Advices from Calcutta havo not improved this market. Tho Neinberg had sailed with G000 bags, aud four vosnels wero stated to bo loading. Great dulnoss prevails, only trade sales nt £19 being mado. Damaged, ox Mayotte, brought £12 15s. Salt. — For coarso there is uot tho slightest in quiry, and littlo desiro to gpecu late iu tho article is manifested. Shipments to tho extent of 1783 tons, after what had previously been shipped, says very littlo for the prudence of merchants oil tho other side ; a quotation we cannot at presont give. Sales have been mado under £3. Fino is nominal at £4 10s. Sugar. — On Monday tho cargo of tho Santiago from Mauritius, consisting of 7591 bags, was of fered, but littlo was sold ; afterwards, nnd in tho room, nearly half the cargo was disposed of at prices showing a slight improvement, bright rations bring ing £24 ; fino brown, £27 10s ; counters, £28 to £80 ; yellow crystals, £34 ; middling white, £30. Yesterday, 1400 bags, ex Cassina, realised £23 for rations ; £30 2s Gd for good counters ; and £32 10s for a very poor sample of yellow crystals ; first white is valued at £37 to £38 ; Cossiporo and Bally being nominal, at £40. 1500 bags, da maged, ex Bosphorus and Cassina, sold at fair rates. Tea. — Tho businoss done has not been large, the lMnrknf. not, linvimr linnn iintml fn,« ir^nM, n/»fi,^ftr Fine teas do not command a great deal of notico, but trado sales have been made at juices ranging from 2s 5d to 3s. Common congous ruling at from Is lid to 2s aromost iu request, but those not being plentiful, dealers supply themselves from medium description at from 2s ljd to 2s 3d, at which rates we hear of several linos having been placed. We observe great fears being expressed by merchants in China that the Taspings would, in revenge for the threatened destruction of their political oxistenco, ravngo tho tea districts, and refer to it as a cirenm Btauco not at all unlikely to happen. Tho Ettrick cleared out with old teas from Foo Chow, and two vessels wero expected to clear from Hong Koug with Chow Chow cargoes. v Timber. — Deals are neglected, no transactions coming under our notice. On Thursday tho follow ing sales of doors, shelving, &c.;, wero effected on the Australian Wharf, ex Wobfoot : — 2401 doors, at 0s Od to 21s ; 814 pair-sashes, at 5s to 12a 9d.

Tobacco has been a vory quiofc market, a sort of panic caused by a vague dread of shipments having seized hold of dealers, originally caused by I. MA TIT'S fr. I.PIPWfl tilt I/' nniiruiTl/i«TYl/i»if /-if uliinrrtnnte from Adelaide. Tho following is tho total of what is coming from America: — 17,028 lb per Alexandria, 100,088 lb per Maria, 25,243 lb per Alqta, mostly consisting of half pounds. From England 90,920 lb was first snid to be coming, but in consequence of a mistake this has to be reduced by 30,000 lb. Most of tho remainder consists of leaf, or Westorn strips, and wo are in debted to an unsuccessful speculation in London in that article for the ohipment ; it will not in any degree interfero with descriptions most suited for tho market. Stocks iu bond have been decreasing !for months past, and our exports for the week end 8th August alone lot up equal to 35,500 lb, exclusive of our consumption. On Wednesday ,a largo assort ment was offered for sale, but the wholo was with drawn, in consequence of tho arrival of the mail. Since the advico of sales in Sydney tho market has been more settled, and wo have no doubt will con iinuo so. if it receive liisf.icn frnm t.lin iinnnrfpr Iu tho meantime we do not alter our trade quota tions of 2s Gd to 3s for tens, and 3s to 3s GJ for halves. Tho reported destruction of tho cigar factory led to some operations in Manilla cigars, at 57a to 59s in bond. Wines and Spirits.— Ports and sherries remain very depressed and without any appearanco of improve ment. Kartell's dark brandy has been sold at lls lid, pale realising lls Gd.

There has been some activity in tho share market this week, and sales to a fair amount are recorded. The tightness in the money market has rather in duced sellers to come forward, but prices generally have ruled higher. Bank shares continue in request. Sales of Bank of Now South Wales shares havo been made at full rate, and holders are now asking an advance of 10s per share. Australian Joint Stoclc Bank shares have been in some request, nnd have changed hands at an advance of 5s per share. In Commercial and Union Bank shares thero have been no sales this week. Steam shares aro again in favor. Australasian Steam Navigation shares havo been dealt in to some amount at tho same price they were quoted at beforo the declaration of their dividend, which is equal to an improvement of 25s per share on the last sale quoted.

Government debentures are hardly so firm ; termi nables havo changed hands at 102 aud interest. Businoss has been vory dull during the week, and with littlo prospect of any improvement. The Into failures have for the time checked speculation, and induced somo caution on,thc part of holders of goods in entering into large transactions. The markets generally are depressed, and correct quotations are very difficult to give, tho prices varying according to the expectations or wishes of tho parties interested. Wo subjoin the latest report of our markets: — Flour: Thoro has not been much doing in this market, and pri-jcs rule about Die same as last week. Adelaide first brands arc quoted at £14 10s to £15 per ton ; other brands- £14 per ton. Wheat is a littlo firmer, Adelaido Gs 3d to Gs Gd.

Few transactions havo beeen effected, but wo may naturally anticipate somo slight improve ment at an early date. Flour is in fair demand at -£12 to £13 per ton. Wheat nt os to 5s 3d per bushel, nnd other articles ns last reported. Tho Cornwall Chronicle of the 12th says : — Wheat has further declined in value, millers now refuse to purchase at 4s 9d per bushel. This is about the highest figure obtainable, and there is literally no demand for the article. Feed oats nre worth 5s to 5s 4d per bushel ; a parcol was sold 3'esterday at the latter figure. Parcels of prime seed pats are scarce at 5s Gd, and 0s is occasionally obtained for small quantities for home use. Loose hay, £5 5s, nnd hydraulic-pressed do, £8 10s per ton.
