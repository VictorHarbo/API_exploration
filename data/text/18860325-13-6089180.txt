THURSDAY, M ARCH 21 1866 The present is a fearful time I came taking, if not epidemic as to be placed, is sporadic, occurring in patches every where The Torres Straits steamer from Brisbane, the American mail from Sydney, the Orient liners, and the V and O boats are all crowded, and the rentaL made in our Brisbane telegram of yesterday the passengers are mostly old colonists applies in each instance One can see that Pall Mall and Piccadilly and the parks are about to be taken on _ possession of by hordes whose table will be of sheep, of mines of eucalypts and of the Melbourne Cup, who will applaud the Australian Eleven in their matches and who, unlike MAU n vi s historic boatswain, will deplore the absence of the sun. The causes of the fish may be various, but there is one great lustres, Mr SERVICE seeks rest, Ihsbop MooimousE has left to assume other duties the member for Richmond fills an official post, Mr J 1.11 x B loan as agent-general, but in a thousand and one other instances, colonists who are contemplating a trip at some time think that they may as well pay their visit while the Colonial Exhibition 1-. in progress, and while every one else is proceeding to the jet eye wit The Exhibition gives them a status, and an excuse Australia will be in the air this year in London and also in the streets But for the Exhibition, Sir J V.MLS "M'CULLOCH, Mr M H DAVIES, and a, host of other public men might have spread their departure over a period of time, but thanks to this institution we have a simultaneous departure One vessel-the Austral took nearly 800 passed come from the south eastern colonies alone Such an efflux has not been known before Indeed, before now it was impossible, but the modern steamer is annihilating space as well as mitigating the house of the sea, and business men find that they can snatch time for a trip to England without serious hurt to their avocations All this is a matter for rejoicing We may both hope and believe that steam and the ship buildcrshaveotherimpiovementsinstoie, for the greater the intercourse between England and the colonies, the more we bind the empire together and, again, the greater the efflux, the larger the influx in due course So soon as he plants his foot on English soil, the colonist undergoes a transformation, and seeing what he does and remembering what he has left, becomes an ardent immigration agent The farewells of the week in Melbourne have been those of Sir JAMES M'CULLOCH an 1 Mr C*i AHAM ] i IUIY Sir J w11 s did not re i over the story of his life, pen from his boyish days and he showed his good taste accordingly In politics wild oats are often sown How many a futher have I seen A sober man among his boys Whose youth was full official noise Who wears his manhood hale and trees Many of those who sat round the festive board on Monday evening had opposed the guest of the evening strenuously when he embarked in politics, but they could, one and all, applaud the solid services he rendered the state after he had gained experience It is fifteen years since Sir JAMES At CULLOCH propounded the idea that it would be better, instead of resorting falling to the Custom house to have an all round direct taxation, so that the community should see what it is parting with, and now radicals are taking up that idea, and are denouncing its old advocates as obst unionists We are indebted to him for the Harbour is list, which stopped the practical fraud of collecting wharf tolls for one purpose and applying them to another He prepared the way also for the abolition of political patronage, and for a business management of the lad ways, and if his son hand procedure was misunderstood by the country, it was right and proper, and is being vindicated by time The stonewaller is already an object of reproach, and the idea that it is the privilege of a minority to stop supplies and thus to ruin individuals and to damage the public credit would not now be her lously contended for the iiLXt Minister who indicates the light of Parliament to govern as Sir JAMES At Cul i our did will be applauded for his action And we are sure that the present Premier cannot do better than remember the farewell advice of the returns veteran, that the special danger, of victories over legislation ' md over borrowing But outside of politics, Sir J 4M to At'CuLLocir his tender ed till continually weight j serVICE He is a pioneer in the frozen meat trade, and he has guard not only money to the charities, but his time and his organising abilities, which are more valuable still We may hope that his departure is not final for stalwart men of his type are not easily spared by a community Yesterday evening it was the turn of the new agent-general to be feted Some of the gentlemen who were present at the M'Culloch dinner could put in an appearance at the Ferry demonstration, and there could be no greater proof of a desire to but) past animosities Mr 1 11 RA -, second trip to ] behind is not so sensational as was his mat and apparently he does not regret this circumstance himself He had so often of his first visit as a failure, but we 110 sure that there is a general hope now, that his present term in London will be an unmixed success V Whatever may be the case at Ballarat and Sandhurst, there H little sympathy felt elsewhere with the living of the extreme radicals, headed by Colonel SMITH, who denounce the appointment as a " 106 It may be a pity) that Mr Alum VA SMITH was not in vited to continue in office until after the Exhibition period because that gentleman has special qualifications to represent the colony at such a juncture, but otherwise the agent) general has he come a recognised post for leading politicians, and it was open to Ali inn accordingly The original agent general was a commercial or commission agent Today he is a political representative, with a fur prospect of shortly obtaining a voice in the government of the colonies, with an official seat in the House of Commons, or in the House of Lords, or in home I edel al Council Mr 1 1 and M s of 1 lends had a light to consider that he had a claim for the post, and there could be nothing unbecoming 111 his accepting it As to his address, we will only, say that he could legitimately claim to be the father of protection, and no doubt his party was associated with the land laws of the 1865 70 era But protection, we fear, has given Sydney a start she would not otherwise have enjoyed, and as to free selection before survey), there is not one colony 111 Australia which has not abandoned I the system as a delusion and a snare The leaders meant well," no doubt, in these things, but their wisdom, we fear, was at fault As to the reform of the constitution, with which Mr. BLrtm d name is said to be linked, it 13 an excellent thing that his proposals-a nominee Council and the producing came to naught It is better, however, to deal with the future rather than the past Air LLBI Y will have a high tradition to maintain, for he follows a distinguished officer, and he will consult with distinguished men, such as Sir Dir LO v BELL and Sir CHARLES his 1 LU The post has pitfalls and temptations of its own, and if we say that Air BLRBY may either make a name in it or mar a career, it is in the hope that Victoria will be abundantly justified in her choice A somewhat unique page of ecclesiastical history has just been added to the annals of Victoria It is well again,. vWt the ocurred of the Presbyterian Church claim as large powers as those that disgusted MILTON , but it may be doubted if many members are aware of the fact that they can reject a man first, examine him BY tel wards, and finally compel him to yield up

But the Melbourne Presbytery has the supreme merit of determination When the Rev Cn vin is Strong's case was under consider action, the members justified then widely blamed action by his silence, and assured the world that if he would only speak two words, the difficulty would be at an end Mr RODS IS not only) willing to speak, but has denied the charges made against him, and the) appoint a committee to investigate his manuscripts If a simple answer would have been accepted in the one case why should it not prove satisfactory in the other !
