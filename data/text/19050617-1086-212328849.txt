The political Arena. The Federal Parliament meets on June 28 . The annual W.A. Labour Congress assembles in Perth on July 8 The agenda paper contains enough material to keep the delgates talking' Nfor six months,— if they feel that way inclined. I would rather see a bonus on children after the first four in each family than old age pensions, said . Dr. Thacker at Christchurch recently. .'We want ' young men in the Colony, and they will look after the old men. if they don't then physical culture is not doing what it should for the race.' One Swedish and six Danish -immi grants arrived in the State last week. They are all good agriculturists, and were sent - along by Agent-General James. Briefly enumerated the chief items of the Premier's scheme of public works are as follow Magnet-Lawlers. railway, Metropolitan sewerage scheme. Coolgardie-Norseman railway, Williams- Darkan , railway, Jandakot railway extension agricultural railways, Fremantle dock, and Bunbury harbour." The retirement of Messrs. Taylor and Holman to a place of more utility but less responsibility" will materially strengthen the fighting forces of the private members on the Goverment benches. Mr. Taylor is a born fighter. Mr. Bath, new Minister for Lands, harbours views of his own on the question of the nationalisation of land. He has sense enough, however,, to subserve his views towards .the . political harmony of the Ministerial team. The Fitzroy (Melbourne) branch of the Political labour league one evening recently committed itself to the following egregious resolution. That this branch expresses its most emphatic disapproval of the un-Christian- like sentiments expressed by-Cardinal Moran, of Sydney, and Biship Green, of Ballarat, and other ministers of the Gospel, in their condemnation of Socialism, by making statements which they knew to be false, and having the same published in the press throughout the Commonwealth of Australia." 'Tis rumoured that the most startling developements in political circles will eventually centre on the Independent Party ; they hold the key to . the' the situation. Mr. Daglish has given them sufficient cause to withdraw their allegiance by not consulting them on his re-construction policy. Mr. Moran, though nominally an Independent, has democratic conviction as solid as any on the Goverment benches. He has been identified with the Labour movement all his life. He is not an extremist in | any sense, and has but the one hobby by immigration. His inclusion in I any Cabinet would be to its advantage. Dr. Ellis, Coolgardie's elect, who moved at the Caucus to give Mr. Daglish a free hand, had some idea that the prefix "hon." would not look had before his own name.
