The subjects include English, French, German, Drawing, Water-color Painting, and Music Miss Hammond ha; spent six years on the Con tinent of Europe in perfecting herself in the French and German Languages, and has considerable ex perience in teaching, having occupied the position of Head English Governess at Argyle House, Stafford.
