With the more settled condition of the weather, business all round has improved. Prime maize is now being bought at 3s. 6d. per bushel, which is a drop of 9d. since last report. The grain has been arriving pretty freely from all " feeding" stations to-day, and on account of the high prices buyers are holding off, and are very anxious to dispose of what small stocks they hold. A large quantity of the new maize forward is very fresh, and not at all fit for Immediate use. There is also a lot of small red American corn coming in. This is of very poor quality, consisting chiefly of Little stinted grains, and, even if perfectly dry, it will be bought only at reduced prices. If the maize is consigned in large quantities, it is exceedingly probable that a further decline will take place There is a fair local inquiry for prime mixed chaff, but large stocks are held in the metropolis, and prices are ruling low. Current quotations (farmers' prices are as follow : Maize, 3s. 6d. per bushel ; bacon, local, good, 4d. per lb.; butter, 5d.; beeswax, 6d.; eggs, 6d. per dozen ; prime oaten chaff, £2 5s. per ton ; oaten hay, £4 ; prime roosters, 2s. 3d. per couple; hens, 2s. 3d.; geese, 4s. ; ducks-English, 1s. 6d. to 2s. 6d. ; Muscovy, 3s. ; turlee}«-hens, 5s.; gobblers, 12s.; pigeons, Gd. 7, LAIDLEY. (From Our Own Correspondent.) January 13. The local market for the week ending to-day has been very dull, this being mainly due to the continued "wet weather, the state of the roads preventing farmers from forwarding their supplies. Very Small quantities of maize have come to hand, prices, as given below, showing a considerable advancement. The demand for the grain is very good, but Just now it is very scarce. Lucerne hay and chaff were sent in at the beginning of the week in only fairly large "consignments, but yesterday and to-day there have been no supplies arriving. The inquiries for these lines are very weak, the quotations as stated in last report ore still being maintained. There is a considerable Improve- ment to chronicle in the values of potatoes, prime blue skins having increased £3 per ton since my last report. In the lighter lines, there has been very little business transacted. Butter is not to hand in very large parcels, the price given for the very best article showing a slight reduction as compared with last week's quotations. Eggs are in limited supplies, and local orders show an increase in numbers. In the poultry section business is at a complete standstill, there being no birds of any description coming forward. Appended are the latest ruling prices : Maize, 5s. 2d. per bushel ; lucerne hay, £1 per ton ; lucerne chaff, £1 10s.; mixed chaff, £1 10s.; oaten hay, 35s. ; potatoes (prime), £9 to £11 ; butter, 3d. to 5d. per lb.; eggs, 5d. per dozen ; cheese farmers', 3d. per lb.; factory, 6d. to 7d.; bacon, 7d. to 8d. ; fowls. 1s. 6d. to 2s. 3d. per couple ; geese, 5s. ; ducks English, 2s. 6d. Muscovy, 2s. 9d. to 3s. 3d. pigeons, and.; parrots, 4d.; turkeys gobblers, 10s. to 12s.; beans, 4s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. TOOWOOMBA. (From Our Own Correspondents.) January 14. On account of the wet weather, both maize and potatoes still figure at very high prices, but the fluctuations are something extraordinary ; there has been no fixed price. Yesterday maize varied from 3s. 9d. to 4s. 6d., and potatoes from £6 to £8. Once the weather clears a big fall may be anticipated. Appended are the local prices : Wheat, 4s. per bushel ; chaff lucerne, from £1 to £1 10s. per ton ; mixed, 10s. to £2 ; oaten, £2 10s. to £3 ; hay lucerne, £1 10s. to £1 15s.; oaten, £3 to £3 10s. onions, 6s. to 7s. per cwt.; potatoes, £6 to £8 per ton ; maize, 3s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. per bushel ; oats feed, 3s. 9d. ; eggs, 5d. to 6d. per dozen ; butter, prime, 4d. to 6d. per lb.; bacon, 4d. to 6d.; cheese, 3d. to 4d; fowls, 1s. 4d. to 2s. per pair ; turkeys, 6s. to 10s.; geese, 4s. to 6s.; ducks, 2s. 6d. to 3s.

Now that the Christmas holidays are over (the Melbourne " Argus" says), visitors from West Australia are leaving again for the goldfields in large numbers, and the immigration officers are on the alert to prevent the overcrowding of steamers. On Saturday last the Barcoo left the wharf, bound westward, with a numerous complement, stopping, as usual, off Williamstown for the purpose of having her passengers mustered and counted by the port officers. The result of the inspection was that the steamer was found to have on board twenty passengers in excess of the number allowed by her certificate, which provides for the carriage of 810 altogether. The matter will be reported at headquarters in due course.
