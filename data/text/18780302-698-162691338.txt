Boaiid Inquiry. — Loss of the Undine. — The Board held an investigation into the circumstances connected with the loss of this vessel, and ascertained that 6he was a schooner of 78 tons, registered in Sydney, owned by Edward Arnold, and insured. She 'was _ on a voyage laden with produce from the Nambuccra River, and in the attempt to get to sea got becalmed on the bar after she had been left by the pilot, and wa« drifted on to the rocks, notwithstanding the efforts that were made to endeavour to save her. The Board decided that no blame was attributable to Andrew Nelson, the master. „ The following is the report of the ship Tyburnia, Captain Colder:— November 20, 11 a.m., left Plymouth with Government emigrants for Sydney (116 married couples, 102 single men, 36 single women, 97 children, and 18 infants). She experienced heavy westerly gales till November 30, in latitude 42' north and 11- west; the wind then veering to N.E., had light w 'ids and fine weather. Lost N.E. trades, and got S.E. trades same day in latitude 5' N.. and crossed the line 18th December in 30- west; had moderate S.E. trades to 22- S. and 30- W.; thence baffling wind and unsettled weather to 39* S. and 18* E. Crossed the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope January 18, and ran down the easting between 45* and 46' ; strong N., N.W. , and westerly winds and fair weather ; rounding Tasmania February 12 ; and met strong N.E. winds, which continued with little variation tj Sydney Heads. Had strong southerly current on this coast. During the passage therehavehcen seven deaths, one adult and six infants. Dr. Andrews is the surgeon in charge, and Miss Chase has the supervision of the single females. The barque Earl Derby left Liverpool on 28th November, with violent south-west gales, compelling her to put into Holyhead, from whence she took her departure on 2nd December. She got the north-east trades in 82' north, and carried them to 3* north ; crossed the equator on 38th December, in longitude 25* west; took the S.E. trades in latitude 3* south, and lost them ''n latitude SO* south ; rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 17th January, pnd made her easting on a parallel of 45- south, rounding the south west cape of Tasmania on tbe 17th instant. The following particulars have been received from Noumea 15th February The barque Pacific Slope encountered a violent gale between New Zealand and this place, and put in here on the 8th instant with cargo shifted and other damage, a hurricane having swept over the southern part of the island. She left for Shanghai on the 15th February, after having discharged 85,000 feet of . kauri. Wrf.ck or the Western Star Brig. — By the arrival o Captain Walsch, the late commander of the above-named vessel, we glean some further particulars respecting her loss. She left the Solomon Group on tne 22nd January; on the 28th the brig was oft' the Brampton Shoal at 4*p.m. on that date. The vessel was hauled off, but at 11 p.m. she struck, and within an hour she broke her back. Captain Walsch remained by the wreck until 2 a.m. on the following day, when they succeeded in launching a second boat (the chief officer and two hands having previously left ) . At daylight both boats left the wreck determined to make for Percy Island, distant some 500 miles. The boats kept company nntil the evening of the 29th. On the following day Captain Walsch boat sprung a leak, which was subsequently stopped. The suf ferings of the crew were doubtless very great, as on the 5th instant water was reduced to a wineglass full per man per day with a smallmodicum of spirits. On the 13th, 6mith's Group was reached, and a supply of water found. The safe arrival of the shipwrecked crew has already been made public. The following vessels were spoken by the Baron Aberdare on the voyage out: — On January 6, in latitude 21 '28 S., and longitude 29-26 W., the ship Nyassa, from London, bound to Sydney, and on the same date the ship Drumlanrig, from Liverpool, bound to Melbourne. She also spoke tbe barque Earl Derby, jVom Liver pool to Sydney, on January 9, in latitude 30'27 S., and Ion jitude 24'Z1 W. — Argus, February 20.

Captain Foreman, of the above-named vessel, arrived by the Beagle, from the Manning, and reports thefor.ndering of his vessel off Crow dy Head. He slates that at 10 a.m. on the 22nd instant it wps reported to him that the vessel had sprung a leak ; as the water was rising in the hold, the pumps we.-e at once sounded and gave 2 iret 6 inchcr, ; pumped for half an hour, again sounded and lound 3 feet of water in the hold. The boat was then lav.nchd and kept alongside, but the leak kept gairing, and at 1 p.m. the water being over the cabin floor, took to the boat and left the ship; remained a short distaiee from her until 2 p.m., when she was icon to roll over on her broadside and go down nead first, Made for Crowdy Head, where the crew lauded at 6. SO p.m., and Captain Foreman proceeded to the Monning to communicate with his owner in Sydney, Mr. Roddam. STRANDING OF THE S.S. PLATYPUS. On the 20th January, while this vessel was crossing the Rich- I niond River bar, with the pilot from his usual place inside the break guiding the vessel in, she was tripped by a heavy sea ! which rendered the rudder, though hard aport, useless ; she slewed Milh her bead to the southward, and took the ground on the South Spit, about a quarter of a mile from its extreme end, 1 but on the seaward side. The 6teamtug Francis Hixon, in attempting to get a towline on board, herself grounded close to her, and was only got oflf by most energetic efforts continued for twenty-four hours, and after sustaining considerable damage to paddlewheels ; meanwhile the Platypus had strained, leaked, and become full of water. At low water the cargo was discharged on the sand alongside, where Mr. Edmond Ross, J.P., much to his credit, on hisown responsibility, engaged a large number of men, and carried the goods across the Spit to the nearest point of safety, a little more than a quarter of a mile distant, from which they were taken by steamer to the company's stores. The Platypus, though dry at low water, was che most of the time exposed to a heavy sea, in which she was fast becoming a wreck; the holes left by the rivets breaking and dropping out were, by Captain Rice and his men, plugged with wood, to prevent as much as possible the sea and sand getting in. Captain Bants, marine surveyor, furnishes the following report respecting the Platypus :— ' I left Sydney on the evening of the 29th, and by pushing on from the Clarence Head reached the vessel at daylight on Friday, the 1st instant, -where I found that captains Rice and Fenwick, with the assistance of tbe pilots, had succeeded in running anchors into deep water, and were attempting to get the vessel round ; while Mr. Ross with a gang of men were baling with casks, and the engine-room pumps working for the same purpose. The cable clipin parted, but succeeded in turning the vessel iuto a better position, and 150 feet nearer the end of the Spit. On examining the hull, found the bottom rising and falling like a pair of bellows, top frames broken, and sides deflected inwards eight or nine inches, which every sea was increasing, and rivets breaking and dropping out, with every indication of a total col lapse and wreck, in a position where salvage would be nil. Set several men to work, and succeeded fixing a tier of quarter stanchions on each side with transverse shores to support the top sides. The Francis Hixson being still disabled, all operation? had to be done from the Platypus; but still she kept Hearing safety, though on several occasions loss seemed almost certain. For instance, on Sunday the vessel lay with a long list ; the water gaining fast rose in the engine-room, and extinguished fire after fire, and when the labt was out the case seemed hopeless. How ever, at low water one furnace freed, and, by the aid of a case of kerosene, tar. and pine, got it ablaze, and freed the engine room. On Monday morning the Francis Hixson was able to' tow the whole tide, but with no apparent result, the vessel lying with a long list, and, despite baling and pumping, filling fast ; suddenly she righted, and moved towards deep water, in which she would have assuredly sunk, had the towline not been cut in time, for the hold was more than half full, and one of the screws fouled by a rope, rendering the engine for the time useless ; fortunately she hung on the edge of the Spit rntil we got the water pretty well down, the fouled 6rrew disconnected, and tbe square foresail under the bottom ; ' when at darkening the trancis Hixson very cleverly got her tow line on board, and began towing, though still ebb. On the first of flood she slid gently into deep water, cut the towline, warps, &e.;, and with the one screw went full speed ahead, water gaining fast, vessel sluggish, and steering badly, but Captain Rice and pilots keeping her well in hand by canvas, until she took the ground in a place of safety at 8 p.m. on Monday, 4th instant ; and the next few day6 were occupied freeing her of water, closing leaks, &c.; On Thursday, the Jth, she steamed alongside of the wharf at Ballina, where repairs were commenced. On the 11th diver, riveters, &c.;, arrived by the Bonnie Dundee. On Wednesday, the 20th, completed temporary repairs, which may be summar ized as follows :— About 500 screw rivets through bottom and top sides, about 200 running feet of prepared planking over broken plates and doublings ; on each side of deck CO-feet logs, 14 x 7, screw-bolted to corresponding logs under beams, connected and secured to bottom of vessel by thirteen stanchions, 5 x 5 on each side, and two lines of transverse shores amidships. On Wed nesday afternoon had a run to Blackwall, and found the vessel comparatively tight, but judged it prudent to make a square wooden pump down lorchold, to work by a direct action wit the steam-winch. On its being finished on Thursday, the 21st''. y instant, steamed over the bar at noon, and arrived at the wharf ^ at 3 a.m. on the 23rd, the vessel throughout keeping com para-- 'j ' tively tight.
