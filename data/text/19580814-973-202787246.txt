IMMIGRANT DESTROYED The alertness of a Kwinana Customs Officer, Mr. R. N. Brooker, resulted in the prompt destruction of a Ceylon crow which had apparently travelled to Australia in the rigging of the recently arrived Danish tanker, Scotland. Noticing the bird being attacked by seagulls on Sunday, Mr. Brooker informed the Quarantine authorities. Killed A Department of Agriculture Stock Inspector, Mr. S. Cook, was sent to the Kwinana jetty and killed the crow with a shotgun. The Ceylon crow is smaller than the Australian crow and has grey feathers extending from the back of the head to the shoulders. It is particularly destructive to chickens and small birds and could be a carrier of serious poul- try diseases.
