As compared however with tlio state of things twelve months ago we find reason for congratulation and for moderate hopes. At that time thoro was little to relieve the dulncss that had continued for many months. Numerous failures had marked the closo of tlio previous year, and a feeling of distrust prevailed, foreboding other cntostrophcf impending. Tlio decreasing consumption o goods throughout tho country and tho un diminished inflow of shipments disheartened importers, and made thom contemplate their prospects almost in despair. The difficulty of doing o profitable business in the regular course of commerce induced many to rush into. specu lation, and unfortunately the mining schemes that lmd recently been introduced afforded, them the ' opportunity which they were but too ready to embrace. Had these speculations proved more generally fortunate, there would have been some compensation to the many who now look back with disappointment and dis gust to tho events of tho last twelvo months.' Only within' the last quarter liavo affairs been' assuming a brighter aspect. A safer and more remunerative business lias been gradually opening, — men have been weaned from' tlio eagerness of doubtful speculation, arid .have -trirried their attention to tho moro prdiriary avocations of trade. Our goldfiplds popula tion has become moro settled, and there is no longer apprehension of an exccssiye exodus to' new rushes across the borders, In addition to' these moro healthy symptoms, wo have latterly had satisfactory assurance of q more rational scale of shipments, and are led to hopo that at length our over- stockod markets have a cliancc of respite from excessive importations. And besides all this, we haya the promise of moro attention to tho wants ,of our gcldficlds, and may .reasonably hope that tho declino in the yield which has continued through the last year will shortly be etayed. These and other promises of bet toy days coming have induced a moro cheerful and buoyant tone, and have en couraged men" .to enter upon the new year as sured of returning prosperity. In reference to tho actual transactions of the past week, we have hut litllo tp remark upon. Ale and porter: bulk and bottled, maintain their ground — there is a good dojiifind, and prices tend upward. Provisions liayp in some respects improved. Bacon has hpon sought after, and sound parcels sell at 9id to lOd. Hams ' also sell more freely at 12t to 12 id. Butter continues at lid to llid| with a moderate demand. Candles are again firriier-- Belmonts cannot begot under Is 4d to Is did. Nevns are quoted at Is 5id. New cheese soils freely nt 13d to 14d. Coffee lins somoivliqt fallen in consequcnco of another arrival anqounced. : Plantation is quoted at liid .to i?d, and native 8id to lOd. Rice lias been sold freely this week at udvanoed rates- it is quoted (it L19 to L19 10s. Sugars and tea9 continue firm. Of tho flour nnd grain market/ Mr. "\V. Lnwrancc supplies the followingrcport. The corn market is entirely devoid of anything, noticeable. The pest year closed as its pre decessor, with stocks of eolouial , broad stuffs absorbed, at least as far as Melbourne is con-, ccrried ; if a fow thousand bushels of wheat or a fow odd tons of flour aro held in tho western district,' (lint is the extent; therefore, tho "now year starts fair thus far. The ontiro stocks of bread stuffs, at a rough estimate,' do not ckceed within the colony 5000 tons— h stock moderate in the extreme, and under which it should nt no time travel. D.uriBS tlio past year tho busi ness in bread stuffs lias been conducted in an even and steady mnnnor ; a few fluctuations liave occurred, . but panics liavo. beeri lesB fre quent, speculation has been nbsont — fair and; remunerative' prices have ' rilled— giving ge nerally n" good return to the producer, as well as a reasonable margin of profit to tho foreign importer; nnd.it is not saying too muoiq in conclusion, that business is healthy; and tlio prospects of the future generally good- Flour : Imports continue, light, 'consisting of -parcels dropping in from South, Aus tralia! '-'which' find a ready: sale at quotatioris, wliilo, considerable parcels _of barrel arc worked off to fill tho place of Ade laide sorts.

Closing quotations aro areas follow: Adelaide sorts, L17 10s to LIS;" Magarey's superfine, L18 10s; There is bono of Hart's brand in the market, but supplies are on the way ; both these sorts aro much inquired after. Chilian, L16 por ton ; United States, 40s per barrel! — "Wheat : Imports "are limited, the- demand being for good colonial for mixing purposes ; prices arc nominally 7s per bushel. Oats : Some holders of imported sortB aro now more anxious to realise ; but tbo trade buy with caution; and will do so- until tlio new orop is fairly in tho market. - Quotations aro as follow : Irish and Scotch, 2s 9d to 3s 3d ; Dutoh and Danish, 3s to 3s 4d ; Russian and Calcutta, 2s lOd to 3s 3d ; Californinn, 3s 3d to 3s 6d ;: Colonial 8s 8d tp 3s lOd per bushel.

For tho older, stocks, preferred by investors, there still con- tinues a good demand, and the tendency in the fnvourito stocks iB decidedly upwards. Bank of Victoria shares sell at L84 10s to L35 ; Colonial Bank, at L6 5s, thoro being few sellers at that price. Nationals havo sold at L2 15s and L2 16s. Hobson's Bay shares are not much Sought for, but thoy would bo taken at a small discount ; sales hato been ' made at par. Suburbans liavo slightly improved, aiid liavo changed hands at L6 5s. Insurance companies aro. not much in request. Austra lasians havo sold at L27 ; and "Victoria Life nnd General are improving onco moro ; sales nt L47. Of .gay stocks, Ballaarat liavo been inquired for, and sales mado at L6 2s -64; holders arc asking L6 5s. Mining shares arc generally very dull. Among dividend paying companies, wo notice sales of McNairs, at L83 to L85 ; and Nelson's Reefs, at L22. Tho shares of flic progressive mines.nro almost un saleable, oven at present excessive discounts. Beridigo Valleys nro offered nt 3s Gd, on 35s paid. Maryborouglis Jiavo Eold at 8s; Vic torias, at 14s, , Sandy .Crooks have been much firmer, and have .sold at 27s Gd and 30s.

Deniliquin Stock Mabket.— 3rd January. Thero ha3 been very little moro activity in the store cattle market Bincc our last, but prices realised arc, if anything, a sliado better. There are four mobs, mostly small lots, yet unsold in the neighbourhood. Wo can report a sale of \- GOO head bullocks (Dargins), to Messrs. M'Kinnon nnd Lydiard, at L3 2s Gd, delivered on tho Billobong ; tlio terras being nine or twelvo months. A lot of bullocks (Morrico'a) linvc been sold to Chave, but wo have no par ticulars of tho transaction ; tho cows of this mob .were under offer, several small lots of storo cattiq arc aiso under offer, but wo cannot report the demand to bo brisk .nt top prices. The quantity of fat cattle coming forward has increased :this week over previous returns. Those that have crossed the river arc as follow :— Dee. 29th, M'Kinnon and Ly- dinrd's, 260 ; Dec. 30th, Nichol and 1 Hunt's, 260 ; Deo. 31st, Lang's, 249 ; Jaii. -1st, Ricketson's, 200. In addition to these, we hear of a draft liavirig loft Calaimo on the 31st December, another draught from : Wcrai ; si draft from Barlinm, taken by ISwceney, and a mob of 250 is reportod to have left Hay's station. , Mustering is going on at lluri's, and also nt Warbreccnn. Our Swan Hill correspondent informs us that a mob of 114, consisting of 03 bullocks and 51 cowb, crossed the river during tho week ending 29tli December. It is worthy of note that a buyer offal cattle lias visited tlio town during tho week, being tho orily ease during the last three months'. In horses nothing has been done. In store sheep we can report a good inquiry, espe cially for young ewes, but there ore norio in the market ;' a few lots might bo quitted at fair prices. Two flocks of fat sheep (Taylor and Loughnan's) havo crossed tbo punt, consisting of 1500 ewes and 1600 wethers. The weather is at presont very mild, but thero have been ono or two very hot days during tho week. Food and water still, continue abundant. .

Hay comes in plentifully, but prices exhibit no change : new hay selling at L3 10s to L4, and old at Loto L6, according to quality. Thero is a Btcady-local demand for flour, and prices are firm at L17 per ton.- Bran Is 3d to Is 6d. .

Flour, L16 to L17 for quantity, but only selling for local purposes ; wheat, 6s 3d to 6s 6d, not much offering ; oats, 3s.
