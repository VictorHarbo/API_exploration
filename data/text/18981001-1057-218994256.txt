DEATH OF | THE PREMIER. The Hon. T. J.Byrnes. The Last Sad Offices. Requiem at St. Stephen's. The Funeral, The public funeral accorded to tho Into lion. I Thomas Joseph Byrnes, Premier of Queens ®und, took plnco on Thursday, and was tho most impressive and saddest spectacle ever I witnessed in the colony. On Wednesday 1 thore was a constant stream of callers at Ycronglca to tako their last gllmpso of tho dead, the coffin being placed in ono of the largest rooms, through which tho I mournful procession passed. On Thursday I morning tho coffin was closed down and placed in a hearse drawn by four black | horses. Then hundreds of beautiful wreaths were placed in mourning coaches, and tho procession started for St. Stephen's Roman I Catholic Cathedral, in Brisbane. It pnsscd I Ycronglca railway stntion through a beautiful I memorial arch of crapo, greenery, wreaths, I and crosses, whioh had been erected by the | late Premier's neighbors as a mark of respect to his memory. Tho procession \- passed Quecn-strcct at 0 a.m., and the many I -people in the streets bared tlicir heads in I sympathy. By the timo it reached St. I Stephen's Cathedral nil approaches to tho sacred edifice were thronged, Elizabeth-street I being particularly crowded. Tho scene in tho | Cathedral was magnificent in tho solemnity of its iraprcsstvoness. The high altar was 1 draped in black, and the pillars on each side of the sanctuary were hung with drapery of the same sombro hue. Tho only relief in color was afforded by white crosses and wreaths. Above tho altar, inscribed in letters of gold, wero tho solemn words, "Requiem neternam dona et Domino, ct lux perpctua luceuci." ("Eternal rest grant to bim, 0 Lord, and may perpetual light shine on him.") Tho front of the choir gallery was also draped "in black. There wero numbers of people assembled in tho unreserved parts of tho Cathedral as early as half- 1 past 8 o'clock, and thenceforward it was not long before it was filled iu every part. ! The body was received at tho cntranco to tho Onthedral by the Administrator of the Diocese, tho Rev. Father O'Reilly, and by tho late I Administrator, the Rev. Father Fouhy (tho present parish priest of Toowoomba). The r Bov. Father Fouhy reciting the ritual np- pointed for bucU occasions proceeded tho I coffin as it was bomo up the central aisle to I the chancel where it was placed upon a cata- I falque draped in black, and within a few I- minntcs it was litorally covered by tho most I beautiful wreaths. Tho solemn Requiem I Mass was then commenced, tho celebrant I being the. Rev. Father Dunham assisted by | Father Byrne as deacon, and Father Lee sub- I deacon. His Grace Archbishop Dunne, vested fl In a black copo, with plain, white mitre, occu- | pied bis throne, to the left of tho altar, and at | bis right was Father Donegan, of South Bris- g bane, while Father James Horan, of Warwick, was on his left. Father John 0 Roilly ancl Father Baldwin officiated as Masters of Cere monies. About forty priests wero located ' within tho sanctuary. Tho ancient Gregorian! Mass was impressively chanted by tho choir, 1 tho sad music emphasising the solemn words j of the service. The scene within the sanctu ary was one never to be forgotten by those who witnessed it. As already mentioned, the interior of tho sacred edifice was thronged. ' Mr. Byrnes' relatives," who wero attended by tho Hon. A. J. Thynne, occupied a seat not far \- from tho front of the sanctuary. Tho gather ing was not only a crowded but a thoroughly I representative one. Special scats were re- . served for the Vice-Rcgal Party, the members of both Houses of the Legislature, tho Judi ciary, d'c., and among thoso who were pre sent in tho Cathedral wero his Excellency the Governor, LordLamington, attended by Cap- tain P-elham, A.D.C., and Mr. P.

Never has St. Stephens witnessed such a gathering, and U testified to tho universal esteem in which the Premier was held. During tho progress of the solemn service many tears .were abed. At tho close of tho Re quiem Mass, tho Venerable Archbishop, standing near tho bier, on either side of which wore placed three lighted candelabra pronounced tho final absolution; Tho impressive strains of tho « Dead March " In » Saul " then rase, and tho ' Cathedral bell tolled out its funeral tone. SnWnnnntlv the coffin was -lifted from tho catafalque and tho mass of wreaths which covered it, tho Union Jack was placed upon It, and some of tho intercolonial iloral tributes placed about tho Union Jack. Tho solemn Cathedral procession then reformed and preceded by the Revs. Father Brcen and McKiernan, the coffin was borne by several members of St. Josephs ..pebaUng Society to tho main entrance ' " to the Cathedral, where it was placed upon a gun carriage. By this time Elizabeth-street was packed from some distance south of tho : Cathedral away round into William-street, and up past tho Treasury Buildings towards North Quay. In Elizabeth-street alone, in the immediate vicinity of the Cathcdful, and as far ns tho intersection of Albert-street, there must liuve been fully 15,000 persons. As tho coffin was borne to tho gun carriage ' the scene was roost affecting, every head being bared and bent in silent sorrow, whilo there wero few dry eyc9 as the shell enclosing the mortal remains of the brilliant young statesman was deposited on tho enrringe.

Koeffc, Toowoomba), ubout 100 members of tho Australian Natives Association on foot headed by a carriage con- veying wreaths from all parts of the I colouy, a largo number of members of j other Friendly Societies, and a number j of representatives of other bodies. 1 The scene as the melancholy procession j wended Its way through EllznbcUi- strect was j a memorable one. On cither side thousands | of spectators formed densely packed lines, every balcony being thronged, at every window I a sea of faces, and on every available roof were j to be observed persons anxious to obtain a j glimpse of the procession. Immediately the j procession commenced to move the Police I Bund played the " Dead March," and at this j juncture tho scene was intensely affecting, j many women fainting, while all were more or I less oppressed by the sad solemnity of the oc- I cosion. The utmost order was maintained, I The procession occupied an hour and twenty 1 minutes in passing, nnd its length may be imagined when the fact is stated that the head of it had reached within a few yards of tho Toowong Cemetery gates before the Inst vehicle had passed the Treasury buildings, a distance of over two miles. All along the route was lined on cither side by a dense mass of humanity, nnd one of the most significant features of the whole scene was the air of deep sorrow which pre vailed, and many thousands who had come to I hco the dead Premier's funeral procession had j not conic to view it merely as a spectacle, but as a mark of sorrowful sympathy for tho departed leader. Deep silence anu absolute order were prominent characteristics of tho scene. The cortege reached Toowong Cemetery shortly after 1 o'clock. The proceedings at the cemetery are thug described in yesterday's "Courier" : — " People began to assemble ut the ceme tery almost before tho body had been placed on the gun carriage at the Cathedra!. Tho crowd rapidly became larger, but instead of wniting, as usual, about the gates to watch the arrival of the procession, the peoplo made their way to the graveside. Tho con- sequence was that there was no confusion whatever at Uio gates. Tho first to arrive were two ' busloads of members of tho Aus tralian Natives' Association, innny of them carrying wreaths sent by the different | branches. Tho natives formed a lino on each hand of the gateway, inside the ceme tery. The advance detatchment of the 1 funeral did not arrive till ten minutes past 1, making over two hours since leaving tho Cathedral. Tho Alounted Police passed through the gateway, and took up a position I further along tho path. The members of I the Defence Force, as they approached tho cemetery, drew out nnd lined encb side of I the road. The gun-carriage .was drawn along botweon them ; It was preceded by several mounted Defence Force officers and j police. The Police band in tho monnthnu I struck up tho Dead March. As tho pro- 1 cession wound round tho paths in tho ceme- j tery, the police officers again took the lead. It was noticed that the Minister for Lands now formed one of tho pall-bearers. Tho grave site was in u spot on the second hill to the right of tho gntewny, The body was placed in the family plot alongside I that of the late Air. llyrnes's mother, who died in 1891. end his brother, Michael Y., who died in 1890. The site was roped in, the enclosure being reserved for the relative- friends, and those more immediately con cerned. Among those who occupied posi tions in the vicinity of tho grave wero the chief mourners, his Excellency the Gover- . nor, nnd the occupants of the vicc-rega! , carriage, the President and Members of , the Legislative Council, tho Spenkcr and members oi tuc .Legislative ashoiuuiv, uie i officials of both Houses, and the depart- 1 meats with which Mr. Byrnes was more closely associated, and many of the legal profession. The proceedings were of the simplest and briefest character. The short j burial service of the Roman Catholic j Church was read by Archbishop Dunne, as sisted by the Rev. Fathers Morris, Hcgarty, Lee, Hayes, and Horan (Warwick). The coffin likewise bore this simple inscription : I " Thomas Joseph Bvrnes. Died 27th Sep tember, 1808. Aged, 37 years. R.I.P." As it was being lowered, nn affecting sceno took place, owing to the fortitude of the lady relatives giving way. When tho gravo I hud been filled 'in the whole party kneeled, 1 while the Archbishop offered up a short prayer, ending with the simple exhortation, " Mny his soul, and the souls of ull the faith ful departed, rest in j»caee." There were many wet eyes during tho proceedings. At the close, the Iloral tributes were placed In tiie enclosure: but there wero so many that great difficulty were experience in finding suitable places for all. The beautiful cross on a pod trial, forwnrded by members of the Legislative Assembly, was given placo n't tho head of the grave. Alongside it ids Excellency the Governor placed his wreath, and near that was put 'the wreath of the members of tho Legislative Council. Thu Chief Justice Sir S. W. Griffith) also placed a wreath on the coffin nt the gravo in honour of his old friend and collenguc." It is impossible to adequately describe tho beautiful floral tributes sent, including as they did some magnificent wreaths, crosses, floral harps etc. Among thoso who contri buted these marks of sympathy are the follow ing: — His Excellency Lord Lamington, tho Governments of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, mcml>orsof tho Queens land Ministry, Speaker and members of tho Legislative Assembly, officersof tho Legislative Assembly, President and members of the Legislative Council, officers of tho Government Printing Office, employees of tho Government Printing Office, officers of tho Police Depart ment, officers of the Department of Agrlcul- ! ture, the officers of the Chief Secretary's Be- : partmcnt, tho Home Secretary and staff, the I officers of the Treasury Department, tho offi- I cera of tho Public Works Department, the | officers of tho Alnrlno Department, the Queensland Potico Force, tho Staff of tho Alines Department, tho Registrar of tho Sup reme Court anil Staff, tho officers of the Post and Telegraph Department tho officcrsof Insol vency, Intestacy, and Insanity, tho officers of I the Government Savings Bank, tho Speaker I of tho Legislative Assembly, tho Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, (ho Han.
