Mi Service has not yet entered fully into the proposal, but so fur les he lins considered it he thinks thnt it is not snell n Hclieme ns the colony should inter upon His obieehim to it is based principally, upon the fact that the evlnbition would not be permanent, nnd would not attract those persons w hose attendance vi ould be of the most advanlngt to Austialin 'J lie idea of allon nig free

and de clanng that provision for religious education wus properly left to the parents and churehes On the othei hand, the movement for providing Buch instruction for the state school children outside of the hours appro priated for secular education, is being well supported, and seems likely to 1« sue cessful The Bishop of Melbourne, who is at the hca 1 of the Bible in State Schools League, also suppoits this movement and so do many clergymen audlnjmen of his and other Protestant denominations Last week a deputation vv aited on Mi Sei v ice, Minister of Education, to request lum to make such alterations in the departmental regula tions as would facilitate the operations of those who are willing to assust in im parting religious instruction after school hours It was suggested by the deputation that becular instruction should cease at half past 3 o clock in the afternoon, that the schools should then be only formally dis missed, and that the children should be allowed to remain for religious exercises, such religious instruction to be given by special staffs organised for the purpose Mr Service intimated his willingness to assist this movement as far as possible, and has asked foi information on the subject from the oflicial teaching staff and the boards of advice 'lhe Shops Commission, which has been for many months inquiring into hours of loboui, wages, mid other matters affecting the employés in various branches of m dustrj, has drafted a scheme for the es tablishment of courts ot conciliation, for the si ttlement of trade disputes , but the scheme will not be iiimllj passed until tlie cilticism of persons interested, which is inv lied, has been dealt with bj the commis sion lhe proposals are for the creation of a cential council of 14, elected equally

amicable arrani-ement be arm ed at by them the matter is to be referred to the central council, w hose decrees shall hav e the force of law Some agitation has been caused amongst the rreemimons of the colony by a move ment for the establishment of a distinct and separate Grand Lodgo of Victoria The formation of a Victorian constitu tion has been advocated before, but on the present occasion the promoters have od vonced further than they have ever gone before 'lhe first hint of the present move ment was given at the last communication of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Victoria, under the Irish constitution, but Sir W J Clarke, the Provincial Grand Master of the Irish Masons, who was present, and who was suggested as tbefirst Grand Master of a United Grand Lodge of Victoria, declined the honour, deprecating, as he put it, any pro position for "cutting the painter ' that binds Victorian Masons to.the mother Grand Lodges of England, Scotland, and Ireland But the movement w as commue- in spue 01 its being discountenanced by the great ma- jority of Masons m the colony, including almost the whole of the J-ngliBh lodges (70 m number) The two Bister con stitutions of Scotland and Ireland num- ber 25 lodges The advocates and op ponents of an independent Grand Lodge of Victoria, as a matter of com se, advance diflerentsets of arguments on the question as to the necessity for such an institution The principal grievance seems to be distance from tho supremo authorities, and the Union urge that a "constant correspond- ence and reference ia lcquircd to be kept up between Provincial and Grand J-odges Masonic certificates, registrations, and returns are constantly required, and con turned delays and trouble occur eoncerning them, which are not readily rectified on account of the great distance " Then it is remarked that large sums of money have constantly to be remitted, for which there is no return " The opponents of the Vietonan Grand Lodge reply that " certificates regis trationB, &a;, aro not delayed m the English constitution, the District Grand Master or his deputy having power to supply a certificate at once in case of emergency, or oven if a brother demands it " As to the money sent home, it is admitted that the Scotch and Irish lodges lia vc just grounds for complaint, for not only do they pay for certificates and registration, but an annunl payment has to be mude to Edinburgh and Dublin on account of each lodge or member Lodges m the colonies under the J Dglish Constitution ore more favonrnbly situated, tor since the year 1819 the only demand has been 7s lui for each candidates registration and certificate, an nual dues, which ure payable by home lodges, having been abolished for the colonies C4 years ago na stilted IheLnglish Masons consequently see no vnhd reason w hy tin y should sevtr their connexion with the Grand Lodge of Lngliuid At a meeting held on the 19th inst. of delegates from lodges favourable to the formation of a Grund Lodge of Vic tona, about 70 gentlemen were presen- il was stated that circulars had been Bent to all the lodges, and that l8, viz, 12 Irish, 6 Scotch, and 1 English liad promised to join the movement, and it was resolved that the Grand Lodge of Vic tona bo founded «his day 'lhere was a ininonty in fin our oi a six months' postpone ment of the step The office bearers wero nominated, Mr Coppin P M and M L.A

District Granel Lodgo ol Victoria under the English Constitution, it was resolved to submit to the Most Worshipful Grand Master of England, the Prince of \\\ ales, the name of some brother as

MELBOURNE GRAIN REPORT. Messrs. K.

Tho estimated area under erop was set down at 9110,-12acres, and the ai ernte 5 leid 0 01 bushels to tlio acre Assuming tho estimate to bo approximately corrcet, after allow lug for home consumption and sect, this would be a sur plus loft a\\-liable for export equal to 72,000 tons of ! wheat Up to tho commencement of tlio present month wo had shipped awaj 42,000 tons, and hence it would appear that there was -bill a surplus of 10,000 tens of w heat over and abovo our local want It »as this element ¡n the market that Induced tho drop referred to, and the recoiory Is duo to two influences which have of late como Into notieo 1 Irst, a demand for Victorian w heat for tlio Sydnoy market, and, second, u doubt as to tlio correctness of Mr Hatters figures, which aro challenged as bclng unsupported by delii cries at Hie Melbourno market of wheat or Hour from the country It ii Into resting to note that » lillst from tho 1st Januar' to the 28th Juno, 1883, the deliveries at Melbourne,

result which hardly point« to a larger wheat j ¡old, moro particularly w l(cli it is remombcred that in 1882 heavy shipments of wlicat wero made from Geelong as compared with a len insignificant quantity this season If wo add the dM-rcnccs - Well the smaller deliveries at Geelong this sLason would make, there Is a dlfferenco of nearly -00,000 bags to account for, and this is sub stantlally borne out by the fact that our exports to date aro 280,537 bags less than to tho corresponding date in 1882, whilst our stocks In Melbourne and Gee long aro also lower Unless, therefore, tho farmcrs hola heavy stocks, It may jet bo feared that tho agricultural st-itlsticfl liaio oior estiuntcd our wheat yield for the past mia-on lower es ti um te there is not still a fair available surj'hi9 in
