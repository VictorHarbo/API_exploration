She maintains that the British vessel rammed the "Marianne". One of the parties is lying, but which one? -• In "MONDAY CONCERT" at 3.00pm the New Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Antonio de Almeida will play "Viviane" Op. 5 by Chausson and "Lenore" by Duparc. At 10.00pm on Wednesday in the third talk in his series "THE URBANISATION OF AUSTRALIA", Professor Sol Encel discusses race relations — a social issue which was largely ignored in Australia during the decade of decision from 1939-1949. But Australia's post- war Immigration Policy changed that. For many years it was possible .to imagine that the attitude towards Aboriginals was a separate issue to the problems associated with thfe assimilated non- British migrants or the long-term exclusion of Asians, known to the world as The White Australia Policy. In this talk, Professor Encel examines the origin of Australian racial prejudice and looks at the effect it will have on Australia. I ABB"9PAVLTVLK J
