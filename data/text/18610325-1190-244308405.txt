MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL. Sinco our last monthly summary no very ro- marknblo incidents have broken tho monotony of our commercial history. There liavo been no disturbing circumstances to shako our credit, no sorious insolvencies, and littlo or no specula tion. Tho ordinary transactions of buying nnd selling have proceeded daily and weekly with out much vnrintion, nnd if wo may beliovo a majority of our traders, without tnuoh profit. It can scarcely bo supposed that business Is conducted month after month at a loss, and 1 that tho morcnntilo mon of Arictorin nro for tlio most part living on thoir capitol, or on tho capital of others, though such n statement is occasionally ventured by certain dismal coin- plaincrs among ub. That somo nro barely clearing oxpcnscs mny bo safoly admitted, and 1 that innny small traders have been rapidly ex hausting thoir means, or hnvo nvnilod them selves of tho oonvoniont asylum of " tho Court' to cscnpo utter ruin, may also bo allowed. But on tlicso grounds it would bo as absurd as un- truo to pronounce the entire fabric of our com- mefco unsound, and to prognosticate over whelming bankruptcy for tho wholo country. It is fnr bettor to regard tho gradual olinngo which has como ovor tho aspect of our business as ono not void of proniiso for tho future. Instead of bowailing 'tho want of tho fcvcrisli excitement which prevailed in the speculative days of tlio past, wo do well to congratulate ourselves on tho safer bnsis of credit now established, and tho steadier prin ciples upon which business is now moro gene rally conducted. Tlioro are of courso still wanting many things to render tho country ns prosperous and as wealthy n9 its residents desire, and for theso wo shall probably havo some timo longer to wait. Our present state is not however without somo symptoms of progress, which, if too slow to moot tho wishes of very ardent suitors of fortune, nro contem plated with satisfaction by tho patient ploddora who rely for success upon industry and pru dence, and have tlio discretion to wait for cer tain results ns their reward. Among other promising sign3 wo may notice, tho improving yield of our goldflclds, attributable in part to tlio moro systematic and soiontifio methods of mining now gradually coming into operation, — tlio extension of agricultural pursuits, - and the cousequent increase in tho homo pro duction of the ncccssaricB of lifo. and tho more moderate scale on which shipments liavo for scvonil months been coming forward. To those circumstances wo ought possibly to add the prospect of large accessions to our popu lation, from tho revival of immigration, nnd of new sources of wealth being opened by tlio in troduction of manufactures, tlio cultivation of tho vine, and tlio development of other besides our golden mines. In our usual commercial columns wo linve reviewed tho business of the past week at somo length, and liuyo also given a detailed report of tho Stock and Share Murkot. It is there fore not necessary here to touch upon tlio particular branches of our trade — as the re marks clsowliorc indicate tho general results of tlio month's business. Had wo been able to report a mora decided 'advanco in tho quota tions of tho import market, it would doubtless have been more satisfactory to all concerned— but with' a fow exceptions, prices nro still ruling at nbout tho samo standard as last month, notwithstanding tlio dccrcnso in tlio nmount of consignments coming forward. Beforo nnytiiing like a general rise in value can bo established, there must be, in nddition to this decline in shipments, a vast incrcaso injthc number of consumers, nnd a material improve ment in thoir purchasing means AYool, Tallow, and Hide Mahket. — Messrs. R. Goldsbrough and Go. report ns fol lows : During the past month tho amount of ' business transacted in this market lids boon, in conscquoneo of tho small quantity coming for ward, vci'v limited ; inquiry, however, hns con- tiuued brisk, and although tho wools offering liavo gonorally boon of nil inferior to avorago description, yot, in tlio absence of anything good, buyers hnvo competed freely, and prices obtained havo been, in most instances, quite oqunl to previous quotations. Tho only sale by auction was held nt our stores on AVedncsday last, when, although the news rcccivod from Europo of tho threatened disturbances in America, tho tightness of tlio money market, otc., was scarcely calculated to inspiro con fidence for tho future, buyors operated -with spirit, nnd cleared, off nearly all tho lots, con sisting of .272 bales, at full prices. Now that tho Benson of 1860-1 may be virtually consi dered as brought to n close, a short retrospect of tho business transacted may not bo out of place, moro especially ns it lias presented an improvomont on.preceding years in tbo condi tion in whioh tlio bulk of tlio clip has been sent to market. During tho past fow years, the influx of now and more discrimi nating buyers has offcctod a great change, nnd settlors generally aro beginning toperceivo that ' it is c'onducivo to their interests to meet tho present requirements, by getting lip thoir flooks iu tho best possiblo manner. Previous to tho nbovo period, unwashed wools, nnd those in in- farior nnd heavy condition, realised oompara- ' lively as high rates as good flock9 carefully got up ; consequently growers had not tlio "samo inducements to oxcrciso duo earo and judg ment in shearing and washing which thoy havo at presont, when buyers devoto their greatest attention to superior lots in good condition,' passing with comparativo neglect inforior de scriptions. This lias been moro noticeable during tho past- than in any previous year, and, as a natural' consequence, tho competi tion iu good lots has resulted in vory high prices, in which other descriptions havo not participated to tho somo extent. Tho clip, liowover, would liavo shown a much moro marked improvement than it has, had it not boon for tho unsottlod state of tho woatlior at shearing time ; frequent showers preventing tho flceco getting dry so quickly as desirable, whereby many flooks wero not in near so high a condition as they othorwiso would havo boon. This, of courso, was beyond tho settlors' control ; wo are, liowevor, . confident that after, tho ex- perionoo wo havo had, tho condition of next year's clip will, should tho weather bo ordinarily favourable, surpass any previous ono ; as the growers generally evinco a unanimous dosiro to take ovory possible care to meet tho requirements of tho market. Prices current : superior scoured, 2s 3d to 2s 7d; ordinary do, 2s to 2s 2d; hand-washod, Is 8dto Is lOd; superior flecco, 1b lid to 2s 2)d ; ordinary to good, Is 7d to Is lOd ; inferior, Is 4d - to Is 6d; greasy (good), lid to Is 2d; do i (inforior to ordinary), 8d to lOd.

Hides: AVo have no change to report. Curers nro stili paying higher rates than are warranted by the state of tlio homo market, and as it is impossi ble to effoct sales horo at remunorativo rates stocks aro shipped on owners' account. Clear ances during tho month nre :— Thomis, 1835 Jiidcs ; Lawronco Brown, G534 do. Tallow : Thoro hns boon a brisker demand for ooloniai consumption, and prices havo hardened a littlo. AVo quoto for shipment, beof, L38 to L42 mixed, L40 to L44 ; and mutton, L48 to L50 por ton. Clearances aro as follows: — Thomis 248 casks ; Lawronco Brown, 5G7 do ; York shire, 32 do. Flow, Grain, Em-Mr. AV. Lawranco furniEli03 tho following review for tlio month ending 25th March, 1861 :— Sinco tho dopnr- toro of tho last English mail tlio corn markot lias maintained a steady position ; and, as fur as breadstuffs aro concerned, has considerably advanced in prices. Horso- foeding grain re mains without alteration to note ; malt still advances; potatoes and other csculnnts nro most abundant, and prices rule low. Tlio weather lms boon fine, with alternate hot winds, followed by heavy rains, during tho post week which has _ enabled farmers to proccod with field operations, tlio early-sown wheat having yielded tho best return Inst season. Tho ques tion of Protection to Nntivo Industry is still being agitated in some of tlio agricultural dis tricts, but doc3 not gain strength ; whilo tlio proposition of imposing import . duty nud wharfage duos ou corn, flour, potatoes, etc., by tlio Government, in January W, mqt with so much opposition as to causo tho immediate withdrawal of tho measure. Flour : Imports sinco tlio 1st inst. consist of about 1300 tons from South Australia, nnd 100 tons from California. From our own seaboard and Tus- mnnm Bupphos hnvo been sparing, whioh havo moved off freely ns lnndotl, to supply town as well ns country orders— tho latter still con tinuing for tho better class of imported sorts whilo parcols have been exported to Now Zea land and Now South AVales, to which latter i colony 250 tons of Adelaide, Chilian, and United States barrel havo gone. These opera tions cheeked tlio downward tendency noticed last month, nnd which lias been followed by nn ndvunco of fully 30s per ton all round. Tho Otto, from San Francisco, linB' just arrived at Sydnoy with 400 tons flour, and reports tlio likelihood of further shipments from California, which to nil nppoarancc3 will como to a better market than might havo been anticipated. This nrrivnl does not appear to affect that market. Closing quotations being — for Adelnido BortB, L18 to L18 10s: Hart's nnd Mngnroy's superfine, L19 ; Tasiiiniiinn, Victo rian (town nnd country), L17 10s ; Chilian nnd Cnhforninii, entirely out or first hands, is held for L17 per ton of 2000 lbs ; United States, 38s to 40s ; whilo bucIi brands a9 Hiixnll, Gullego, nnd Dunlop's nro worth 42s por barrel. AVhcnt : Im ports sinco tho 1st inst. consist of about 15,000 bushels from South Australia, 2,500 bushels from Tasmania, and G,500 from our own seaboard. Tho wot harvest has hud tlio effect of damaging tlio colonr of a portion of tho crops grown in this colony, while in somo districts, owing to heavy floods nnd the want of sufficient labour, quantities havo Buffered to such an oxtcnt as' to render it unfit for milling purposes ; in some instances complaints avo mndo without causo, liowevor, estimating tho loss nt a considerable item in quantity produced, it will bo seen that very largo supplies will yot reach miller'B hands, nnd especially so woro tho market likely to nssumo a downward tendonoy. Iu Tasmania cxtcn- sivo parcels nro snid to liavo been bought on Melbourne account, whilo tho continued de mand in tho Soutli Australian markot for export to this and neighbouring colonics causes somo excitement, closing quotations 7s to 8s per bushel of 60 lbs. Oats : Imports fall off, but supplies aro amplo from our own pro ductions ; although the colour isnot equal to tho avorago of former crops, yot llicy urc found good enough for nil purposes, and they will go far to supply our consumption for months. Thoro is n Blightly better feeling noticcnblo for sweet nnd sound parcels of imported sorts, but prices can scnrcely bo said to improve, ns Government hnvo found parties willing to supply thorn with largo quantities at a prico equal to 2s 5d por bushel. Any good parcels ot Oaliforninn, purchasable nt nnd under 3s Gd have found buyers ; somo now Calcutta hnvo boon Bold at 3s, whilo colonial hnvo receded fully 4d por bushel. Closing quotations nre — Scotch and Irish, 2s to 3s ; Dutch nnd Danish, 3s to 3s 3d ; Californian, 3s 4d to 3s Gd ; colonial, 3s 9d to 4s per bushed of 40 lbs. Barley : Tho supplies nro light ; tlio de mand increases for Capo for seed, whilo low transactions result as yet in English malting ; tlio former may bo quoted at 5s 6d to 6s Gd, tho latter nt Gs to 7s per bushel of 501b. Maize : This grain hns run up in price, nnd the consumption lms fnllon off in conscquonce. Supplies of foreign grown will probably reach horo soon. Closing quotation, 6s Gd per bushel of 5G lb. Gram : n small parcel to hand wns quitted at L12 10s per ton of 2240 lb : but tho price, being considered high, limits its con- sumption also. Bran : Supplies nro not in ex cess of tho demand or consumption, yet prico3 rule low. Quotations cannot bo made over Is 3d por bushel of 20 lb. Outmenl is in fair request; but prices rulo nt such rates ns lenvo no margin for importations. Im ported sorts may bo quoted at LIS to L19 ; colonial, at L25 . per . ton of 2240 lb. Malt : Imports nro vory moderate. Colonial is well worked out, and imported sorts sell nt oxtroino rates ; the closing price lor English being 13s Gd to 14s por bushel of 40 lb. Hay : Hydraulic pressed liny will most probably bo imported to somo extout this sea son ; somo parcels to hand from South Aus tralia havo realised' L7 to L7 10s per ton. Potatoes: Supplies ore nbundunt, and prices rulo low. Victorian-grown, L3 10s to L4 per ton of 2240 lb, whilo a parcel from Circular Head (Tasmanin) did not realise L4.- Onions nre nbundnnt, and can bo obtnined nt L3 10s to L4 per ton of 2240 lb.
