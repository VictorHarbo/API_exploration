I thank you heartily for this distinguished mark of your approval, which, if it could bo stamped with higher valuo, is moro precious to me, bocaoso you frankly Btnto it to be tho result of my publie career in oonneotion with tho oity, and tho sntisfnotlon you havo felt in my dis- charge of tho publio duties devolving on me. With tho ramo spirit of franknoss and candour >n which you havo addressed me, I accept your in- vitation, confident alike in the sincerity of your expressions of. npprovul, and your promises of support. 1 I agree with you, that in tho turmoil of political events «hiçhuflnto years lins agitated tho colony, you must have h»d fair opportunity of judging pretty accurately of tho general soope and tSnor of my political opinions, and for moro for tho sake ol tho advancement of thoso opinions whioh t hold lo bo true, than for the possession of the lionouryou wish to confer upon mo, do I reioioo to hear that those opinions aro your olin.

To Thomas Hyndes, Esq., and tho other.Electors of tho City of Sydney signing tho above Requisition. 2329 TO THE ELECTORS OF THE CITY OF SYDNEY. GENTLEMEN-I have been unexpectedly in- vited, by the usual form of requisition from an. influential, number, of your body, to oiler myself as ii candidate for the scat in your repré- sentation which has become vacant by tho resignation of our lato excellent member, Mr. Lamb. -For the Inst few years I have tnkon nn notivo part in the publlo movements of this city, and, hy this gratifying recognition of my humble services, I- feel flattered into tho hope that my efforts have been in some measure oonduoivo" to the publia -benefit. .' During that time, I have never thought of stepping aside from what I "believed to bo my path of duty, to seek for office or mark' of distinc- tion'at the hands of my fellow citizens ; and there are those among you who know how ar ' dently I have desired, on tko present occasion, to seo a candidate, with higher abilities to serve you and stronger claims to your support; brought forward for your suffrage?. - Tho prinoiplcs which I hold necessarily lead me to fi* the standard of qualification for a' Representative far above my own estímalo of my capacity to fill .with' credit and usefulness that dignified and respon- sible office. Besides a sense of my own uufitiiesi, tho anxiety which I feel In the discharge of other important duties would urge mo to declino the invitation with which 1 hare been honoured, if 1 could feel assured that the publia intcrosts would bo committed to hands abler and moro willing than mine to promote and dofend them. As it is,. I do not feel Warranted in taking any other' course than acceding-.- to your requisition. After much thought, .and .-.consulting with friends on whoso advice I set much .value, I have mndo up my mind, in good faith, and. with a firm purpose, to place my services át "yótlr. disposal. Should your choice, on tho day of polling, bo in! my favour, my limited abilities shall bc steadily land faithfully employed, in my new .sphere of action, to advance the 'prosperity ¡and ^freedom of i tho country. It now becomes .necessary for mo to explain and'I wllI'do'-BO^as^b'riefly ns I cnn-tho principles whioh will regulate my publie conduot, if elected to tho distinguished post of your Representative. Throughout ray lifo I have advocated tho exten- sion of political power to'the great body of tho people. Tho experiences <'ofJ every day hnvo tended: to confirm my : adheroneo .to thoso prin- ciples of .Progressive.,,Reform whioh are now admitted to be tho.best safeguard; of. our British institutions, and' tho brightest glory of our national cha incl or. ; ? I am "an advocate of tho National System of Education, believing it to hollie best pinn hither- to, devised for extending to all classes tho advan- tages of knowledge-'that greatest blessing of civilised socioly. . .. , I would extend the political franchise, that this great social blessing might follow, OB well as on tho ground of inhereut right ; for,, assuredly we must look for enlightenment ns tho fruit, not watt td see Implanted na tho root,-of sound and rational liberty. . II» , ; As a leading principle, I would .make popula- tion tho basis of tho representation, BO that honest notion might he given to à liberal, franchise, in the electoral-'decisions of tho country. . l am prepared to carry out to my utmost in colonial legislation, tho:principles of that Freo Trade Polioy ef tho Imperial Parliament, which has already produced such magnificent results for the advancement of British commerce. . I : nm'. opposed to all State endo« monts for Religious : purposes ; but BO long as the existing Schedule for Church support is continued, I will, if elected, vote for im oquitnblo-distribution of tho publie mouey to all Denominations. ' These, general statements of tho principles which I entertain, will indicate how I should bu likely to act in tho Council with reference to particular measures of legislation ; hut in those opportunities .of ' intercourse which will occur -before'tho clay of election, and on the Hustings, I shall bo happy to explain my views, on any publie question, to those of your number who may wish to ascertain moro fully my opinions. I nm called upon-without any motion of my own-by a voico which I do not feel nt liborty to disobey to submit my claims to your judgment. 1 know I must nbldo by your decision. My publlo conduct is beforo yon," nnd open to tho canvass bf all ; roy sentiments hnvo been frequoutly expressed, and nt all times without disguise or fear.
