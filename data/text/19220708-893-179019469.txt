NO EMBARGO. SETTLERS FROM DENMARK. ? Mr. Peterson, the new Tory member for Normanby, has exhibited an axiety In the past few days to know whe ther tho Queensland Government has placed an embargo on Danish immi grants. In answer to a question oil the subject, which ho asked the Pre mier on Thursday, ho was told that the Government had not imposed any such embargo, nor had it the power to do so. Yesterday he returned to the attack. He read a letter from the Premier, written in March, 1921, to himsolf (Mr. Peterson), in which tho Premier said: "Wo are not making any arrange ments In the direction of inducing other than British subjects to emi grate to Queensland. Tho Queens land Government, however, recogniscs the value as future citizens of Danish farmers with capital, and I would bo glad to consider any proposal that would lead to the settlement of such farmers in this State, provided they were possessed of, say, not less than £700 cach." The Premier said that the letter read represented the position. The question he had answered the previous day was accurate. The State Gov ernment had no power constitution ally to impose any embargo. Opposition Voices: What about the ,£700? The Premier: In connection with Government assistance to Immigrants "we lay down our own regulations. We give preference to Britishers, to which the member opposite seems to object.
