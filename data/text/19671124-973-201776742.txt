Un der its conductor - soloist, Antonio Janigro, the ensemble has performed at every major European Festival. From. Great Britain, the Festival will present Gillian Weir, a brilliant young organist who has already won international acclaim for the extent of her repertoire and the quality of her musicianship. A brilliant selection of British films includes Romeo and Juliet, starring the incomparable Dame Margot Fonteyn (pictured be- low) and Rudolph Nureyev, in full colour, with the Royal Bal let Company and the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Three other British film triumphs are Marat/Sade, a play within a play, set in the grim Charenton Asylum, and performed by the Royal S h a kespeare Company directed by Peter Brook; Accident, with screenplay by Harold Pinter; and Cul-de-sac, directed by Polanski A Sinhalese film of some interest is Gamperaliya, which has won several major awards.

The Lucero Tena Company of flamenco dancers and Castanet players from Madrid will be making their first Australian appearance during the Festival.
