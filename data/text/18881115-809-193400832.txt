PR O S P E C T U Of a COMPANY to PURCHASE a FREEHOLD ESTATE Of ABOUT TWENTY-TWO ACRES, In CITY of PERTH, W.A., And an Estate Of ABOUT TWO HUNDRED ACRES (Exclusive of StreetsX Subdivided into about 800 Quarter Acre Blocks, Almost in City of Perth. Capital : £8000 in 6COD Shares of £1 each. 2s. on Application, 2s. on Allotment, and Balance not to Exceed Is. per Share per Month. TRUSTEES : J. J. Marshal, Esq., Paddincton Brewery, Pad- dington. R. J. Brandon, Esq., J.P., Bourke-street, Warerley. BANKERS : Bank of New South Wales.- SOLICITOR Thomas Marshall, Esq., Pitt-street. BROKERS : G. Dyson and Co., Phtenix -chambers, 153 Pitt- street, Sydney, Directors will be elected at first meeting, which will be held in about a month. These two valuable properties are placed under offer for the extremely low sum of £6750, on easy terms. The extra capital is being raised to prepare for contingencies, improvements to estates, or other expenses which may arise. It is estimated that not more than 8s. or 10s. will need to be called up. The 22 acres of city land will subdivide into over 5000 selling feet, with valuable water frontages, and should readily realise £6000. The suburban land is already subdivided into about 800 quarter-acre blocks, and should realise, at a low figure, £8000. This estimate of £14,000 is based on present sel ling price of tbe land, and if the property be held for a couple of years it is estimated double that price could be realised in subdivision. These properties have been inspected and selected as tbe most eligible in and around Perth, and in vestors may rely on it that no more genuine venture uas ever ueen placed betore the public ol New South Wales or adjoining colonies. No promoters' shares are to be issued, everv share ranking alike as to calk. Ac. The properties are placed under offer to Mr. G. Dyson, who has inspected them on behalf of the proposed Company, tor the sum of £6750. and ore being sold under circumstances highly favorable to the proposed Company. The expenses of the Company need be very small, as Mr. G. Dyson, who has had considerable experi ence in disposing of land in subdivision, and economically managing estates, will, if the com pany feel disposed to accept his offer, place his services and offices at their disposal for a nominal sum, and a commission on profits. To show his faith in the concern, he is prepared to take from 500 to 1030 shares, should that number be avail able. Tbe company will be a terminating one, and no other properties can be purchased without express sanction of the shareholders. Tbe 22 acres are in a good position right in the city, and have about 15 chains frontage to the Swan River ; they are adjoining Government reserve, and close to another reserve for public gardens. It is about 10 minutes' walk from the Town Hall, and can be approached either by macadamised road or water. Every block of land between this and the centre of the city, with the exception of Government reserves, which almost surround this estate, is laid out in town lots, and not an acre can be purchased at the price this is being offered at. As will be seen by ihe official plans, very few blocks of land avail able for subdivision can be purchased in tbe city of Perth, and already such blocks are being readily bought op by Melbourne and other speculators, and it may safely be said that in a few months blocks of land situated as this is, and of such an area, will be eagerly sought after, but unobtainable except at a very much higher figure. What will 20 acres of city land be worth in a few years ? This company will do well to secure it, and obtain a gift while there is a chance. The 800 quarter-acre blocks of land are almost In the city, being but a few chains from the boundary. It has been carefully inspected, and is without doubt a valuable estate, being nearly all elevated and overlooking the city, and the beautiful waters which separate it from the city. It has frontages to two main roads, and therefore is very accessible. It is very advantageously subdivided into quarter-acre blocks, pegged out, and cleared. The Company will not therefore lose an acre of land for streets, or be put to expense in regard to subdivision. Esti mating each block, which is 66 ft. frontage by 165ft. deep, at £10 (which is a low estimate), this estate alone would realise £800 0, being more than tbe cost of the two properties now under offer. That tho progress of Western Australia has been slow up to the present period is not to be wondered at when the circumstances are looked into. That such a tine colony has remained so long, as it were, a blank, is a lasting disgrace to the British nation, or those who have bad the controlling power of its destiny. Languishing for want of population and capital to develop it, the wonder is that the popula tion has not decreased. Hampered and restrained from borrowing the necessary capital to carry on any public works, it is somewhat a miracle that its handftu of people have not before now openly rebelled, and claimed the right to manage their own affairs. Almost worn out by waiting for the turn of ttae< tide the people of that colony h&vo; not yet fully realised what is within their grasp— Responsible Government, or a Constitution similar to our own. Will anyone who has watched the progress of our own colony 3ince we were granted a right to manage our own affairs deny what will be the result of that boon to Western Australia? What will be the result of the first loan after Responsible Government is granted ? Will it cot have the effect of rapidly increasing the population, and stimulate numbers of slumbering industries ? It will cause such a rise in the value of property that no such field as Western Australia will present Itself for the capitalist. The day Responsible Government is granted to Western Australia will be the most joyful one ever witnessed there. That Responsible Government is within its grasp is a certainty. It is confidently expected there that within the next few weeks, or months at most, everything will be settled. Tbe railway from Perth to Albany is almost com pleted. The Midland railway is again commenced, and German immigrants are to settle on land emi nently suitable for vineyards, orchards and agricul ture. The goldfields are no invth, but an encoura ging and promising reality. The latest goldfields are only a few days by good read from Perth, and machinery is now being erected on the field. Numbers of people are wending their way daily to them, and it is anticipated that in a few months a great rush will take place. All these developments will assuredly cause a marvellous rise to take place in the value of land, and those who secure the picked blocks now will have chances which no others can have. Early application for shares is necessary, as a number are already applied for. All money returned within one month from the date of prospectus if required number of shares are not applied for. The only expenses the company, if formed, will be pat to are those attending the formation, which will be very light Plan showing positions of both blocks will accom pany prospectus, and other information will readily be giTen at the office of the brokers, Messrs.

I am willing to go before a J.P. and swear to the above. Mr. W. WITE, 23 High-street, Warerley. Sydney, 29th October, 1888. To H. J. Speer, M.D. Dear Sir,— l wish you to make this statement pnohcthrongh the press, and I will gladlv attend to any personal inquiries at 203 Cumberland-street. When quite young I had a fall, causing me every now and then severe pains across my bai?lc A few- weeks ago these pains became almost unbearable, and I completely broke down, with a feeling that my time was coming to a close. I was unable to sleep, depressed, discoloration of tkin, aud lost inv appetite. Hearing of you through a friend I called, and in a simple and straightforward way my trouble was made as plain as day to xne, with the result that I had complete confidence in you, which, to my thinking, has much to do with the successful treatment of any trouble. In conclusion, I thank you for my complete restoration to health. Youre faithfully, Mrs. GRANT, 203 Cumberland-street. Sydney, 13th July, 1888. To tbe Public- Having been a great sufferer from an affection of the eyes, which has been very severe for the past three months, so much so that I had to give up my work for fear of becoming totally blind, x called on Dr. Speer a fortnight ago, and rhanba to his careful attention and treatment, I have gradually recovered the use of my sight, and feel altogether a different man, my whole system having undergone a com plete cliange. 1 am now able to resume ray work, and take an'interescin anything I do, which I could not before. I have great pleasure in recommending sufferers from any cause to consult Dr. Speer, who I am sure takes great interest in all his patients. Yours faithfully, DAVID WYLLIE, Harris-street, Sydney. Sydney, 8th July, 1888. To the Public, — Having been a sufferer for the last two years from various troubles, I gave up all hope of ever regain ing my lost health. Having consulted many doctors in Sydney without obtaining any satisfaction or re lief, I was advised by others to call on Dr. Speer, who told me from what I was suffering, and guaran teed he could cure me. I have been under ms care for about five weeks, and am now perfectly cured, and in the best of health, Dr. Speer having fnlly carried out his promise. I strongly advise anyone suffering from any cause whatever to at once Visit Dr. Speer ; he will tell you if you can be cured, and will not try any experiments. I became much better after the first few doses of his medicine, and have steadily improved till 1 am now completely cured. (Signed) ALICE VOSS, 12 Agar-street, Sydney. 16th October, 1831 To 1L J. Speer, M.D. Dear Sir, — Words fail to express my gratitude for tho splendid core which you have effected in my case ; and tor the sake of my fellow creatures who may be likewise afflicted, and who do not know where to eo for proper treatment, I wish you to publish this letter. For the past six years I haTe suffered from weakness and pains in the back, a feeling of being 1 easily tired, waking up in the morning languid and unrefreshed, depression of spirits, loss of appetite, furred topcue ana constipa tion — in fact, a general feeling that 'life was not worth living. I applied to several doctors and herbalists for advice, with the result that, after spending large sums of money my health was rendered even worse than before, owing to tbe violent remedies. I read your advertisement, which seemed to bear the stamp of honesty upon its face, and I came to yon on 14th May, when you told me ; at once the nature of my disease, and that for a small fee you would undertake to treat me and supply me with all medicine until I was cured. Thanks to your skilful and painstaking treatment, t I am to-day what God intends U3 all to be— in per- feet health. I am, yours very gratefully, W.FLEGG, Ferris-street, North Ann an dale. Declared before me, W. Elmslie, J.P. I 17th October, 1683. To H. J. Speer, M.D. i Dear Sir, — T most tender you my very sincere , thanks for the wonderfully successful cure which , you have just effected in my case. For many year? I was afflicted with attacks of great weakness and ; prostration, which were accoznp&hied; by Epileptic i Fits of a very serious nature, and pains across the loins. I was quite disheartened by the successive t failures of doctors and patent medicines to relieve ine, when I was advised by a friend to consult you. At my first interview you , threw an entire new light upon tbe cause and ' nature of my trouble, and £ was so satisfied that you thoroughly understood my complaint that I placed i myself unreservedly in your bands and the result is r that in two and a half months you have effected a i complete cure, which seven yean of previous doc- , tors and physic had failed to bring about. I there- l fore strongly recommend any persons afflicted with f Nervous Diseases of any kind or diameter to lost ) no time in consulting you. Yours faithfullv, I II. G.
