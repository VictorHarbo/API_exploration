measures for rescuing the University from its present empire issues underlying out the principal recommendations of the Royal commission Industrial legislation figured prominently in the discussions of the Federated Master Builders of Australia, who held their eighth annual convention at Brisbane last week. The rapid growth of state intervention in trade and industry is compelling employers throughout the Commonwealth to pay as much attention to politics as to the conduct of their businesses. Trade societies, which used to be concerned mainly with purely trade questions, now devote." most of their time to criticism of the various state and federal bills which are introduced for the avowed purpose of regulating the relations of masters and men. At Brisbane the master builders from different parts of Australia were able to compare notes and form opinions based on a broad survey of the conditions to be found in the whole continent. One of the most interesting features of the debates was the comparison drawn between Queensland, where state interference is at a minimum, and New South Wales, where it is at a maximum. The president, of the association, Mr. A. Midson, is a Queenslander, and in his opening address he bore testimony to the good feeling which obtained between employers and employes in the building trade of his state. There was, he declared, an almost complete immunity from disputes, contracts were carried out without serious friction, and since 1888 there had been no strike or lockout. Queensland has neither Wages Boards nor Arbitration Court. The delegates from New South Wales had quite a different tale to tell. Whatever merits it may possess, the Court of Arbitration does not seem to have produced harmony. In a little over two years it has had to decide twenty-five disputes, while 85 cases are down for hearing, and no less than 100 others have been filed. According to Mr. Sims, a New South Wales delegate to the convention, the act, Instead of having a soothing effect, has been the means of bringing the employés " to the throat of the employer in " almost every industry through Now South Wales." He asserted that even when masters and men were working amicably prior to the act union officers have deliberately incited the men to manufacture claims for the court. The tyranny of the unions appears to have been greatly encouraged by the Court's power to award preference of employment to unionists. If two men apply for a job, one being a member of a registered union and the other not, the employer has to take on the unionist, unless he can prove no easy matter that he is unfit. Workmen who do not sympathise with the aggressive tactics of the union officers are forced to join the union or drift into the ranks of the unemployed. But they cannot always get admitted to union privileges when they apply, as was proved in Sydney a week or so ago, when it came out that the Coal Lumpers' Union had constituted itself a close guild, and refused membership to men whom it had boycotted for unloading broken metal from the steamer Kiama. Strikes were used in times past to keep the associations alive, and Arbitration Court cases are now used for a like purpose. Litigation is accompanied by less risk than a strike; it does not cost the union so much, and failure does not make the leaders so unpopular. Disputes mules will Arbitration Act multiply so rapidly that the Court cannot cope with its work. May not an occasional short, sharp struggle be less injurious to trade than an everlasting series of small disputes? The RAY S Other?
