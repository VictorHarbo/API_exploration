RICHARD CUMMINS, Machinist, 110 Collins street east. 39 52G0 /~~1 ROVER & BAKER SEWING MACHINE \JC COMPANY beg to call attention to their celebrated PREMIUM SEWING MACHINES. These machines are so perfect in construction, and combine so many new and useful improvements, that they have been very properly termed tho PER FECTION OF SEWING MACHINERY. WHY THEY ARE BEST. They are more simple, durable, less liable to get out of order, and easier managed than any ether machine. They sew from ordinary reels, and no re-winding of tho thread is necessary. They fnsten both ends of tho seam by their own operation, and will mako beautiful embroidery without any change of arrangement. Theso aro the only machines which both Sow and Embroider perfectly. Tho GROVER & BAKER MACHINES were awarded the Highest Premiums at Seventeen Fairs ast year, at nearly all of which the leading sowing machines were in competition. 24 SW ANSI' ON STREET. 47 90 alt an 28 SIN GEE'S LOCK STITCH SEWING- MACHINES. SINGER'S MACHINES will sew tho finest CAMBRIC or heaviest BROADCLOTH nnd all intermediate textures with the same ease, rapidity, durability of stitch, and beauty of finish. They wUl HEM, STITCH, FELL, and GATHER, and do a greatervnriety of work than tho machines of any other manufacture. Thoy aro strong, durable, and simplo in construction, and ennnot bo put out of order except by gross carelessness or violent misusago. Price, £12. Particular attention is culled to tho fact that, in consequonco of the superior construction of ma chinery, tho celebrated SHUTTLE STITCH of SINGER & CO.'S is vastly superior to the Shuttle Stitch of any other manufacture. But ospecial at tention is called to tho moro important fact that SINGER'S MACHINES mako tho TRUE LOCK STITCH, which is exactly aliko on both sides of the fubric, aud one that positively will not ravel ; that they do not mako a ridge on ono side of the material sewed, as do all CHAIN STITCH MACHINES ; that they do not uso one-third as much cotton or sewing material as do all CHAIN STITCH MACHINES ; that they will not ravel when one end of a seam is started, as will all Chain Stitch seams. And further that Singer's Machines do not uso a curved needle and circular niotioD. On tho contrary SINGER'S NEEDLES aro straight and tho motion perpendicular, hence they will stitch through a very great thickness, and sew across seams, which would prove instant destruction to a curved or bent needle. For a confirmation of^ our assertions wo would respectfully refer to tho manufacturing establish ments of Messrs Sargood, King & Surgood, Messrs Harris Si Heymansen, Messrs Solcsberg & Son, Monster Clothing Company ; Mr Skinner's Crino line Manufactory, and to all other large manufac turing houses both in Victoria and tho other Aus tralian colonies, and to tho thousands of families who havo Singer's Machines in daily use.
