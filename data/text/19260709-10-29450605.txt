On i 8 -J**8T»» the financial proposals of the Government aro placed before mem- bers within the first eight days of the financial year. It has been my aim al- ways to present the Budget, as early a3 possible, and thus give the Parliament full opportunity to exercise its control of tile finances. Further, the stabilifia tion of finance generally is assisted. Thu commercial, trading, and industrial com- munity is then able at the earliest mo- ment to make its arrangements conform with the demands which will be made l>v taxation. The operations of thc States and of large numbers of private persons are also influenced by thc scheme of (Commonwealth .expenditure. .Uitilierto it has been regarded as impossible to deliver the Budget speech uutil about ihe end of July, as only then were figures available showing, in detail, thc previous year's expenditure.. I found, however, that the Treasury always knew umler many hoads, about tho first day of July, what thc revenue and emenditure und been during the prenons financial year. The information obtainable nt that carly date seemed to me quite sufficient in de- tail for the purposes of a Budget. This early presentation will be of great value to members this year in discussing tho important legislation dealing with the adjustment ol the linanciijl relationships between tho Commonwealth and th-. States which is before Parliament. I trust it will become the established Con; monwealth practice.. Tho decision to dispense with the less important details is supported by tho practice of the Chan- cellor of the Exchequer. The British House of Commons dea's with estimates which ¿how the estimated expenditure of thc current year, the estimated expen- diture of the previous year, and tho ac- tual expenditure of the year before that. Althour£_thc information now included in the estimates of tho revenue and ex- penditure under geueral heads is, in my opinion, sufficient to enable the House to deal with the Budget, 1 propose, as early as possible, to present to the House that detailed information which it baa been the practice to supply in the past. FORM OF PRESENTATION. Since assuming the office of Treasurer, my attcrition has been directed to pre- senting the aocomvU .to Parlament, in such a form as would enable tho exact jiosition of the ncvcral sections to be readily ascertained. Last year tho di- vision of the estimates into three parta showed at a glance the result arising from the ordinary aoanirtistrativo activities of the Government, tile sunplns or deficit on business undertakings,, and the cost to the Commonwealth of administering the territories under its control. A fur- ther division may now profitably bc made. The capitation payment» and other grants to the States are in no sense expendi turo of the Commouwealth. Hitherto these payimcnta Stave beer* shown under Part I. of tho estimates, which provide for departments andi services other than 1 business undertakings and territories. The result gave an crroneors inipi-earioit of tim volume of Commonwealth, expendi- ture. A further division of the esti- mates has therefore been introduced, and will bo shown as "Payments lo or for tho States." In this part will be shown payments to tho States, including pay- ments out of special laxes, spécial pay- ments to West -Australia, and Tasmania, relief to West Australia in respect of tic north-west, grants to States for main road1) conatruction, tho cost of collection of toco for States, and interest on. loans raisadi by ¿ho Commonwealth for. thc titatoa. This port will show also the roveruies specially raised for tho Slates, as well aa general Commonwealth revenue allocated to the States. The fmaricial operations conducted by tho Common- wealth on behalf of the Slates will thuo be distinctly shown in (Jlie Common- wealth Budget. THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1925-26 Departments and Services The Expenditure Tlie chief increases in the actnol ex- penditure 1925-26 over thc estimate are as follows: £ Interest and sinking fund on war loans, war péririons, and otie.r war services. 311,4071 Invalid ami oldi-ago pensiona . -172,382 Bounties andi other special ap .propróations. 105,348 Ordinary vote» of departments .. 130,752 Other increases and decrease* net increase. 61,307 Total increase.£1,174,254 The main increases in the expenditure on war servicia are in connection with . interest on war loans and war pensions. .The estimated interest was based on the aouunption that, on the conversion of the £67,000,000 wax loan in December Toot, ondy one4ia3f year's interest at tile in creaecd rate would Call duo for payment within the year. The conversion, loan, however, was floated with tho right of contributors of now nionoy to receive interest from the date of their subscrip- tions. War pensions exceeded the esti- mate by £143,C&4. The estimate for invalid and old-age pensions expenditure was calculated on tho basis that tho increased pension of 2s. fid. ncr week would come into operation in January. Increased payments operat- ed from September. The effect of thc wino export bounty, together with prefer- ence, cranted. by Great Britain, eaebial V Australian manufacturers to compete even I moro Buccossful than was anticipated with tho continental wines. The bounty actually paid, due to the increased ex- port, was £172,100 in excess of the esti- mate. An unanticipated amount of £26. 002 was paid to .tho Commonwealth Oil He- nneries 'Limited in accordance .with thc Oil Agreement Act. 1020. The balance of the increase under bounties and other special appropriations is made up of iron and steel products bounty. £31,005. and sundry other increases and decreases. Of the increase in Treasury expendi- ture. .£38; 183. is for minting silver coin to replace Bri.liah coin withdrawn from* cir- culation. Thç actual coinage receipts due to tho profit on this replacement were £207,036 in excess of the estimates; £25,400 was provided for science and in- dustry investigations, whereas when thc Budget vas framed it was contemplated that Ulis amount would 1» paid from a trust account. In tho discussion on the estimates, explanations of the remaining increases will be 'furnished, if desired by members. The increased interest on loans raised for .the States results from the esti- mated loan raisings being; exceeded. This money is recovered from the States. SURPLUS FOR THE YEAR. In addition to the expenditure set out above the following moneys not provided for in thc Budget of 1025-26 were paid to trust fund in anticipation of a surplus in the accounts of the year:- £ "~ Naval construction. 1,000,006 Special provision for air service« 250,00t Science and industry investiga- tions and endowment for scientific research.".. 250,0001 Special payment for debt re- I demption. 1,000,0001 £2,500,000 There remained at the close of the year a surplus of £286,944, which it is propos-j ed to set aside, for:- £ Prospecting for oil and precious metals... -.. .." ,. .. 100,000 Invalid and old-age pensions and j national insurance"'. 186,9441 REVENUE. The chief increases in thc revenue were:- £ Customs and excise. 1,998,853 Direct taxation. 1,004.124 Coinage. 207,030 Net profit-'Australian note is BUo.' .. .. 90,062 Other heads of revenue. 61,896 £3,422.001 In estimating receipts from Customs and excise, the contemplated reduction in duties was taken into consideration. Re- duction in duties do not operate until the amended tariff is passed by Parliament. As the tariff was not passed before June 30, the reduction in duties did not become operative last year. Tho increase in direct taxation arises almost wholly from income tax. The normal rate of growth of the taxable in- comes-6 per cent.-wau considerably ex- ceeded, and the position in regard to | arrears has improved. BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS. Tile receipt« and expenditure of busi- ness undertakings do not show any con- siderable variation from the estimate. The actual expenditure of the Post Office was £10,651,880, being £38,445 in excess of the estimate, whilst the revenue was £105,251 in excess of thc estimate, the actual,re- ceipts being £10,815,251. Thc cost of working the Commonwealth railways was £897,122, or £3$S5 below tile estimate, and thc actual revenue was £20,345 less than the amount estimated. TERRITORIES OF THE COMMON- WEALTH. The actual expenditure on the territories of the Commonwealth was £40,547 lesa than the estimate. An amount of £50,000 was provided for the transfer of staffa and office equipment to the 1'edcral Capital; the general transfer was not commenced as was anticipated. THE NEW YEAR Increase on Loan Expenditure | The Budget for 1826-27 ia flamed ^ accordance with the Government's pro- posals for tie readjustment of the finances as between Commonwealth and States More particular reference to these pro- posals will be made at a later'Btage. When considering the expenditure to bc provided for it is necessary to divide tbe amount into capita! expenditure which is change- able against loan, and annually recurring expenditure which is correctly payable ont of revenue. Th* estimated expenditure for works out of loan in 3925-26 was £10.279,014; the amount spent was £7,fiS2.O30. Tho items of expenditure in 1926-27 aro: £ Land and buildings for tho Postmaster-General's Depart- ment and construction and ex- tension of telegraphs and télé- phones . .. 5,000^00 Commonwealth railways .. . 1,474,500 Graf ton-Sooth Brisbane railway 1,000,000 Naval Bases, floating dock, aviation buildings, munitions supply buildings and other de- fence works... 587,500 Advances for purrhaw of wiro and wlrc-notttrrg. 500,000 Immigration-Advances of pass ano money. 348,380 Rivor Murray Waters Act .. .. 252,500 Subscription to capital of Ama!- "rA<M>< namatod Wireless Ltd. 250,00« Sundry works of varions depart- ments .;:.-.V. .

Provision is also made for £3,400,000 for loans for tho States' for immigration and £2,000,000 for loans for the Federal Capi- tal CommiEeion. SOLDIER LAND SETTLEMENT. In the Budget Speech of last year I made a general statement indicating the part tho Commonwealth had taken in thc matter of soldier land settlement. Tho Commonwealth had undertaken to lend tho required moneys to thc States, at rate» of interest corresponding to the cost tn the Commonwealth. For the first five y cora of each loan to a State, tho Commonwealth granted a rebate ot interest at the rate of 2Vi per cent, per annum. The interest concession made on tho Commonwealth, loans, and on cer- tain moneys raised by the States them- selves, amonnted to £4,740,000. In addi- tion, tho Commonwealth paid sustenance allowances, amounting to over £500,000, pemding'productivity of farms. In view of the fact that the losses by the States would bo greater than was at first an- ticipated, thc Government dcicidedi to write oil from the loans to the States the sum of £5,000,000, to enable thc States to deal fairly with, the settlers. The total contribution by tile Common wealth towards losses amounted to more than £10,000,000. In addition, it was decided1 to reduce the rate of imtcrcst payable by tho States to 5 per cent after December 31. 1530. Format agree- ments have now been signed by thc Treasurer of 'the Commonwealth and. the Treasurers of the several States covering the whole of the arrangements between the Governments in regard to soldier land BcUtlement. The arjreements ore subject to ratification, by the soveral Parliaments, and will shortly be submitted to Parlia- ment. NEW SEAT Or GOVERNMENT. In accordance with the. decision that Parliament sliatl open at Canberra in May, 1Ö27, the Commission has adjusted its activities with the object of conrokt ing the neccGiiary buildings by that, ¿ate. Provision is made iu the loan estimates for raising a loan of £2,000,000 on. behaS of the Commission. Varions public build- ings are nearly completed; the Govern- ment Printing Office bas been erected and its machinery is now being installed. 'Die construction of 500 houses in addition to those already in existence is being ar- ranged for. Four hostels are provided for j "in the building scheme and contracts have been let for four large guest-houses. Roads. I water supply, sewerage, tree planting, and I other services are procccdbig. ! MURRAY RIVER AGREEMENT. I Thc amount of £252,500 has been plared on the estimates as the Commonwealth j Government's contribution.for works dur- ing thc year. Each of the three con- tracting State Governments is to provide a similar amount. Three completed weirs and locks aro in operation. It is expeet 1 ed that during the year three further weirs and locks will be completed. The total expenditure to date amounts to £4,230,000. I WIRE NETTING. ?With a view to increasing thc carrying I capacity of our pastoral areas and assist- ing thc State Governments to extend then schemes for providing settlers with mater- ial for vermin-proof fences, thc Common- wealth Government last year undertook to lend £3,000,000, at the rate of, £500,000 a year for six years, at concession rates of interest. Thc proposals of the Com- monwealth having recently been agreed to by several States, the Government will shortly bring down a bill to give effect to its promise. MIGRATION AGREEMENT. Though the rate of natural increase in Australia compares more than favourably with that of other countries, the Govern- ment desirca to supplement it by the grad- ual absorption of desirable settlers from overseas, more particularly from Great Britain. A combined effort by Great Brit- ain and Australia is being made through thc migration agreement to achieve this result. With the exception of New South Wales, all the States have accepted the terms of the agreement which contem- plates an expenditure of £34,000,000 and the absorption of 450,000 migrants in ten years. To examine and report írpon the schemes submitted, to frame and sub- mit proposals for other undertakings, to consider the best means of developing our resources, to investigate the condition of existing industries, and the possibilities of establishing new ones, the Government proposes to appoint an expert commission. THE NATIONAL DEBT Reduction of War Debt The outstanding feature of the national debt operations in recent years is thc systematic reduction of the war debt. Though new borrowing is increasing the amount of the gross debt, the Common- wealth has, since the war, practically lim- ited its loan expenditure to developmental and reproductive works which provide re- venue-producing assets to off-set the new debt created. Australia bas £28,500,000 less war debt to-day than four years ago. In the same period the net debt fell by £160,000, despite the fact that the post office created over £16,000,000 of new assets during that time and many other necessary public works were provided. Tho croso debt at Jone 30, 1926, was: £ War debt. 304.546,643 Debt incurred for the States.. 83.40S.850 Other debt,. 70,438,135 Total grose debt ? at Juno To ascertain .fie net debt Ibero may be deducted Loins to the States for development- ? .

Gd. per head leas than in 1922. These state-: monta show clearly thc improvement in the position of thc Commonwealth. THE GROSS DEBT. j Of thc gross debt at June 30, 1920, £287.148,052 is redeemable in Australia, £»1,805,682 is due to the Government of tho United Kingdom. £09,017,61« is re- deemable in London, and £15,411,487 in New York. Thc gross debt at thc begin- ning of the financial year was £430,948,002. tho increase during the year being £27, 495,575. Of this amount, £14,543,564 was raised by the Commonwealth for the States. The gross debt also includes the recent London loan of £6,000,000, practi- cally all of which will be available for works 'to bc carried out in the financial year now commencing. SINKING FUND AND DEBT REDEMPTION. Substantial contributions were again made last year for the redemption of the ublie debt of the Commonwealth. Tho contributions from revenue were: For payment to the sinking fund, including special contri- bution of £1,000",000 . 2,790,722 For pavment to thc British Gov- ernment. 1,231,723 Total from revenue .. .. £4,028,445 Repayment of moneys lent by the Com- monwealth .£777,706 Half of Commonwealth Bank profita. 22(5,170 Reparation moneys re- ' ceived under the treaty of peace with Germany. 302,921 Interest on investments 83,050 Contributions by States in respect of loans raised on their be- half by Common- .' wealth .. .. .. .. 76,711 \- 1,467,464 Total made available during 1925-26 for the redemp- tion of debt.j.. £5,405,909 Since thc establishment of the national debt sinking fund, lesa than three years ago. a total of £20,067,040 has been ap- plied to the redemption of. debt. Before a systematic effort was made to pay off our debt it was sometimes said that the provision of a sinking fund was incon- sistent with regular new borrowing. Tho reasoning seems to have been that any moneys which could ba raised for Paying off thc public debt would better be ap- plied to the, construction of new works. Thus the new borrowing .would be so much less than that which would bc ne- cessary if the moneys available were de- voted to a (sinking fund. What really happened was that, our public debt went I on increasing year after year, and efforts towards its repayment were indefinitely | postponed. Under thc arrangements wc have now made the Treasurer is compelled to find revenue for payment into the Sinking Fund at such a rate as will repay all the debt existing, at the formation of the fund in not more than 50 vears from that time; also he musl iprovide revenue moneys to Tepay all new borrowings with-1 in not more than 50 years after thc year | in which the new borrowing occurs. The use o£ sinking fund moneys in re-1 purchasing cur securities on the market has a bcnefici.il effect in maintaining their | price. In this way our credit is improv- ed, and future loans will be floated at a I rate of interest lower than that which would in other circumstances be obtain-1 able. STATE DEBTS Hov/ the States Stand The latest particulars available of the I public, debt of the titates arc thoso for | June 30, 1925, when thc debts were: £ New-South Wales. D1.ÎJ31.110 Victoria. 128,445,565 Queensland. 9G.3R9.0G71 Routh Australia. 74,780,835 West Australia. 64,403.2011 Tasmania. 23,894,< Total.£603.334,254 These omouuts represent the gross debts, without any deduction for thc (substantial revenue-producing assets constructed by the States with the loan moneys raised. In Australia, most public utilities are pro- vided by tbe State Governments, whereas, in other countries, these services arc, in a much larger measure, provided by Tiri- te enterprise. For this reason the public debts of the Australian States are of a nature quite different from those of most other countries. In 1924-25 the State undertakings in Australia produced a net revenue of £19,460,080, which represents the earnings available for the payment | of interest on the debt. Thc SUte sinking funds'total £18,630,951. Ou all loans now xaificd by the Common- wealth for the States an annual sinking j fund payment of 10s. per cent, is made by I the States to the national debt sinking | fund of the Commonwealth. AGGREGATE OF DEBTS. Omitting debts which are included both In the Com- monwealth and in tho State debts, tho gross debt of the Commonwealth at June 30, 1926, and the States at June 30\. 1925, was.£990,642,419 | From this there may be de- ducted sums held in cash by tho Commonwealth, sinking funds, and moneys to be re- paid In cash In respect of cer- tain assets.

AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCIL Activities Daring Year The loan operations of the Common- wealth and of the States other than New South Wales were undertaken during tbe past year in accordance with plan« made by thc Loan Council, which waa formed in order that thc loan business of tbe va rion« Governments might be carried on with- out clash or competition. Experience hu I shown that the Treasurers, acting in con- I cert, can secure better term» than if they j acted independently. No decision of tie | Loan Council binda any Treasurer until hi« Goxemment has consented. Thcyrw^l ; policy of tho Loan Council is-(1) Erny maturing loan shall bc converted in the place where tho origina] loau is domiciled; (2) for new money the States shall rely on both the Australian and overseas mar- kets, thc . amount to bo raised overseas being determined by the Loan Council after consideration of the amount of money which will probably be available in Australia; (3) while tho States remain free to accept money "over the counter," they shall not raise in Australia any money by the issue of an advertised prospectus; (4) money required for the States in Australia, except money taken "over the counter," is to bc raised by the Commonwealth on behalf of thc States, in accordance with a pros- pectus and publicity campaign; (5) the Commonwealth shall not raise new money for its own purposes in Aus- tralia, but shall satisfy its requirements by oversea borrowing; (0) each State I shall manage its own flotations in Lon- don, whother for now money or for con- versions, in consultation with the Loan Council; (7) amy oversea loans required in America, either by tho Commonwealth or by any State, »ball bo raised by and in the name of thc Commonwealth. The Cbmmorrwcalth floarted four loans last year. The first of the series was the aanuftaneous borrowing of £15,000,000 in New York and £5,000,000 in London, and waa dealt with, in my last budget speech. The second was ¿he conversion of thc £67,000,000 of wax loans which ma- tured on Doc umber 15, 1325, and proved an unqualified etrcecsa, though it waa the greatest financial operation ever attempt- ed in Australia. In some quarters there were doubts regarding the result. It was pointed out that, during the previous vear, the Commonwealth had to pay as much as £6 7s. per cenït. for loare?, and some thought that the rate of 514 per cent, offered was too low. The Treasury never wavered in rta expectation ot suc- cess, however, and the result showed that it bad accuratelv gauged the proper rate of interest. Following thc conversion, a new Commonwealth loan on behalf of the States was announced. Tho rate of intercut offered was 5Y* per cont., or % per cent, below tho rate of the conver- sion loan. This operation oleo wara suc- cessful, the loan being over-subscribed. The rate of 514 per cent, is well establish- ed, safes of Commonwealth slocks now taking place freely in. tho open market on a basis yielding about 5'A per cent. Winb- in the ¿st few weeta the Commonwealth I hos by private negotiation raised a local loan of £1,600,000 on behalf of the States at this rate. During last month the Com- monwealth floated a loon in London of £6,000,000, the interest being 5 per cent, and tile price of issue £00 10<. This price was £1 better than that which was secur- ed by New Zealand and Victoria on loans issued within the nrevious few weeks, and £1 10s. better tihnn that at which New South Wales raised a London loan of £4,000,000 in March ot" this year. COMMONWEALTH BANK Making Progress The Commonwealth Bank, which was founded in 1912 and given central banking functions and a board of directors in 1924, ia intimately associated with thc loan operations of the Commonwealth Government. During the first two and a half years of the bank's working it cann- ed no profit. The tranmctions under- taken by tho bank for t!he Government during Oho war and. tho immediate post- war periods enabled great profits to be made, which amounted in one year to ns much as £847,000. Since that time. Trea- sury balances have come back to normal, with a consequent decline in the earnings of the bank. Tho profits of tho last threo years wore: 1923 . £328,000 1924 . 261,000 1925 . 452,000 This shows that the bank is making progress under normal conditions and under the now management. Tho Savings Bank branch of the Com- monwealth Bank shows remarkable ex- pansion. In 1911, the deposits amount- ed to £7400,000; in June. 1920, they were £1S,000,000; and in the next six months they increased to £33 300,000, chiefly a« a result of the laking over of the State Savings Bank in Queens- land. On December 31- last the de- posits amounted to nearly £44,000,000. These details show satisfactory progress aud are a cheering indication of success- ful management. The real value of tho bank to the community, however, is to be tested by the way in which it handles its central banking functions. Nd ex- amination of ita figures alone will indi- cate tho efficiency or the importance of tbe management of the central bank. The success of its efforts in exercising a general control over finance is to bc gauged by thc absence of crises rather than in its handling of any crisis which may arise. As a central institution lt must take 6teps to maintain the cur- rency on such a basis that public and private finance can bc carried on without nnduc disturbance. Stability of finance is of the highest importance in securing thc welfare of the individual and assist- ing general development. Nothing could be more injurious to employment and to economic progress than violent alterna- tions of monetary stringency and case. Australia is enjoying a period oí go.xi finance to wbich the management of the Commonwea'rth Bank baa largely contri- buted. THE 1924 MONETARY CRISIS. In 1021 Australia passed through a very serious monetary crisis. Thc cen- tral bank under a board of director.-; had just, been established and was faced with a seriously threatened hold-up of the sales of wool and other "rimary pro- duce. It was estimated that, during the following months, Australian pro- ducts to thc value of £110,000,000 would be available for Hiles overseas. Already primary producers were being compelió.! to acce"t. £95 in Australia in respect nf every £100 secured oversea by the sale of their goods, and in some cases ex- porters were buying exchange forward, receiving only £93 5s. for each £100 ju London. In addition Uley lost internst amounting to a considerable sum because they received thc money in Australia two or three months before they could use it. The fifiiculties di crehan;?.? had become flj acute that a temporary stoiwaco IT hiller seemed imminent. If this had 'eeeurrSoVnot only would prices have slumped, but producers would have been compelled, even on their lower re- turns, to submit to an exchange chargL of about 10 per cent. This serious posi- tion was averted by thc decision of the new directors to lend notes to the other banks up to £ 15,000,000 to enable them to finance exports. This action imme- diately enabled sales oí produce to be continued. The saving to the commun- ity arising out of the wise handling of the situation by the Commonwealth Bank can scarcely bc indicated in figures. There is r.o doubt that it amounted to many millions of pound". The action of the bank in tbe crisis of 1924 hos flometimes been criticised by those who have not realised thc gravity or the com- plexity of the situation. They apn.'.ir to think that the Commonwealth Ba.ik it«clf could have dealt dirrctlv with the ^reducer* instead of prr.!ri!"ring afsin tanr<. to the other banks. Such a coarse was impracticable. To give one rearon only, it may bc pointed nut that, to pre- vent inflation which jnicht have b-cn permanent, "with thc consequent. Iron- ing of the purchasing power of money, it wa« necessary that the advances i.c repaid within a definite fhort period.

This logic control may be given either by way.of debenture or by placing the pro duce in a store or ou a ship, and by handing tho covering doenmenis to the bank. In every ease there must, of course, be a sufficient margin, between the valuej of tho prodiucc and thc advance. No gooci purpose would) bo served in . talc- ing uncommercial risks. lt is in the interests of the primary producers them- selves' that the rural . credDts business «Irait be conducted on o. soundl basis. JHE GOLD STANDARD. Duning tho period of the war, Austra- lian paper money was not convertible into gold. ? Thus, tho automatic control of the'amount of thc paper circulation was removed. Under war conditions an over-issue cccurTcd. Tlic vabic of the paper poural felï until it was, at its low- est, worth in gold only about two-thirds of ita face mme. Owinrr to many" influ- ences our pound! was ultimately restored to gold value The restoration was thc result, in a hirco measure, of the refusal of the Notes Board1 to issue additional notes. It has been said that thc board's noiiey of deflation waa carried rather far. The fact remains fhat thc policy ivas well based.' Thc value of the paper pound, in thc carly part of VXS, reached a value of slightly moro than, a sovereign. In these circumsbanjees, the banks began to import gold. The Commonwealth. Bai'k j Board bad for some time favoured i re I tum to the gold standard, and .ifter dis ! cussion with the Imperial autli-iri'.i.» Ihr j Government felt justified in rcmr.ii-.;; th-. J embargo upon the ecsport of gold in April : 1025. Simultaneously tlie Counnoti wealth Bank began to provide gold' ir j rcdeniiPtiotL "of notes in cases where th« I gold was required for export. Gold ii not in dorriûstic circulation, but in thif respect Australia, is in exactly the same position as ; the Mother Country- Nc I detriment is being suffered by any inter ! crt owing to the lack of gold for internai i use. I After more than a year's experience it can be said that thc return to the ROI ! standard was' effeutod in Australia wit'i out financial. disturbance, and the free exipont of gold Iras been maintained with' out auy dutfield ty. Kxactly the same fa cilities and advantages aa those whitt ! were in existence baforo the war are non being enjoved. Our currency being thu I maintained on a gold basis, exporters ?r< I bringing the proceeds of their sales bact I to Australia practically at par, thor.; lie inç a charge for exchange of only a few I shillings in each £100. Importers havi no difficulty in mcoting their require [ ments. The consiznùnç puiblic benefit) by thc fact that prices aro not disturben by vagaries of exchange. An impartan; result of tho return to gold! standard :'; that money borrowed abroad may ri brought to Australia without excessivi cost for exchange. This condition cn ablcs the Governments to keop their loco borrowing within tho limits of tile amoun which, can lie miffed locally without in terfering with the. legitimate demands o industry. By tliis limitation of amount interest rales uro kapt in chock and ar maintained at a. rough approximation will the raten paid for oversea money. THE HOUSING SCHEME. The question of the housing of the pee pie affects thc comfort and well-being o thc individual, and the efficiency of th individual is necessary to thc national wc fare and progress. In accordance wit the policy aunouneed prior to the las election, the Government in consultatio: with the Board of the Commonwealf Bank is preparing the details of a schem to bc submitted to Parliament to enabl the Commonwealth Savings Bank to a; sist in the provision of homes for th people, both by new construction and b purchase. For this purpose funds up t £20,000,000 in all will be provided. Th intention is that advances shall be mad by the Commonwealth Savings Bank u to amounts which, consistent with safetj shall bo a high percentage of tho toti cost, lt is desired also to keep interés rates down to a minimnm. The Commor wealth has already provided 28,813 wa service homes, and this has assisted t meet the acute shortage of houses. 1 might here be mentioned that since th \Vnr Service Homes Department was ri organised in 1922 no losses have occurrec There ia immense work yet to be don to meet tho demand for good housing nn the desire for individual ownership. Th Government's intention is to assist an Kupplement the existing activities, bot State and private. Since the C'ommoi wealth Government's housing scheme wu announced notable changes, have occurre in tho liberality with which the cxistin institutions are viewing the demands < home- seekers.

Tlic inrreasev of Commonwealth expenditure are almost wholly a result of a. po H cy .liirh rnecL-i the legitimate demands' of the p«op!e--as in fhn ease ot nldvign pen ions a-nd defence. Thg tontontlon that tho Common woalth Government can substantially re- duce tlie cost of administration of the several departments may bo considered In tho light of tho details now appearing In tho Budget. The expenditure under the ordinary votes of tho departments during thc fast six years is as follows: £ 1921- 22 .. . 2,952,475 1922- 23 . 2,772,920 1923- 24 . 2,668,710 1924- 25 . 2,753,443 1925- 26 . 2.874,463 1926- 27 (estimate) .. .. 2,794,141 In this period the annual expenditure has been reduced by £158,334, notwith- standing fiat in thc meantime the popu- lation has increased by approximately 000,000, fjid despite the fact that arbi- tration awards have conriistently increas- ed salaries and otlxr cost« in all tha de .paxiincnJts, In 1921-22, thc. coat, «f jjast Commonweal tb departments per head nf population was 10s. 9d.; in 1920-27 it will l>e 9a. 2d. If the expenditure in 1926-27 were made at the per capita rate of 1021 22 the expenditure would bq £3,290,951, or an increase of £496,S10 over that con- templated. This comparison indicates cleanly that the strictest Etipervision is being main- tained over expenditure, while at the same time tho Goveriament is seeking policies, such as the amalgamation of thc Commonwealth anil State Income Tax Departments, which will reduce duplica- tion and permit of substantial savinga. The proposed adjustment of Common- wealth and State finance will probably result in administrative savings to the people of Australia of nearly £100,000 per annum unnecessarily spent under thc present duplication. DEPARTMENT OF REPATRIATION. Thc cost of war pensions is still in- creasing owing to tlie birth of c.liildrcn to pensioners and to liberalising the condi- tions under which pensions are granted. Nb immediate reduction in the numbera applying for medical attention is antici- pated. Certain factors euch as increased age, progress of disease, and complica- tions pf ivar disabilities with the ordinary diseases of civil life arc likely to caitie the numbers to be maintained through- out the ensuing financial year. DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIA Building of Armaments The five-year programme announced in tho Bulge.t of 102-1 to improve the army, the navy, aral the air ten-ices, and to cn'.arge the organisation- of a munitions supply, is being actively pursued. The building of two 10,000-ton cruisers, two submarines, and a pcaplamaoarricr is proceeding The Government has agreed to make a payment to the Now South Wales Government of £135,000 as a sub- sidy towards tho cost of a floating dock at NewoasUc, on the understanding that tho dock will bc capable of accommodat- ing the now cruisers. During the past financial year a satisfactory advance was made with the developmental services, including the enlistment of personnel for the cruisers and submarines, the exten- sion of oil fuel facilities, training of Royal Australian Naval Reserves, purchase of mimctdons, artillery equipment, etc. There bas been substantial progress in the building of munition factories, and in air force buildings. o_t l'oint Cook, Laverton and Richmond. Additional personnel will bo enlisted during 1926-27 to provide for the manning of the submarines, the cruisers and the soapiane-carrier, and for the establishment of a now air craft squadron. The trainiitg of^an-.additional "quota of Koyal Australian Naval Reserves and Citizen Air Force, training will con- tinue. Provision is being rando for Wie building andi filling of an- oil tarde. INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS National Insurance Scheme The. hope that the researches of thc Royal Commission on National Insur- ance would, be sufficiently advanced to enable thc Government to bring down, during last financial year, a national in- surance acharne in connection with old agc and sickness, importunately, has not been realised. Accordingly, in Septem- ber thc Government obtained legia'aUvt authority for an increase in the rate of pensions from 17s. Od. to 20s. a_ week, in anticipation of the adoption- of national insurance. In addition, tho statutory limât of income plus pension was increas- ed from 30s. to 32s. Cd. a week. Tnto in- crease was additional' to the previous in- crease of 5s. a fortnight made under thc present Government in September, 1923. Tho large number of new claims which have boen received shows that the in- crease of pensions to £1 per week has been greatly appreciated by the oJd and infirm. In the nine months from Oc- tober, 1925, when (bo increase to £1 r. week* bogan to operate, moro than 21.000 new pensions have been granted. This i sightly exceeds the total number of granta for the whole of tho preceding .tifel-re months. The number of pensions ut present in force is approximately 176,000, an increase of more than 13,000 during tho year after allowing for deaths. The omoiuit paid in pensions during 1925 20 was £8,252,3S2. It Ls estimated! that an amount of £9,000,000 will be required for pension purposes during 1926-27. These figures afford a convincing proof that tho Commonwealth, realises ito obli- gations to the aged and invalid .roeirjbers of the community. The Govenimcoit is still of opinion that thc present method of providing..relief does not fulfil all rc quinoments. It is looking forward to the time when, as a result of the inquiries af the National Insurance. Comirróasiún. it will bo in n position to present to Parliament a national Dchcme for old age, sickness, and unemployment. PUBLIC HEALTH Conference This Month Thc recommendations of thc Royal Com- mission on Health, which reported during last financial year, have been taken earn- estly into consideration by the- Govern- ment. It will not be practicable immed- iately to bring into operation thc exten- dive programme included in the recom- mendations, but the Government has made provision to give effect to these recom- mendations so far as is possible. A con- ference between the Commonwealth and State Ministers nf Health in being held during thc present month to agree on thc best methods to this end. SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH Avenues of Inquiries Thc Institute of Science and Industry has been reorganised under the name of I the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. A sum of £250.000 has been paid to its credit ¡TI a trust account to enable it to function effectively. As a first stop investigations will bc be- gun into the following main groups of problems:- . Animal pests and diseases. Plant pests and diseases. Food problems, especially cold storage. Fuel problems, especially liquid fuels. Forest products. A sum of £100,000 has been set aside as an endowment, the income from which is to bc used to provide assistance-(a) to persons engaged in scientific research; and (1)1 in the training of students in scien- tific research. Tho work of the council will bc carried on in close co-operation with thc scientific and tcchnicul department« of the State Governments, thc universities, and other scientific bodies throughout the Common- wealth. Existing institutions will be used to the fullest extent practicable. The council will co-operate with thc British Department of .Scientific and Industrial Research. OTHER ACTIVITIES Engineering; Standards During the year M25-2G important pro grpt-s was made in the work of thc Aus- tralian Commonwealth Engineering Stand- ards Association. Thc association had published 2S standard specifications, 28 upecifications have been approved for issue and 72 are in course of preparation. There are in operation 13 sectional committees^ with 54 sub-committees and 20 panels. An international standards conference was he'd in New York in April, 1928, when' definite proposals were made for tile crea- j rion of an international standards com- mittee. The Australian Commonwealth i Engineering Standards Association has ten- tatively decided in favour of affiliation, j The organisation of the power survey com- . mittce and panels has bern completed. !

For some years -the ConimonwcaUh Gov- ernment Las joined with, th« cotton-çrow ing States in guaranteeing prices for seed cotton. Tin's method of assisting tha growing of Australian cotton, however, has not been wholly satisfactory, and the Commonwealth Government, after full consideration, has come to tho conclusion that this industry can best be assisted by means of a bounty. Thc Government be- lieves it to ba. a sound economic policy not only to encourage tho growing of cot- ton, but also thc spinning of cotton yarn and manufacture of cotton goods in Aus- tralia. There does not appear to bc any reason why eventually the'whole of the ¡Australian crop ehould not bo manufac- tured into cotton goodti iu Australia. The Government, accordingly, proposes to ask Parliament to grant, as a first step to- ward- this objective, a bounty on seed cotton and on the tpinning of cotton jams. Thc, bounties arc estimated to total £150,000. ? WOOL. After the suspension of wool sales in - Mareil. 1925, selling waa resumed in July, and continued without interruption there- after. The whole of the 1926-1926 clip has now been disposed of, and thc "carry ? over" from thc previous season of about 500,000 bales baa been sold. Competition, . chiefly from French buyer«, raised prices . slightly till November, when the demand from that quarter fell off to some ex- tent, with the result that a slight fall marked later sale«. The market seems to have steadied at prices that may b» considered fairly remunerative to growers, and, aa far as they can be estimated, the Prospects for tho new season, which wiH open in August next, «rc encouraging. The recent general strike in Fingland had tlic effect of -teducing the consumption of woo!, and the continuance of the coal strike must retard thc operations of manufacturera resuming normal propor- tions. The financial disorders on tile con- tinent of Kurope may also have an. adverse , effect on the market. Stocks are believed to be light in all consuming centres, BO that it is not an unreasonable expectation that a ready outlet will bo found for. thc 1 growing clip at fair prices. WHEAT PRICES. \ Owing to a rattier dry winter and spring the wheat harvest wa« not up lo cxpecta. tions. Prices, however, were satisfactory. It is forecasted that the area under wbcat; in the present .season will constitute a record, and, as early rains have enabled seeding operations to bc conducted under tho best conditions, thqre is every possibil- ity that a big harvest will result. I am advised that e»od prices are likely to-bo realised for thc new wheat. DAIRY PRODUCE. During tue year the Export. Control. Board has saved tho industry nearly £20,000 per annum, by obtaining a reduc- tion in marine insurance, has regulated tho export of butter to Great Britain, and. in co-operation with, its London agency, has been "able to prevent violent fluctua- tion in prices. The improvement in qual- ity brought about by pasteurisation, the standardisation of thc product under the national "Kangaroo" brand, and orderly marketing, have resulted in bringing tho London prices of Australian butte? to tho New Zealand level and almost to tho Danish. Tho Paterson scheme ha« at tho same time assisted to maintain local líricos. Trade with thc East in butter, cheese, and other dairy produce bas ex- panded. The Government has approached the States with a view to the encourage- ment of fodder production and conserva- tion, to the better education of butter and cheese factory managers and employ- ees, and to tho establismmcnt of dairy colleges. EXPORT OF FRUIT. Tho 192G pack 0,1 canned fruits almost equalled, tho rocordi of kvst season. Tho eale of tile export surplus was assisted by a subsidy granted for apricots and clingstone poaches. Last year tho export of apples amounted to 3,100,000 casos, of which about two-thirds woro Tasmanian. Unfortunately, tho dislocation caused hy tho striko In Great Britain affect- ed pricos. I SUGAR AGREEMENT. On September 1, 1925, a three years* agreement between thc CVammiontwcaitli and Queensland Governments commenced to operate. Thc agreement scurcd for consumers additional concession» esti- mated at £282,000 per annum, incbvling £121,000 for reduced prices of sugar for. the processing ol fruit products. The iy¿52ü season- produced approximately 520,000 tons. Tile surplus of 213,004 ton« was exported. Some 198,313 tons sent to Great Britain enjoyed the Empire pre- ference duty of £4 5s. 7d. per ton, and. 14,781 tons sent to Canada secured there a preference of £4 12s. per ton. WINE BOUNTY. '1 The bounty paid' on thc oxroori of sweet wine, together with the preference grvciu in Great Britain, has enabled) Australian wine* to compete with the products of j Continental countries, 977,000 gallons of. Australian «weet wino having been cx-l parted to Great Britain. ' EGGS WORTH £10,000,000. Thc annual value ci! thc production nt' eggs is now approximately £10,000,000. An encouraging export trade has been doveloped, and r-esruiations will shortly be issued prescribing tho grades and standards for export. Tho expansion of this industry r-houtd provide opportuni-, ties for the settlement of large numbers,' of people. The Department of Markets I is assisting various oigamsations to im-> prove the system of oversea marketing. ] ADVERTISING IN GREAT BRITAIN.' In co-operation with tho Dairy Produce Control Board, thc Dried Emita Control Board, and the Australian Ruit Canners" Association, the. Government is subsidis- ing a «chôme of trade publieitrr in tho United Kingdom on a £1 for £1 liasis, the Commonwealth liability being limit- ed to £50,000. Another subsidised scheme of publicity has for some time been car-; riecl on in Groat Britain in relation to Australian apples. PREFERENCE GRANTED. During the year the concessions of duty resulting from the preference granted by Great Britain to Australian products have amounted to: £ Sugar.-S46.O0O Wine . ..-,-;. 19(1,000 Currants .._ ... 34,000 Sultanas .. _._ .. 90,000 1 Lcxias._V_ 22,000 1 Canned fruits .. -.. 4,000 j Total.£1,178,000' Thc reciprocal tariff treaty with Canada lias already been of advantage to produc-) ors of Australian butter and canned fruits. ¡ There are also prospects of a good market! for Australian dried fruits. ¡ BOUNTIES PAID. ;| Dining the year 1925-26 bounties total-i ling £403,582 wore paid on primary and secondary products. £242.005 was paid iva galvanised sheets, fencing wire, wire not- ting, and tractors. The bounties on winni totalled £217,109. No bounty was paid: to an exporter unless a guarantee was fur- nished to the effort that he. bought, or would buy. Iiis dorailillo grapes at not lesa (lian £5 per ton and )¡h spirit al. 5s. per proof gabon, the latter prue being fixed to enable the distiller lo pay £5 per lon for his dorailillo grapce. £38.549 was paid under the Sulphur Bounty Art, 102.'!. and £10,962 under the Canned Fruit Bounty Act, 1924. During the year tho payment« under the Krport Guarantee Art, which was passed to assist the over- sea marketing of primary produce, amount- ed to £53.000. This assistance included £24,540 to the hon industry' of Tasmania. £17,417 to doradillo grape growers. £8.927 to exporters of canned fruits, and £1.842 to growers of ohanez grapes, broom millet, and oranges. From January 1, 1927, under the Papua and New Guinea Bounties Act, encouragement will be given to territory growers of cocoa beans, fibres, sago, vanilla beans, bamboos and rattans, spices and kapok imported into the Commonwealth. Continued on Next Page Federal Treasurer's Speech Continued from Page 7 BUSINESS UNDER- TAKINGS Revenue and Expenditure Thc estimated revenue and expenditure of business undertakings for 1920-27 are as follows: POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPART- MENT. * £ Revenue. 11,441,000 Expenditure. 11,294,4.10 Surplus. £146,520 ! COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS. Revenuo. 499,003 Expenditure . 953,360 Deficit .. -.. 464,368 Not deficit. £317,848 It will be noticed that in providing these public utilities the Government is not using them as a means of raising! revenue. The post office can in no way be character- ised as a taxing machine, whilst the loss on Commonwealth railways is provided out of general taxation. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT Revenue-It is estimated that the re- venue from all sources for 1926-27 .will bc I £11,441,000. which is £625,749 greater than j that for 1925-20, and represents an crease of 6 per cent. £ Expenditure.- The estimated ex- penditure ot the Postmastcr General's Department for thc current year is . '.. 11,291,480 1 Thc actual expenditure in 1925 26 was .. . 10,654,880 Resulting in an. increase in Í926 27 of....... £039,600 I Owing to thc liberal programme of cap- ital construction, the charges for interest j and sinking fund have grown by £188,312, leaving an increase of £451,688 in thc or- dinary working and administrative costs of the department. Arbitration awards have greatly increased thc expenditure, and with an extension of postal, tele- phonic, and telegraphic facilities, further increases must bc looked for. These, how- | ever, arc offset by an increase in the earn- ings of the department. In the estimates I for 1920-27 it has been necessary to pro- vide £177,000 to cover increased salaries of postal employees payable under the pub lie service regulations and the Public Ser- vice Arbitrator's awards.' When the ad- ditional assets, now being provided by loan | expenditure, reach their full earning cap- acity, it is expected that the increase in I working costs will bc more than provided J from thc additional revenue earned. TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEVELOPMENT. During 1925-20 approximately 41,000 additional telephones were connected, of which 18,210 were in _the metropolitan areas. It is anticipated that, in 1928-27, 40,000 additional telephones will be in- stalled, of which 25,000 will bo in the country arcas. Thc number of tele- phones in uso throughout the Common- wealth now exceeds 400,000, nearly seven for each 100 of population. Australia now stands sevcittb on the list of coun- tries from thc standpoint of telephone development. The United' States is first, with 15 telephones per 100 of po- pulation; then follow Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden, and Nor*way. The policy of the Government is to pro- vide, in the intereste of national effi- ciency, thc funds necessary for the ex- pansion of tile telephone system. The Government's progressive policy has re- sulted during the/ past two and a half years in the addition of 100,000 tele- phones. The expenditure for 1925-20 approximated £5,050,000. For 192Ô27 u sum of £-1,500,000 is provided. In rrr cent years no increases have been madi in tho telegraph and telephone tariffs, but on tho contrary a number of con- cessions have been granted. The pro sent tariffs are- amongst thc lowest in the world, and, as a result of increased costs oí labour and material, many ser- vices are now being operated at a lc Thc anticipated reveuue for 1926-271 would be incTOased by £3,530,000 if the' American rates operated in Australia. WIRELESS. Owing to difficulties beyond the con trol of the Commonwealth Government, the ¡beam services to England and Can- ada have not yot commenced, but are I expected to function in January next. [ The broadcasting services have now be- come a recognised feature in tho life | of the community, and are contributing in no small degree to mitigate the sense | of isolation in sparsely-populated areas. The regulations are now being reviewed to determine whether any changes arc necessary in the interests of tile multi- tude of listeners, who now number over 118,000. Wireless stations at Wave Hill and Camooweal were opened during thc year and have already proved their utility. COMMONWEALTH RAIL- WAYS Trans-Australian Railway Tho extension of the uniform gauge I into Adelaide hos been recommended I by the Parliamentary Standing. Commit- tee on Public Works, and will consider- ably increase the traffic on the Trans Australian Railway, as the breaks of i gauge at Kalgoorlie, Port Augusta and Terowie have greatly hampered and re- j stricted business on the railway. NORTHERN TERRITORY RAILWAY. The working expenses of this railway, I including interest und sinking fund, are estimated at £192,800, being an increase | of £30,506 over the actual expenditure of thc previous year. The estimated receipts are £76,000 for the current year, being an I increase of £3/,121 over thc actual receipts of tho previous vear, leaving a deficit of £6,615 less than in 1925-20\ OODNADATTA RAILWAY. For the first half-year, that is to Decem- ber 31, 1925. thc railway was operated on behalf of the CcmmonwealUi by the South Australian Railways Commissioners, and tor the second half of the year by the Com mon wealth Railways Commissioner. Tb» | total loss for the twelve months, not ir. eluding interest and sinking fund, is mado | up as follows:-Half-year operated b> South Australia (loss) £57,936; half-year | operated by Commonwealth (loss) £35,000 (approx.); flood damages. £13,000; total, £105,936. lt is antieinated for the yca-^ | 1920-27 the loss on the working of thii railway will bc very much reduced. QUEANBEYAN-CANBERRA RAIL WAY. The cost of working this railway is csti- j mated at £14,236, and the revenue is esti- mated at £22,500, thus showing a surpluB of £8,204. The surplus in the previous veat was only £2.434. Thc improvement în the position can be attributed to the greater activity in connection with tnt establishment of the Federal Capital. Ai indicated earlier, the working oí thc Com; ¡ monwealth railways ehows a los» £4G4,30S. TERRITORIES OF THE COM-| MONWEALTH Deficit of £400,000 The estimated expenditure of tho Territories of tho Com- monwealth for 1926-27 ls .. .. £435,539 The revenue, derived exclusively from Northern Territory, is estimated at. 35,000 Leaving a deficit of. £400,53) Thc actual expenditure for 1925-23 was j £385,224. Tbc estimated expenditure for I 1920-2Í is £435.539, being an increase of I £50,315. The chief item, of increase is in j tbe Federal Capital Territory, where it is I expeetrd thal the expenditure wi!! be £34.81S in excess pf the amount expended in the last financial year. This increase is almost wholly due to the cost of trans- ferring, during the current financial year, portion of the Central Office staffs to Can- berra, together with official records. An increase of £32.720 is found in the expen- diture for additions, new works, and build- ings. Th:s additional expenditure is pro- vided in connection with the administra- tion of the Northern Australian Act which was recently passed by Parliament. The esitmated expenditure on Papua is £22,187 less than that of thc previous year and the estimated expenditure on New. Guinea shows an increase of £4,293. TERRITORY OF NEW GUINEA. Tho "mandate for the German posses- I «ions in the Pacific Ocean situated south of the' equator, other than Gorman Samoa and Nauru," issued by the Council of the League of Nations on December 17, 1920, gave to the Government af the Common- wealth of Australia full powers of ad- ministration and legislation over thc territory subject to the mandate, as an integral portion cf thc Commonwcnltih. All ex-enemy property, rights and in- terests within thc territories of Papua and New Guinea _W<TC expropriated in order that the net proceeds of the sale or liquidation should be applied in the reduction ot the reparation debt. Owing to the slump iu thc copra market and the undeveloped state of the plantations, an immediate .realisation of the properties I could not be made at satisfactory prices, so thc development of.tlie plantations was continued under thc management of thc Expropriation Board. The wisdom of Kia policy is shown by the rculte re- cently achieved when the first group of ex-enemy properties, ofliciallv valued at I £422,443, was sold for £501,403, many to j returned soldiers. It is hoped that prac- tically the whole of the expropriated in- terests iiv tho nvandatcd territory will be liquidated at satisfactory prices. I PAYMENTS TO OR FOR , THE STATES The Main Roads National Scheme With thc modern development of in i tcrnn.1 combustion engines, road trans I portation has become an essential factor iu thc commercial and social fife of thc comanunity. These interests demand s systematic development of Austral ia r roads of a standard suitable for motot traffic, which should specially contribute in some measure to tho facilities it needs. Tho State Governments, lacking the power to impose Customs duties, ar» unable to effectively reach all road users Tho Commonwealth, therefore, is co operating with tile States in a nationa roads po'/cy, and will impose special Cus toms duties which will be hypothecate! for road construction. By imposing these duties at thc source, the ordinary trade procecK of passing on costs will ultimate ly result in the road users paying thi: spécial tax proportionately to their usc of tlie roads. In 1923, the Commonwcaltl granted £500,000 to the States on 1 ; pound-ior-<poisnd basis for the construe tion of main developmental roads, and ii the subsequent years, sums of £500,00' and £75OiP00 were provided on a símala' lxisis. The results of those expenditure have been so satisfactory that the Gov eminent, in conference with the States recently evolved a scheme of nationa croad development contemplating an ex cpendituro of £35,000,000 in a period o ten years. Of this sum, £20,000,000 wi! bo contributed by the Commonwcaltl £5,090,000 being from existing sources o its revenue, and £15,000,000 will bo ob .turned from additional collections of revc inue from road users through the Cm .toms. The taxes for this purpose will b levied on petro!, tyres, and Chassis. The are estimated to produce £1,500,000 p« annum. 'Pile Commonwealth will distr bute its contribution on a basis of arc and population, three-filths according t ¡population and two- fifths on area. The States' contribution of £15,000,00 may be derived either from revenue o from loau. Whore the State contribt tion is from loan, a 3 per cent, smimi fundí is being arranged to ensure that a the end of twenty years after completio af a road it will be free fitom debt. Prc vioiom is made for the permaneKt mair tenance andi upkeep af roads constructc or reconstructed under the scheme. Tb roada intruded in thc scheme arc:-(1 Main roads which open un and devele now country. (2) Trunk "roads befcwee main towns. (3) Arterial roads to carr concentrated traffic from developmento main, trunk, and other roads. Th will in effect be lie first instalment, an form tho basis of a motional a-one scheme. When completed i-t'will be ca] able of extension in such a manner tte tho whole of our future roads constru tiom wiH dovotail into the works now pp posed. In taking this step Australia Eutting herself intto line with what hi cen done in- America and Britain, whci road users for roany years hove contri uted a very siibstanitial part ¡ of tho co of road upkeep and construction. COMMONWEALTH AND STATE FINANCES Proposals for Adjustment On June 4 I explained to the Hou the proposals of the Government for permanent adjustment of the financi relationships of the Comanomwearth ai thc States. Tho Commonwealth Cover mont proposes to withdraw the prese capitation payments which ure paid frc year to year. At. the same time, proposes {o discontinue the imposition certain Commonwealth taxes. This w enable the State Governments to reco themselves for tho loss of the capitati payments by raising equivalent funds their own taxation methods in the si rendered fields. Out cf the remains revenues of the Commonwealth, t-pec grants, amounting to £600,000, are ti paid to tho States in tho first year, is proposed, further, that Weet Au«'ra and Tasmania should receive assiil.-.r to the exilent oí £450,000 and £378,( respectively on account of special diflic ties and disadvantages. The principle underlying the prjpDs in that, as far as possible, the author «"laich expends money shall hav» Mic sponaibility for raising it. Départ from that principle has Icu to the e\< duplication of existing agencies, wh collect similar taxes from the same p pie under different laws. Under the n scheme this waste of administrai:!.-i v bc eliminated, with the saving of proximately £100,000 to the taxpayers Australia. Practically every argument advanced tho State Governments in regari to th proposals iirnores thc vital effect of war on Federal finances. If tin» wur 1 oixmrrcd' before Federation, tba C< monwcaltli wouM clearly have roqn'; an amount equal to thc Customs and eise revenue to meet its war and ot obligations. In auch circumstances, ts idle to suppose that the CommonwiM would have been required lo pay a sh of the Customs revenue to the S: Governments and at the same timo raise direct taxes similar to llio.-:c rai by the State Governments. Thc obv: course wouki have been to do what Commonwealth now proposes, nair, give each Government senora te tie!.! tniation. coupled with full re.sn.jnsib: for raising thc taxation it require.'. "A WRONG BASIS." The present system of uniform cat lion payments to each State is palpi on a wrong basis, because two States ready have been forced to apply for oial grants, which practically means adoption of a graduated escale of cai tion oariucnta. At, the piescut timi Commonwealth policy shou.d stimii the dcvçlopment of one State and re development in another, that State w ia benefited has its industries enlarged population increased, and receives an ¡ tiou.il payment by reason of that fact, tho State which is not stimulated in same way, population may remain sta ary or decline, and its payments may rome both absolutely and relatively Ii any payments arc to be made, ar lhere is to be balanced development jthe Commonwealth, it is evident that as for BOecial industries there need t special tariffs, so. to meet the eondil of each State, there must bc difiere and not uniform payments. In all payments made bj tnt CommonweaH , the States except thc capitation paym some basis other than that of nnpul; tia« been adopted. All other Federa have rejected a system of uniform capita payment1» to their constit Staten. In the field of direct tavatir bc vacated, thc Commonwealth has collecting sums of money in excess o] capitation payments which are to bc iont:nucd. Including the snecial pain to the States, and on the hypothesis thc State Governments will raipe in vacated field only as much revenue a: Commonwealth now nays them, tho ¡ taxpavers won'd he better off to th tent if £1.527 852. It is neither i s-iry nor des'rn b'-" that the States si rnl'r-t this £1.527.S.r.2 frr.m the ncoi COMMONWEALTH OPERATION FIRST YEAR. The Government has given very c: and earnest attention to tho vari cu jeetions made by tho Stato Governr to the Commonwealth proposals, lt, how ever, is firmly convinced that these pro- posals aro sound in principle and should be translated into statute form. To meet the objoction. however, that the States liavo not sufficient timo to put tho requir- ed machinery in motion for 1926-27, the Government has decided to ask Parlia- ment to pass such legislation as will en- able the Commonwealth to oporato the schemo during tho first year, instead of leaving tho arrangements to be made by the Stato Governments. This will give to the State Governments and Parliaments an additional period of twelve months in which to formulato"their plans for raising tho necessary rovenue. In the bill to abolish .the capitation pay- ments an additional clause will bc insert- ed to enable the Commonwealth to pay over to thc State Governments lind tax, entertainment tax, and cstaie duty for tile year 1926-27, "collected at the rates which existed in 1925-26: also 40 per cent, of the income tax at last year's Federal rates. Tho arrears of taxes imposed by the Commonwealth in respect of years prior to 1926-27 will belong. to the Common wealtji, but ail the taxes imposed by the Commonwealth for the States, whether collected in 1926-27 or, in subsequent yearn, will belong to the State Governments. If the taxc3 actually collected by the Com monwealth for the Slate Governments in 1926- 27 do not reach'lhe total which would have been payable to the Stato Govern- ments in 1920-27 on a canilation basis un- der thc Surplus' Revenue Act, the Com- monwealth will malic good tho difference during 1926-27 by advancing the shortage to the State Governments this year in anticipation of the collection of the ar- rears. The result will be that in 1026-27, tho State Governments will receive at least as much as would have been payable lo them this year as capitation payments under a continuation of the Surplus Re- venue Act. No change of Stato taxation laws will bo necessary until 1927-28. They will thus havo a full year to consider how they will adjust their taxation, and dur- ing that year they will bo guaranteed against any loss - under tho new pro- posals. In 1927-23, when tho State Govern- ments have readjusted their laws, they may experience some little difficulty in collecting, before the close of tho year, a full year's rovenue in respect of the taxes they impose to replace the discor.? tinued Federal taxes. Any shortage of their own collections in 1927-28 will, how- ever, be furry compensated for by tho arrears which they will receive in that year in respect of tho Federal tnxes imposed on their behalf. The States of Queensland, South Australia, West Aus tralia. and Tasmania will also receive, in 1927- 23 the adjusting grants, totalling £000,000. originally -proposed in the States' Grant Bill in respect of 1026-27. Thus thc Commonwealth, by operating the new scheme for one year in tno man- ner proposed, will overcome the most pressing difficulty under which the Sfcntc Govemincmis felt they would suffer. The State Governments will have time for a readjustment, a guarantee against loss in thc meantime, andi arrears to make good any shortage of tax collections when they commence to collect the taxes. Bills wiri bo submitted to Parliament for tho Tcoeal. . as from thc end of tho rear 1928-27, of the Land Tax Act, tiió"l"u tc:iLai.-jment9 Tax A»:t and tho Estate Duty Act. For the year 1927-23 the Commonwealth, will abandon 40 poi- cent, of its income tax. In the case of West Australia, a special addition to capita- tion payments was. provided for in sec- tion 5 of the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910\. That special addition to tho capi- tation payment is included in thc special relief of £150.000,now to be given to Wost Australia, and consequently tho pay- ment to Wast Ausitralia in 1926-27 out oí thc special taxes will be correspond- ingly reduced. Doubts have been expressed hy the State Governments as to tho occurai-y of the Commonwealth est:mate of the vicki of the direct taxes fo be surren- dered. The actual collections of these taxes for the year just closed ¡»how that the Commonwealth somewhat underesti- mated tho amounts, ana should f-ntirely d'Lspol the fears of the State Govern- ments. REVENUE FOR NEW YEAR The Treasurer's Estimates £51,382,000 Expected Haring now shown the expenditure of the Commonwealth, it is necessary to consider the sources from which the re- venue to moot thntr expenditure can be obtained. The expenditure for which revenue is required is the minimum , amount necessary for carrying out the ? ordinary services of government and giving effect lo policies approved bv the people.

It would be convenient at this stage to bring together for the information of mem- bers the total direct taxation which it is proposed to collect during the enrrent year, including the special taxes to na raised for payment to the States. The compari- son of these taxes with 1925-20 is aa fol wok: 1925-26 1926-27 Land tax. 2,521,923 2,311.000 Incomo tax. 10.858,045 10,506,000 Estate duty .. . . 1,411.337 1,350,009 Entertainments tex .. 460,309 370,000 . 15,251,614 14,537,000 CUSTOMS AND EXCISE REVENUE. Thc Customs and Excise revenue for 1320-27 is estimated at £40.500,000, being £1,301,117 in excess of the actual receipt« for thc previous year. This estimate is made in view- of the experience of recent years, combined with the excellent sea- sonal prospects and anticipated good prices for the bulk of our exports. INCOME TAXATION, j Tn the Budget speech las*, year a detail I ed history qf the'variations of Federal in- come taxation was given. Income tax was ûrst collected in the year 1915-18, and thc rates were increased from time to time until thc peak was reached in 1921 when .ho original vates had been increased by 70 5-8 i«-r cent. Reductions of more than 10 per cont, were made in each of tho years 1922-23 and 1924-25, tho exemption was raised, and last year a further reduc- tion of 12V6 per cent, was made. The in- come tax ncr head 1ms in these ways been redumd by 47 per cent, p'r head since 1921-22. 'During the current year it is anticipated that £0.450.000 will bc collect-' cd for Commonwealth purposes, and £4.056,000 for payment to the States, making a total in all of £10 503.000. It is interesting to notice that the incomo tax to be raised for Commonwealth expendi- ture represents £1 ls. ld. ncr head of the population, and the tax to be collected for "xprnditure by tho States 13s. 3d. per head. LAND TAX. Tho estimated revenue from land lax in 1920-27 is £200.000. The Commonwealth will raise, in addition. £2.110.000 na ordi nary land tax assessments during the year. This amount will bo paid to the States. OTHER DIRECT TAXATION. Thc revenue to be collected in 1920-27 on i estate duties and entcrtaiments tax is csti- ' mated at £100,000. This amount arises wholly from arrears of assessments for the nrevious year. In addition £1,020,000 will be collected in respect of assessments of thc current year DE/1 handed over to tho States. Tho war-time profits tax does not apply to profits derived after June 30, lfüSj. and transactions under this head arc purely adjustments of o'.d assessments. During tho year ¡I is expected that the re- funds of tax will exceed the collections i by £20,000. j REVIEW OF THE BUDGET I Total Revenue to be Raised, £51,382,000 Having now explained it considerable detail thc finanrca of the Commonwealth, and having given members some account of those activities which come intimately infr. contact with thc life and interests of indi vidual members of the pnb!i.\ it is now dcs;rah!c to make a brie; survey of the I Budget. Part I. of thc estimates is really the heart of thc Commonwealth Budget. Part II., covering the business undertakings of the Government, is to an extent se'f-con tained. It is unfortunate that, alth- ugh the Postmaster-General's Department is able to pay its way, an-J in fact yields a small surplus, yet the various railways, with the exception of thc (Jueanbeyan Canberr;. railway, impose on the taxpayers j, Continued on Next Page FEDERAL TREASURER'S SPEECH Confirmed from Page 8. a deadweight border, which must be pro- vided from general taxation. The public has, however, demanded these railways, and the accounts as presented show clearly the loeu on the working which the tax- payer has to shoulder. Similarly, thc de- mand* made upon the Treasury to main- tain the territories of the Commonwealth must be provided from general taiation. This cost is clearly set ont in part III. of the estimates.: The tases to be raised by the Commonwealth merely for the pur- pose of making grants and special pay- ments to thc States are clearly ahown in part IV. of thc estimates. The losses on business undertakings, thc cost of the territories of the Common- wealth, and the charges made on Common- wealth taxation for the purpose of special payments to the States ari; focussed in part I. of thc estimates, which, in addition, shows the expenditure on ordinarv Govern- ment departments and other administra- j tive services. Part I., therefore, shows the real obligations of the Commonwealth, and sets out as well thc methods adopted to raise tho necessary rc-enuo. ¡ A reference to part I. of tba estimate* will show that in 1929-27 tho Common- wealth proposes to raise by direct and Indirect taxation the sum of £47,230,000 and from other sources of revenue £4,152,000, making a total in all ol £51,382.000. The rovonuo available is to bo applied as follows: Cost of departments and ser- vices, other than buslnoss . undortakinns and territories of tho Commonwealth ... .. £49,287,443 Deficit on business under- takings . -317,848 Deficit on territorios of the Commonwealth. 400,539 Margin - representing surplus for tho year. 143,381 Those amounts total.£50,155,211 thus leaving £1,226,789 availablo from : general sources of revenue for grants and special payments to tho States. I The total grants and special payments to be made to thé States are £10,513,7S9, Thc surplus available towards these payments ! is £1420,789, leaving £9^287,000 to be pro I vided by special taxation. This amount it is proposed to raise by special Customs tosas totallins £1,SOO,000 and direct taxa- tion totalling £7,787,000. , This statement itself demonstrates tho 1 wisdom and the necessity for the Govern- ment's action |n placing tho financial rela- tions ot tho Comrnonwcalth and the States on a moro satisfactory basis. The presen- tation of tho accounts shows in a striking manner the extent to which tho Common- wealth durina 1926-27 must romain in fields of taxation in which tho States already operate, in order to raise revenue to be handed to tho States for expenditure by tho States. The statement of Commonwealth re- ceipts and expenditure furnishes an effec- tive reply to the claim of the State Gov- ernment that they have a moral^ right to a shave of the Customs and Excise re- venue. Part I. of thc estimates shows that the legitimate expenditure of the Commonwealth, quite exclusive of pay- ments to the States, requires not only the total Customs and Escise revenue, but revenue from direct sources in addition. COST OF SERVICES. REDUCTION IN TAXATION. In fact war and defence services cost £3f.019,90T>. and invalid and old aga pen- sions £9,000,000. The burdens of the war, of thc adequate development of the national defences and of thc obligation to provide pensions were imposed upon thc Commonwealth long after thc con- stitution was framed. These services »lone cost £4:1,019,906, or £2,519,000 moro than the total Customs and excise collections. During the last three years tho Gov- ernment has made reductions in taxation and postal charges of an annually re- curring amount of £5,090,000. It has also substantially reduced thc war debt, has Instituted a progressive defence policy, paid £1,250,000 in bounties to stimulate industries and improved, at an increased annual cost of £3,600,000, the lot of the old and the infirm. This year finds it able to carry these cumulative reductions and concessions and to pay bounties of £600,000 to stimulate industry. Under the Commonwealth's financial proposals the State Governments, when imposing taxation in the field vacated by thc Com- monwealth, will have the opportunity of giving further relief to taxpayers totalling £-1,527,852. The Commonwealth Government is meet- ing its own obligations which arise from the ordinary functions of Government, from thc losses incurred in providing pub- lic utilities, from the burden of develop- ment of its territories, and from the de- mands for financial assistance from State Governments to raise their development to the general standard, lt is necessary that the States should also meet their ob- ligations and, themselves, make the neces- sary provision for that purpose. To facili- tate this action on the part of the States, tho Commonwealth proposos to vacáte cer- tain fields of taxation which aro more than sufficient to yield tho prosont capitation payments to the States. The Common- wealth Government's neiley is ultimately to vacato tho whole field of direct taxa- tion. lt will still pursue Its programme of strict economy and tax réduction, thus alvino the States a continually widening scope to indemnify themselves for the withdrawal of the per capita payments. The financial proposals of the Govern- ment have now been unfolded. Its policy since its accession to office has been to secure the balanced development of Aus- tralia ns a whole. Its actions have been directed to establish both its own finan- cial position and that of the States. The redemption of war debt in Australia, the activities of Ufo loan council, Common- wealth abstention from raising new loans for its own purposes in the Australian market, Commonwealth co-operation with regard to migration, Commonwealth eon cessions regarding soldier land settlement, bounties to stimulate industries in vari- ous parts of Australia. Commonwealth policy with regard lo unification of rail- way gauges and national main road con- struction, national efforts to improve mar- keting conditions, the provision of better facilities for postal and téléphonie com- munication and reduction of direct taxa- tion-ail haw tended to make, the States' financial position easier than it otherwise would have been.
