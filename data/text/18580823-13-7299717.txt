COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Saturday Evening. The only entry passed at the Customs to- day for the export of gold was one for 14£ ounces for the Dover Castle. Buyers have been more active on the gold- fields ; and the prices Offering have brought forward increased quan- tities. The following are the rates quoted ia Melbourne :-Omeo gold, G8s. to 71s. 6d. ; Plea- . Bant Creek and Gonlburn, 75s. to 75s. 6d. ; Ben. digo, Castlemaine, and Jim Crow, 75s. Cd. to 76s. 6d.; Ararat, Maryborough, Dunolly, Piery Creek, Avoca, and Amherst, 77B, to 78s.; the Ovens, 77s. 6d. to 79s.; Ballaarat, 783\. Gd. to 79s. 6d. . The escorts still continue to answer the expectations formed from the experience of past years. The total of the week's escorta \--^liaB amounted to 18,418 ounces, which is 748 ounces above the average of the past year, 6,493 ounces above that of the first quarter of the current year, and 8,128 ounces above that Of the second quarter. As compared with tha bOneeponding week of last year, this week's Jtetum shows a great deficiency ; hut it must £ remembered that the months of August Bnd September, 1857, surpassed all other months in the yield of the metal. In tha following list, the asterisks prefixed to the names of the gold-fields denote that the escorts thence are despatched weekly. 1858\. 1857. Oz. dwta. Oz. dwts.

During the current year, tho escorts from this district, taking in the O cans and all the tributary gold-fields, have beau uniformly about half of those of 1857. Tho other differences arise moro or less from fluctuations not uncommon in gold-fields EtatisticB. The shipments for the week have been light. The mail steamship Columbian cleared out with 40,089 ounces, and the miscellaneous ship- ments amounted to 38 ounces only. Those quantities, added to 1,528,330, the previous shipments of the year, as recorded in tho Custom House books, bring the total of the year up to 1,568,457 ounces, or, reduced to tons Troy, to C5 tons 7 cwt. á lbs. and 4 [ounces, the value of which, at £4 per ounoe, 'amounts to £6,273,828. The shipments for the corresponding period of 1857 amounted to 1,094,099 ounces, or to 70 tons 11 cwt. 2qrg. 24 lbs. 11 ounces. t The gold-fields news of tho week has not been of pressing importance. The season- able weather has been filling the creeks and providing the puddlers with the means of continuing their avocations. There have not been any rushes of an important character. At Bendigo, the question of the extraction of gold by the fusion of quartz is exciting at- tention, and experiments are being made, with, os yet, nothing more than the old results- proofs of the presence of gold, and of the inability to separate it from the matrix at a profit with the chemical means at pro Bent available. The .two great Ballaarat nuggets " Welcome " and "NilDesperandum," nave'excited attention to-day, especially the former, which an assay of Mr. Birkmyra de- clares to be within J of a grain of 24 carat gold The number of persons who arrived at the Port of Melbourne during the week was 469 ; comprising 179 from the United Kingdom, 282 from the neighboring colonies, 2 from Calcutta, and 6 from the Gape of Good Hops. The departures are computed at 280. The net addition to the population of the colony, by the seaboard, was 13,628. Arrived. Departed. January . ....2,656 1,939 February . ' """ March. ... April .

Money appears to be abundant, and seeking employ- ment, but not for purposes connected with commerce The uncertain feeling which has EO long prevailed in the import market has so completelyohecked.speculation.thatcapltallsts out of trade have withdrawn from the market, and have sought other investments, mortgages at from 10 to 12 per cent, being the favorite security. The rates of discount at the banks are :--For bills under 95 days' currenoy, 8 per cent.; from 95 to 12G days', 9 per cent. ; over 125 days', 10 per cent. ; and on overdrawn ac- counts, 10 per cent. There is nothing done in commercial paper outside the banks, except at usurious rates of interest, and very little at these. The demand for bills of exohange on Bag land by the Columbian does not appear to have been very great. Tho selling rates of the banks were-On England, 1 per cent, pre- mium for CO days' sight for large amounts, and le per cent, premium for 80 days' sight for bills under £50. Freight on gold by sail- ing vessels is taken at from 2¿d. to 8d. per ounce, deliverable in London ; insurance, 1} per cent. ; by the overland route, f per oent., that is, 7d. per ounce as nearly as possible insuranco, li to lg- per cont. In the stock and sharo market there have been several transactions, but not of large amounts. Victoria Government Six par Cents., payable in Melbourne only, principal due in 1863, have changed hands at £103. South Australian Six per Cent. Debentures, payable in London, principal due in 1883, at £107 ; and New Zealand Government Ten pat Cents., due 1868, at £10210s. Melbourne Gas and Coke Company's Ten per Cent. Debea tures, due 1860, have been sold at £104. Mel- bourne and Hobson's Bay Railway shares have been sold at £71 and £71 10s. Colonial Bank of Australasia shares have advanced to £6 buyers, sellers demanding from £6 Is. to £6 2B. The Directors of the National Bank | of Australasia are disposing of their remain- ing shares at 5 per cent, premium on the amount paid up. The export trade has been quiet, but in- quiries have sprung up for wool, and a few lots of fellmonger's bales have changed hands at from 9¿d. to lOJd. per lb. for slips, and Is. öd. to Is. 9d. for scoured. Hides have been slightly noticed, but transactions have not .been large. Tallow has been sold at from £10 to £42 per ton for beef, £43 to £45 for mixed, and £50 to £52 for mutton of first-rate quality. The increased exports of the last week for which the Customs returns are completed" that ending the 14th instant-have brought She balance of trade for the current year onoa more in favor of the colony. The commerce of the Fort of Melbourne has been, according to these returns, very evenly balanced during the year, as will be seen from the following comparative table a Wcok ending, Imports. 80 .

LAHOR MARKET.- Tho oondltlon of this market is wholly unimproved, the supply of all descriptions Doing in excess of requirements. There doos not appear to bo any general dcslro of reducing ratoi of «ages ; but, notwithstanding tho numerous extensivo works, both public and privato, carrying on, ttiore are moro bands than can bo occupied, and numbers aro consequently unemployed, and, we rogrot to say, without much prospect of procuring any spoody hire. Tho immigrants per Africa, consisting of 483 persons, aro all of tho assisted class, and aro being speedily removed from the depot by their frionds ; those, thoreforo, do not press diroetly on the labor market; but with the exception ol first-class fannie Borvatits witli testimonials ot capacity, thoro is no de- mand f orany class of unemployed labor.
