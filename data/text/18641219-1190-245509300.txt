The past week has been h very dull one in the ' import market, the favourable nature of. the ship ments from Europe being counterbalanced ' by the news of heavy failures, which to a certain ex tent affect firms iu this city, nnd operations (King further restricted by the uelav in the announce ment of tho fiscal policy ot- the Government. The advices of the'embarrassment of the London firm has caused the suspension of Alcssrs, Clcvc, Brothers, of tills city. The liabilities ure stated to amount to about L20,000, and the estate has been privately assigned for tho benefit of tlie creditors to Messrs. Joshua and Blackwood (of the firm of Dalgety and Co.)
