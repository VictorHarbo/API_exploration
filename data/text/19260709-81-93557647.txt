YEAR CLOSES WITH A SURPLUS OF £286,944 REVENUE FOR MAIN ROADS EXPENDITURE REDUCED BY £7,614,261 PER CAPITA SCHEME MODIFIED There were no k surprise in the budget speech delivered in the House of Representatives by the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page). The review of the past year showed that it had closed with a substantial surplus and the estimates indicate that there will be a considfirahli» rediiRtinn in the expenditure this year. Taxation will practically remain as it is, except *that additional customs duties will be imposed on motor accessories to provide a portion of the £20,000,000 grant for main roads. In regard to the per capita payments the State Premiers are to be given a year's breathing space during which the Commonwealth Govern ment will hand them the taxes they would have received undsir the Prime Minister's scheme instead of the amount they would have received in per capita payments. ' f - MELBOURNE, Thursday. In the House, of Representatives to-day the Federal Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) de livered his budget speech. . \ I)r. Page said :—It has been' my aim al ways to present- the Budget as early as pos sible, and thus give the Parliament full op portunity to exercise its control of the finances. Further, the .stabilisation of fin ance generally is assisted. The commercial, trading, "and industrial community is then able at the earliest moment to jnake its ar rangements conform with the demands which will be made by" taxation. The operations of the States and of large numbers of private persons are also influenced by the scheme of . Commonwealth expenditure. Although the information "now included in the esti mates of the revenue and expenditure under general heads is. in my opinion, sufficient to enable the House to deal with the Bud get, I propose, as early as possible, to pre sent to the'House that detailed information which it has been the practice to, supply in the past. EXPENDITURE The chief increases in the actual expen diture 1925-26 over the estimate are as fol lows :—Interest and.*sinking fund 011 war loans, war pensions and " other war services, £311,405; invalid and old-age pensions, £472.882!: bounties and other special ap propriations, £195,348; ordinary votes of -de partments, £130.752; other increases and de creases—nefc increase,- £64,367. Total in crease £1,174,254. The main increases15- in the expenditure 011 war services are in connection with inter est 011 war loans and war pensions. War pensions exceeded the estimate by £143,664. SURPLUS FOR THE YEAR .'In' addition to the expenditure set" out above the following moneys not provided for in the Budget of 1925-26 were paid toi trust fund in anticipation of a surplus in the ac counts of the year :—Naval, construction, ■<£1,000,000; special provision for air ser vices, £250,000; science and industry investi gatibiis and endowment for scientific re search, £2.10,000; special payment for debt redemption, £1,000,000—£2,500,000. There remained at the close of the year a surplus of £286,944, which it is proposed to set aside for :—Prospecting for oil and prec ious metals, £100,000; invalid and old-age pensions and national insurance, £186,944. ' REVENUE '' The ciiierf increases in the revenue were : \---Customs and excise, £1,998",883; direct taxation, £1,061,124; coinage, £207,036; net profit—Australian note'issue, -£90,062; other heads of revenue, £61,896—£3,4221,001, The increase in direct taxation arises wholly from income tax. The normal rate of growth of the taxable incomes—6 per c.«rat.—was considerably* exceeded, and the position in regard to arr.ears has improved. BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS The receipts a^d expenditure^ of business undertakings do not show any considerable variation from the estimate. The actual expenditure of the post office was £10,654, 880, being £38,445 in; excess of the estimate, whilst the revenue was £105,251 in excess of the estimate, the . actual receipts being £] 0,815.251. The cost of working the Com monwealth railways was £S97,122, or £398-5 below the estimate, and the actual revenue was £20,345 less than the amount estimated. TERRITORIES The actual expenditure on the territories of the Commonwealth was £46,547 less than the estimate. An amount of £50,000 was provided for the transfer of staffs and office equipment to the Federal Capital; the general transfer was not commenced as was anticipated. LOAN EXPENDITURE The Budget for 1926-27 is framed in ac cordance with the Government's proposals for the readjustment of the finances as be tween Commonwealth and States- More particla-r reference to Fhese proposals will he , made at a later stage.: When considering the expenditure to be provided for it is necessary to divide the amount into capital expenditure which is chargeable against loan and .annually'recurring'.'expenditure which is corrcctlf payable out of revenue. The estimated expenditure for works out of loan in 3925-26 ' was £10,279,014; the amount spent was £7,6S2,0S9. The items of expenditure in 1926-27 are Land and buildings for the Postmaster-General's De partment and construction and extension of telegraphs and telephones, £5,000,000; Com monwealth railways, £1,474,500; Grafton South Brisbane railway, £1,000,000; naval bases, floating dock, aviation buildings, munitions supply buildings and other de fence works, £5S7,500; advances for pur chase of wire and wire netting. £500,000; immigration—advances of passage money, £34£,380; River Murray Waters Act, £252, 500;. subscription to capital of Amalgamated Wireless Limited, £250,001; sundry works of various departments, £117,331; subscription to capital of Commonwealth oil refineries) £50,000; loan to territory of New Guinea for works, £42,085. Total expenditure out of loans for works, £9,622.,297. The expendi ture -on war and repatriation services, main ly war service homes, is estimated at £93S,202, making a total loan provision for Commonwealth expenditure of £10,560,499. It is anticipated that not more than £10,000,000 of this total will be required. Provision is also made for £3,400,000 for loans for the States for immigration and £2,000,000 for loans for the Federal Capital Commission. SOLDIER LAND SETTLEMENT In the Budgqt SJpeeeh of last year I made a general statement indicating the part tfie Commonwealth had taken in the matter of Soldier Land Settlement. The Common wealth had undertaken to lend the required i moneys to the States, at rates of interest corresponding to the cost to the Common wealth. For the first five years of each loan to a State, the Commonwealth granted a rebate of interest at the rate of 21 per cent, per, annum. The interest concession made on the Commonwealth Loans, and on certain moneys raised by the States them selves, amounted to £4,740,099. In addition the Commonwealth paid sustenance allow ances amounting to over £500,000, pending productivity of farms. In view of the fact that the losses by the States would be greater than was at first anticipated, the Government decided to writ# off from the loans to the States the sum of £5,000,000, to enable the States to deal fairly with tho Bettlers. The total contribution by tho Com monwealth towards losses amounted to more than £10,000,000. In addition it was decided to • reduce the rate cf interest payable by the States to o per 'ient. after 3lst December, ' I'.l.'lO. For mal agreements have now been signed by the Treasurer of tho several States covering the whole of the arrangements between the Governments in regard to Soldier Land Set tlement. The agreements are subject to ratification, by the several Parliaments and • will shortly be submitted to Parliament. SEAT OF GOVERNMENT. In accordance with the decision that Par liament shall open at Canberra in May, 1927, the - Commission has adjusted its activities with, the object of completing the necessary buildings by that date. Provision is rnado in the Loan. Estimates for raising a loan of £2,000,000 ah behalf of the Commission. MIGRATION Though the rate of natural increase in Aus tralia compares more than favourably with that of other countries, the Government de sires to supplement it bythe gradual absorp tion of desirable settlers from overseas, moro particularly from Great Britain. A com bined effort by Great Britain and Australia is being made through tlu; migration agree ment to achieve this result. With the ex ception of New South Wales, all tho States, have accepted the terna^ of the agreement i which contemplates an expenditure of £34, 00ft,000 and the absorption of *150,000 migrants in ten years. To examine and re port upon the schemes submitted, to t'ranio and submit proposals for other undertakings, to consider the best means of developing our resources, to investigate iho condition of existing industries, and the possibilities of establishing new ones, tho Government proposes to appoint an expert Commission. REDUCTION OF WAR DEBT The outstanding feature oi; tho National ■ Debt operations in recent yeara iB the sys tematic reduction of the War Debt. Though new borrowing is increasing the amount of the gross debt, the Commonwealth has, since the war, practically limited its loan expendi dure to developmental and reproductive works which provide revenue-producing assets to off-set, the new debt created. Aus tralia lias £28^500,000 le^s war debt to-day tliah Jf?otir years ago. In the eume period net debt fell' bv £160;000, despite tho fact that the Ppst Ollice created over £16 000,000 of new assets during that time and many other necessary public, works wero provided.. SINKING FUND AND DEBT REDEMPTION Substantial contributions were again made last year for the redemption of tho public debt of the Commonwealth. .. Since the establishment of the National Debt Sinking' Fund less than three years ago, a total of £20,067,040 has been applied to the redemption of debt. tinder the arrangements we have now made, the Treas urer is compelled to find revenue for pay ment into the Sinking Fund at such a rate as will repay all the debt existing at tho formation of the Fund in not more than 50 years from that time; also lie must provide revenue moneys to repay all new borrowings within not more than 50 years after the year in wlucli the new borrowing occurs. The use of sinking fund moneys in repurchasing our securities on the market has a beneficial effect in maintaining their jjricc. In this way our credit is inrproved, and future loans will be floated at a rate of interest lower than that which would in other circum stances be obtainable. COMMONWEALTH BANK The Commonwealth Bunk, which was founded in 1912 and given central banking functions and a Board of Directors in 1924, is intimately associated with tho loan opera tions of the Commonwealth Government. During the first two and a half years of the Bank's working it earned no profit. The transactions undertaken by tho Bank for the Government during the war and the immed iate post-war periods enabled great profits to be made, which amounted in one year to as much as £847,000. • Since that time, Treas ury balances 1/ave Come back «to normal, with a consequent decliite in the earningSi of the Bank. The profits of the last three years, namely:—-IPSa/ £328,000} 1924, £261, 000; 1925, £452,000, show that the Bank is making progress under normal conditions and under the new management. RURAL CREDITS DEPARTMENT The Rural Credits Department of the Com monwealth Bank is passing safely through its initial stages. Already it is handling wheat, frozen eggs, dried fruits, wines and ' osmiridium. " Allegations that the Eural Credits Department has been unable to function in particular cases on investigation have been found to be based upou instances in ^hicli no proper security for advances could be given. The Act requires that tho -produce on which advances may be made shall bo placed under the legal control of the Bank. This legal control may be given oithor by way of debenture or by placing the produce in a store or on a ship, and by handing tbf* covering documents to the Bank. In every case there must, of course, be a i sufficient margin between the value of the produce and the advance. No good purpose would be served in taking uncommercial risks. It is in' the interests of the primary producers themselves that the rural credits business shall be conduet&d; on a sound basis. HOUSING Tho question of the bousing of the people affects the eomfort and well-being of the individual, and the efficiency of the individ ual is necessary to the national welfare and progress. In accordance with" the policy announced prior to tlfe last election, the Government in consultation with the iBoard of the Commonwealth Bank is preparing the details of a scheme to be submitted to Par liament to enable the Commonwealth Sav ings Bank to assist in the provision of homes for the people, both by new construction and by purchase. For this purpose funds up to £20,000,000 in all will be provided. The in tention is that advances shall be made by the Commonwealth Savings Bank up to amounts which, consistent with safety, shall be a high percentage of the total cost. It is desired also to keep interest rate-g down to a minimum. . \ . ,. . .. (Continued .on. Bage 6.) FEDERAL BUDGETSPEECH I (Continued from Page 5.) expenditure I now come to the annually recurring ex penditure out of revenue' for 1926-27". The total expenditure under this part of the Estimates is £49,287,443. The1 expenditure yf tlie previous year was. £52,384,247, being a reduction'• of £3r096,804. • Decreases have been 'effected in directions where the ad ministration is .in a position to -control the. expenditure. The increase's of. Commonwealth expenditure are almost wholly a result of a policy which meets tlit'.legitimate demands <vf the. people—:as in .the case of Old- age Pen sions and Defence. " DEPARTMENT OF REPATRIATION 'The cost of war pensions is" still iuertas ing owing to-the birth of children to pen sioners and to liberalizing: the coifditions under- which pensions are ^granted. No im mediate reduction in the 'numbers applying for -medical attention is anticipated. Cer tain factors such avs 'increased age, progress .of disease- and complications of war disa bilities with. the ordinary diseases of civil life are-likely to cause the numbers to be maintained throughout the ensuing financial veaiv ' ' .... ' DEFENCE The fivC-year programme ( announced in the budget of 1924 to improve the Army, the Nnvj- and the 'Air" Services, and to enlarge, rluv organisation > of ^ a munitions supply is being actively pursued. <Th'e building of two 10,000:tt)n cruisers, two submarines, and a seaplane-Sarrier ' is proceeding. The Gov ernment has agreed to make a payment to the; New South Wales Government of £135, 000 as a subsidy towards the:'cost of a float ing dock at Newcastle,- on the understand ing that the. doclt will be capable of accom modating the new cruisers. Additional per sonnel will be enlisted during 1926-27 to provide for the manning of the submarines, the cruisers and,-the seaplane-carrier, and for the establishment of a."hew Air Craft Squadron. The training, of an .additional' <]uota-'ltoya] Australian Naval Reserves and Citizen Air Force training will continue. Provision •:isJ}eing;madG :fo'r the building and filling of an oil tank. v INVALID AND \OLD-AGE PENSIONS. The hope that the researches of the Royal* Commission on National Insurance would be sufficiently advanced to ' enable the Govern ment, to bring' dowp, 'during last financial year, a national'■}insurance 'scheme in Coii uexion with Old age and sickness, unfortun-1 ately, has not' been rt'alised!' Accordingly in September the'Government obtained legis lative^authority for an increase iii the rate of_ peiisibnsVfr6mr"l7s''6d to 20s a week' in anticipation" of' the adoption of national in suranc(v<'In addition the statutory limit of incomif plus pension was increased from 30s to>JfSg 6d a wetk",. This increase 1 was addi tional to the previous increase1 of os a fort night made under the j>resent Government in September,, 1923/fc The ^.Government is still of opinion 'tliat the -present , method cf pro viding relief, does not-f ulfil all requirements. It is looking forward to^the time when, as a result of- the inquiries f'of ; the National Insurance Commission, it ;will, be in-a posi tion to -present to Parliament a national scheme for;'old age,' siekhdss/^&nd; unemploy ment. .

Commonwealth Railways: Revenue £499,000, expenditure £903,36S, de ficit £4'64,36S, net deficit^ £317,848. , ; It will be noticed that-in providing these public utilities -the Gbvernment .is not using them as; a means of- raising revenue. The Post Office can in no way be characterised as a'taxing machine, whilst the loss on .Com monwealth, railways is provided' out of gen eral taxation. • TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEVELOPMENT . During 1925-26 approximately 41,000 . ad ditional 'J. telephones ;; were ' 'connected,'.. of .which 18,210 were in the metropolitan areas. It is anticipated that in 1926-27,"'46,000 ad ditional' A telephones will be installed, of which -25,000'will be in the country areas. Tlie number of telephones in use throughout the Commonwealth .now exceeds 400,000, i nearly -7 for each 100kof population. Aus tralia' now stands seventh on the-list oi countries from the stand-point of telephone deyelopnpreht. ! The_ United States is, first, \yith 15\ teJephones per' 100 ot" population then follow Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden; and Norway. ' The policy of the Gbyiernmeiit is .to ' provide, in the: interests of national; efficiency, the, funds necessary, for the expansion. of•the telephone system. The Government's'progressive policy has re sulted during the past two and a half years in the addition o£: 100,000 telephones. The expenditure for, • 1925-26 approximated £5,050,000., For 1926-27 a sum of £4^500,000 js, provided. In;' 'recent,' years, no increases have been made in the 'telegraph and tele phone tariffs, but on the contrary, a num ber of., concessions, have been granted. The present tariffs are amongst the lowest in the world, and, as a result of increased costs of labour and material, many services are now being operated;'at a loss. The anticipated re.yeiiue, for 1926-27 would be increased by "3",580,000 if the 'American rates operated in Australia. , . . ;, .MMN ROADS Witli the modern development of internal combustion engines, road transportation has become an essential factor in the commer cial and social "life of the • community, "jh'ese^ interests- demand' a' Systematic develop ment.''of Australian roads' of - a standard suitable for niotor. traffic, -which should apocifiiiy. cqntrijbiitb iii - some ■ measure to the I'.ocllitipg jt ijeetlsr •"TJie "Stated Governments, la.cking 'tlm power tb impose' Customs duties, ar.er pnablo.. .tcT ;o$qctivelj'/rea6it all' road usora, " Tlio COTOTOOnwealth';1 tlierefprp,. is cp operating wlth J' the ' St'iitps >i)i . a:.';fiafiqna] roads poli.cy,s.ni»^.;.wni ijjipose special.

This will in effect be the first instalment and form the basis of a national roads scheme.

' i INCOME TAXATION J In the budget speech last year a detailed history of the variations of Federial incomi? taxation.^ was given. Income ..tax was. first collected in the year 1915-16, and the rates were increased from time to time until tho j peak was reached in 1921. Reductions of, more than 10 per cent, were made in cach' of the years 1922-23 and 1924-25 the ex emption'was -raisedj and last year a further reduction of 12-i per cent, was made. The income tax per head1 has in these ways been reduced by 4'/.-'per"cent, since 1921-22 During the Current year-it is anticipated that £6,450,000 will, be 'collected for Com inonwealth purposes, and £4,056,000 for pay ment 'to the States, making a total in all of £10,506,000. •• The income tax to be raised for Cominonwealtli expenditure represents £1 ls Id per head of the population, and the; tax to be collected for expenditure by the States 13s 3d pei« head. V f LAND TAX The ' estimated-reveriue from land tax in 1926-27 is £200,000. The Commonwealth' will raise, in " addjxtion, £2,110,000 - on' ordinary land tax assessments during the year.» This amount will'be. paid to the States. r,~ • ^ • OTHER DIRECT TAXATION The revenue ■ to be collected .in. 1926-27 on estate duties- and entertainments tax is estimated at £100,000. This amount arises wholly from Arrears of assessments for the previous year. In addition £1,620,000 will be collected --in respect of assessments of tlie current year and handed over to tlio States. TiieHvar time, profits tax does hot apply .to profits derived after the 30th June, 1919, and- transactions under this- head are purely adjustments o'fi old assessments;- Dur ing I he yeav-'it is expected that the refunds of lax will exceed tlie collection by £20,000.

It has also substanti ally reduced war debt, has instituted a pro gressive defence policy, paid £1,250,000 in' bpimties to stimulate industries and im 'proyed, at an increased annual-cost'of £3,600, 00'0;: the lot: of the iOld, and the infirm. This year finds it able to carry these cumulative reductions and '.concessions and .to rpay bounties of £600,000 to stimulate hidustvy. Under the Commonwealth's financial pro posals the State Governments, when inipos ilig taxation in the field vacated by-the Com monwealth, will have the'opportunity of giv ing further reliefs, to taxpayers totalling £1,527,852. The Commonwealth Government is meet ing its own obligations which arise from the onliiK:ry functions of Government, from the losses incurred in providing public utilities, from the burden of development of its territories, and from the demands for. financial assistance from State Governments to raise the development . to the general, standard. It is necessary, that the States should also/meet their obligations and. theni:. selves make the necessary provision for that purpose. To facilitate this action on the part. of. "the States, the Commonwealth pro poses to vacate certain "fields of taxation which are more than sufficient to .yield, tho present capitation ■ payments .'to the - States. The Commonwealth Government's policy is ultimately to vuonti* the whole iielil of; direct taxation. It will still ^ pursue its 'programme of strict economy and tax reduction, thus giving the States a continually widening scoj)c to indemnify.; themselves for 'the with drawal of the per capita payments. The financial proposals of the Government have now been unfolded. Its policy since its accession to office has been to secure the balanced development of Australia as a whole. ' Its actions h;jvo been directed to establish both its own financial position and. that oi the States. The redemption of war debt in Australia, the activities of the Loan Coun; eil, Commonwealth abstention from raising new loans for its own purposes in the'Aus tralian. market, ^Commonwealth co- operation with regard to migration, Commonwealth concessions regarding soldier land settlement-! bounties to stimulate industries in various parts of Australia, Commonwealth policy with regard to unification, of railway gauges and national main road construction, national efforts to improve marketing con I ditioris, the provision of better facilities for I postal and telephonic communication and .re j duction of "direct taxation—-all have tended to make the. States' -financial position easiei than ~it otherwise would have been. 1 At the conclusion of the Budget speech the Minister for Customs introduced a bill to amend the ,tariff schedule. He said the amendments were a corollary to the Govern ment's national roads* development scheme. /Phe Government wanted to provide £20,000,000 at the rate of £2,000,000 for 10 years. Of this £500,000 would be raised from revenue and £1,500,000 from extra Cus toms duties, as far as possible imposed on road users The duty on petrol would be increased all round 2d a gallon, on. tyres.by (<d per lb. weight, with an- increase of 15 per cent, on other tyre items. There would be. an all r'ounu increase of 24 per cent, on motor chassis, which would also apply to chassis'parts. "Oh the basis of last year's importations'-"'-"the. "increased duties would yield .£9^3,000 on petrol, £270,999 from chas sis/alul £303,000 from tyres. : TUp fleb'ate \vnsadjja\Rned. ; ..lusurfince against divorce is the latest jj^ote^tjon fov wovnen to be .advocated.
