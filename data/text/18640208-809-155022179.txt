COMMERCIAL. Age Office, Saturday Evening. Export entries wore passed at tho Customs, to? day, on 6961 oz 17 dwt of gold, of which quantity 4171 J oz was for shipment per ltod Rover, for Lon don ; and 2890 oz por Rangatira, for Sydney. Tho import market generally has boon dovoid of any interesting or important feature ; tho speculative feoling, so prominent a short timo ago, has com pletely subsided, nnd a very quiet week has in con sequent been- passed. Wo do not, howover, ob sorvo any sign of depreciation as apparont in tho principal staples, not oven in tho3e in which the rapid and continuous rise so recontly established might woll liavo borno a slight decline without causing much surprise. Bulk beers are frightfully depressed. Bottled evidence littlo qr no cliango. Candlos aro neglected. - Corn sacks havo bocn ex ceedingly active, and have reachod the extreme rate of 21s. Cements are easier. Currants havo been considerably dealt in, prices having advanced. Manilla cordago has again improvod. Coffee is firm at last week's rates. Broadstuffs havo not been so brisk. Tho Trieste's cargo of Californian oats changed hands for another market. Maizo is droop ing. Colonial oatmeal lias declined. Kerosene oil has boon moro extensively operated in. Tho first shipment of Tasnianian jams has como in ; thoy havo boon sold largely, to arrive, at pricos fully equal to English, to which thoy are preferrod. In pro visions both butter and hams and bacon show symptoms of revival. Rico has greatly firmed to words tho close of the weok. Full oonlidenco is felt in tho futuro of tho sugar markot, though littlo business has beon done. Teas have gone largely into consumption, but at a decliuo. Tobacco has boon dull. In timber, deals maintain the lato ad vanco. Iu spirits, Hcnnessy's caso has again gone up Blighlly. A largo salo of Pinet Castellon, bulk brands, has boen cffccted. Tlio' British and Foreign arrivals comprise two vessels from London, one from Franco, one from Mauritius, and ono from Cali fornia. Ale and Stout. — The position of this markot gets worse overy day. No progress can bo made in sales, saving at auction, wliero largo quantities are weokly disposed of at low ratos. At present, it is almost impossible to givo anything like current quotations, as holders aro so completely in tho hands of doalors, who, in purchasing, mako their own prices. We quoto Bass's No. 3, £5 10s ; small sales of No. & havo beon mado at £7.' For Allsopp's, £5 to £5 5s is wanted. Marrian's rules at £6 15s to £7 ; and tho Carlisle Company's at a similar figure. Wo observe about GOO hhd of Joules' advertised for auction sale on Wednesday next. Tho Colonial Company's, iu trade lots, realises £5 to £5 10s for strong and £6 15s for light. 350 hhd, sold by auction, wero. quitted at £3 lo £4 5s. Scotch alos aro equally heavy, at about £4 10s. For stouts, thoro is littlo or no inquiry. Taylor, Walker and Co.'s, in parcels, brings £G to £6 6s, wliilo for smaller quantities a hotter liguro is obtainoil. Whit bread's is offering at £5 10s, and Allsopp's at £4 15s. Bottled ales do not go off so rapidly; a slight concession has boon yielded in some casos. Of Prestonpans shipments havo been cleared off at 10s 6(1. Muir's can now be purehasod at 10s 3d. Aitken's at 10s to 10s 3d. Considerable sules of Jeffrey's have beon inado at 10s ; nnd, ? in order* to secure first arrivals,' this brand has beon purchased, lo arrive, at 9s 9d. Of Tranent's thero is nono offering — last sales eileeted wero at 10s to 10s 3d. . Blood's and Arrol's are disposed oi at 10s. Bass's triangle realises 9s 9d. Allsopp's of Byass's bottling can be bought at 9s Gd. Joules' is in fair request at 9s Gd ; and the Colonial Company's sells at 9s 6d. Tho demand for bottled stout coiitinucs'moderato, at unaltered rates. Henry WLite and Co.'s is held for 10s to 10s 3d. Arrol's readily commands 9s 9d. Blood's can be placed at a similar figure in consumers' pared?. Duupliy's is sparingly uskod for at 9s. Of Maclien's, which was lately sold at 9s 4 Jd,- there are no new shipments in the market. Byass's is, if anything, firmer, holders being more inclined to insist on 8s 9d ; in ono iu stanco wo know of 8s 7.}d having been refused. Sales of tho Colonial Company's single have been made at 8s 6d, while tlio double realises 9s. Hibbert's moves slowly ut 8s 3d. Pint stout is disposed of at 6s 9d. Bagging. — Com sacks have been very active, ex tremo rates of 23s having been obtained for all sold during tho week, und to-day sales aro reported at 23s Oil to 24s. An unusual demand from Sydney sprang up for woolpacks. Sales have been effected at Gs to Gs 3d, and even at Gs Gd. Gunny bags, ex Queensland, brought lis 3d. Candles have shown no animation ; prices are hardly so firm. Tho Nova Stcarine Company's Ave quoto lid ; Cramer's and Rabaix, 10jjd ; Belmont's, 10Jd lo lO.Jd; Brandon's, 10M ; Hale's and Ogilbv's, 10;d to lOJd for llnu foreign ; light weight's aro valued at 8 jd to 8}d. Cement. — Portland lias been quitted at 15s 3d, 15s Gd, and 15s 9d. A parcel of American plaster has been disposed of as low us 14s 9d| the dealers' trade prico being 17s. Coffee. — Plantation has been reduced, our quo tations being llAd to 12d. Java is valued at lid, I as holders now meet the views of buyers, with moro liberality. A fair amount of business has, in con sequence, boon done. Chicory finds buyers at 3.Jd to SJd for best brands. Au exceptional sale, however, has trans pired a shade under those figures. Cordage. — Manilla descriptions aro in good demand and continuo to advance. Ono parcel of ten tons, Binall sizo, 1 to 2 J inch brought, £51, and another lot, 1J to 4 inch, and including a warp of nine inch, was sold for £53 10s. For Europe, 1 to to 2^ inch, £52 10s is wanted. Europe, tarred, is worth £40, and seaming twine sells at 14d to 14M. Confectionery. — A good trade inquiry exists in this market at 10½d for Wotherspoon and Keilor's assorted. Jujubes sell at 1s, but candied peel is dull at 13d. Chemicals.' — Soda crystals being still scarce, £10 is readily obtainod in parcels. Caustic soda goes off slowly at £18 10s ; carbonato brings, 18s. Flour of sulphur evinces no sign of getting better, sales at £18 being difficult to make. Fisii. — Tho improved inquiry noted in our last for herrings continues, at 21s for half- barrels, and 9s for firkins, which the trade freely pay. Bed herrings lia^ e declined to 29s per dozen tins. Ling is, if anything, weaker, soles in some instances having been effected at 4Jd ; in general 4jd is paid. Fbuits. — Currants kayo beon very lively, a large country demand having set in, which resulted in very considerable parcels changing hands. In the early part of tho week most sales wero mado at 4^-d, but latterly 4Jd, both on the spot and to arrivo, has boen.refused, and, thongh it is r.ot unlikely 4$d may bo reached, the stock is much too scattered to admit of their going over this. Muscatel raisins, in layers, are offered at 7Jd to 8d. Sultanas aro valued at 7Jd. Elemes bring G.}d to GJd. Seedling muscatels tealise 54(1. Figs sell at 63d. Furniture. — At an auction salo of Brown's patent brass-jointed furniture, the following prices wero obtained : — Drawing-room suitos, consisting of couch, two easy chairs, and six small chairs, from £19 to £38 ; walnutwoot] loo tables, from £5 to £14 ; walnutwood chiffonnieres, marble slabs, glass backs, from £8 to £23 ; lounges, covered in damask, £5 to £7 ; mahogany sofas, hair seating, £5 10s ; easy chairs, £2 15s to £4 5s ; sideboards, £9 to £21 10s ; telescope dining-tablcs, £U 5s to £9 ; lounges in hair seating, £6 ; wardrobes, £20 to £21 ; mahogany washstands, 37s ; toilet tables, 33s ; chests of drawers, £4 5s to £6 ; couches covered in roan skin, £8 15s to £9 ; easy chairs, £6 5s to £6 10s ; small chairs, 31s to 363 ; wash stands, marble slabs, £14 15s ; toilet tables, with glass, £9 10s ; chairs, hair-seated, 21s to 28s. Flour and Grain. — Tho millers have experienced a large demand for flour for actual consumption, but business outside of these has been languid. 'Trade parcels of Tasmanian havo been purchased at £16. 10s, and of host Adelaido brands at £17 10s to £18. The mills quote £18 to £19. Those rates practi cally show little or no ohange, which is attributed to tho small stocks held. Should, howover, ship ments come forward more freely, we will not vouch for tho rates now ruling being maintained, tbo market generally being moro guided by immodiato supplies rather than an anticipated scarcity in future. Adelaido telegrams report 20,000 tons of flour as having loft California for the colonies ; tho state ment, however, has so complotely overshot its mark to gain any oredenco here, even had it not. been known that tlie latest accounts from San Francisco could only have reached Adelaido via Melbourne. Thero is no South Australian wheat offering on tlio spot, but we understand a parcel of 6000. bushols has been placed to arrive in all this month, tho price agreed upon was not disclosed. A small lot of Vio torian brought 7s. Tho only transaction of impor tance which has taken place in feeding grains is the salo of tho Trieste's cargo of Californian oats, which changed hands for another port, at, wo believe a considerable reduction on previous rates ; tho exact figure did not transpire. Colonial oats aro heavy, and our quotations of 4s to 4s 9d are al most nominal. Scotch are valued at 3s Gd, and Danish at 4s.' Feeding barloy is in moderato request at '3s 9d to 4s. Malting is worth 4s 9d. Maizo looks verysiok. Holders being oompelled to press tho markot for fear of weavol, wo still quote 4s 4Ad, but parcels could not be disposed of at tho prico. There is no gram in first hands. Bran is steadily maintained at at Is 8d. Mr Bencraft an nounces a reduction on all produce manufactured at his mills, oatmeal being now offered at £2G, pearl barloy at £28, and maizo moal at £16 per ton. Groats and prepared barloy at 8s per dozen. Gunpowder. — Good brands of blasting realiso 9d por lb, Hall's being held, in one instance, at tho extreme figure of lOJd. Hoi's.— Ths demand for '63's has slackened ; good to best descriptions range from Is 8d to Is lid to country buyers. Quantities could not, however, bo disposed of without a liberal concession on tho ratos named. Attempts to quit at auction havo not suc ceeded. Fino '62's bring Is to Is 3d. Malt continues inanimate. Sales can with diffi culty bo mado at 9s 3d, and not large lots oven at this. It will depend entirely on tho nature of tho advices which will bo received by tho mail due on Wednesday next, whether or not pricos will recede or remain steady ; an advance is hardly ex pected. Metals. —Inquiries for pig iron havo quieted down, and quotations aro £4 2s Gd to £4 5s. Cor rugated does noo Ul'UIV lUUUll uuueu. scoicn is without alteration on £26 to £30 10s. For Hamil ton's, £33 to £33 10s is wnnted for 26 nnd 28 gauge togothor, and £34 for 28 gauge alone. Gospel oak is valued at £35 10s. Sheet lead is quoted £26 10s. Zinc cannot be placed over £29 to £29 103. Tin plates bring 17J per cent, on invoico. Oils. — Kerosene which, in tho bogin.iing of tho wool:, was negleoted, trade sales only being effected and that with difficulty at 3s Id for best brands, at which about GOO cases in lots wero sold, revived considerably towords tho close. About 2000 cases Downer's nnd Couzzens's, recently in the flood, woro placed at 2s lOJd and 2s lid. 1000 cases landing, ox Aberdeen, havo also been sold at 3s Id, wliilo a like liguro was refused for a largo parcel, afloat. Second brands havo likewise a hotter look. On linseed w'o hear of 110 improvement,' drums bring 5s Gd nnd lihd 5s. Castor oil shows no alteration, 5s Gd being obtainod for casos from country buyers ; twonty hhd, per Queensland, offered this weok, did not sell. Lard oil is valued at Gs 3d. No sales of colza aro rcportod. s Oilmen Stores.— Several extensive parcels of oilmen's stores, goneral groceries, &c.;, wero offered 011 Tuesday. Tlio larger portion was passed in, the trado evinoing little inclination topurchase. Bottled fruits havo declined to lis for Joyco's. English jams realiso 10s 3d to 10s Gd. Wo havo been favored with tho inspection of a sample of Tasma nian, manufactured by Mr R. Stewart, of Launces ton, wlioso tasty got up is quite equal to English, ivhile, in the delicious freshness of their flavor und quality, they far exceed them. It gives us pleasure to notice thus any progress making in Australia, even though the manufacture referred to should bo that of nnothor colony, with tho hope that what is now dono in Tasmania may shortly be done in Vic toria. Tho quotation for tho articlo in question is 10s Gd, and wo understand 800 cases have been sold to arrivo. A considerable demand exists for Colo man's bluo at 9Ad, parcels on tho spot and to como iu having chonged hands at this price. Wliilo starch has bocn placed at 4-jd. Mustard is worth 7 Ad. Half pints salad oil, Gs Gd to 7s. Pickles, Gs to 9s. Vinegar, 8s 3d to 8s Gd. 1-lb salmon, 15s 9d to lGs Gd. 1 lb lobsters, 7s Gd. Halves, sardines, 8s XOJd ; quarters, 5s 9d. , 1 Provisions. — Butter receives more notice, one or two larger pnTcels thau havo been sold for some time having been quitted this week ; the trade demand, however, has not yet much iucreascd, lOd is still the nominal quotation in small lots. Larger transactions have also taken placo in bacon. In hams, cxccpt for trade purposes, thoro is nothing doing. Wo quote Sinclair's, 14 d to 14.Jd ; Coey's, 13d to 13 Jd ; Mof fatt'sbaoon, 13d ; Campbell's, 13d to 13Jd; Compton's, 12jd to 13d ; York bams, lid to 11 Jd. Checse is in fair request, at llAd and 12Jd to 12Jd. Quicksilver wo havo no cliango to report upon, 2s being obtained for moderate trado quantities. . Rice in the early part of the -week did not look at all woll. The cargo of tho Queensland was offered 011 Wednesday, but was withdrawn at £23 without any being sold. Since then, however, it has become known that about half this cargo goes on to Sydney, and the market has altogether assumed a more healthy appearance ; there is a greater de sire to do business apparent which is only for the moment checked, by tho near approach of the mail, buyers not being inclined to operate till in posses sion of advices bearing upon shipments. Salt continues depressed. Course we quoto £3 10s, and fino £4 15s. Sugar, though a very quiet market throughout tho week, is well hold, transactions have been con fined to supplying local trado wants at full rates. AVe quote 1st crystals £50 ; 2nd, £48 ; yellow, £46 ; 1st count6rs, £44 to, £45 ; 2nd, £42 to £43 ; and browns, £37 to £39. Tea. — An increased business has been done in this staple, both privately and by auction ; tho finer descriptions having been most in demand, at from 2sldto2s5d. Tho damaged portion of the Keepsake, consisting of 750 packages, and tliatof tho Fidelioof 644 packages, wero sold at very full rates. On Wed nesday, the cargo of tho Jos3ie Beasley, from Foo Chow-Foo, was offered, and tho auctioneers suc ceeded iu selling 2455 packages congou, at from Is 5d to Is lid por lb ; scontcd orange, pekoe, 2s 4d do ; caper, 2s 6ddo. They also sold, ox Notos, 145 packages of hyson and young hyson, at from 2s 5.}d to 2s 7Jd per lb ; aud, privately, 300 chests of fino congou, at a prico which has not transpired. Pri vately, also, very considerable parcels have changed hand?, upwards of 700 chosts having been disposed of in trado parcels by one firm alone. Timber.— Deals continue firm ; [- x 3 red have again been placed at 4j}d to 4Jd. The entire cargo of lumbor, ex Union, about 200,000 feet (sold as per bulk), at '£8 2s Gd to £12 por 1000 feet; sashes, 2s Gd to 2s 9d per pair ; mouldings, 3& 8J to 6j 9d per 100 feet. Tobacco. — This market has beeiv exceedingly quiet. Common descriptions of plngr tobaccoes aro plentiful, and will likely go lower in- price. Fine sorts are not so abundant, and must advance. Tho principal portion of those landing from the Aber deen liuvo turned out inferior. Trade quotations are unaltered. Tens, Is 3d to 2s 3d halves, 2s Gd to 3s 3d ; aromatics, 3s 9d to 4s Gd ;. twistsr 3s 3d to 4s 3d ; Barrett's, 5s 3d to 5s Gd. Swiss- cigars have been in considerable request ; ono- parcel of 50 cases was quitted at full rates. Wines and Snniis. — Sherries go slowly into con sumption nt £24 to £35 for common,, and £45 to £70 for medium to amontillado sorts. Ports 'realise £24 10s to £75. MarteU's dark brandy is offered freely ut 83 Gd. Pale has beon sold at 9s 9d for lilnl TfVa lininrr wnnfnfl for nnnvfflrH- 'FrEnnnMKv's brings similar rates ; thoro is no palo in the nnrket.

Caso Hennessy's has gradually crept up to - 80s, at which sales havo beon mado, though for parcels 6d to Is less has not beon refused. Otard's brings 28s; U. V.

Colonial Produce. — The vool sales have been well attended, aud the bidding spirited,, but the high reserves checked the evident dosiro' manifested for business. Messrs Goldsbrougli and. Co. catalogued 4052 balos, and sold 1100 at, for- greasy, 8d to lid ; greasy lambs, lOd to Is ljd ; fleece, lod to 21pd. Messrs Clongh nnd Co. offered 1539i bales,, of which 700 met with purchasers at, for greasy, 4d to. 12 Jd ; scoured, GJd to 17Jd; and lleeco,|10(l to. 19(1. For , tallow thero is littlo inquiry.

During the corresponding month of tho year 1863, tho receipts readied 55,928 ounces. There is, therefore, a de crease in the quantity of gold received during the month of 21,913 ounces, or 39 per cent. Tlio fol lowing are the amounts delivered during tho months of January, 1863 aud 1864, from the Western, Southern and Northern gold-fields 1803\. Western. Southorn. Northern. oz. oz. ox.

South Australia. — Our files from South Aus tralia are to tho 3rd inst.

Wheat is more freely efferod to-day, and several largo sales havo been made at 5s por bushel at the Port. Tho town price remains at 4s lOd.
