Tho signal fires seen wt-re supposed to bo trout Vood cutters on the shore. The ship Seo Star arrived at tho outside anohoraga of Hobson'« Bay late on Thunday evoning. She left the Downs on the 9th June deeply laden« had W. and S.W. winds to the latitude of the N.B. Trades, which were very light and variablo to the Equator. Contrary wfudi continued to passing tho meridian ofOtpe Good Hope In latltudo 43 S. She bsd then easterly brooz i< -to 50 E. longitude, when iho fell in with a strong f»ir wilid, which unfortunately on'y continued to longitude ivS K. Thence sho has bad a continuation of strong beta winds. Notwithstanding the ship boing vary deeply ladon, tho has brought to the colony four very valuablo thoroughbred horses In first-rate condition. The adverse winds she has experienced must account for ber seemingly long passage, as on bor first voyagi she accomplished the passage undor 80 days, and hu sinco then mode the run from New York to Lond mit 16 da; s. Trial Trip of the Leinster.-Tho mail boats of Mo City of Dublin btenm Packot Company, which han arui so long and regularly, In all weathers, botwioi Uolyhoad and Kingstown, aro about to be supersodad. Tho "time" between London and Dublin-wa ari erasing to speak of distanco-Is to bo shortened to len ti an 11 hours ; and the old steamers, though safe vaj- eéis of their class, luve long been considered too si )v lor the service. Their stylo, build, and fitting*, ara iemlllar to thousands ; bnt they aro on tho eve of dli »ppeartng, and thoa« who mako their first voyais to the Bister Irland after the 1st of August will do so in an entirely now class of steamers, almost as difiera it from the presont vessels us the galley of Cleopatra froai i Thames lighter. That thoy aro propelled by a'.oitu is the only point in which tiley resemble oaehothsr. In.size, build, power, speed, and all the interior aoeoni xnódatlons, tho new vessels of the company are extra- ordinary improvements on their prcdecesson. But -while the older variety of the class Is pa-sing awiy, they deiarve an Acknowledjremonfof- whatttieydii dering many years ; the ocean link la the chain of communication was very rnra'y brokan ; In the worst weather the Dublin and Holybead steamers undo Stho passago not nWayB as rapidly as the pasiongors -wished, but as safely ob o:uld bo doslred. Even in the furious tempest lhat wrecked the Royal Charter and perillod tho Great Eastorn, wo bolievo the Holy head mall packots crossed the Channol without au. dent or any unusual doloy. But in nn era of progro < i one good quality will not eavo cither mon or shi.H from being beaten in tho raeo hy thoso whioh posies i that one merit and others besides. The Irish nu!! boats though safo, had become, by comparison, slav. It was in tho powor or selene: to savo an hour on the Channol passage, and it has been effected. Tin original Channel steamers will noon be as extinct as stngo coaohes. When such vessels as the Leinster appear, their time is nearly como. Our coratnun'o i tion with tho neighbouring shores will ba made b/ steam-ferries: and tbo narrow sens will bo crjisîl with Tiearly as much fooUlty as inland rivers. Tai Leinster is one of four now steamers built by the City of Dublin Company for tho mai' service and passonger tie 111 o botwoen England and Ireland. The mall con- tract with the Post-office requires the mails to bo on-' veyed from London to Kingstown In 11 hours -thj maximum average of timo is allowed. The ordinary s» pasEogo is now fivo hours. In bad weather it la not un f requently moro. It is in crossing the Channol that Mun may, bo gained. Tho now vessels of the company aro to effect the saving. Tho Leinster ran a trial trip to tin Nore and back on Saturday, and tho results of the trial woro completely satisfactory. In a rough 301, and with an adverse wind, Bho attained an avoraga ' rato of Bpoed of nearly 20 miles an hour-it was only a small fraction of a milo lo,s. Tho directors oftheo3_i . paDy had invited a numerous party of passenger» fir the experimental voyage. Thoy woro convoyod from Fonchureh streot to Tilbury by an expross train. Trio Leinster was lying off Gravosond ; and as soon as the party had been p'acod oil boord, aho stirtod. Th j morning was vory unfavourable. Loaden skloä, a driving rain, cold wind, and muddy waters deprived tho trip of all that might have boen pleasant, li the ele- ments had been in the exact opposite condition. Tho Shames was chafing with its snores, and lashing tho _seox flats In ono of his worst humours. But it did not affect tho business pirt of the proceedings. Too Leinster started, and steamed down tho river gallantly, passing ovory thing on hor woy. She ison ironstoomor, of 2,000 tons burden, and about tho sumo length as the Hiinalayah-860 foot-and 36 feet in breadth. In proportion to her length, sho is, thoroforo, vory narrow, and her lines forward aro excoodiogly slurp. Sho will out through the waves rathor than rido over thom. Her engines are onormously strung. Nomi- nally they aro 700 horse-power, but they can work up to several times that rato. Her paddlewheels aro 27 feet in diameter. Throughout the trip the ongtnoä workod with porfeot smoothnoss ; so easily, indeed, that they seemed rather to bo at play than nt work. They woro built by Mossrs. Ravenhill and Co. At 2 o'clock tho vo'sol's rato of speed was tosteJbytln measured milo. Sho passed down that distance ii tbrco minutes and 42 seconds, giving on avorago roto per hour of 10 210kuots. liming put about, she did the up milo in threo minutes 23 sooonds, a roto ol' 17 734 knots an hour. Tho avorago speed of both miles waB l8 075 knots per hour, which U equal ti 19-620 land miles. The trial running was not at all favoured by the weather, but rather the rovorso, Mr. Samuda, tho builder, who was on board, roocivod many hearty congratulations on the decided succoss of tlio Leinster In point of spood, the greatest any atoara ir lias obtained in the open sea. The cabins aro spaoloui, with more holght than can be allowed in most sea- going vessels, to tho great improvement of the venti- lation. The ladles' cabin is a complota drawing-room, Tory elegantly furnished. Ono compartment of tin ship, forward, is fitted up as a post-ofBce, where til 1 letters, both ways, will bo sorted on tho voyago. A'. S o'clock, when tbo Lolnstor had again reached wate. smooth enough to moko dilling safo to tho landsraon, a cod collation was sorved in the cabin, at which pro 1 ) orlty to the ship and hor oivuera was drunk wls1» ' treat good-will.-Tlie Times.
