QiAB LIGHTING OF THE FUTURE | FOSTER te IDLE have been appointed SOLK AGÍ NTS for the * f l- ALBO-CARBON LIGHT. This Light is one of the most valuable inven tiona of the age. It is, in fact, the perfection o Gas Lighting. By its use a dull and wavering light is rendered intensely bright and steady, and this delightful improvement is effected aim*ly by causing the gas to pass through a metallic vessel containing a specially-prepared substanoe called Albo-Carbon, which, being vaporised by the heat of the gas flame, so enriches the gas as to raise its illumination to the highest power. 1000ft of Albo-Carbon Gas is equal to 3000ft of ordinary gas. Two-thirds the number of burners dispensed with. A remarkable advantage is the diminution of heat, and the escape of vapour« so DELETE- RIOUS to HEALTH. This invention can be applied to ordinary gas fittings. «.«.rjlHE SANDGATE DIRECTORY I AND ~ EAST MORETON ADVERTISER."
