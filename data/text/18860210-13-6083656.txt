It will be remembered that a little girl named Ethel May) Hampton was murdered by her mother and Butter whilst apparently under the influence of some strange form of mania. Dr Cutts, jun of Coburg, has compiled the following interesting history of this remarkable case For many months they had all been under the control of a secret in silence the nature of which they were unable to define with any accuracy Their most collected impression was that the influence was that of a secret society possessing many and powerful members, who furthered their own end by supernatural agencies which end was to obtain possession of their minds, that they yielding should in their turn exert a similar influence over others, and to swell the ranks of this immoral society By some subtle power this society had drugged them having as an object their easier conquest by removing the strength of their will to resist They felt that their resistance was becoming gradually more initTictuul, and prayed earnestly) for advice and strength face upon it Their condition was becoming deplorably worse, and they consulted with their mother as to what should be done in the extremity of their helplessness She advised the murder of the child that it should not grow up to be tempted as they were and that afterwards tin), herself included blood 1 kill themselves. 1 in) all agreed to this but acting on the conviction of the youngest sister, that Heaven would eventually cause them out of their trouble, they determined to wait and to watch. One of the sisters had dreamed twice on the same night that Tues day, the 24th January, was to be the hottest day in the year it was accepted literally, but its recurrence was mentioned to the other as us a coincidence On the night of Sunday the 24th, however u vision told them that it should be interpreted metaphor early to mean the day on which things should be in and the hottest for them This much alarmed them and the greater part of Monday the). spent in prayer J Fearing the early part of Tuesday) morning they retired to their room on Monday night returns I dressed and contrary to usage took their little sister in with than shortly after midnight they heard thunder a special thunder-w hub could he thirds none out themselves and which the) ac cepted na a proclamation of the power of their enemies and a warning that an immediate decision was necessary) Between two peals of thunder a cart stopped in front of the house which was surrounded by their enemies who knocked at their wind in, and paced the verandah into which it looks this precipitate 1 the murder. All were unanimous and the soundest minded of the sisters Mary), use I 1 upheld the child's head whilst the mother cut its tin out with their brothers razor in the presence of and with Uni approval of the other two sisters Having satisfied themselves of the death of the child, they submitted their left arms to each other to be cut with the same razor in the hope of binding to death The) all fainted.
