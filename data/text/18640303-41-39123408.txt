The Young Australian.— The damage sus tained by this steamer on her last trip to Clinton consisted of a break in the main shaft ; but as for some tune past it has been contemplated that she should undergo a thorough overhaul and refit, the present opportunity is taken advantage of, and a l?ang of artificers were yesterday employed detach ing the various parts of the engine preparatory to the insertion of new bearings and particular repair where needed. The Young Australian has done good service for a long period; and it is a subject of gratulation to the shipping public that another steam-tug lias been recently fitted, or serious delays might have ensued in vessels getting into harbour.
