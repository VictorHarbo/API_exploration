EXHIBITION, Another Superb, Thrilling, - and Realistic Picture "THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW" In a succession of splendidly enacted scenes we are led step by step from the beginning of the dissatisfaction of the Indian troops at Lucknow. Finally the outbreak occurs, and we are shown the night of May 12, 1857, and just what occurred on that memorable evening at Lucknow. At the beginning of the mutiny we are shown the burning of the officers' houses, the news of the outbreak received by Sir Henry Lawrence, and also Vise manner of - St. Henry Lawrence's death; his burial, at night, midst shot and shell, and. like Sir John Moore, ' " No useless coffin enclosed his breast. Nor in sheet nor shroud we wound him, But he lay like a warrior taking his rest, With his martial cloak around him. Yet another fine film is a Vitagraph production, "THE ROCK OF AGES." A young widow finds refuge at the Cross and dies crowned with eternal life. A GRAND SACRED CONCERT consisting of pictures and music appropriate to the occasion will be given at the Pavilion on SUNDAY NIGHT, in aid of the helpless Widows and Children of the unfortunate men who were killed in the MOUNT LYELL DISASTER. Their bodies lie imprisoned-closed Within the insensate mass; But wallaby rock, no prison make , When spirits pass." DON'T FORGET SUNDAY NIGHT!
