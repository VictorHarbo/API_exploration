The apparatus is so simple that it is surprising it was not invented years ago. It consists of a single or double steel bolt, and may be fixed to the inside, outside, or bottom of any vehicle. The bolt is worked by being pulled out to block the wheel and pushed in to free it. It can be fixed to almost any conveyance, and in case the wheels are varnished, the end of the bolt or bar is covered with a leather or indiarubber stocking. The advantages claimed for this patent are that it takes no timo to adjust, and does away with the necossity of having an unsightly strap or chain dangling, from the body of a vehicle. It is cleaner to handle, cannot get out of order or be lost, while it is almost as cheap as an ordinary leather strap. From our advertising columns it will be seen that the patent is to be exhibited at the Exhi- bition, after which it is proposed to form a small company for working it in the various Australian colonies. Although incredibly simple, the invention should prove a success and will no doubt be a source of considerable profit to the owners, Messrs Offer and Olver In another page will bo found n sketch of t e now Exhibition Building at Bowen Pvr_, together with a plan of the grounds The 11 lubition promises to bo a great success, due ir a large measure to tho hearty co operation afforded hy kindred societies in tho prot ince Entries from all parts of the colonvarc «ry numerous, and it has been found difficult to satisfactorily deal 111th all tho application» made for space Tho Exhibition Building will bo quito rcudy for occupation on Monday neil and everything is likely to bo in complete ord" bofoio tho opening ceremony takes place oa Wednesday.
