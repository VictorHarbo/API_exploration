The story of the wonderful success which has been achieved by Beecham's Pills, as a medicine peculiarly suited to the requirements of the household and the general needs of the public is now an old one. For several decades they have been a recognised specific in cases of stomach and liver disorders, and the ailments arising therefrom, and it is a significant fact that their corrective and curative properties are as highly valued as ever. Their good work still progresses. They are a present-day boon and blessing to many thousands. have a splendid record. Time has tried them, and out of this most perfect test they have emerged triumphant. For constipation, indigestion, biliousness, depression, and the other distressing symptoms of a deranged stomach and dis- ordered liver, they still remain the great and sovereign remedy. Their reliability -their sheer merit-their undoubted efficscy-have proved in the past, and are proving in the present, the truth of that old saying-BEECHAM'S PILLS Prepared only by THOMAS 8EECHAM, St. Helens, England. HER AGE WAS TEN, AND THIS WAS HER FIRST ESSAY. , SOAP "All of us in our house use soap, and mother knows all about its Mother says, ' Burford's Prize No. 1 Soap is the beat soap that can be made/ It is lovely soap to smell and wash with, and it makes your clothes so nice and sweet. We don't use any other soap in our house, because you can use Burford's Prize No. 1 Soap for everything, including your face. When I grow up to be a lady and get married, I will always use Burford's Prize No. 1 Soap, because it saves money and I will be able to buy lots more dresses. When you buy soap you have to be careful, because the grocer might give you soap that looks like Burford's fcrize No. 1 Soap, but isn't, and if you get any other soap except Burford's Prize No. 1 Soap you will be sorry for it and lose money.
