INTRODUCTION. In our last summary we mentioned that the danger of a collision between the two Houses gave a feverish anxiety to politics. Since then, in a constitu- tional sense, the worst has happened, and it does not appear any longer to be possible to avert a disastrous struggle between the two Houses. The conduct of the Government has driven the Legis- lative Council to bay. It is about to make a stand for life's sake. The collision occurs with regard to the much-vexed question of payment of members. Hitherto this payment has been provided for by Act of Parliament. Prior to 1870 the Council rejected several bills which proposed to authorise the payment, and its decision was accepted as lawful, both by the Assembly and the country. Since then it has twice con- sented to temporary bills, legalising payment during the term of a Parlia- ment, but expiring with the first session of the next ensuing Parliament, so that while allowing the experiment to be tried, it has retained the power of vetoing the system should it prove to be a failure. On the last occasion the bill was only carried by a majority of one. This year it was feared by Ministers that the Council, strengthened by public opinion, would reject any measure which might be sent to it, and imi- tating the tactics of a former Ministry with regard to the Darling grant, the Government decided to tack payment of members to the Appropriation Bill so as to coerce the Upper House into accepting an obnoxious proposal by the fear of throwing the public finances into confusion. As the right of the Council to an equal voice in the settlement of the question has been so often acknowledged in the most practical manner, hon. members took alarm at the proposed in- novation. Hints also were dropped by the Chief Secretary that he would frame all his measures so that the Council could not touch any of them. The Governor, it was semi-officially an- nounced, had telegraphed to Great Britain for advice and instructions. And the Council, thinking the time had arrived for its intervention, and fear- ing that silence might be construed into giving consent, put a question to the Ministerial representative in that Chamber, the Postmaster-General, on the subject. Mr. Cuthbert returned an evasive reply, claiming, however, "the " appropriation of revenue" as "the " exclusive privilege of the Assembly," whereupon the Council adopted and pre- sented an address to the Governor, informing His Excellency that the Council claimed " the right to exercise the same " free and deliberate vote on any bills " which may be submitted to us for pro- " viding compensation to members of " Parliament as we have had and " exercised on all previous occasions." It was thought possible that His Excel- lency, folling the precedent set by Sir Henry Barkly in 1861-2, would refuse his sanction to payment by a vote on the Estimates, but his reply intimated that he had placed him- self in the hands of his responsible Ministers. And on Thursday last a mes- sage was brought down from the Crown covering additional estimates which included a sum of £18,025 for the pay- ment of members of Parliament, at the rate of £300 per annum, from the anti- cipated close of the session to the end of the financial year, on the 30th June next. No doubt whatever is felt as to the result of this action. If payment of members can be put upon the estimates and passed in despite of the Council, nearly every question of policy can be settled in the same manner. Religion may be estab- lished or disestablished. Education may be abandoned or continued at pleasure. The government of the country may be subverted. On all questions of public policy, payment of members included, the Council has expressed its readiness to accept the will of the country, but it declines to tolerate a virtual infringe- ment of the constitution, which, if per- mitted, would be fatal to its existence as a co-ordinate branch of the Legislature. Unwilling as the members of the Council are to reject an Appropriation Bill, it is anticipated that by an overwhelming majority they will lay aside the measure about to be sent up to it, thus leaving it open to the Assembly to send up another bill with the objectionable item omitted. The crisis seems inevitable. The conse- quences it is impossible to predict, except that the violence shown by the Govern- ment must inevitably tend to bring dis- credit upon the colony. The dispute with regard to the Rail way Construction Bills has also be come intensified Out of nine lines proposed by the Government, the Council accepted seven It rejected the connexion with the Gipps Land line at Oakleigh via South Yarra, because that line seems to be proposed in pure bravado to reduce the value of the Melbourne and Hobson s Bay Railway, and the principle of inflicting wanton injury upon a private company, representing for the most part British capital, is one which it would be unseemly to affirm The Council has proposed instead that running powers be taken over the Hobson'a Bay line as far as Hawthorn, whence a direct line could be constructed to Oakleigh A large saving would be effected by this course Again, the Councd has vetoed as a notorious political job the proposal to take away the Goulburn Valley line from the thickly populated weatern side of the river and construct it upon the eastern side, which, though comparatively barren, yet returns Government sup porters Ministers met those amendments with a cry of "privilege ' In deference to the wishes of their supporters, they were compelled to send the seveon lines not in dispute to the Council In a bill which immediately became law, but the othor two lines were returned in separate measures, and voluminous reasons in reply to the Council's denial of privilege were prepared by a select committee of a strictly party charactor, on which to the surprise of the public, the speaker of the Assembly con sented to serve Mr Service, the friend of the Government, who more than any man helped them to office, was moved to descrlbe these reasons as "a sackful of chaff, but they were duly adopted, and sent to the Council, which has replied to them at equal length Here again the right of the Council to make amendments has been repeatedly admitted, and it Is naturally considered by the members of the Uppor House a little too much that they should be asked to forego rights established by law and usage, because their views are not in accord with those of Mr Berry The line to Oaklelgh via South Yarra has again been vetoed by the Council In favour of the line via Hawthorn, and the Goulburn "Val'oy line baa again boon placed on tho weat eldo of tho rlvor Tho dofonce schomo submittod by Sir Wm Jervois is also in jeopardy, Ministers ha mg g0no ou(¡ 0f y10lr way to mtro ance the bill by a preamblo unheard of beforo in our Parliament in similar COBOS Mr Borry'a roMsod tariff has itself beon revised, and tho idea of reduoing «io dutlos on dried fruits and on gloves «aa boen abandoned And no little son sation has been created by a proposal to place the avowedly prohibitivo export duty of £3 per ton on wattle bark-an article largely used for tanning purposos, and in which a largo trado is now carried on. The obj'ect is to " keep the bark in the colony," for the use of our local tan- neries, but the barkatrippors are proteat ing againat their induatry bolng ruined, and their case is attracting much public sympathy, tho more especially as the wattle tree grows so rapidly, attaining maturity from seed in five or six years, that it is impossible that any demand should cause it to be eradicated. 'With tho same object of " keeping the timber in tho colony, a prohibitivo export duty has been proposed on red gum. The export of scrap iron is also to bo interdicted, in tho interests of the local foundries. And in connexion with revenue, we learn that tho public expenditure is to be largely in- creased. TheaddltlonalEstimates brought down amount to £102,031, making a total expenditure for the year of £5,02?, 145, againat an estimated revenue of £4,004,180, showing an apparent defi- ciency of £117,905. To many of the items in the supplementary estimates the strongest objection is taken. In par- ticular, allusion may be made to a vote of £20,000 as a subsidy to tho mining in- terest. As the policy of the grant has never been debated, and as its distribu- tion is loft entirely in the hands of Ministers, the money is looked upon aa nothing more than a fund for bribing the gold-fields constituencies. Mr. Gillies, the ex-Minister of Lands, who was unseated by tho Elections and Qualifications Committee, has been re- turned by a large majority over his former opponent, Mr. Shackell, who re- ceived the direct support of the Ministry. Mr. ForgusBon, a Ministerial member, whoso agents were declared guilty of bribery, was allowed to keep his seat. Mr. Levien, a member of the Opposition, has been unseated, on grounds which, perhaps wisely, the committee has not stated. The committee has now to deal with a second petition against Dr. Mac- artney, which, however, the Ministry would not allow to go before It until cer- tain paragraphs had been struck out by the House. Tho bill providing for tho International Exhibition of 1879 has boon sanctioned by the Assembly, and the Exe- cutive commissioner for Victoria at the Paris Exhibition-who is also charged with making arrangements for the Inter- national Exhibition-leaves by the out- going mail, SOCIAL. The beginning of the month was devoted to holiday-making. On the 3rd the Vic- toria Racing Club's Spring Meeting com- menced, and on the 6th the great racing event of the year, the Melbourne Cap, was ran for. The interest taken in this race, not only in Victoria, but in tho neigh- bouring colonies, grows year by year, and daring the carnival week Melbourne was crowded with visitors. Tbe weather on Cap Day was very unfavourable, but there were more people on the coarse than on any former occasion, the number being estimated at not less than 75.000. On the other days of the meeting the attendance was also large. The Piince ot Wales' Birthday, which took place daring the same week, was observed in a hearty manner, and the various out-door sports attracted crowds of spectators. AmongBt the visitors to Melbourne daring race time were His Excelleucy Sir Hercules KobinBon, Governor of New Sonth Wales, and Mr. Weld, Governor of Tasmania. Owing to political difficulties Mr. Weld had to letnrn earlier than he intended, viz., on the 10th inst Sir Hercales Robinson re- mained until thel3:h inst. Telegraphic communication with Earope ¡B in even a more unsatisfactory condition than was the case last month. The Putt Darwin and Java cable has now given way, and some time must elapse before it can bo repaired. The break, which is believed to be situated about 250 miles from Port Darwin, occurred on the 8th ¡nat,, and since then ne have been dependent on the steamers of the Netherlands-India Steam Navigation Company, which ply between Batijoewangio and Port Darwin, in com- pliance with an ogreoment entered into be- tween the company and the various Auatra lian Government!!. Oa the 20íh inst. a bitch of telegrams, containing European news to the 1.3th inat, was brought to Port D-irwin, and Was diatribated by telegraph throughout Australia, but since that date we have been without intelligence of home affairs. While Buch important events aro transpiring in Earope, this obatruotion of the acoastomod channels of communication is borne with the highest degree of impatience. Theanivalof five maila from Englandin the courre of thtee or four days has again drawn attention to tbe advisability of having n fortnightly service. The ordinary m jil, «iii TorreB Straits, closed in London on Septem bor 14, that by way of Sin Francisco on Sep- tember 20,yrliilo the Brindiai-Suez mail closed on September 2S. In addition to these, special moils wero despatched by the Han- kow, leavirjg Plymouth on September 21, and by tbo Cuzco, which sailed three days afterwards, viz., on the 27th. The period covered by the various mails was 11 dcys, but they reached Melbourne almoBt simultaneously, That by tho Han- kow was delivered on Thursday, November 8, arid that by the Cuzco on Saturday, while the San Francisco and Suez maila came in together on Sunday. The Torres Straits and San Francisco mails, as far as home cor- respondence is concerned, wero practically useless ; while the difference between tho dates both of departure and arrival of the through Bteamers and those of the Suez mail were so inconsiderable that tho extra oppor- tunities proved of merely infinitesimal bene- fit. Some day perhaps theae things will be managed bettor. It is of interoBt to record that the Cazco made tho passage to Adelaide in Ia few hoars over 40 days, while the actual steaming time at sea was only 39 dayB and 12 minutes. The Hankow was 43 days on tho voyage to Melbourne. It may be added tbat tho mail vkl Suez was delayed somo three or four days, owing to a Blight derangement in tbo machinery of the Tanjore during the run from Galle to King George's Sound. Notwithstanding thia hin- drance, however, the mails wore delivered two durs within contract time. Regarding the San Francisco service the Governments c f New South WaleB and New Zîaland have agreed upon a new time-table, under which those colonies will enjoy to a large extent the advantages of a fortnightly service. The now arrangement will come into force in January next, the maila starting on the 3rd from both London aud Sydney. Provision has been made by the Legislature for an international exhibition to be held in Melbourne in 1«79. A commission is to bs appointed, which will have the control of a Bile of 20 acres in the Carlton-gardons, and a sum of money on account has been voted by the Aasembly. Efforts are also boing made to have a satisfactory representation of the colony at tho Paris Exhibition, The mining department will send specimens of auriferous quartz and eaitb, models of 'be large caggota which have been found on our gold-fields, together with a collection of locks, minerals, and fossils illustrative of their geology, mineralogy, and mining ra rources of the colony. A large and compre- hensive collection of woods, fibres, extracts of bark, gum, &c; has been made by the director of the Botanic-gardens, and the major portion of the oxbibits has already bein despatched. The s.o. Durham, which loft on the Sth inat, took altogether 21 cases cf exhibits. Two of Her Majesty's ships-of-war are now in port, a somewhat unusual uircumstance for Melbourne, The Wolverine, having on board Commodore Hoskins, arrived on the Oth inst, after a long passage from Sydney, caused by Btormy weather, and Bhe was fol- lowed on the lilth by H.M.S. Sapphire, from Hobart Town, During the passage of the Sapphire, the senior midshipman, Mr. Rivers, fell from aloft while on daty on the Sth inst, and was so much injured that he died ia 20 minutes afterwards. Both the Wolveiiao and Sapphire leave to-day for Sidney. The inaugural banquet of the new Mayor of Melbourne, Councillor Pigdon, was held in tbe Town-ball on the 9th inst, and was a highly sneceasfal gathering. Over 300 guests weie present, including His Excellenoy Sir George Bowen and many distinguished visi- téis to the colony-tho Governor of Tas mama Commodore Hoakms and officers of the Wolverine Colonel Scratchley, and other gentlemen His Lxcollency Sir Hercules Robinson Governor of New South Wales, had also been invited, but was unable to be present A representativo assemblage of the citlztns of Melbourne, with membors of the Government and of tho L-gisIaturo was likewise brought together Tbe Victorian contribution to the Indian rumine Relief I and han rea bed tho hind some amount of £23 2/j There are other SnmB to come in, which will substantially increase the total The eleven Australian cricketers who are to visit Lagland during the ensuing season are now plajiog a series of preparatory matches m the differont colonies In Qaeens land tbey easily boar, a team of twenty two The visit of another English eleven to Aas trabáis talked of Ihe Melbourne Cricket Club has placed itself in communication with Mr. I D Walker, who has been invited to bring out a team An important step has been taken by the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners At the meeting of the trust on the /th inst, a telegram was lead from the otont general m London, stating that Sir John Hawkeabaw had recommended Sir John Caodo one ot most eminent civil engineers of the day as well qualified to report on the Bubject of tbe barbour improvements of this port Sir John Coode would undertake the commiss on for a sum of 5 000 guineas bat it he should be employed on a Bimilar mission by the South Australian Government, with whom he is now in treaty his services would b3 available by the Harbour Trust for 4 000 guineas As the South Australian Govern- ment is not disposed at present to join ia the engagement, it was agreed at a subsequent mceling of the trust, that Sir John Coode's services should be secured for Melbourne at the stipulated fee Mr L C Mackinnon, who leaves for Eng land by the outgoing mail, was the recipient on the 23rd iuBt of a leatimomal from the staffs of 'Ihe Argut and The Australasian newspapers The presentation took place at Clement's Cafi where between 10 and "¡0 gentlemen assembled. Mr. Hagh George waB in the chair and handed Mr Mackinnon the memento which bad been subscribed for -a handsome locket and Albert chain, the former bealing a suitable inscription. The chairman mentioned that Mr Mackinnon was leaving to take charge of the London department, which was growing more and more important daily and which it was felt ought to have the benefit not only of a thorough business man, but one who was personally acquainted with the requirements of the colony There could be no better manifestation of the respect in which Mr. Mackinnon was held, and of the friendly feelings entertained towards him, than that day's meeting Mr Mackinnon, whose health was drunk with enthaBiaem, said in reply, that he regretted exceedingly having to say "good bye,' for during his connexion with the office he had met with cordiality and kindness on all bande but he hoped some day tbat be would bo coming back again and that on biB return bo would find the ' old familiar faces " Several other toasts, ia eluding that of The Proprietors ' responded to by Mr James Spowers and the Hon J S JobnstoD, were honoured before the proceed- ings terminated Sir Samuel Wilson, who a year or two ago expended the sum of £1 000 in an attempt to introduce salmon into the colony has mads a fresh effort, and on this occasion with more Eromise of success The salmon ova hitherto as been obtained from I ngland, but after tbe failure of the last experiment Sir Samuel Wilson determined to try whether better re suits could nat be secured with ova from California. Ho therefore ordered, through the Californian Acclimatisation Society, 50 000 Californian salmon ova, which arrived by the last Californian mail in line condition The ova had been skilfully packed, and had been carefully attended to during the voyage. Immediately on its arrival it was taken to Lrcildoun, and the very next monning several hundreds of the young fry were hatched The result of this experiment ia acclimatisation is being watched with the greatest interest The annual generol meeting of the Old Colonista Association was held on the 23rd inflt, at the Athen cum. The president, Judge Pohlman, occupied the chair. The council, in their report, directed special attention to a very important amondment m the rules, which will have the effect of gieatly extending the usefulness of the asso ciation, by admitting persons who have re Bided In the colony for 20 years, whilst mem- bers who arrived prior to the 23rd of No- vember, 1855 (being the doy upon which constitutional government in Victoria was Eroclaimed) and their malo descendants will e termed pioneers.

In 1871 a bill to continue the law for n similar period was agreed to, in the face of some opposition, but the measure was passed on the ground that the time had not been sufficiently long to thoroughly test the principle In the last session of the last Parliament tbe bill was not again renewed, and the law would therefore expire al the end of the present session, unices some provision for its continuation wero made. Among the members of the Legislative Assembly payment of members is considered to be a question of special ira portance, though there is a strong and in ilucntial minority opposed to it, bat as far ib can bo ascertained it is believed that the opinion of the country generally is adverse to the system, which, while costing the country about £30 000 a year, has not pro duced tbe successful results anticipated The present Ministry, however, were pledged to their supporters to continue thesjstem, and feaung that tbo Council would not again assent to a separate bill, have determined to deprive that Chamber of the power of expressing un opinion on tho question, by inserting the vote in the Appropriation Bill. The Council, it is understood, will decline to submit to coercion and to part with its legislative rights, and the rejection of the Appropriation Bill is therefore regarded as a certainty. In order that the existing condition of alaim on this auestion should be thoroughly understood, it is necessary that a summary of the action that has boen taken upon it Bhould be given The determination of the Ministry to include the vote for payment of members ia the Estimates has been freely stated for some time past The Argus on September 4 drew at tention to this matter, and cited the coarse followed in 1861, when the same ques tion waa under consideration. When the Heales Government went to the country in the middle of 18G1, payment of membors waa mado part of the Ministerial programme, and during tho progress of the elections it became ge-ierally known that, in order to overcome the supposed objections of the Upper House, the necessary money would be voted in Com- mittee ol Supply, and included it the ordi raiy Aporopnation Bill providing for the pervice of the year Oa Tuesday the Ird September the new Parliament mot for tua despatch of business and in the vico regtl BDeech delivered 1 y the then Governor Sir Ile ii r y Barkly the follorring paragraph oc carrea -

If I refrain from giving you a positive instruction to this effect it is only because I am unwilling to bind you irrevocably to a specific course of conduct under circumstances which may have mate lially changed before this despatch reaches yon.' In accordance with this direction the Governor refused by message dated 26th June 1868 to comply with on address pre seated to bim by the Legislative Assembly, praying him to again recommend the grant in question, until he had been advised "that the concurrence of Parliament' might "be expected. ' The Duke of Buckingham in a subséquent despatch, dated Iebruary 1 18G8 wrote as ful lows - In tbe present case alter full con eideration of my predecessor e despatch, 8th December 18GG of the toims of the colonnl regulations, and of the relation which Sir Charles Darling now occupies towards Her Mojtstj b Government, I have arrived at the opinion that the proposed grant-whatever opinion may be formed of its policy or uro priety-ia not bo clear and unmistakable a violation of the existing rule as to call for the extreme meaBure o! forbidding thi Governor to bo party under the advice of his responsible Ministers to those formal acts which are necessary to bring the grant under the con»ideration of the local Parliament, This while modifying somewhat tbo views expressed in the previous despatch as to thin particular feront did not touch the general rolo therein 'fd down viz, that ' the Queen's representative ought not to bo made the instrument of enabling one branch of the Legislature to coerce the qthcr ' The public attention thus directed to this question of payment of members had the effect as has been stated on au hortty, of inducing His 1 xcellency Sir George Bîwen to communicate by telegraph with the Sacre tary of State for the Colonies in order to ascertain what course he should take ii op plied to by his Ministers to authorise the ia elusion of the vote in the csfimatos Nothing is known authoritatively as to the form of words in which the question of the Governor, and the reply of the Colonial Secretary wera coached, but it is alleged that His 1 xcellency was instructed to follow the advice of his responsible Ministers On November 1, in the Legislative C jancil, Mr Anderson plainly asked the Postmaator Gtneral whether there was any truth in tho current rumours that it was tbe intention of the Government to include the amount for payment of members in the Appropriation Bill instead of sending it up n. a Bopirato bill ob heretofore Mr. Cuthbert said thaf be had bcon instructed to give the following reply -"It is unusual and inexpedient to state the intentions of the Government otherwise than by the due presentation of buBinees to Parliament, but in this instance there is an additional and sorious objection to the question. It deals with appropriation of revenue which is the exclusive privilege of the Legislative Assembly, and it is there fore highly undesirable that the Legislative Council should interfere even by a question with appropriation, the initiation of which is by message fiom the Crown on the advice of reeponeibie Ministers, and is further con trolled by the exclusive ptivilegos of the Assembly." Mr Andorson at once gave notice that on the following Wodnesday be would move-"That an address be pre eented to His Excellency the Govornnr re spectfully intimating the desire of the noaso to be afforded an opportunity of considering the question of payment of r embers by bill as heretofore, pointing out that the inclusion of a sum for the paymont of membars in the Appropriation Bill might make such a pro cedure the instrument of enabling one branch of the Legislature to coerce the other and requesting that His 1 icollency may thore fore refuse to authorise su^h a procedure ' On November 7th this motion, amended lu the following form, was submitted - ' That an addross be presented to His Txcellency the Governor, respectfully assort ing the rifebt of thia House to be afforded an opportunity of considering the question of payment of members by bill as heretofore and pointing out that tbe inclusion of a sum for the payment of mombors in the Appropriation Bill might make such proce dure the instrument of enabling one brauch of tho Legislature to coerce the other ' Mr. Anderson, in supporting his motion, pointed out that if the Council were to con- cede tbe claimB that had been put forward if it was to have no right to interfere with any bill m which money was mentioned, it would como to this, that all the measaros poseed by the Assembly might bo put into the schedulo of the Appropriation Bill In fact it had been intimated that it would re quire no great amount of ingenuity to make a sufficient appropriation m every btll as to deprive the Council of the power to amend it. The question whother members of Par- liament Bhould bo paid or not was a question of large public policy, apart altogether from tbe appropriation of the money, and as such the Council were entitled to consider it No previous Ministry had ever attempted to argue that it was not a question of public policy It was now contended he believed, that as the Council had assented to tbe prin cipleof the bill on two consocutive occasions, it was not now neresaary to consult hon. members further on tho matter. But it was beyond diBpute that np to tbo present pay- ment of members had always bien re- folded as a temporary measure , and it could only be properly continued with the approbation of both Houses of Parha ment If payment of members was included in the Appropriation Bill a contest bat ween the two Houses would be inevitable. (Hear, beni ) Should that contest arise it would be impossible for the Governor to stand out of it Oa th6 other hand, if the proposed address was presented to the Governor, it might have tho effect and was intended ti have tbo effect of preventing any contest, because if His Excellency assonted to the terms of the address and declined to tack patment of members to the Appropriation Bill, as he waa directed by bia inHtructious bb found tiven in the I otes and Proceedings of the Counulloi 18G4 5 at page %i -' You aro as much as possible to observe in the passing of all laws that each different matter be provided for by a different law, without intermixing in one and the same act such things as have no proper relation to etch other ' and if he held that this House was entitled, on a large public policy, which had been on its trial for bix years past to cipress on opinion then ho would refuse to neetet the Ministry in their attempt to induce him to Bend down sucha message as would, in the language of tbe Duke of Buckingham, enable one blanch of tbe Legislature to coerco the other Mr Cuthbert opposed the motion ob ill timed and premature He stated that it waa not the intention of the Government to let payment of membors fall into abejonee, for they intended to carry out tbe views of the country, as clearly expressed at the last general election. Thore were S3 of the 8b members of the Assembly in favour of the payment The hon mern her (Mr. Anderson) wanted the House to come to the conclusion that tho Governor would do something constitutionally wrong if be acted on the advice of his responsible Ministers Rather he would do wrong if he refused the advice of his Ministers, unless he considered that Imperial interests would be interfered with. He did not say it was the intention of tbe Government to place pty ment of members either for the Assembly alone or for botn Houses, on the Estimates, but if that were the case, how could the Ga vernor refuee to assent to their doing bo He contended that it would not be unconstitu tional to do bo and referred in support of his position to the despatches of the Duke of Buckingham on the Darling grant as given above contending that the second de spatch very materially altered the vie va expressed in tbo first. Mr Balfour pointed out that there was the very great distinction between tho Darling grant and the present question-that the voice of the country had been taken eape emily on the former question, whereoB it had not on the latter Payment of members was not a question which turned the lant clec tiona, and was not e'uii a main question in them. The motion was carried without a division, and a committee, consisting of Sir Challes Sladen, Dr. Dobson, Messrs Sar good, Fitzgerald, Balfour, Graham, Simson, and Anderson, was appointed. On the next day the committeo brought up the following addreBS - "May it please your Excellency, "We, Her Most Gracious Mojosty's most dutiful and loyal subjects the members of tho Legislative Council of Victoria in Par hament assembled, beg leave to approach your Excellency with renewed assurances of our unabated loyalty to Har Majesty a throne and person, " We desire to draw your Excellency's at tention to the answer given by the hon tho Postmaster General during tho Bitting of the Council on the 1st inst, to tho question put by one of our memberB viz -' Whether it is the intention of the Ministry to affo d this House an opportunity of considering the propriety of renewing or discontinuing the payment of members of Parliament by sub. mlttmg the measure by bill as heretofore Î ' "That answer was as follows -'In reply to tho bon. member, the Cabinet desire mí to Bay that it is unusual and inexpedient to Btate the intention of the Government other- wise than by the due presentation of basiaoBS to Parliament, but In this instance there is an additional and serious objection to the question of the hon member.

Tho seven lines to which bDth Houses bad agreed wero included in one bill and this was passed by the Legislativo Council without objection lbe Goulburn Valley line and the Oukleigh line were introduced ia separate bills Upon Ootober 30 on the motion of Mr Beny a select committee of the Legisla live AfBembly waa appointed to draw up reasons in roply to those of the Council on the question of privilege The reasonB presented by tho committee wore vory diffuse but in brief amoanted to a conten tion that the Legislative Assembly was created to possess and from the beginning claimed and exercised the same exclusive power over publia expenditure claimed and exercised by the House of Commons And that tbo Legislative Council was designed to poeseBB with respect to aid and supply only the legal right of rejection (whioh is in effect merely a suspensive vote) enjoyed by the House of Lords They submitted -1 That the bill authorising the construction of certain railways by the ntate appropriates a part of the revenue of Victoria or what amounts to toe samo thing the proceeds of debentures whioh the revenne will have to redeem 2 That the amendments made by the Counoil involve lho expenditure of public money authority for the payment of whioh did not originate in the Assembly 3 That such amendments have been made in douanes of the 50th sec tion of the Constitution Aot and also ia violation of tbe alta seolion and of the ex press agreement made and adopted by the Council on the 21st May, 1867 which fix the power and procedure of tho Council in rola tion to all bills of sid and supply as identical with the corresponding powers and proco dure of the House of Lords. Mr Service likened the reasons to a grain ol wheat ia ft eaok of e-haff They Amounted to a strained contention that the wnUon constitution of the country could be overridden by the un- written constitution of Great Britain. If the Council gave way, he said it would be practically snuffed out Only those who believed that the colony Bbonld be governed by one Chamber would follow the Government in its lead, Mr. Berry BBBerted that bo bad no desire to quarrel with or deBtroy tho Council, but con- tended that the second Chamber could only exiBt in the capacity of a House of Lords. He intimated tbac the reform of tbo Cmucil would be tho first work taken in hand next BCBsion. After a debate extending over two evenings the reasons were agreed to without a division, and sent to the Legislative Council. A select committee was also ap- pointed by that Chamber to draw up reasons in reply, and a very voluminous docu- ment was the result. The Council relied upon tho Constitution Act, aa it appeared on tho statute book, and declined to recognise any authority in the matter of legislation drown from any other source. Concerning the express agree- ment referred to by the AeBembly the Council pointed out that so far from there having been a clear, formal, and final recognition of tho principle contended for by the Asssembly in ÍMI7, ob aeserted, nothing at all resulted from the conference to which thoy had called attention ; and tbo Council expressed sur- prise that the Assembly should now designate as an agreement that which was never matured, and never brought to the stage deecribed by its originators as necessary to give it effect. The Council denied thal the Railway Bill was a bill for appropriating ony portion of the revenue, and they utterly declined to accept the statement that " the legal right of rejecting bills is in effect merely a Buspenaive veto," oa an assertion j astified by the Constitution Act. Further, tbey held that the powers of the Legislativo Council differ materially from thoeo of tho House of Lords, Tho Council is created by a statute which limits its powors and privileges, with certain defined exceptions, to thoso of the House of Commons. Its powers, like those of the Assembly, are created and aro bounded by that enactment. Tue reasons were adopted and transmitted to the Assembly. A question of privilego was likewise raiBed over tbe Waterworks Bill, a measure pro. viding for the establishment of compulsory laticg. The Council made amendments relativo to procedure before the court, or to distress, and Bale of gooda for sums due by any person, Herein the Assembly sow a ques- tion of privilege, and intimated the same to the Council, who replied that they could not understand how Buch amendments could involve any privilege of the Assembly, The bill was laid aside by the Assembly, but an- other measure providing for the points amended by the Council introduced. Another difficulty has arisen over the Forts and Armaments Bill, a measure em- bodying the defence scheme proposed by Sir W. Jervois. Both Housea are willing to assent to tho scheme, but the bill was sent up to the Council with a free- gift preamble. In the Assembly, Mr. Berry stated that Im. peiial precedent had been strictly followod in this motter, but in the Council Mr. Cuthbert, the representative of the Governmont, dis- claimed tbe responsibility of the Ministry for its insertion, and declared that the draughts- man bad inserted it without instruction», pimply following English precedent. Sir O'. Sladen expressed his astonishment that such a preamble should have been adopted as this -" We, your Majesty's moat dutiful and loyal subjects, the Legislative Assombly of Victoria in Parliament assembled, having con- sidered," &c; Was thero, ho asked, only one House of Parliament in Victoria ? Were they reduced to the Legislative Aesembly alrtody, and bad the Council no existence 1 He could assure the Government the Counoll had no wish to obstruct the scheme, or to humiliate the Ministry, but was propared to accept the statement that an error had boen committed by accident ; and if the objection- able preamble were withdrawn a bill coald bo passed in five minutes. Mr. Cuthbert ad- mitted be bad not read the preamble, did not ero ita necessity, and would consult with his colleagues about withdrawing it. In connexion with tho general subject of defence, Mr. Berry mentioned that the works at the Bboals would bo first proceeded with, and that in all probability arrangements would be made with Lieutenant-Colonel Soratcbley, R.E., to cupervise the carrying out of the whole of tho fortifications. It is now stated tbat the Government in tond to insist on the free-gift preamble, and will, if the bill be thrown out, decline to proceed with the Bchemo of defence. THE BAILWAT BILLI The Government having abandoned the original Railway Construction Bill, divided the measure into three. The one including the seven lines not objected to was passed by both nouses without demur. The Gipps Land Railway Completion Bill, providing for the line between Oakleigh and Melbourne, differed from the provious proposal of the Government, in so far that power was not taken to take the site of the old suburban station from the Hobson's Bay Company, but left it open to arrange a friendly purchase. Tbo second reading was taken in the Assembly on Novomber 13 An amendment in favour of the outer-circle route wos proposed, but waB negatived by a majority of 38 votes. The Council insertod their previous amendment striking out tho litre from Oakleigh to Flindora Btreet, and substituting a line from Oakleigh to Haw thorn, via Camberwell. No mention, how« ever, waa made on this occasion of running powers over the Hobaou's Bay line, but the Government wero left to nroposo their own method of getting tho traffic from Hawthorn to Spencer-street, Tbo Goulburn Volley R til way Bill waa poseed by the Assembly, un amendment to substituto the western íoulo for the eastern being negatived b} 30 votes. The Legislative Council again altered the routo buck to the western Bide. These bills wero returned to the Assembly, and yet remain to be finally dealt with, THl; KODNEY LLECrlON. The election for Rodney, which was decided on November 2. occasioned general interest, not only in the district itself, but in Mel. bourne, where the result was anxiously awaited. Political attention bud boon con centiated on this contest owing to the peculiar nature of tbo precedent circum- stances. The close struggle between Messrs'. Gillies nnd Shackell at the genoral election, when the former won tho BOCondBoatby a majority of 19 only, the petition on tho gronnd of undue influence, the extraordinary decision of the Elections Committee, de- claring the Bitting member innocent of all tbe charges brought against him, yet ousting bim from his seat, tboefforts mode by the Go- vernment to procuro bia defeat-all served to invest this election with a special interest, opart altogether from that naturally at- taching to one in which a politician who had occupied for years a prominent position in the arena of politics wos concerned. Messrs. Gillies and Shackell were left to fight ont the battle between thomselvcs, but the contest between them was not so close ob was anticipated. Mr. GHHob was returned by a majority of 122 votes. The Govern- ment havo not borne tbair defeat in this matter with equanimity. In the House one of their supporters, Mr. Gaunson, brought forward a motion of conBuro on Mr. Gillies for the manner in which he, ob Minister of Lande, bad dealt with certain applications for land by a Bquntter named M'Arthar. Mr. Gillies showed that the conditions of the law bad been complied with, and the motion was withdrawn by the advice of the Chief Secre- tary, who, however, has Bince intimated his intention of appointing a board to inquire into the recent administration of the Linds department. THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION:. A large proportion of the goods intonded for the Paris Exhibition hove been Bhippid from Melbourne to London. There has bo su no local display, and the selected articles, as tbey have come in, havo been packed np and sent away. The exhibits on account of which space has been applied for will take up moro groand than was oocupled at Phila- delphia, whoro Victoria obtained the use of a tbitd or a fourth of tbe floor appropriated to the colonies of Australia and New Zealand. Most of the goods-the produce of the ran, the farm, the mine, and the vineyard, and manufactured articles of'the towns-will be shown in tho name of tho growers or the makers. The local commissioners decided, as an inducement to private persons to famish exhibits at their own expense, that all goods tbey thomsolves wero obliged to buy should bo shown in tho nomo of the commissioners. There will bo four large trophies to do justico to tbe principal industries of the country trophies of wool, wine, grain, and gold. Some obeofs of next autumn's corn will bo shipped in February or March by the mail steamer, so as to make known both the robustness of the straw and tho heavy weight of the grain whioh the agricultural districts of the colony produce. Tho Hon. J. J. Cosey, M.L.A., who has been appointed special commissioner-with Mr, G.
