The ships Lightning and Owen Glendower, in particular, looked exceedingly well, having dressed ship in man-of-war style. The several races were well contested, and the arrangements of the regatta were well carried out by the sailing com- mittee, who were stationed on board H.M. yacht Lœlia, moored off the Railway Pier, Sandridge, for that pur- pose. The Lightning, which was the flagship, was visited by hundreds of people during the day. The schooner Melbourne, which arrived late on Friday night, landed in safety about 30 tons of Government stores at Parker River, for the use of the staff at Cape Otway Lighthouse and the Telegraph Department stationed there. The Result, of the Blackwall Line, was towed to sea on Saturday evening by the steamer Sophia. Captain Woods, of the Black Swan, reports having sighted the steamship Royal Shepherd on the 4th inst., at 7.30 p.m., 10 miles S.E of Cape Schank. The Marion arrived in Hobson's Bay during the night of the 4th inst. Captain Flemming reports having encountered head winds on this coast ; also that the Express (schooner) left Colombo for this port 12 days previous to him. Captain Godt, of the Canton, reports having expe- rienced a calm of 27 consecutive days in the China Sea. He passed through the Straits of Sunda on the 4th ult., and has since then had fine weather. Captain Burge, of the Sunbeam, reports having been in company with the Antagonist, from Foo- Chow-Foo for Melbourne, while passing through the Straits of Sunda. The Dorothy Jobson arrived in Hobson's Bay early on Saturday morning last. Captain Young reports that he was becalmed and had head baffling winds for 10 days in long. 90 E., lat. 32deg to 38deg. S. Captain James, of the Salcombe Castle, reports the following vessels lying in Auckland when he left :— H.M. steamer Iris, Kate, and Constance. In Bay of Islands :—Young Hector, whaler, with 300 barrels oil, and two others, names unknown ; also, that the barque Rosetta, from China for Monte Video, had put in here, and left on the 18th ult. The Havilah left Adelaide on Thursday, 3rd inst., at 5 p.m., and reports having experienced head winds with heavy head swell during the passage. She arrived in Hobson's Bay on Sunday, at 8 p.m. THE EAGLE SPEED.—In the report of the cargo of the Eagle Speed it is stated that 14,182 boards, 1 malt-bin, 100 barrels, 333 boxes, 24 cases, 200 quarter- barrels gunpowder, are consigned to Messrs. Dickson, Wil- liams, and Co. ; whereas they are really to the con- signment of Messrs. Sichel and Co. BURNING OF THE MISSIONARY.—The barque Mission- ary, 217 tons, William Simpson, commander, which sailed from Hobart Town on 18th inst., for Melbourne, with a cargo of timber, was destroyed by fire on Christmas day, when about 30 miles to the N.W. of Hummock Island. It appears that about 1 o'clock in the morning the man at the wheel called out to the captain that there was a smell of fire. The captain imme- diately went into the cabin, and found smoke coming from the sail-room or steerage. Lifting up the small scuttle he discovered that the ship was on fire. All hands were called, and commenced throwing bucketsful of water on the flames, but could not suc- ceed in extinguishing them. The captain, finding that it was impossible to subdue the fire, ordered some of the hands to get out the long-boat, whilst the rest of the crew continued to throw water on to the burning mass. Being fully convinced after some time that there was no chance of saving the ship, a bag of biscuit and a barrel of water, which were all the pro- visions that could be got at, the cabin by this time being enveloped in flames, were put into the boat, and the crew then left the ship. This had scarcely been effected when the mizenmast went over. There was a very strong breeze blowing from the N.N.E., and a rough sea on at the time, which caused the ship to go rapidly before the wind. The crew having hoisted a sail, followed her till daylight, when they made for Hummock Island, which was reached at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Slept on the island all night, starting next morning at 11, and got to Goose Island at 6 in the evening. At this place they were very kindly received by. Mr. Scott, who is in charge of the lighthouse, and by Mrs. Davies, who did everything in their power to assist the unfortunate crew, who sailed away on Friday at midnight, and entered Tamar Heads at 7 o'clock on Saturday night, and arrived in town on Sunday after noon. The actual origin of the fire is not known, but it is supposed that a sailor, who was the only person who slept in the steerage, having to get on deck to watch from 12 to 4 o'clock in the morning, had lit his lamp, and, either from carelessness in extinguishing the match, or from the unsafe way in which he might have left the lamp, some articles had taken fire. We understand that the vessel is insured for £1,600, but she is worth £2,500. It is not known at present whether the cargo is insured.—Launceston Examiner, Jan. 1. THE WHALERS.—From our (New Zealander's) Russell correspondent we have the following notice of arrivals :—December 8.—Joshua Bragdon, barque, 270 tons, Bates, New Bedford, 38 months out, with 900 barrels sperm ; put in to refit for home. Captain Bates reports, September 1.—George, ship, 280 tons, Silva, New Bedford, 800 barrels sperm, 900 barrels whale. October 22.—Japan, ship, 487 tons, Grant, New Bedford, 1,000 barrels sperm. The Liverpool barque Rosetta, Captain Kreeft, was to sail, weather permitting, the first opportunity. GERMAN IMMIGRATION.—Much, from time to time, has been said and speculated relative to immigration from Germany to New Zealand. We understand it is likely speedily to become an accomplished fact. At all events, Mr. Futachler has received advice that the barque Elizabeth was loading at Hamburg for Auck- land and Wellington, and would sail in all November. The class and character of immigrants from Holstein, Hanover, Brunswick, and the banks of the Elbe, will bear comparison with any in the world.—New Zea- lander, Dec. 22. THE FASTEST STEAMER AFLOAT.—The maximum speed on railways, with a due regard to public safety, seems to have been attained, and, whether with broad or narrow gauge, 40 miles an hour seems to be about the mark; not so, however, with steamers, which have been gradually creeping up in speed, from 8 to 10 knots, which was at one time considered a good average, to 12 and 14 knots. The Great Eastern was expected to make the next stride in speed, but she disappointed public expectation, and it has been reserved for the City of Dublin Company to accomplish this new feat with their splendid boats between Dublin and Holyhead, which are now in full operation, making the passage under three and a half hours average, and it has been done by them in three hours fourteen minutes. On Thursday last the Connaught took her trial trip at Southampton, which entitles her to the proud distinction of being the fastest steamer afloat, having made the mean run over the measured mile of 21 statute miles per hour, exceeding the speed of the London-built boat Leinster by half a knot per hour, with one revolution less of the engines.— Liverpool Albion, Oct. 1.
