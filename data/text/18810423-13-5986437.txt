SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. ANALYTICAL SUMMARY. Ministers have not been able to pro- rogue Parliament, as was intended, before the Easter holidays, but have merely adjourned the Houses until the 3rd May. The prolongation of the session is, to some extent, due to the action of the conference committees of the two Houses on the Reform Bill. The committees did not arrive at any terms, but the final pro- posals on each side leave comparatively little to be briged over, and conse- quently an appeal from the committees to Parliament was deemed advisable. The conference committees sat on the 11th and 12fh inst. After discussion of the proposed franchise, Sir Charles Sladen intimated that the Council's representatives were unanimous in offer- ing to take a £10 ratepaying qualifi- cation for owners and a £25 qualification for occupiers, the existing arrangements with regard to plural voting to be maintained. Mr. Berry, on behalf of the Assembly, offered to accept a £10 rating franchise for owners and occupiers alike. Both parties expressed their sur- prise, the one at the ultimatum of the other, and vice versa. The Assembly's representatives urged that the Service bill had proposed a £10 and £20 qualifi- cation, and that the country had rejected even that in favour of the ratepayers' roll. The Council committee replied that the Service bill did not bind the Upper House —that the majority against that measure was against the elimination clause, and that in descending from a £50 franchise to a £10 owner and £25 occupier franchise the Council is making an enormous concession. The Assembly, it was urged, should be glad to travel so far at one stride in the diroction it re- quires. Sir Charles Sladen declared that it was monstrous to expect the Council to descend from a £50 franchise to an all round £10 franchise at a jump. No one could foresee the consequence of such a change, and if it was disastrous, then there would be no going back. Further argument did not alter the position, though Dr. Hearn made the remark that if the Assembly would accept proportional representation, the Council would come down to the £10 franchise. It was agreed that as no understanding could be arrived at with regard to the fran- chise, the conference must be abandoned, but Mr. Berry added that he would adjourn the Assembly over the Easter holidays, and this would give the Council an opportunity of amending the Govern- ment bill and sending then proposition down to the Lower House. The result was mentioned in both Houses. In the assembly Mr. Murray Smith and Mr. Wrixon expressed the opinion that the Councils offer should not be lightly set aside. There was a feeling in the Council that the Assembly ought to proceed with the measure sent down by the Upper House, and place its last proposals in that bill, but the proba- bility is that hon. members will consent to the adoption of the Government sug- gestion, and will return the Ministerial measure with amendments to the Lower House. The difference between the Council and the Ministry is very much narrowed down by the conference proceedings. The Council has at present 32,000 voters. The new franchise proposed by the Council would give 108,000 voters, extending the franchise to 76,000 new men. The final proposition of the Assembly would extend the franchise to 142,000 electors, giving the franchise to 110,000 new men. There is a difference of 34,000 voters in the two propositions. Both Houses have agreed to a £10 rating qualification for owners. The difference is that the Council requires a £25 rating for occupiers, and the As- sembly wants a £10 rating qualification. The Legislative Assembly on a manhood suffrage roll has 200,000 voters. The extent of the alteration to which the Council has consented will be seen on reference to the following comparative statement :— Tim PROrcPD Couscn £10 ratepayiuc, Iran lilac for f rcoholdors Sfb ratepaytiig fran lilac for occupiers Fourteen provinces 1 orty two members £lo0 freehold qualification for members Tho business taken m the Council before tho Easter adjournment waa not important in charactoi The second read ing oí tho Land Tix Act Amendment Bill was postponed In the Assembly, nupplfmentary estimates amounting to £148 000 wero brought down, but tho bulk of them have not as yet been voted The lont, postponed debato on tho voto for the endowment of municipalities has taken place Tho Government proposi- tion was that £100,000 Bhould be voted for the half yeal as the first instalment of a reduced grant of £200,000 per annum, instead of tho £310,000 formerly granted Mr Barr moved as an amendmont that the subsidy bo restored to tho old rato, and granted on the old basis, with the : exception of additional grants to newly foraicd shires m tho remote distnota The discussion was proceeding at length, vihen Mr Berry roso and Bald that, find iirig that tho feeling of the Houso was against him, and recognising its right to control finance, ho would accept tho amendment A short financial statement was made by the Treasurer m the Assembly, April 12 &ir; John O fchauassy asked how it was proposed to make up the £148,000 aew estimates and the additional voto of »65,000 to the municipalities Mr Bony lephed that the revenue for the yoai will Probably equal his original anticipations «anticipates a good quartoi from the Jaoibition, aa the duties on the articles which have been purchaaed will now be pa As to tho additional exponditme, ne hopes that the savmga and tho un- expended votes will give him funds for Um purposo If not, then ho will hato to fltaw on the fund which should be 2 a?ks t0 radmvy Pur luíi?dls I »a 8 T ' n Uut tbo rabblt nuisance UPwnnmaUu- \ m,lUy la a question of &" iíy' und ,hould ba dealt with «wag«io present session, Mr Vale ex W,7, ?* ?TCilT «'at the rabbit pest gesagter itcd an Uhu, the real danger K./01 at0rrm Mr Val° »".ya feLd , aYryefow labb"s when ho Ki^ví'fnct e H,s bohe£ » that »AS l Ine,etuiga have been sot SfcUlg >nb<»dM»te., instructed ttiud Zms°V! in, Melb°<"T This ^ statement-characteristic of the STtWM " »r CUl0d m tho House' tóeat Ätay Was only saTd from 8SLb y tho caatlnS «to of tho TlPPlUiiFUCOtAClt. £60 ratfpi>ln(, fran lilac lor Iretholilers JCoO ratepajlojj franchiso for occuj lera Bil pro incea Thirty m mbcrs £250 ircchold qualification for n embers ÄerÄti0boardaPPwntod t0 Kon vii Chare°8 Preferred by Mr B P Wl mg «"»nattée, against Mr «¡hook lY wspoctor of industrial 'Äed' J^ Pre3entod Mr Neal »3 ssedX0fVpy ?°Unt> aud surPrlS0 k£l, thal Pr°feasor Pearson and AT* "houWhave cast impula mSL", Publc offioer when they ^M «ntaoe to justify the Am } m bellßTa that Mrf Neal SOCIAL AND GENKRAL His Excellency the Governor, who boa boen Buffering from an attack of fever and ague, has now almost fully regained his health The Earl and Countess of Ellesmere left for England by tbe b b.

Superintendent Hare is awarded £800 ; Mr. T. Curnow, the schoolmaster, who gave the alarm to the train, £550 ; Senior- constable Kelly, £377 ; Sergeant Steele, £290 ; Superinten- dent Sadleir, £240 ; Mr. O'Connor (in command of the trackers), £237 ; Jesse Dowsett the railway guard, who assisted to capture Edward Kelly, £175. The constables present receive from £115 to £42. "Hero," "Spider" and the other black trackers are allotted £50 each, to be handed to the Governments of Queensland and Victoria to be spent at their discretion. The drivers and guards of the pilot engine and the special train receive sums from £104 downwards. The board mentions that the representatives of the press pre- sent deserve the thanks of the community for the able assistance they rendered to the police under circumstances of considerable danger, and had they put in claims these gentlemen would have been fairly entitled to participate in the reward. The only person not directly connected with the capture who is rewarded is Detective Ward, for his em- ployment of Aaron Sherritt. No informa- tion leading directly to the result was, it is said, received except from this man, and for his connexion with Sherritt Detective Ward receives £100. The board consisted of Mr. Murray Smith, M.L.A., Sir Charles Mac- Mahon, M.L.A., and the Hon. J. MacBain M.L.C. Mr. Curnow considers that he has not been justly treated and he has appealed to the Chief Secretary against the finding of the board.

nas held three Bluings and examined one or two new wit neeees during the past fortnight Mr A Myatt police magistrate m the North Eastern district, was called on the 12th mat, and gave a great deal of evidence with regard to some of the circumstances connected with the pursuit and capture of the gang "Much of his evidence had reference to the many and great difficulties under which the police laboured, and gave them credit for doing their utmost under the circumstances Mr Myatt thought that all that could pos Bibly be done to capture the outlaws was done After his experience he thought, and indeed had repeatedly expressed the opinion that the KellyB would never be caught by mere pursuit as all circumstances were m their favour and there were many chances by which they could escape J? rom his personal know ledge he waa satisfied that there was not the slightest unwillingness on the part of the police-therewoa on the contrary aneagernesj -to continue the pursuit He thought the Kell} a would never be caught by continuous pursuit because their friends and associates were bo numerous lie knew of 77 rela tives of the gang some of whom were m Mansfield, others somewhere in New South Viales and others at Wallan Kilmore Kjneton and elsewhere Mr Wyatt also expressed the opinion that the system of trying to hunt down the outlaws would not succeed It might do m the pursuit of one man but in thisdiatnct thecircumatances were peculiar and it waa best to quietly surround and take men posaoasing such exceptional advantages auch special sympathy and as aistance and such large means na these men had Mr \Y yatt knew the place where and circumstances under which Morgan waa cap tured He heard that Morgan said that lie would Boonergive himself up than be pursued aa ho waa by the police But he was aBingle m an not a large well armed well provided party Therefore tho hunting down might answer with him, and yet fail in the case of a party The residents of the district generally, Mr M yatt helieved were ready to aid the police Be felt assured that the police were acting m a verj efficient and admirable manner throughout and every one appeared to be imbued with the desire to do his duty Mr Wjatt gave most credit for the ultimate capture to Mr ISicolaon the acting chief commissioner whoae plan of procedure while m the district was. in Mr Wyatt a opinion bo Bure to succeed that he (Mr Wyatt) re farded the capture as only a matter of time le anticipated that It would take place at about the time when it did and thought it a fortunate accident for Mr Hare that he waa present at the time when the anticipated re suit of Mr Nicoleon a scheme occurred in the capture of the gang Superintendent Sadleir was also examined He gave an m teresting narrativo of the capture of the I.ang and notably of the tragic éventa at Glenrow an He dwelt upon the remarkable criminal proclivities of the relatives and sympathisers of the Kellya and took by no means a hopeful view of the district m which they have committed their outrages He regarded the condition of the district indeed as critical and feared the recurrence of Borne Berious outbreak at no very distant date The committee has

amongst the sandhills andBcrub about Portsea and Sorrento Good Friday their firatday, waa occupied with their vojage down (which waa accomplished in two steamera) and with battalion drill On the Saturday they had field exercise in driving an imaginary enemy from the Quarantine grounds to Sorrento On Monday the force was divided into two battalions and a sham fight took place at Portsea They returned on the evening of Monday to Melbourne well pleasod with their outing This is the first occasion on which so large an undertaking of the kind has been carried through by voluu teer officers without the assistance of the head quarters staff Advantage was also taken of the Easter hohdayB to give the Naval Reserve Borne practice on board ship They embarked on board the Nelson on Good Tnday and cruised about in Port Phillip Bay for four daja The men were exercised m working the ship under canvas and they had a good deal of shot and abell practice with the big guns AGRICULTURE The rainfall, long and anxiously looked for by all classes in the country districts, haa only in rare instances been equal to require monte Tho equinoctial rama consisted onlj of thunder showers which wero as partial aa auch rams proverbially are Heavy down pours occurred over strips of country, leaving the land a mile away on either Bide, as dry as ever In the great wheat growing areas in the north west this condition of things has led to the publication of reports which are unintelligible to readers unacquainted with the topography of that country In some cases, where wheat sowing was early com menced, light rams cauaed the Beed to gerrin nate, but more rains are wanted to establish the young crops, which, in certain instances are Bald to be perishing Re sowing ia being talked of in several parts, but as the weather is becoming cooler there is ground for hoping that the young wheats may be able to hold their own until ram falls m quantity It is however, impossible not to regard the passing away of the season at which equinoctial rams should have occurred without feeling seriously anxious for the crops Experience has established that in the majority of years the early Bown wheats alone can be depended upon m the principal grain producing die tncts The sowing season in these dia tricta will close during the month of May, and the progress already made in the work baa been comparatively trilling, so that the time at disposal for completing the sowing will bo quite limited enough in proportion to the work to be done In the cooler and later districts, the sowing season often extends far into July, although June is the month preferred The rabbit peBt bas become a burning topic with farmers in the country adjacent to the mallee ecrub These animals are fast in vading some of the boat wheat areas m the north'weatern district, and although an act for the suppression of rabbits has been passed, no concerted action ia being taken to carry out ita provisions Poisoning b/ moana of phospborieedoata, areeniaod carrots and bran, and by resort to other measures, ia being Sursued with fair success in detached dm neta, but the Government ia not doing ita legitimate put in this matter, and aa long aa rabbit« are bred on Crown lands, the best effort« of farmers will bo neutralised ; their landa will be re- occupied by fresh bordea of Tabbita almost aa Boon as it has been cleared. THE WEATHER. At the beginning of the paet fortnight it was use, cool, and pleasant, bat on the 13th became boisterous and very cold, with heavy westerly aqualla and rain Bhowers, and at Cape Otway a very high sea; the rain ehowera extended along the coast and the greater part of the inland districts, bnt did not reach aa far aa tho Riverine district. During the second week it was very fine and clear and very warm, the average temperature at Melbourne being as high as Of dei?, while with the westerly gale m the previous week it was aa low aa 48deg.

The brieknesa noticed m the principal trades last moil still continues, and, generally speaking, the labour market is in a very healthy condition. The boot factories are not quite bo buey as they have been for some time past, but the alacltneBB is believed to be only temporary. Ordinary labouring men continue to find ample employment in the country, and with tho work on the now lines of railway it ia not likely we shall have many unemployed besieging the Government offices for work this winter. There is ample em- ployment for nny number of men in the colony, but the fluctuations in the rates for ordinary labour prevent many capitalists from undertaking large operations The Biiccess of bo many mining ventures in the Ballarat and Sandhurst districts has had the effect of atimulating mining enterprises all over the country, and consequently miners are fully employed The large increase of visitors to Melbourne to visit the Exhibition lins created a great demand for house BorvaatB. w}jo have been receiving full rateB Ï he following are the rates of wages - Domestic Servants-For Town-General Borvants £S0 to iib per annum, housemaids, £30 to £35 per annum, female cooks, from £35 to £60 per annum, malo cooks, from 30a to 80s per week, nursemaids, £25 lo £"0 per annum, laundresses, £30 per annum For Hotels-Cooks malo and female, £50 to £80 per annum , houBcmalds, £30 to £35 do Tor Stations First-class married couples lor home stations, £70 to £00 per annum, second class do, with eblldren, £10 to £50 per do , cooks, £15 to £65 per do , housemaids, £35 to £10 per do For Farms-Men cookB, £50 per annum, married couples, £00 to £70 per do , women servants, £30 to £35 per do , farming men, 20s per week , milkmen, 20s per do , ploughmen, about 20s per do VA alters for hotels, 25s to 35s per week , grocers assistants, 15s to 30s do , general store do , 20a to 40a do , nursery governesses, £30 to £40 per annum, finishing do , £00 to £80 do Station Hands -Stockmen receive from £C0 to £75 per annum, shepherds, 15s to 20s per week, ordl nary woiklni, men, 15s to 20s per do , drovers, 25s to 40s per du , gardeners, 16s to 25s per do Building Trades-Stonemasons, 10s per day, plasterers, bricklajers, slators, los per do , car I enters, 10s per do , labourers, 7s per do , pick and shovel men, 0a 6d per do The da) s work is eight hours Bootmakers -Thcfollovvlngaro the nominal rates -For making childrens peg boots the rate is Cd per pair, bo}8 lOd , womens, Is , and mens, Is 3d , the same rates are paid for finishing In some of the beat order shops tho rates paid aro -Wellingtons, 10s , claetics, 7s (k1 , closing.
