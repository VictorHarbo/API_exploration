Speaking of one EODg alcne, ' Marble Halls,' by Miss Annii Montague, the Sydney Homing Herald, September 10, says : — ' It is customary with many musical connoisseurs to ridicule Balfe and despise English opera. Wo have, however, amongst ns a lady whose performances in many operas have attested her ability, and who, In a ballad from the ' Bohemian Girl,' carries her hearers far and away beyond the routine of this everyday life. True, 'Marble Halls' has been ground on every barrpl organ inallpossibleplaces.butfuvenaswe heard it last night it comes fresh from the land of melody, and puts us mentally so completely in ttwrealnrof fancy that we come back with a shock as the applause demands a repetition. Utterly free from ornament, Miss Montague wisely sings the air as if herself still nnder the influence of the charming vision. The poetry of lifo is pictured in the words, the poetry of sound is reached In their utterances, the voice is managed with consummate skill, and yet with such an absence of effort that the melodious tones come forth like the clear rippUng -waters from a crystal fountain, brightening and gladdening all around. Musically, it Is a triumph ; but it is much more in an ideal sense, and if Miss Montague were judged by this ballad alone she proves herself au exceptional artist, and she makes all who hear her debtors for a season of real delight.'
