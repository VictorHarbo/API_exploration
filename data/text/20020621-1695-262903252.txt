French lessons WITH due respect to immaculately credentialled French diplomats everywhere, but especially in the UK, France’s World Cup soccer team played like one from le proverbial “shitty little country” [a French envoy to London recently referred to Israel in those terms]. Instead of the team flying straight back to France, it would have been better to recuperate in Israel, where Le Frenchman could find all his needs met. Israeli cafes make the finest coffee, breads and pastries of all types (skip Danish ones because of the 2-0 loss to Denmark), and opinionated conversation freely flows. Self-reflection and soul-searching may follow, leading one to think that little countries like Senegal, Denmark, Uruguay or even Israel can have an important place in the scheme of things. Visits to centres of learning and yeshivot could enhance this experi ence and have a profoundly beneficial lasting effect on one’s psyche. Also, “little” does not necessarily mean “shitty”. For instance, Napoleon, who looms large in the French imagination, was of small stature. Though small geographically, Israel has absorbed its own size in immigrants and more. Recent Jewish immigrants from troubled places are always arriving. Don’t be alarmed — the Spanish speaking Latin American immigrants are from Argentina, not Uruguay (0-0 in the soccer), and those with French accents couldn’t be leaving troubles in France, could they? Finally, Israel could facilitate France’s soccer rehabilitation via a match at Ram at Gan Stadium (FIFA permitting). To ensure France finally score a goal, France will play the Ashdod Under-8 side. If the match is producing more embarrassment, an Israeli hi-tech industry has designed a goal that widens or narrows. If all else fails, the referee could award penalties as required. In the land of miracles anything is possible; just keep an open mind, with all due respect of course. David Gross Melbourne, Vic
