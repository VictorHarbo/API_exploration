COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Saturday Evening. Export entries were passed at the Customs today for 16,798 ounces of gold, the whole of which, with the exception of four ounces, was for shipment in the Roxburgh Castle, for London. The total taken by that vessel, which cleared out this afternoon, amounted to 50,267 ounces, shipped as follows:-By the Lon- don Chartered Bank, 18,000 ounces ; Bank of New South Wales, 10,000 ozs. ; Bank . of Australasia, 9,347 ozs.; Bank of Victor!t, 8,317 ozs.? Union Bank, 1,625 oza. ; Neuhauss and Co., 461 ozs.; Williams and Co., 337ozs.; N. Buth, 273 ozs. ; N. and J. Job, 261 ozs.; B. Bute, 234 ozs. ; H. Hartsnung, 168 ozs. ; Isaacs Brothers, 136ozs.; J. Schultz, 122ozs. ; O. V. Mansford, 115 ozs.; H. Andrews, 112 czB. ; White and Co., 100 OZB. ; sundry small shippers, 653 ozs. There has been more activity in the Goll Maiket, hut shippers are still disposed to hang back until after the arrival of the EagliBtt mail. Prices range at present at £3 14s. 6d. to £3 14s. Od. for Castlemaine and Sandhurst ; £3 14a. Od. to £3 16s. for Mount Korong; £i 15s. 6d- for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Cieek, and Avoca ; £3 15s. to £3 lös- 9d. for Ararat and Pleasant Creek ; £3 16s. to £S 17s. for the Ovens; and £3 17s. 6d. to £3 17s, 9i. for Ballaarat. ' Although the Escorts are again under the average, they begin to show signs of improve- ment. The weather since our last report has been everything that could be desired for the great majority of the miners. Wherever the rains have fallen increased activity is the order of the day, and this will soon produce a marked effect on the returns. In the fol- lowing list the fortnightly escorts are dis- tinguished from the weekly by an asterisk prefixed to the names of the gold-fields. In the second column the quantities are given for the corresponding week of 1857. The chief decrease exhibited in this comparison is from Beechworth and the Maryborough district. The escorts from the latter are improving every week. Beechworth contributed a settled unfluctuating quantity of about 15,000 ozs. fortnightly during the whole of last year, and the sudden falling-off which has taken place this year is the more marked :— 1858\. 1857. ozs. dts. ozs. dts.

The recent stoppage in those branches of gold-fields industry which depend upon the supply of water has been of so serious a nature to the mining population that atten- tion has become fairly aroused to the necessity of providing against future inconvenience and loss from drought. An aqueduct from the Coliban to the centre of Forest Creek has been projected, the country surveyed, and the practicability of the undertaking ascer- tained. It is estimated that a first cost of £50,000 would enable puddlers, sluicers, and diggers to carry on mining operations in a more efficient manner than can be the case with the pre- sent limited supply of water. The inhabi- tants of Bendigo are turning their eyes to- wards the extent of mountainous country which surrounds that district with the like object. The Bendigo Advertiser says :—" A very considerable extent of mountainous country exists in the vicinity of this gold- field, most of it, too, at a high elevation. The chief portion of the range consists of granite formation, abounds in springs, and furnishes the source of a number of creeks of greator or less importance. Are we quite satisfied that in this country there does not exist any area of watershed, or place capable of being formed by artificial means into an extensive gathering ground? If we are not, why do we not take means of satisfying our- selves on a subject of such interest?" These are practical movements, and such as are best calculated to put an end to the cry that the gold- fields of Victoria are declining. With associated enterprise in labor and capital, the older gold-fields will keep up their yield for a long time to come, while those that are new now will be ready for similar undertakings when the first miners have taken out all they can by their individual exertions. There has not been much else stirring in mining matters this week. At Pleasant Creek the eyes of the miners are still turned towards the advanced parties prospecting round the Gram- pians and the Victoria Ranges, in which di- rections this field appears to be spreading. Ararat has been dull. The works are steadily progressing on the several deep leads at Bal- laarat, Carngham is almost deserted, but at the deep lead at Preston's there is more ac- tivity. At Bendigo, the most noticeable feature is the small quantity of quartz gold that is now being produced,—a fact that calls for explanation. The Mary- borough district has had the usual num- ber of small rushes. At Tarrengower the ground about Hunter's Sawpit, recently opened, is still attracting and retaining a nu- merous population. The Goulburn miners are now washing out, after having been at a standstill for want of water. We have heard of little doing In the Ovens district. The Buckland quartz-reefs are proved to be extensive, but not very rich, and it is thought that they will not repay at present for the ex- pense of the transport of machinery so long a distance over a rough country. One thousand five hundred and sixty-four immigrants have landed at Melbourne during the week, consisting of 1,307 from the United Kingdom, 30 from the United States, 3 from Mauritius, and 224 from the Australian colonies. The number of departures is com- puted at 210. The net addition, by the sea- board, to the population during the current year, up to this day, has been 8,063. Arrived. Departed.

Indeed the week has been one of comparative stagnation in nearly every branch of business, arising from the indisposition of capitalists to operate, while a mail bearing news of so important a kind as that expected by the City of Sydney or Victoria is due and hourly looked for. In order to afford a comparison of the banking business of the colony at the close of 1867 with its prede- cessor, we append a tabular statement of the aggregate averages of the eight banks carrying on business within the colony for the fourth quarters of those two years. In this table all the items refer to the actual business of the colony except the last four. The paid up-capital, amount of dividend and of reserved profits, and the rate of dividend, relate in each case to the institution as a whole :— BANK OF AUSTRALASIA. 4th Quar- 4th Quar- ter, 1850. tor, 1857.

Thoconstant expectation of the arrival of the Overland Mall.produces tho usuol offjot in chocking business transactions, whilst tho onor mouB arrivals of goods during the past wook, amount- ing to noarly 15,000 tons, havo had a doprosslng tendonoy. Tho lato heavy raine havo Induced team- sters to ask an advance in rates of cartago. Tlioro is a woll- supportod demand for many articles of gonoral uso for tho diggings, which would havo an effect on tho stocks of goods in first hands in tho ovont of supplies decreasing ; but, whilst shipmonts continuo to pour in as horotoforo thora can bo no hopo whatoyor of any improvomont. Liquors.-Beers remain without chango, and price* nearly nominal, small sales only having boen offootod at tboso ratos. .Bottled boors of good brands aro dull. Tho domnnd is very trifling, and sales to any oxtont havo to bo made at lower prlcos than those quoted. Spirits havo mot willi but littlo Inquiry, and tho amount of transactions Ima boon vory trilling. Brandlos of bost brands of gonuiuo warranty cannot be quoted over 16s. por gallon, and othor Burts In pro- portion. Bum, gin, and whiskey ovinco no improvo- mont in domand, and pricoi aro almost nominal, Gonova has been in Bomewhat moro request, Wlno3 aro quito nogleoted, and notwithstanding tho low ratos at willoh really good sorts aro offering, thoro oppoars no disposition to purchase to any oxtont.

Tlio "quantity of Tasmanian flourln tho markot is oftoo light an amount at prosont to afl'oct markets. Amorlcan barrel flour has boon within tho last tew days pressed on the market, and a salo of 3,000 barrels Gallego is reported to-day at 83s. Od. per barrol. Wheat continuos In light Inquiry ; OB yet no quantities of any consideration aro offorltig, and however desirous tntllors may bo of pur- chasing, thoy hold off for tho prosont. Oats havo again declined in price : arrivals havo been oxcossivo. By auction largo sales of Californian havo boon made at 5s. lOd, por bushol. Scotch and Iilsh can ho bought at 6s., whilst Danish and Russian I can bo bought under that prlco. Tho parcol ox Minister Tltorbeckc sold by auction at 4s, lid. por I bushel. Now oats, of colonial (Victorian) growth ara In tho market, but as yet tho quantity offering Is sruill, and tho prices asked too high to bo a 'guidanoo for markot prices.

Bran has mot with stoady domand, and clean sweet pnrools of lato arrival havo found buyers at 2s. 8d. por bushel. Gram continues to sell steadily at 102.10s. to 112. por ton., at which prlcos stocks aro moving aft into consumption.

Oilmen's Storos. -The accumulated stock of those articles had begun to diminish, and an improvomont in prices was looked for, Tho supplies, howovor, ar- rived by lato vessols from England aro hoavy, and prlcos will mainly depend on tho way in which goods aro offered for sale. Groceries.-Teas continuo saleable, and prlcos of bettor descriptions arc unchanged : salos by auction of inferior toas havo boen modo during tho wook at lowor ratos. Cofl'oos aro unobangod.tn prico, and lu tho absonco of arrivals unllkoly to vary. Rico-In spite of all attempts to ruBh this article Into speculation, prlcos romain unchanged. Tho de- mand for Patna kind is good and steady at about 192. per ton. london screened Patna, in barrels, has boon sold during the woek at 212. 10s. per ton. Sugars hovo fluctuated considerably Invaluo during tho wook, and in tho absonco of largo Bales it is somowhatdllEoult to afford correct quotations ; the pricos realised have, howovor, boon lowor than previous ruling ratos, moro particularly for lower qualities, tho domand for which sorts has boon but light.
