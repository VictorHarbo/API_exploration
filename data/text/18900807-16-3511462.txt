PARLIAMENT. WEDNESDAY, AUGUST G. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. The President took the chair at 4 p.m. MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT. Mr MORETON moved the adjournment of the House, and said be had conciseness that morning, a statement that on an amendment in the Victorian Legislative Assembly being now d, to the effect that the Estimates be referred back to the Colonial Treasury for further consideration, the proceedings in the Legislative Council I see stopped That carried out what they contended on Tuesday, that no business should go on while in another place a vote of want of confidence was hanging over the Government. There was only the difference between the cases that the House in Victoria was elective but they were therefore more in touch with the people. He mentioned the matter to show that They were right in what they had done on the previous day Mr MACDONALD PATERSON also referred to the matter, and said he was ashamed of the division which had taken place on the previous day it second a parody on what had had to place yesterday that on that morning they had a telegram as mentioned by Mr Motton Rofe fence had been made as to the matters on the business paper not being put matters was the matter in Victoria a party matter } Whatever the character of the business and it should have been suspended as soon as the Leader of the Government in that Chamber knew that a want of confidence vote was un In consideration elsewhere. It was not a matter as to the nil run out the business 01 party, but one of principle of vital principle in the conduct of business in the Chamber It had been and they were not dependent on other Pnilnin fits for precedents His reply to that was that it was simply no sense He trusted the ibv,bioii}csteidii} would be taken as a working protest After remarks is our Mr Heussler, Mr THYNNE said the motion for adjournment was really an endeavour to keep all the conclusion which the House came to yesterday a conclusion which be believed was a correct one in principle and practice It was an extraordinary thing if that was to be quoted as a constitutional rule that neither of the hon gentlemen who had spoken were able to show any rule on the subject. He was not aware, as he stated yesterday) that it was a correct thing wherever circumstances such as those here arose that business should be suspended He was not aware of what the exact posi- tion of business was in Victoria in the Legislative Assembly Under eel tam circumstances it would be his duty to ask the House to adjourn, but he did not think those circumstances had arisen as hon. gentleman in a few days would learn He thought it was rather early to announce that the Government had forfeited the confidence of Pm liament He contended that it was the dignified and proper course for that House to proceed with business on the paper until it was quite clear that they should discontinue the business Mr MORETON said he had merely brought the matter up not with the idea to continue the discussion, but to show that they had some reason for bringing it up yesterday He withdrew the motion for adjournment FEDERATION RESOLUTIONS Mr. MORETON said that in renewing the debate he was placed at a disadvantage in his mg to follow such able speakers as Mr. Thomas Smith and Mr Brentnall, The question before them was of very great importance, and he thought it right that most of them should say something. It was very satisfactory to know and feel in Queensland that while some speakers in the Southern Parliaments railed at Sir H Parkes, there was nothing of that sort here, but, at the same time, there was no occasion to sing his paeans of praise The matter was now in the range of practical politics On the question of defence, He maintained that in other countries the necessity of defence, 01 after a successful resistance to an enemy, had ltd to federation they had illustra irons in the Souths in Dutch States, Switzerland, and Canada He did not know what "bogey" was frightening them here The only one l. felled to was the Chinese, and he did not think there was much occasion to have tear from that quarter He did not think any one could say what the feeling of the masses was on the subject of fe li action . represent only uren Himkmg turn find gin is much attention to the matter.
