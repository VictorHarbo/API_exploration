COMMERCIAL. Since the publication of our last summary for Europe, there lias been a considerable improve ment in the tone of our markets and in business generally. Tho news by the last mail has restored the feeling of confidence, and has led our mer chants to believe that at length homo shippers have opened their eyes to the fact that both the , demand for goods in this colony and the means or paying for them are limited. Still, however, tho improvement is only of a prospective character'' and it will, require a continuance of advices of. the same kind to bring our markets to anything like a healthy condition. In nearly every, class of' provisions the market has been, and is now, over-' stocked. Many of these articles are being produced ' in the colony to an extent which must necessarily in- ' terfere to a very great degree with importers. This is especially felt in the case of butter, hams,' bacon, anil cheese. Of the former article thero; has for months past been an overstock, and nhortly before the departure of the last; mail a large quantity was resbipped aiul sent back to Euglanil. Since then priccs have slightly improved, but there is now made in .the colony a large quantity of butter, and which, being inatle musmccessBiily lind a mavket. arid: of course docs so lo the exclusion of the imported and inferior article. The same may bs said, in an indirect sense, of checse and hams and bacon. 1 '? The demand for these ;has consideraly slackened, not so much because they are produced here, but' because their place is supplied by other commo dities of a less expensive character. The produce of our gold-fields for the last month is about equal to that of the same period of the year pre ceding. But this fact lias less to do with our real progress and ptosperity than would at first sight appear. It is now proved conclusively thai the number of persons actually engaged in mining is less than in former- years, and thero aro a greater number of persons occupied in industrial1 pursuits, equally, if not more, profitable to tho country than mining. Thero is _ .a very general disposition now to perceive that we have other sources of wealth besides gold, and that the time has arrived when we must turn our' attention to those industrial pursuits 'which have made other countries great and prosperous. We ' are stimulated in this course by tho success of , ~ ™'' California, which from being merely a gold pro ducing country has become, after ten years exist ence, both an agricultural and manufacturing country. The nominally high wages which have, ruled in this colony have, no doubt, impeded our progress in these respects, but with a general re duction in tlio cost of the necessaries of life,' fixity of habits, and more continuous employ ment, the working classes would find it to their interest to accept a lower rate of wages. NotwithV standing the statement? to the contrary, we believe' that this is the feeling of the working classes' themselves, and we have no doubt that tho diffi culties of the wages question will receive a prac tical solution by the cheapening of the articles of general consumption.' Al ready tho change is in operation ; the live stock of this and the neighboring colonics have increased to such a degree as render meat cheaper than it has been for many years, and so by increasing the difference in the cost between home-produced and imported provisions, tho consumption of the latter is decreased. Vege tables aro to be had at one-fourth tho price they were obtainable at two years ago, and this agtdn tends to lessen the consumption of imported com modities of a vegetable kind. There is every probability , that within a short time the Austra lian colonies* taken as a whole, will be inde pendent of foreign- *rown supplies. Indications of this' are already apparent. A greater breadth of wheat has been sowii this ycar'in Adelaido than in any former years, and this crop promises to leave nearly oue-third more for exportation than in previous seasons. We have for some time past been receiving large shipments of grain from California, and of late they have come so fast as to cause considerable depression in the flour market. Prices of flour and wheat. in anticipat' on of the harvest are ruling lower than they have for two months past, and there is but little prospect of recovery. The new Land Bill having comc into operation, whether profitably or not, there will next season without doubt be a large quantity of grain produced, and shippers cannot be teo soon made aware of the fact that shipments of grain next year to this market to the same, extent as hitherto must result in low prices and loss both to tne importer aud our' own coloiiial growers. In horse feed of all descriptions there is a good demand. Oats have a tendency to advance, and the stocks of , maize aro worked down very low. In barley there are no transactions and no stocks. Malt has slightly advanced, and several purchases have' been made for holding on speculation. The gram which lias been re introduced into the. market has, after being held for some time, found its market value at '£16 per ton. The following aro the prices which, arc ruling in the grain market Adelaide, £19 per ton; Chilian or Californian, £18 10s. ; United States flour, 41s. per barrel; wheat, Ss. per bushel; colonial oats, Is. 2d. to 4s. 3d. ; maize, 3s. 8d. ; malt, 12s. 6d. par bushel. The market is being supplied with new potatoes, which are realising £11 to £13 per tea. Ales and porter are in brisk sea sonable demand, and numerous sales of Baas'* No. 3 are reparted at £8. The rcoent olearinj; out which tho butter market has had cauiod j-:icn to advance, and sales of new butter in tho cloth littto bssn mads at U.j bstwsjn wHlcH lid. tho price fluctuates. Cheese is in better demand for really prime sorts, and no others are 'saleable. The stocks of sugar are small in first hsindu, and prices are firm nt j nbout— CossiporeNo. 1, £00 ; Mauritius, good to fine counter, £?', 1 to £4;'!. There hiis been a pood deal doing in rice, which is being held for £18 ; silica nt £17 103. are reported. The arrivals of tea for the last week or two have been light, and in anticipation of there being 110 very heavy ship ments to thesa colonies for some time to come prices' have .a tendency 10 advance. Fine congou ia quoted at £11 to £11 10s. the chest. With the exception of brandy, for which there is more, inquiry and a slight advance in prices, thero is no change in tho wine and spirit market, which con tinues dull, and for spirits, with the exception before alluded to, there is not much inquiry. In flooring boards and deals there has been more in quiry, and, 1111, advance in prices. White piao shelving hiis been' bought at £13. The stock? ; of earthenware and ironmongery ' are large, and slow to move off The market is over supplied both ivith bar and rod, aud galvanised corrugatedivon. . . ? .

Capitalists seeking investment are more disposed to.mirchass the stock ot oid and well established companies than to speculate in mining shares. Many of these latter are, however, advancing into the position of permanent and dividend paying com panies. Ar usual, when companies have arisen as the fruits of a share mania, there has been much wild speculation and unprofitable investment of capital. But now the shareholders finding that they are either compelled to retain their interest or sell at a loss, are endeavoring to economisetlie expen diture and make their , machinery as effective as possible. . The stock of fifty-soven mining com panies is quoted in the share list, and of these thirteen are classed as dividend paying. ' . ; Wool. — Messrs. Goldsbruugh and Co. report : —In our last monthly review of the wool market, we mentioned that the shipping season had fairly commenced. 'We have now to report that during the past month there has been a very spirited de mand for all classes of wool, but more particularly for bright descriptions of combing, and we have pleasure in stating that wo have never seen so large i proportion of the wool of this colony in such good condition ; both as regards washing, getting up, and being more free from burr and grass seeds. Our iniblic sales, held each week, priced catalogues of which we append, have been numerously attended, ootli by... buyers ond owners, aud there is 'evidently on fncieiisfiig desire on the part of the latter to compete with each other in getting up I tlieir clips in the best possible manner, and thus see lira the highest price, and iu every instance they have been well repaid for increased attention and care, by the very high rates the choicest clips havo realized. A considerable proportion of tlie I wool sold has been purchased on continental account, and many of our usual purchasers for tho London sales, have boen quite shut, out of the I market. The arrival of the, Joddo with news from the home murket to September 2Gth, bringing i fir! vinpy nf tlio imnrovnrl nrosnnp.t of rhp !n-:i i 11 li !1 I' ve S t , which from the tenor of the news by the previous mail had been supposed to be all but lost, from the long continuance of unfavorable weather, had tho effect of bringing buyers forward who] had previously been indisposed to operate, tiros. causing a keener competition for all lots that coiild be.sliipped in time for the February sales ; indc.edj up to tho present date, a larger quantity ]iii3 changed liauds (upwards of 10,000 bales) than up to tlio same period of any previous season, cithcrdn this or all the Australian colonies col lectively— -we having sold nearly 8000 bales. It will b» evident from this that the advantages of tiiis market are every season more appreciated, both by growers and buyers, and its position as the metropolitan wool mart of these colonies, is now universally acknowledged, ^.t the sales, wools in grease have been mostly taken on scourers' account, shippers only purchas ing the very best descriptions of lofty wool. In ?\vashed fleece the greatest demand is for combing desariptions, deep, stapled full bodied wools, of which, some very choice parcels have been sold j flnnp. nlinrfc wools beim* cainnnrativalv nesrlected. although thoy may be in equal condition. In scoured, there have not been many transactions, though parcels are quite in bounds, iudesd under those of washed and unwashed fleece. Our buyers are tliis season selecting with care and judgment, lit-nce the great variation in catalogued rates, inferior Into being very difficult to place at prices at all satisfactory to tho growers. Taking a gene ral review of the month's business, we never witnessed a more general desire to purchase, and this is met by the sellers being satisfied at tho prices tiie Melbourne sales yield them,, without seeking a distant market and taking a greater risk. Up to tho present elate ten ships have cleared with the now clip, having on board 20,091 bales, ond two are about to clear with 3500 bales more, so that we have on board ship, eay 23,591 bales, against 10,563 bales for the corresponding period of last year, being an increase of 7028 bales, proving that the clip is much earlier than usual. Since our last summary the following ships have saiied with wool on board: — Nov. 3rd, Wellesley, from Melbourne for London, 1488 bales; Nov. 13th, Indemnity, from Geelong for London, 2084 bales ; Nov. 14th. Strathdon, from Melbourne for London, 2050 bales; Nov. 16th, Clutha, from Geelong for London, 3260 bales; Nor. 17tli, Essex, from Melbourne for London, 1181 bales; Nov. 22nd, Sea Star, from Geelong for London, 1721 bales ; about to sail, Champion of the Seas, ' from Melbourne to Liverpool, 4477 bales ; sailed previous to last summary, 3240 bales ; about to sail, Hebe, from Melbourne for London, gay 1000 bales ; Moravian, from Melbourne for London, 2500 Dales ; total, 23,591 bales. Prices current ; — Superior scoured, 2s. 4d. to 2s. fi'.d. ; ordinary do., 2s. to 2s. 2d. ; hand washed, Is. 8d. to Is. lOd. ; superior fleece, Is. lid. to 2s. 2d.; ordinary to good, Is. 8d. to is. lid.; infe rior, Is. 5d. to Is. 7d. ; greasy, good, lid. to Is. 2d. t do., inferior, lOd. to lid. Hides : The '.market continues very depressed, and for shipping parcels there is either no inquiry, or off.;rs are so inttch under cost, that to accept them would leave a heavy loss to tho cur«r, consequently, as has been tho caso for several months past, nearly all the shipments are on owners' account. The following ships havo cleared with hides on board during the month: Nov. 3, Wellesley, for London, 250 hides; ?Nov. 14, Strathdon, do., 10,808 do.; Nov. 16, Clu tha, do., 2531 do. ; Nov. 22, Sea Star, do., 3641 do. About to clear. — Moravian, do., 8000 do. ; do., Hebe, do., 2000 do. Tal ' low : Transactions during the month have l:cen ' unimportant, colonial consumption being nearly equal to supply; very little appears in the mar ket. Our principal exports arc to the adjoining oolenics, only a few casks having been shipped to the home market, and these have bean on owners' ftfount. We quote ihippins parotic, bsafi -83-3 to £42 ; mutton, £14 to £16 per ton. Shipments have been: Nov. 3rd, Wellesley, for London, 114 casks; do., Hebe, do., 87 do. ' Flouii, Gn.vr.v, &c.; — (Review for the month ending 24th November, I860.) — Mr. W. Law rance reports : — The com market since the depar ture of the last English mail has been marked by some changes, important in their nature, and giving a vivid illustration of the consequences produced by rushing up the prices of breadstulfs at certain seasons, inducing speculators to esti mate a deficiency and import probably in excess of our requirements ; though no such excess can be said to exist. Three large ships from Cali fornia and two from Chili have arrived in our part within a week ; the cargoes previously to hand havo yielfled handsome profits, and right that it should bo so, yet it is certainly a miscal culation, having the bulk of these imports coming to hand at tlie commencement of our harvest, while it is also true that the know ledge of foreign breadstuffs being' expected has kpnt sncc.ulation at hav. nnd with tlie pxr.roatinn of a few slight panics, and equally sudden re actions, the market has generally maintained a steady arid even position, with fair and compa ratively remunerative prices, and it is to be hoped that no restrictive or protective fiscal enactment will ever come into existence to interfere with the enterprise of the merchant who thus risks such a speculation; had not foreign supplies reached this market as they have done, we should have had extreme rates ruling, heavy speculations afloat, and, as has frequently been the case, losses sustained. Tho weather has i-ontinucd changeable ; rain has fallen ; a few hot days have been followed by cold and rather . clul ling winds ; the crops have not, however, suffered, accounts from all quarters testifying as to tne good prospects. Tne reaping ot cereals will bo later than was at one time anticipated ; while we ore reaping hay hero, in South Austra lia barley, oats, and wheat aro being cut down and in the market; but although the harvest has thus commenced on the Plains of that colony, in the other districts it will not be general for some weeks yet, therefore stocks of breadstuffs will likely be well absorbed before any heavy sup plies reach us. The new Land Bill came into operation on tlie 1st instant; nothing can as yet be aaid as to its working or operation, but with tho many dcfocts pointed out by its opponents the measure is initiatory of a better, and if fairly dealt with by the Government who s«es its out set, it will be a great boon to the colony, not only in facilitating tho cultivation of a portion of the waste lands, but in inducing immigration — the greatest desideratum felrat the present moment. Flour. — Imports in September being light, have been made up by what ha3 come to hand during this and past month, the quantity from South Australia being considerable, and shoving the stocks as held there, anticipating a rise, as being, large. The approximation of imports for the current month is as follows : — Tasmanian, 55 tons j South Australian, 1500 tons ; Cali-. fomian, 100 tons; Chilian, 300 tons. At commencement of the monthprices ranged higher ' for colonial sorts, but now close from £1 to £1 103\. lower, with the turn still in favor of the buyer, at the following quotations : — Chilian, .Californian, and Tasmanian, £19; Adelaide sorts, £19 ; Magarey'a and Halt's superfine, £20 per ton of £2000 lbs. Wheat — Imports are con siderable, and consist as follows : — 500 bushels Tasmanian : 9500 bushels South Australian : 55,000 bushels Californian j 9000 bushels Chilian. High prices havo been paid, but a reaction has now set in, new wheat has changed hands in Adelaide at Cs., and for delivery in December 5s. 9d. per bushel ; closing quotations are nominally about 1 8s. per bushel . of 601b. Oats — Im- ports' for October are about the same in ex tent as the previous month, while for the current, they are in .excess of either ; for some time past' supplies have been drawn from Tas mania ; however, considerable parcels have come forward from Cal-utta, California, &c.;, and the reccints stand thus:— From Tasmania, 30,000 bushels ; from South Australia, 350 bushels ; from New South Wales, 600 bushels ; from California, 31,000 bushels ; Calcutta, 6,000 bushels ; and from the United Kingdom, 14,000 oushels. The heavy stocks of Scotch, Irish, and some other sorts, accumulated here, to i great extent lay un touched, and show no signs of their i-eing about to ' suffer a recovery,' the consumption being confined to colonial, f'ulifornian, Danish, and Dutch ; some parcel of Calcutta have been ex ported to Mauritius. With the heavy stocks remain ing on. hand, and the largo amount of capital lying locked up iu them, might it not bo worth the j consideration ol' parties interested, while they ! find them a slow sale for lioise feed, to introduce | thorn for working up in distillation ? British gin, and Bain; soi ls of French brandy, sent here, lire distilled principally from oats, while a distiller in tho United Kingdom lias obtained n parent for pro ducing whiskey fiom oats, which is said to be equal in quality to some descriptions made from Malt. Closing quotation's are as follows : Irish and Scotch 3s. to 3s. 8d. ; Russian aud Calcutta, 3s. Cd. t-- 3s. 8(1: Dutch, 3s. Od. ; Danish, 3?,. 10 J. ; Californian, 3s. fkl. to -Is. ; colonial, 3s. lid. to 4s. Id. per bushel of 40 lb. Barley. — Thero are no transactions to report. The harvest lias commencpu. .d aney can ue grown nere un equalled anywhere. Farmers will do well to give it more atteution, as.developing another of our 'resources.' Maize. — Imports are heavy, yet the consumption is equal. Prices are steady, ranging from 3s.' 7£d. to 3s. 9d. per bushel of 56 lb. for maize, the growth. of ..New South Walts'. Gram. — Two' parcqls arc .to hand from Calcutta. Sales are being made at £14 to £16 per ton of 2210 lb.

Irish and Scotch sell at £18 to £22 ; Bencr.-ii't's colonial, £25 per ton of- 2240 lb. Malt. — Imports aro oil the increase, but speculators are said to be oper ating largely.

Potatoes — Thero has been a steady and active business done iu potatoes at prices varying from £13 to .CK per ton. The new crop is iu the market, and is reported good, the quality proving excellent. Imports for October, 1860, as compared with October, 1859 : — Bran, I860, 22,122 bushels; 1859, 21,527 lmshels; barley, 1859, 8403 do. ; beans and pea'-, 1860, 612 do.*; maize, 1860, 41,755 do. ; 1859, 31,680. do. ; malt, 1S60, 20,012 do. ; 1859, 18,097 do. ; oats, I860, 05,336 do. ; 1859, 129,987 do. ; wheat, 1860, 28,138 do. ; 1859, 32,333 do. ; flour, 1860. 1905 tons ; 1S59, 1443 do. ; gram, 1859, 283 do. ; oatmeal, 1860, 71 do. ; 1859, 72 tlo. ; potatoes, I860, 611 do. ; 1859, 553 dp. Friday evening. Tho transactions of this day are to a limited extent. In flour but little business has been done. in wneat uiere are no transactions, oome sorts of oats are a shade easier. At auction Californian has been sold at 3s. 6d. to 3s. 9d. ; Dutch, 3s 5d. per bushel. The cargo of the Berkshire at Port Phillip Heads from Chili, is said to consist of flour and wheat, and that of the Lord ltaglau from California, of flour, wheat, aud oats.
