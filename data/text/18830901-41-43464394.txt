Natal STercury, March 4, 1882.—' Railway Concert in Durban. — It may seem ungallaut to the ladies who kindly lent their services on this occasion not to mention them first, but the place of honour of the evening must be accorded to Mr. Edward Lyons for hismasterly playing of the Clarionet. Before he had exchanged Her Majesty's Band for the Colonial Government we had had the pleasure of hearing this talented instrumentalist, and we trust he will often be seen on our local platforms.' The Natal Mercantile Advertiser, July 14, 1833.— 'Philharmonic Concert.— Mr. Edward Lyons's Clarionet solo was a 'Fantasia,' by Mohr, and we never heard Wvm to more advantage. At its con clusion the audience insisted on more, which was acceded to. We regret exceedingly that we are about to lose Mr. Lyons from our midst. Wherever he goes he will be, as he is, a lion amongst musi cians ; for he is a most clever musician, and' one that the Philharmonic Society can ill-a2ord to lose. He is one of the best players that it has been our fortune to hear, and that, conplei with his modesty of manner and willingness to oblige, will ensure him success wherever he goes. We sincerely wish Mr. Lyons a hearty good-by, and trust that he, like many others, will return to Natal.' ? x CHURCH OF ENGLAND GRAMMAR, SCHOOL, GEELONG, VICTORIA, Head Master, J.
