VICTORIA AND DENMARK. THEIR TRADE COMPARED. SOME STRIKING FIGURES. DENMARKS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS £40,000,000. VICTORIA'S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS £18.500,000. DENMARK AND G1PPSLAND, EQUAL IN AREA. The Victorian land settlement division of the Immigration League of Australia of which the Hoen. Alfred Deakin is President, a body called into existence through the general awakening of Aus. tralia to the urgency of more population, has just issued a pamphlet which contains a mass of useful information in reference to the possibilities of Victoria from an Agricultural point of view. The pamphlet makes a strong demand for the unlocking of the lands for the benefit of the people, points tothe danger of concentration in Melbourne and offers to help anyone who wishes to settle on the soil. "No immi gration," says the League, " is possible to Victoria until the State Government has arranged for land for its own people. We want every man in Victoria to be able to get land. We want people living in Vic toria to be able to write to their relatives and friends in Europe and America and tell them to come out to Victoria. We want them to be able to tell them that everyone can get land here, and to be able to tell them that the Lands Admin. istration in Victoria is up-to-date, and managed in a business-like way." An interesting comparison of Victoria with Denmark is them made as follows: Victoria and Denmark. "Victoria has much land; and few people. You will understand this, if you will follow some comparisons we will make with other countries. Victoria has 56,245,700 acres. Den mark has 9,500,160 acres. Victoria (87,884 square miles) is nearly as large as England, Wales, and Scotland (88,266 square miles). Denmark has a population of 2,449,540 persons, or about twice the population of Victoria, 1,231,733. Vic toria has 14 persons to the square mile, U.S. America 22, England and Wales 586, Scotland 157, Ireland 135, Belgium 589, Holland 406, Germany 290, France 191-Denmark 165. To realise the great possibilites of Vic toria, if the people could get the land, and cultivate it, particular reference may be made to Denmark. Denmark has 948,997 persons engaged in agriculture. Victoria has only 126,840 persons so engaged, of whom 95,920 are engaged in agriculture, and 30,920 in pastoral and dairying. You can judge of the social condition of the Danes by the testimony of the Norwegian poet Bjornson, that the Danish agriculturalists are the best enlightened peasantry in the world. The Danes, with climate un certain, obliged to shut out the sea with dykes as the Dutch have done, with a soil of shifting quicksands, liable to be blown away, with in Jutland a sandy soil, cultivate 4l5ths or 80 per cent of the whole area of Denmark. Victoria culti vates about 1/14th of the area of the State. The Denmark of to-day started in the early sixties, after two disastrous wais iu which she lost her principal provinces. Victoria started fresh and unburdened in the early fifties. The cultivable land of Denmark is amongst the most trouble some to cultivate, and with the greatest natural difficulties to contend with. The land of Victoria is amongst the richest in the world, the climate unequalled. Denmark has to import coal, and has no minerals whatever. Victoria has coal at her door, and mineral wealth enormous. Victoria has State Forests and Timber Reserves to the extent of 4,658,821 acres, or equal to half of all the land in Denmark, whereas Denmark has only 500,000 acres of Forests. But Denmark produces £300,000 a year from her Forests, which is more than double the value of the Forest products of Victoria £142,905, (not including firewood). The total value of all the meat of every kind exported (1905) by Victoria comes to £652,419 But these do not approach near to the value of the export of eggs from Denmark, which in 1904 was worth (£1,404,833). The latest advices report that the Danes have in view an export trade in eggs of the yearly value of £S,000,000. Wool is Victoria's principal export, but the Victorian produce of wool exported is not equal to the value of the export of bacon only from Denmark, which in 1901 was £3,448,444, and bacon is not Den mark's principal export ! The Victorian produce of wool exported in 1905 was valued at £2,501,990, of wheat at £1,835,20(, and of butter and cheese £1,576,189, the principal exports of the land of Victoria. The total value of these (£5,913,383) is not equalto the value of the butter alone exported from Denmark in 19041, which was valued at £8,174,994. Denmark's export of bhtter is greater than all Victorta's exports of wool, wheat butter, and cheese, flour (£590,297),skins and hides (£535,086), hay and chaff (£97,471), fodder(£63,260),oats (165,585), dried fruits (.£56,808), fresh fruits (£6S, 522), and the products of our jam fac tories (£73,233). The number of men employed in Fisheries in Victoria was 1,039 in 1905, and the value of the fish caught in Victorian waters £68,000. Denmark employs more than 15,000 men, and the fish caught are valued at more than £600,000. Victoria pays annually for importation of fish, fresh and preserved, about 158,000. Denmark receives each year for the export of fish more than £300,000. The Gippaland District which is about the size of Denmark has only 6884 occupiers of land. Denmark has 948, 997 persons enigaged in agriculture." The pamphlet whlich is is dedicated to "The People of Melbourne" then makes a fervent appeal to every patriotic Aus tralian to help the League to settle people on the land. The office of the League is 159 Queen Street Melbourne.
