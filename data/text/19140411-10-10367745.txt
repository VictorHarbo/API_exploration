The United States is becoming more and more an industrial country, and agricultural and pastoral industries are becoming relatively, though not necessarily absolutely, less important. The yearly production from agriculture and kindred industries amounts in value to only £2,000,000,000, while that of all the manufacturing industries put together amounts to £5,400,000,000, or nearly three times as much. Hence, we are importing more and more foodstuffs and raw materials, and are likely to continue to do so. "Another matter I should like to men- tion,'' said Dr. Snowden, "is' that of immigration. The immigrants who now come to Australia from Great Britain are drawn largely from the towns. They are not farmers _ or country people. Now, in America we have a race of pioneers. They are not old men, but mostly in the prime of life, some of them still young men. They are the type of men who went into the Middle West States like Kansas 15 years ago, or thereabouts, and have since moved on into Oklahoma and other now territories. They are now ready for pioneering in some new country, for the West is filling up. I am surprised that Australia does not do more to attract men of this class. They are men with a little money, some of them with a great deal, and with plenty of energy, and used to hard work and pioneering. Canada has attracted these people by the thousand, and they have added wonderfully in the opening up and development of the Canadian North-West. There are no. new worlds to conquer now so to speak, in America, but Australia can still offer attractions to pioneers of this type It would be well worth the while of Australia to get into touch with the people in the Mad- also West States' who could come here and help to develop your vast natural resources As you know," remarked Dr Snowden, in conclusion, our main object is the development of closer trade relations between America and Australasia There is a great opening for your products, both the one or two I have mentioned, and many others, in America You have things we need, and, on the other hand we can supply many things you need, and, of course, we want to do that, too The that. velopment of trade along these lines will be good for both countries, but, of course, we look, to other things beside the development of trade relations We in America, want to do the very best we can for you in Australia, and we want to be the best possible friends with you Not only do we want closer trade. relations, with you, to our mutual benefit, but we look forward to join- ing hands with, you across the Pacific, and we want you to be our allies on the Pacific in the future 'of Mr Paine, who has been president of the National Association of Man i facturers, the members of which, by the way, employ over five million workers, for four successive. of terms and is a very large manufacture of carriages, vehicles motor-cars, and the like, in addition to being interested in railroads and other things, heartily agreed with what Dr Snowden had said about the impression Hobart had made on the visitors, and the opportunities for the development of trade between Austria ha and America
