The resolutions set out that in view of the urgent necewity for prosecuting to the utmost the development of the primary industries, in order to pro vide the sinews of war, the time had ar rived when the indiscriminate enlistment of producers for overseas' service should receive consideration and, if necessary, be discontinued. The chairman (Mr. Brink worth) expressed himself in accord with the general principle of the motion. Apart from such individuals as the racecourse habitues and men of that stamp, mor chants' stores and men engaged in similar occupations might be drawn on to a much greater. extent without the serious results which would follow an exodus from the primary producing industries. Mr. Kirk expressed the view that the present indis criminate system of recruiting was harm ful, not only in regard to the enlistment of men engaged in vital industries, but also with respect to the wholesale enlist ment of married men with families. The board unanimously decided to support the. resolutions. A similar letter from the Toodyay Board came . before the. Swan Roads Board last week, but no action was taken. The Darling Range Roads Board also took the letter into consideration at. its last meeting, and -the following motion was carried unanimously, on the motion of the chairman (Mr. R. S. Sampson): '"his board agrees that indiscriminate en listment is not in the best interests of the. Empire, and that the needs of the Empire will be best served by the retention of men for carrying on the primary indus tries."

A reso lution was passed objecting to this ap pointment, on the ground that the views of the Danish community had not been ascertained. It was pointed out by vari ous speakers that it was only fair that their country should be represented by a gentleman who was interested in their homeland, and it was considered advisable that steps should he taken at once to urge on the Danish Government the necessity of having a Dane as consul, esecially in view of the prospect of increased trade with Demnark awaiting the advent of a business man, with a knowledge of both local and Danish conditions.

" pubnlishg a statement showin that traffic m the streets of Berlin in 191 compurd well with the returns for 1914, es pecially in the war period. 'There is natur ally a heavy fall as compared $iith 1912 and 19L3; and at was impossible to reach the high figures of these year." The paper continues:-h some of the omnibus ser vices had to be suspended, the public sought other means of conveyance; and the street tramways secured the bulk of the traffic. The Decemnber returns show that the trams earned 4,724,566 marks in Decem. ber, 1915, as compared with 4,166,271 marks in December, 1914 (about Â£236,228 and Â£908,313 respectively). The total income of the tramway company was 52,191,531 marks for the whole year. compared with 51,135, 040 marks for 1914, an increase of more than 1,000,000 marks. But it is added that the dividend of the Tramway Company, which was 6 per cent. in 1914, is not likely to be inreased. Dog Flesh on Sale in Vienna.-The "Wie. notr Tageblatt" announces the opening in the Rotherturm.strase, Vienna, of the firs butcher's .shop for the sale \of dog The Prmepect of a Long War.-The prob ability of a longer war' than is anticipated generally wua foreshadowrg by Geneal Sir Edward Hutton in a speech in Chertsey (England). Ue said that Lord Kitchener considered that it would take three years to vanquish the great German power and destroy the military system of "blood and iron," but he thought that that was a large under-estimation, and so did most of his colleagues. Generals accustomed to study strategetical questions were only just 'beginning, to realise Germany's great power. Held by Fance and Russia, Germany was not extending sonthanlrs, the evident de sign being to make a broad belt from the North Sea to the Persian Gulf. Whether she suoeeeded or not depended largely on the British Empire. 12,000 Millions on /War.--Mr. Arthur Kiddy, city editor of the London "Morning Post," delivered a lecture in London re cently on "Some Financial Aspects of the War." Mr. Kiddy estimated the aggre gate expehdituri of all the belligerents up to the end of December last at a little more than 6,000 millions, of which 1,500 millions was the cost for Britain; about 1,200 millions for France; a little over 1,000 millions for Russia;' and 150 millions for Italy; while Germany's total was about 1,600 millions, and Austria's about 750 mil lions, the two last totals including the sums paid out to Turkey and Bulgaria. Ger many had raised loans amounting to 2,000 millions, or sufficient, it was srid, to carry on the war up to March (this month). Given a continuance of the war to the end of the present year the probable cost would be at least 12,000 millions, of which rather moare than 3,000 millions would probably be the total as far as Britain was con cern ed.
