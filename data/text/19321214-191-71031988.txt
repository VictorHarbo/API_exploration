MARTYRS TO NEPHRITIS Dr. CilenWs report on chronic nephritis, a form of kidney disease, cannot be described as either deter minate or highly practical. Hie pos sibility of lead-poisoning being a factor cannot, in his opinion, be entirely dis counted, but it will have to be further investigated before definite conclusions can be stated. Referring to the con tention of Dr. Nye that there is a definite association between the pre valence of child nephritis and wooden houses painted with white lead paint Dr. Oilento admitted that in Queens land, where 85 per cent of the houses are wooden and painted, 322 deaths per 100,000 had been due to nephritis, a percentage much Luther then that of Victoria, New Bonth Wales, and South Australia. Dr. Gifonto also instanced the fact that in jfcw Zealand, where 90 per cent of the houses are wooden, the figures for chromic nephritis are very low, and lead poisoning among children is unknown. That climate, as well as bad paint, may have some thing to do with the Queensland figures, was not suggested in the re port, but there is some significance at tached to the statement that in Bris bane, Rocklmmpton, Ipswich, Towns ville. end Charters Towers there are or have been four times as many deaths from the disease than in the remainder of the State The doctor's conclusion from that fact is that in the cities named some definite factor which causes the disease is operating. And so on— leaving the sad fact just as it was, without any genuine ray of illumination. Like the beauty's eyes 'with mystery at the ©ore,' which the poet pleaded should 'tell us less or tell us more,' Dr. Oilento still leaves us guessing. ? ? * WOOL- SCOUAING AS AN ENTER PRISE Randolph Bedford and others, who have been urging that Australian wool should be' scoured before it is. sold for shipment abroad, will be strengthened in their opinion by the circumstance that a new record, 28fd. per lb. for scoured wool, was- lecured at the re cent Brisbane woo! sales. That price was secured for five bales a.w., branded P.J.B. over Osbert, and scoured at the Julia Creek scour, North-western Queensland. Many wool growers etiil hare a lot to learn even from Chinamen. In South-western New South Wales a Chinese, who establish ed a wool scour in the 'nineties, and paid gooof priceB to the selectors for their wool, made a fortune by shipping the scoured wool to China. He was a very intelligent and honest Chinaman, whose word was his bond; and many of the small wool men regretted his retirement from business when the desire for city life had too strongly captured the imagination of his city schooled sons and daughters, +m*po* a mHHHmmm ? :^ Bntwh, Oanmpnweilth, BDd Victorian' Swbs Governments are to shar^^Jhp payment «f the eosta of ti£e TtosjM /G^fssfoa , .wKeh- Inquired Ui^^iioi^Uitl'^'l^^sii^ii^ante in Ytolip£,, p^,.-mp^i-x-'iiMid 22 months, .'.travelled all over Victoria, tile.

'' The 'settlement'' so-called of the migrants, was effected by an ar rangement between the British and Bruce-Page .Governments, with' the High Commissioner's office in libndon as the intermediary. It was one of various slipshod and silly [obs of the Bruce and all-for-England regime, but some of the deluded 'settlers' were of good intellectual and fi&hting; quality, and the dust of official forgefc fumess was not permitted to obscure their original and subsequent griev ances. The Commissioners, who seem to have been of Clydesdale breed rather than of hunter stock, despite their nearly two years' attention to tie mat ter, have not yet got their report ready oA that which, since interest in it long since died, is best described as a postmortem. RELIEF WORKERS AND THE REGEftfi Minister M. P. Hynes (Labor and Industry) and the senior, officers of his department must be congratulated on their efforts to do the best possible for unemployment relief workers, of all classes, and for the families of mar ried relief workers during the Christ mas and New Year season. That the Labor Government would have . done better still on their behalf bad it been possible, should be well understood. Always. when such relief is given and accepted there should be kept in vi«w the fact that nothing could be more undesirable than the perpetuation of unemployment relief conditions. The gradual return of all relief workers to normal employment under normal con ditions and normal rates of pay must be. kept in the forefront, both by those who administer and by those whom the administration helpB. Not the relief workers' standard, but the highest ob tainable standard for workers gener ally still is Labor's objective, and in Queensland the leaders will not pause in thought and effort so that those whose, ^aith. they price inay return to sufficiency u and something, .over. ?s .- ,.» ? . .. f. , HAVE THEY BEEN TRIED t The Minister for Agriculture, Frank Bulcock, has his head- full of schemes, which are to be tested .for, the good of the State and the farmers.. One of them is the growing of proved grasses on a commercial scale at the head of the O'Connell River, in the Mackay district. The grasses to be planted will include molasses, kikinja, pani cum, Rhodes, and TownsviUe lucerne. Should the experiment prove success ful, northern fanners may follow on with the new grasses for farm cultiva tion. Australia has an extensive range of native grasses, some of which might well repay widely scattered ex periment. The recuperative properties of Some of them after that most cruel of tests, a record drought, is little short of marvellous. Transplanted to areas with a sure rainfall, Nature, aided by the Department of Agricul ture, might make of them something of the world's blue ribbon class in pas turage. ? » * TRADE UNIONS AND ECONOMICS OF INDUSTRY In the course of his presidential address to the Manchester Associa tion of Engineers, Julius Frith sdd he had been surprised to find how deeply trade unions have gone into tbe eco nomics of industry, and have, on oc casion, been able to' tell, or at any rate remind, the financiers of facts which vitally concern both employers and employed, and which might, with advantage, have been found out by economists working in their joint in terest. If this had been practised a little more in some of tbe Lancashire industries it would not have been ne cessary for outside economists to come and tell them home-truths which they might, and should, have found out for themselves.
