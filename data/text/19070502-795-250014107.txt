The Peril of Melbourne Mr. Marshall Lyle, Secretary of the Victorian Land Settlement Branch of the Immigration League, has published a pamphlet entitled "The Peril of Melbourne." The peril of ^Melbourne is the conrmon- danger of all Victoria, and arises from want of land settlement; or, rather, from the Jack of suitable land on reasonable terms. Mr. Lyle, with the assistance of (among others i the Government. Statist, and Mr. J. B. Hourigan, of the Statist's Office, has collected and tabulated a vast amount of information, which cannot fail to be of interest to every reader. "With the question of immigration we do not propose to deal, for, as the pamphlet points out, "we must secure land for our own people in Victoria before land can ID© offered to immigrants." No immigration is possible while eurigration goes oft. Inducing .people to come to a State which cannot keep its own population will merely increase the volume of emigration. In addition to our own people who are being forced out of Victoria, we should have the spectacle of outsiders brought here at the expense of the State, and leaving at their own expense. Emigration from a nc- li young country like Victoria is a ?vniptoni that- there is something wrong, and in this case want .of land is the root of the matter. If our farmers' sons could get land in Victoria, they would stay here and prosper, and would increase the production of Victoria. The peril of Melbourne is the loss of the country population. Victoria is about the size of Great Britain. The latter is often held up as a shocking example of agricultural decline, yet what do we find according to t'he Year Boohs.? Victoria in 1905, produced, of wheat, 23,417,670 bushels; oats, 7,232,425; barley, 1,062,139; and of potatoes, 115,352 tons; as against, wheat, 58,902,000 bushels; oats, 116,437,000; barley, 58,110,000; potatoes, 3,763,000, grown in Great-Britain. Land Settlement Fraud Mr. Prendergast, speaking at the Eight Hours' luncheon, said the land 1 purchase policy, as pursued by the present Government, was a fraud. The Crown lauds were kept locked, while the State purchased private lands at fancy prices for the purposes of settlement. The figures given in "The Peril of Melbourne" bear out this view. The State had available for occupation at the end of 3905 12,850,990 acres. Of" course, that area included some land which may not be fit lor closer settlement, but there are. in addition, grazing leaseholds' comprising 3,631,974 acres, and over 2,000,000 acres are held under pastoral leases; education reserves and endowments aggregate one and three-quarter millions, and unsold town lands nearly two millions. In the whole State the land alienated in fee simple amounts to 22,-558,188, out of a total area of 56,245.760 acres. A further 12 million acres are occupied under different tenures, yet of the total held in occupation — 34,518,526 acres. — only 4,269,877 acres are under cultivation. The other lands are held practically in idleness. The holders cannot claim that they have fairly stocked. their lands. Victoria is, as we have said, about the same size as Great Britain, and a comparison of live stoak returns proves Britain to be millions ahead of us. In 1905 Victoria had 11,455,115 sheep, against 25,257,193 in Britain. We had 385,513 horses, 1,737,690 cattle, and 273,682 pigs; while Britain had 1,572,433 horses, 6,987,020 cattle, and 2,424,919 pigs. The occupiers are not only keeping men off the land, in the interests of sheep and bullocks; they do not even raise the sheep and bullocks to anything approaching the number we inight expect. The squattocracv demands protection against the rabbit, but bunny is of nearly as much value as an article of export as are the sheep.. Rabbits and hares brought us £220,940, as compared with £275,195 for frozen mutton. Interesting comparisons are furnished between Victoria and Denmark. Denmark has an area of nine and a half million acres—about one-sixth of Victoria —and a population of -2,449,000, or about twice that of this State. Denmark has 948,997 persons cngag^ in agriculture. Victoria has only 126,840 persons so engaged, of whom 95,920 are encaged in agriculture, and 30,920 in pastoral and dairying. The Norwegian poet Bjorson said ihat the Danish agriculturists' are the best enlightened peasantry in the world. Denmark and Victoria The Danes, with climate uncertain, obliged to shut out the sea with dykes as the Dutch have done, with a soil of shifting quicksands, liable to be blown away, with in Jutland a sandy soil, cultivate 4-51 he, or 80 prr cent., of the whole area of Denmark. Victoria culti> vates about l-14th of the area of the State. Denmark maintains her population, and increases it. Victoria does not maintain her population, but loses it. Denmark attracts immigrants from, the surrounding countries. Victoria is pouring her people over the border. Denmark, we may remark in • passing, has legislated against the aggregation' of estates, and she has also a land-tax. Indeed, one-seventh of her entire revenue arises from direct taxation. Denmark, with 165 people to the square mile, as against 14 in Victoria, beats us badly in nearly all our exports. The value of agricultural production in Victoria is estimated (1905) at £7,728,424, and pastoral and dairying at . £10,837,410. Eleven years ago Mulhall estimated the farm products of Deaunark at £35,000,000, and, in every form of agricultural production there has been ari enormous increase since then.'. The number of men employed in fisheries, in Victoria was 1039 in. 1905, and the value of the fish caught in Victorian waters waters £68,000. Denmark employs more than 15,000 men, and the fish caught are valued at more than £600,000. Victoria pays, annually for the importation of fish, fresh and preserved, about £158,000. Denmark receives each year for the export of fish more than £300,000. The middleman in the fish trade is as bad as the spread- eagler in the land. If there is one business that requires public attention more than any other it is the fish trade. •Our waters teem with living wealth, yet fish, instead of being, as it should be, the cheapest, is one of the most costly articles of human consumption. T'he money is drawn from the consumer, but only a small share goes to the fisherman. The rest is absorbed on the way. Unlock and Keep Unlocked The aggregation of large estate® is going on merrily while we are talking subdivision. More land is held in Victoria to-day than at any other period of its history, but so far as farm lands are concerned they are held by fewer people than; a few years, ago. Grenville county cultivates less than 4 per cent, of its land, and it has lost nearly 19,000 of its population sinoe 1871. Follett county has less than 1 per cent, under cultivation, and is losing population. Instances could be multiplied indefinitely to prove that the smaller holders, are being systematically bought out or pushed out by the larger proprietors, and yet, although every platform rings, with demands to "unlock the lands," we hear hardly a suggestion' for keeping them unlocked. If we unlocked all the lands, public and private, in the State tomorrow, how much would we benefit in 20 years' time ? Precisely the same influences and tendencies that led to their being locked, in the past are still in operation, and history would repeat itself. If we are to have .effective settlement we must prohrbit the adding- of further fields to already sufficiently broad acres. The prohibition of aggregation must yet be made a live political issue. The progressive party must face the ques-. tion. There is no room for escape or evasion. In breaking up large estates, while other estates are being extended, we are simply running in a circle. We may go on breaking up until the crack of doom unless we prevent the putting together of the pieces again. The peril of Melbourne will always continue so long as the unlimited acquisition of real estate is permitted. Mr. Lyle's enquiries lead him to flatly contradict the boast of Ministers that they 1 are settling people on the land. "In 1887," he writes, "genuine land settlement as a State policy in Victoria came to an end. From' 1887 to 1892 the number placed upon the land was at the lowest. This period (1SS7 to 1892) was one of feverish land speculation in the State. Land speculation, the buying and holding of land for sak\ took the place of the settlement of'land for the production of wealth. In no year from 3S87 to the present time have the selectors iiiimbered annually more than about a .ptarter of the number who used to select' before the commencement of the land ^ vculation era. From 1893 to 1900 the annual number of selectors was about 700. From 1901 to the latest available returns, a decline in the number of sectors, only once slightly interrupted, IIAS set in, each year less* selections being procured than the year before. Now operations have become so small, that the putting of 50 .persons on the land is paragraphed in the prese for months." The. Premier boasted during the election campaign • of thousands who had been provided with farm's. The records' of the Lands Department show "a decline in the number of selectors, only once slightly interrupted." We hav<e the land, we have the men, but we have not a Government capable of either vigor or political honesty. The Minister of Lands contradicts himself as often as he speaks. One can only assumes that he varies, his opinions to suit his audiences. Let UK 1 suggest to the Land Settlement League that the first step towards' removing the admittedly pressing peril of Melbourne is to shift Bent.
