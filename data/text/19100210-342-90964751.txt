CONSULAR COMMENTS. SPEECH BY MR, HOLM AN. FORWARDED TO SWEDEN. Sydney, Feb. 9. Trie jjanisn uonsm ^iYir. x-aa-ujver; and the Swedish Consul (Count Morner), said to-day that neither Denmark nor Sweden ean spare agricultural immigrants, and, though they do send immigrant's from other classes, the Consuls find it most diffi cult to place them. The warnings given by the Go vernments seem to be due to the forwarding to the Swedish authori ties by Count Mo-rn-&r; of a news paper cutting of a report of an at taok on . .the Govern mont inimigxa tion policy by 'Mr. Holman at New castle last November. In that speech Mr. HoOroi&n; spoke I of the steady stream of immigration j that was being directed to Australia j by the dissemination of deliberately | lying statements. 'Immigrants,' said Mr. Holman, 'found themselves on arrival 'in a, fool's paradise3 into which they had been deluded by the deliberate lies of an unprincipled j Government.' Count Morner says he forwarded Mr. HoSman's remarks to the Swe dish Government with a request that it be forwarded to the Swedish Anti- i Immigration Society. Count Mor ner also said that tbe Swedish immi grants who oame here, being mostly non-agricultural, found much diffi culty in getting employment. i
