MINING INTELLIGENCE. ' ADELAIDE SHARE MARKET. General Agency Ollicc, King WilHam-stTeer, Friday Eveninir. Scut. 1. 1848. The enquiry is still continued, at intervals, for Ade laides, but without materially altering the price. Surra Hurras continue in request, and have been done at £21! exclusive of the dividend (£10, payable to-day). iNotwithstnndingtlie increased scarcity oi money, ami i considerable dulness in many important bran- hes of trade and commerce, the stock maintains its elevated position, and it will not surprise Us if we have to quote it at £220, or more, before the end of the present month. Belvideres have changed hands to some extent at £3 5s. Port Lincolns have been rather quiet this week, par ties wishing to purchase, holding back in expectation of, the call of £1, due on the 27th instant, sending them | down a little ; holders of this stock seem, however, to have quite as good an opinion of their worth as those who want to buy them cheap— and as there appears little disposition on the part of holders to give way, business in it is somewhat suspended, both parties wait ing the effects of Michaelmas day. Wakefields. — Of this stock a quantity, reported to be the property of a gentleman leaving the colony, has been adventured for sale at 12s 6d, and a good many have been bought at from 10s to 12s 6d. The mode of payment probably causing the difference in price. In the absence of business in shares, which is seldoaii?» feature of dividen 1 day, we avail ourselves of the present space to mention the circumstance of the formation, at Hamburgh, of an enterprising smeltin? company, hav ing an establishment on the banks of the Elbe, and em ploying a capital of upwards of £100,000, and posses sing six frigate-built vessels employed in the importF tion of foreign ores. Of those, two were recently des tined for this colony, one of which, the Alfred, is duly announced as 'expected V but which we suspect, with her partner, may have been detained by the Danish blockade o! the Eibe The importance of this feature, as respects the mining interests of this colony, will be readily appreciated by our readers, most of whom will join us in considering as a consummation devoutly to be wished, the suspension or abrogation of the naviga tion laws which at present so seriously fetter the com merce of Britain and her colonies. At the present time, vessels pa-sing into the Pacific for ore, the produce of Chili and the Western parts of South America, have to double the Horn in quest of cargo ' to fill up,' alonjr tne coast oi Jbrazu witn our commerce unshackled, and as free to the world as its wide spread waters them selves, it cannot be doubted that numbers of vessels trading to other regions would find their way hither, swelling the tide of our immigration, supporting the market for our ores, and in a diversity of ways, easily to be conceived by our readers, giving a renewed impetus to the prosperity of our adopted country. We are amongst tho e who anticipate that Britannia may shortly be seen ' ruling the waves' belter than heretofore, and shall not be surprised at an early relax ation of her maritime code. The Lcontinc, after being annonnfed as a Government mail for the past ten days, is suddenly suspended from the ofiice for the present, whether she be lying back in expectation of any such announcement as the one we are venturing to hope fur, we do not know ; but it appears desirable that the Go vernment at home should know that a very lively and anxious feeling is awake in South Australia upon a point so identified with her interests, and that as re spects all those reforms which are connected therewith, immediately or remote y — there is no part of Britain's empire where the motto of plus ultra is more energeti cally, and at the same time rationally recognised, or de cidedlv adonted While gUncinsf nt the subject of immigration, we were at !he same moment reminded of a duty which is by no means foreign from such an article as the present. of pointing to the fact that we were this week instru mental in procuring in a quarter-of an-hour constant work and splendid pay tor .-even nb e bodied miners, before they h.-d got their luggage out of the Constance, for the be- efit therefore of till concerned here and in our distressed father and, we for a moment dwell upon the contrast presented by th s fact incidental to immigration to these happy shores, and the melancholy features pre sented to the British public in a recent meeting at Holy well, counlytown of Flintshire, in North Wale?, in which, out of a population of 10,834, no less thau 4,000 are by trade miners, heretofore employed in the neighbouring mines, but owing to the falling oil' of employment through the unpromising cond.tion of the mines, only 300 of this vast number can now find work, and that at not more than 8s a week! no wonder when our private letters from Manchester slate the condition of its masses to be similar, our correspondent should add, 'Thou- sands here would be glad to get to Australia who can not,' and no wonder we, whose bowels yearn to release our suffering fellow-ccuntrymeu, should indignantly say ' perish the frippery «nd pomp, the useless purposes for which teris of thousands are annually voted of Briton's diminished earnings, while Australia wants labour, and England is being crushed by its weight.' ' A Cornishman' will find that the entire dividend of all the mi ties referred to by him is scarcely double that of the Burra Burra alone. At the East Wheal Rose bimonthly meeting held on the 5th May, the dividend declared was £35 per share. The sales of lead ore in January and February had been £ 10,740. uR.'Isqdite mistaken. In the Mining Journal oi May 1 1, a correspondent ' A Lead Miner,' gives a list of no less than 19 mines in the single county of Car digan, which had £137.500 expended upon them to no purpose in fifteen years ! ' W.*' — We shall bring the subject, one of long cherished interest with us, before our respected fellow colonists as early as really pressing present engagements will permit. _. . , Paid Total Preient Name.
