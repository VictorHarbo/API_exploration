If any further proof were needed to' convince doubting Thomases of the value of Unionism, Senator Fairbairn, in' a- speech before the Employers' Federation on Sept. 3 8 last, supplied it.

The aboA'e is the title of a little booklet of essays and prose slcetohes written by 'The Vag,' and collected from the pages of 'The People,' a Sydney paper devoted to the propagation of certain . Socialistic principles. Although suffering from scrappiness, the contents of the little. A'olume are in to] esting— especially those chapters re lating to the early struggles of 'The People.' But, unfortunately, the author uses up too much space denouncing or captiously criticising other working-class bodies, in stead of shooting at the real enemy, Capitalism. How the Fat Man must smile when he sees the various Socialist and radical minded organisations slangwhanging each other! — particularly when he . pleasantly reflects that the organisations on HIS side of the .economic fence Avork in har mony, and .spontaneously bring doAvn a big collective- foot on the neck of the Avorkiy'g das'' . ? ? ti t.

Herald' leader. Pity Rus sia is so far from New South Wales! The 'Herald,', strengthened by its -recent -exer- cise in advising lines of Government policy at home, Avould certainly exercise potent influence on Russian, parties. As a means of stilling internal dissension its ,wise counsels would be inAraluable. As a step towards bringing Russia's couple of hund red millions of ? people back to a proper frame of mind the; Australian Government might do worse than cable whicheA^er Government happens to be on top at the moment just Avhat the 'Herald', thinks. That would almost infallibly do in. one act what the whole big outside AA'orld and Rus sia itself to boot has so far been quite unable to accomplish, and might eATen bring Germany to terms right away. # ? # * 'I hate the business of blood.
