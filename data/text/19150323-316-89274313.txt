It matters nnot how beautifult' the features, how. perfect the .figure, or how glossy or reduuuant the hair, no woman can look" really, pretty or at tractive if her face betrays a disor dered digestive apparatus. A yellow, sickly face is iuconipat ible with any womanly charm. There are cases known where ladies have suffered in silence for years from dic kening liver and stomach complaints, simply because they were unable to withstand the weakening and racking propiensities of. the. ordinary purgative medicines. Ju such case Laxo-Tonic Pills may be taken with utmost confidence, for they neither unduly purge nor do they weaken. These Pills have been -known to brine tI e roses to a girl's checks which hiad been absent for years. Price, 1/ and 2/. Obtainable at W. D.

B., Ren ton, of 14 Sir John. Young's Crescent, Sydney, New South Wales, and con nected with a well-known George street wallpapet house, illustrates two things-one, that doctors. are not in fallible; and the other, that adults are troubled with worms just as children are, and that Comnstock's - Dead Shot': Worm Pellets are a most effec tive remedy for this most unpleasant complailtt. The letter of Mr Renton is purely voluntary and freely given, and simply states the facts, which he will at any time conlirm. "Some time ago I began losing weight in an alarming manner," writes Mr Renton; "so much so that I went,to see a doctor, who examin ed me and came to the conclusion it was due to overwork and worry. I continued to lose weight," and also suffered from peculiar internal pains. I became very anxious at the continued loss of weight. and thinking I' might be going into a decline went to a se cond doctor, who examined me thor oughly, amnd gave me about the same opinion as the former one' had done, and prescribed a tonic. One night go ing home in the traiu I read one of your advertisements giving symptoms of people who have worms. The symp tonis given strongly coincided with my own, and I determined to test the question. I accordingly procured a packet of your Comstock's 'Dead Shot' Worm Pellets, and took eight tablets, and in the morning four Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills, and to my intense satisfaction and relief passed two very large stomach worms. I took them in a glass and, showed them to the doctor who had last examined me, and who had prescribed the Tonic, aid it is needless to say he was surprised at the result. Altogether I lost thirty pounds in two months. .due to these worms, and you may believe me, I was thoroughly alarmed, thinking I might 'have consumption. I regained all this lost weight immediately I rid my system of the worms, and am in splendid health at present. These are the simple facts, which speak for them selves, and I shall be only too pleased to confirm them to any person who doubts their truth. You havo my per mission to use this for publication." Comstock's "Dead Shot" Worm Pellets are a purely vegetable medi cinal preparation for - the eradication of Worms in children and adults.
