The undersigned Bookmakers dMire respectfully to intimata that, having been denied the U3e of an Inner Bing for the purpose of plying their avoca tions at these Races, in spite of their representations that they have incurred heavy liabilities thereon in i anticipation of the usual opportunities for poat betting, they are conmelled in self-defence to de monstrate the absurd oppressiveneiJ of the To talizator Repeal Act. '.They are advised by eminent Counsel that an' person putting money on the Totalizator is liable under this Act to the pains and penaUies set out therein, and accordingly this notice is Riven that parties so contributing may be proceeded against as the Act directs. \-- They are the less reluctant to take this course since it has come to their knowledge that such action will not injure the Hunt Club, the receipts of the day having been purchased from them for a stated Bum. , Should their action inconvenience any of their Patrons, the Bookmakers, while re&i-etting; the annoyance, must remind them that their means of livelihood are suddenly attacted, and that their action is intended as a protest against the measure referred to.

Health depends in a great measure upon the soundness of the teeth and their freedom from decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes nor pastes cmi possibly be as efficacious for polishing the teeth and keeping them sound and white as a pure and non gritty tooth powder ; such Rowlands' Odonto has always proved itself to be. ROWLANDS' MACASSAR OIL preserves, strengthens, and beautifies the hair ; it contains no lead or mineral ingredients, and can now be also had in a golden colour, which is espe cially suited for fair or golden-haired children and persons. Four sizes. ROWLANDS' KALYDOR^^ -I. ing, healing, and refreshing wash for the face, hands, and anns, and is perfectly iree from any mineral or metallic admixtures; it disperses freckles, tan, pricklyjeat, redness, DimDles &c.; ROWUNDS'EUPLYSIA^^^ wash for cleansing the hair and skin of the head from all impurities, senrf, or dandrig ; the application of the Euplysia (which is perfectly innocent in its nature) should be made on retiring to rest at night, a practice that will render the morning use of Rowlands' Macassar Oil increasingly effective both as to health and beauty of the hair. ROWLANDS' EUKONIA » ? »— * pure, delicate, and fragrant toilet powder, and has lately been much impoved. Each box has inside the lid a certificate 01 purity from Dr. Redwood, Ph.
