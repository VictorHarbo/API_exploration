Gentlmeiv,— i am honoured, by tho receipt of the above influential requisition, and as I consider that, in tbe present state of affairs, it is the duty of every man who la In a position to spnre the necessary time, and who has the interest of his adopted coun try at heart, to place his services at the disposal of his fellow colonists, I have much pleasure in accept ing your invitation, to olfer mvseif at the apuroach- lug general election as & caudidate for tho represen tation of the important district of South Bourke, in which I have been a resident, for many years. I thiuk it due to you and tho electors generally to Bubmit without delay, although very briefly, my views upon some ot the subjects which will pronably occupy the early attention ot the new Mouse of Assembly, and which, if elected, I Bball strive as an Independent member to carry out. First in importance is n new or amended Land Bill. In the absence of any belter system being pro posed, I am in favour of the publio lands being sold by auction; but any measure which will have the effect of enoouraging agriculture and settling this vexed question, shall have my Bupport. I am of ooinlon the time has Arrived when mode rate Protect Ion would be as beneficial to this country as Free Trade principles have been to Great Britain. We must have our own manufactures, for the sake of affording employment of a settled ohar&oter; to our children : if we huve net, we ebaU have our native- born population growing up to be a curse instead of a. blessing. While admitting this oountry can support a large number of people. I am opposed to their introduc tion without employment can be assured thorn If we can offer cheap land, plenty of work, with fair wages and light taxos, wo mav induce the right class of people to come here. Without suoh inducements o«r popula1 Ion, by immigration, will, I think, inoreaBO but slowly. ' ' The destruction of property by the late floods, calls imperatively for some means being at once adopted to nrcvent further loss. Having, with many of yoi. suffered, you may rely upon my not losing sight of this Important matter. The unsettled state of European affairs demands that our ports aud harbours should be placed, with out delay, iu an efficient state of defence. I am prepared, by every constitutional means, to resist the introduction of convicts to any portion of Australia. In conclusion, I would add that there are nume rous other questions which tho limits of an odlress preoludes my bringing under your notice. I shall, T trust before the election visit all parts of the dis triot, when I shall express more fully my views, and should they meet with your approval and secure my return I shall endeavour to discharge my duties If Jthfuliy to you and the colony, in which I have resided for the past twenty-four years, I have the honour to be.
