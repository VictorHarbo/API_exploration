ENCOURAGING ' IMMIGRATION. Moro actively perhaps than the Government of any other State the authorities in Western Australia are endeavouring to encourage Immigration. By the Ortona, which arrived at Fremantle a week or so back, there landed six Danish and one Swedish Immigrant, sent by the Western Australian Agent-General's office. All the men were young about 21 years of ago, and were agricultural labourers. The Swede was a skilled dairy farmer. They were met by an officer of the Statistical Department, and escorted to Perth, where they were to be offered work by the Government if they cared to accept It. They had paid only Â£6 10s for their passage, or half-fare, the balance being' defrayed by the Western Australian Government. According to the Perth "Herald," the Federal Immigration authorities appeared to be somewhat suspicious, but as the men stated they had no written contract, they could not take any stops In regard to them. It is understood that more Danish and Swedish labourers of the same class are to be sent out to Fremantle shortly. Much good should accrue from the importation of men such an those appear to be, and the Government of the western State is to be congratulated on its forward movement.
