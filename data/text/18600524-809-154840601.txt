The great advantages derived from the idaytation of this beautiful, new substance are, that ill sharp e_E os are avoided, no wires or springs are required, a natural elasticity hitherto wholly un ittainable and a fit perfected with tho most unerring iccuracy aro secured, while from the softnecs and legibility of the material used tho extraction of :ender root* becomes unnecessary, and the greates luppo.-t 13 given to the adjoining teeth when loose -r tender.

The Froprietoca of tha far-famed preparation known as ROW'S EMBROCATION; Or, FARMERS' FRIEND, (which has become ' A« familiar as a household word' in New South W^lcs), having received numer ous communications from percons resident in Vic toria urging the desirability of its introduction here, have determined on bringing it thus prominently before th* notice of nil owners of stock, feeling satis fied that it -~ill supersede every preparation which has hitherto been used in Victoria in all oa»« of Spreinn, Bruiscn, (Juts, Galls with the sadillo, girth or cillar, Wounds and Sores generally,— and that ere long it will occupy a place in every stable and on every station throughout tho colony. Were it neccRsary in order to convince those inter ested in the use of this h mbrocation of its superior and never-failing efficacy, hundreds of letters in support of their assertion might be appended to this advertisement by the proprietors, but the following extracts from le'.ters received by the Proprietors are deemed sufficient to convince the public of its general utility :— J. C. White, Esq., many years stud-master to the Australian Agricultural Company, Port St.pheni expresses his opinion that ' 110 one ought to travel without it ; its curative effects arc surprising. '— H. Zouch, Esq., states tliat 'previous to the introduc tion of the Embrocation into the force of the Southern Patrol, constant recourse was necessary to the skill of the Veterinary Surgeon, which has now been ren dered needless. Mr Andrew Gribben, the well-known farrier of Sydney, writes, 'that he has had such un doubted proofs' of its ifficacy, t.s to warrant him in recommending it most strongly.'— Henry Rotton, Esq , M.P., dcsii'tiiites it 'a most excellent appli cation.'— John Perry, EFq., thi mail contractpr, 'has uped it with great succflsn in his oxtcn«ve coaching establishment ;' and Mr Samuel Smith, coach proprietor, West Maitland, writes the following words in 'his letter to the proprietors :— ' 1 use it con stantly for all kinds of »ores on my horses, aud beg to state that 1 have never found anything to equal it for that purpose, though I have been for many years a coach proprietor, and havo tried all sorts of aj pli- cations.'
