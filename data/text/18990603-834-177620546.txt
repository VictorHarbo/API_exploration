Company in Toowoomba mikes it desirable that a tnateiial alteration should be made in the manner of our repre sentation in this town With the object ef affording better facilities to the Insuring public it has been decided to convert our Local Agency, into a Branch, under .the management of Mr S. G. Stephens, who has for upwards of twenty yeais so ably. '.repre- sented the Company, as agent in Toowoomba The effect of this alteration is that, all trans actions with this Company may at once be concluded on the spot, without the delay of of having to refer. to Brisbane as in the past Thus proposals may be accepted by Mr Stephens, and on the very day of his, accep- tance thereol he will be in the position to issue policies therefor. He will also -be in the position to observe the same despatch 'in regard to endorsements on policies, and the settlement of any claims that may arise. This change, in the status of our Local Re presentative is an important one, and I feel sure will be appreciated by our numerous supporters on the Downs;, as :in all' their insurance dealings with him they will be practically dealing with the Company direct. ..?.VV.
