US Barred To Scientist COPENHAGEN.—Dr. Sven Moller Kristensen, eminent ^ Danish scientist and literary critic, who last May won an award from the Danish-American Fund to visit the US, has been refused a visa by US immigration authorities. While no reason was given for the refusal, it is generally believed here to be based on Dr. Kristensen's membership of the Communist Party. His award was to enable him to pursue his studies of American literature—an interest which led him to arrange a series of broadcasts on American novels for the Danish Government radio. Dr. Kristensen has also spread the popularity of American literature here by translating a number of American works.
