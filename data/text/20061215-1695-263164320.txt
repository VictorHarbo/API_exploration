!N MEMORIAM JOCELYN ROBUCK HAAGEN-DAZS COFOUNDER ROSE Mattus, an Eastern European immigrant to the USA who founded Haagen-Dazs ice-cream with her husband, Reuben, died at the age of 90. While Reuben handled the marketing and devised the original recipe,-Rose handled the business end. One of her pioneering ideas was designing a distribution network that involved sending cases of ice-cream packed in dry ice to distant college towns on Greyhound buses. In her self-published 2004 memoir, Rose wrote that the reason they chose a Danish-sounding name was because of that nationâ€™s exemplary treatment of Jews during World War II. The Mattuses were known for their Zionism; a high tech training centre in Herzliya is named for them.
