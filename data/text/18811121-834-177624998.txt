At a meeting of the Board on the 20th August last, a letter was road from James Beck, stating that the Overseer of Works [John O'Dea) had passed John Ryan's con tract, the work not being done according to specification. Messrs. Hanly, M'Phuil, and Mason were appointed to inspect and report. On the 3rd November they reported us fol lows : — ' The logs used in the crossing near May's selection were not the specified width, being July ten inches at the southern end and :ight inches iu diameter at the northern end, nstead of twelve inches as specified. The ?ubble used in formation of road was more ;luin. half soil, anil not the sneritied depth, ind we consider this contract performed iu a nost unsatisfactory manner. The logs used n the crossing near Blaekie's were of very uferior timber.' The Inspector, on being examined, stated /hat he did not consider he would be justified u condemning work fairly done, even should ;h'e specifications not be strictly adhered to, mil that he was iu the habit of passing work before it was completed in some cases. A vote of censure was passed upon him, ilthough opposed by MeBsrs. Hanly, Grimes, Keleher, and Fitzgerald. At the meeting held on the 14th inst., in consequence of O'Dea not having sent in his resignation, Mr. Cooke moved — ' That a call i£ the whole Board be made for the next meeting, to consider the conduct of the Over seer of Works, and that in the meantime uo more work be undertaken.' When I rose to second the motion, Messrs. Hanly, Grimes, Keleher, and Fitzgerald did all they could, by continued interruptions, to prevent my speak ing, and the meeting was adjourned. Notwithstanding the above, the condemned work has been paid for upon O'Dea's certifi cate alone that the work is now properly done. The above are facts, which you will do well to bear in mind at the next election. Your obedient servant, CHARLES CLARK. East Talgai, Nov. 18th, 1881. AUSTRALIAN MUTUAL PROVIDENT SOCIETY.

GENTLEMEN.-Althoughinthe opinion of some of your number I acted im prudently in resigning my seat in the Assembly as one of your representatives, yet I beg to assure you, one and all, that I was actuated by tho highest motives of public policy. I value, as I think every member ought to value, the good opinion of my con stituents, and when a number of my consti tuents banded themselves together as a representative deputation, and waited on Ministers and stated that I did not represent the feelings of my constituents on a question which had already received the sanction of the representative branch of the Legislature, I felt that an indignity had been cast upon me, and an attempt made to discredit my Parliamentary utterances as your representa tive. Moreover, I found that, not satisfied with the deputationising business, the same parties were using the Press and other avenues of publicity to degrade me in the eyes of the electors. Conscious that what I had advocated in the Assembly in the pur chase of the Canning Downs estate was the outcome of conscientious conviction, and an honest desire to serve my adopted country, I felt that it would bo better for me to resign my seat than be made the victim of studied and continuous misrepresentation, instigated by certain members of the Government, Having waited some days for a candidate to offer himself to you who would possess your undivided confidence, and finding that no such candidate was forthcoming, and having received urgent requests and solicita tions from all parts of the electorate to offer myself again to the constituency, I have con sented to do so, and now appeal to you for re- election, and ask you to let me know through the ballot box, whether I still enjoy the confidence you have twice during the past three years generously reposed in me. 1 need hardly tell you that I am a decided supporter ot the Hon. S. W. Griffith, the Leader of the Opposition, and am still pre pared to assist him in his gallant struggle against tyranny and corruption. No Queenslander with any patriotic feeling can have the slightest faith in a Government kept in power by ' a solid phalanx 1: of ser vile followers, many of whom cling to the Ministry from purely Belfish motives, and are supporting the Government because the Go vernment support them. The payment of £550 to Mr F. A. Cooper, in direct violation of a resolution of the Assembly, for revising statutes which are now found to be all but valueless, and have to be recalled for amend ment, illustrates tho corrupting influences at work to obtain support. ; The financial policy of the present Govern ment must, before long, land Queensland into a boghole or quagmire, from which it will be difficult to extricate it. During the last three years they have increased the public debt from ten millions to fouiteen millions, chiefly expended upon nonrepro ductive works; while, during the same period, British and German immigration was stopped, and tho burden of interest of this large debt consequently falls upon a sparse population. They are now ajionating the best portions of the public estate on '? Peak Downs and elsewhere to their friends and supporters at from 10s to 15s the acre, in very large blocks ; while, at the same time, they are charging men of small means, and cultivators of the soil, -£4 and £5 the acre for eighty-acre blocks. The interest on our public debt is no\y nearly £700,000 a year, or more than one third of our annual revenue, and the colony iB drained of this enormous sum annually to be sent to London to pay the interest on our debentures. In tho face of these facts the public money is frequently frittered away. For instance £2000 was voted to Mr Landsboroughfor hisexploration of the Western country, while the claim made by Mr P. O'Sullivan for the grant of £500 to the widow and orphan of a public officer, who was murdered in the performance of his duty, was scornfully rejected. To prevent a serious crisis, they will have to go on, year after year, borrowing not* only tomeet the payments of the interest, but, to carry on useless works beyond there' quirements of our small, and, I am sorry to say, decreasing European population. Gentlemen, do nob be led away- by the Premier's boasted prosperity of the colony. The laviBh expenditure of the borrowed mil lions among our small population must of necessity create a kind of fictitious pros perity; but the re-action which is inevitable will fall most heavily upon the taxpayers in tho Bettled districts, and particularly upon those who havo made Quoenslnud Jheir por mdnent home. My political opinions on all tho great ques tions of tho day are pretty woll kno'wn to you, and I shall not trouble you with a recapitulation of them here. I leave myself : confidently in your hands, fooling assured from your past treatment of me, I aboil receivo justice. I havo tho honor to bo, Gpntlemen, Your obedient Servant, FRANCIS KATES.

A Refreshment Boom is also necessary at. the Warwick Railway Station for the cou vonienco of passengers botween Stanthorpo and Toowoomba* Tenders require to be called for the line from Hifrhfields, and also for the line from Warwick to Killarney, these I believe I can undertake to have immediately proceeded with. In the matter of the claim of the Govern ment against the Corporation of Warwick for the Waterworks, it will be my duty to have this modified to aomo extent. As to the Exchange Lands at Allora, I considor, in the face of two bad seasons out of three, that some extension of time should be allowed the purchasers ; should they require it, this I would adovcate. 1 am also in favor of a line (which 1 believe would he remunerative) from either Greenmount, Cliftou, or thereabouts, pro ceeding thence through Clifton Back Plains to Leyburn, and thoreafter via Westbrook Homestead Area to Oakey Creek. I may state as the subject is now being mooted, that 1 have had some experience ol Coolie labor. I will vote and work strongly against the introduction of these people into Towns and Stations or anywhere beyond the boundary of Sugar Plintations, and even then if they are to cost the country one shilling. . ? I regret that 1 am not sufficiently acquainted with some paits of the Electorate so as to be thoroughly conversant with the wants thereof. In the event of my election, it will be my duty and interest to visit these portions and obtain tho necessary knowledge.
