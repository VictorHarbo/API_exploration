THE PORT OF NEWCASTLE. THE following Statistics of the Port of Newcastle (collated and compiled from the most authentic sources) have been carefully brought up to the present time, and will be studied with interest by a large number of our readers desirous of becoming more thoroughly acquainted with the post and present commerce of the principal northern harbour of this colony. We begin with some particulars relative to the coal exported from Newcastle during the last sixteen years ; the figures being such as serve to manifest the very great importance of the trade in coal-the main staple of the Hunter River district. The details are such as go to show that this trade has gradually increased in magnitude, notwithstanding those occasional fluctuations of prosperity, which seem to be inevitable in all mercantile and industrial affairs.

At this first decrease, recorded in our table, the coal exported was nevertheless as much as 139,938 tons. In 1859, the increase of the coal exported over that of the previous year amounted to 101,483 tons. In 1860, the like increase (still ascending) was 42,510 tons, In 1861, there was another decrease in respect of the Hills total of the previous year the amount of decrease being 27,896 tons; that is" to say, 255,910 tons, instead of 283,836 tons. During the next five years there was an annual increase of coal ' exports, the least increase being that shown by the returns for 1865. Thus, in 1862, the increase of exported coal was 101,583 tons ; very closely approximating to that which was exported in 1869. In 1863, the increase was 12,820 tons; in 1861, 89,617 tons-, in 1865, 2142 tons; and is 1800, 183,613 tons, In 1867, there was a third decrease the amount of that decrease being 63,682 tons that is to say, 692,033 tons, in st, end of 645,615 tons. In 1868, the increase of too coal exported over that of the previous year amounted to 95.1S7 tons-656 tons (in the annual increase alone) more than was expected from the port of Newcastle altogether in the your 1874\. In 1869, the increase of coal exported over that of 1868 was 18,368 tons. Last your (1870), there was a fourth occasional decrease on the antecedent year ; the amount of such decrease being 13,389 tons- 692,099 tons instead of the 706,488 tons of coal exported in 1869. From this it may be seen that the coal exported annually through the port of Newcastle, including the trade coastwise, intercolonial, and foreign, may be fairly estimated at seven hundred thousand tons, representing, even in its present stage of imperfect development, a commercial and industrial interest of which the colony may justly be proud. All these figures may be depended upon, as they are derived from an official Borneo. CHARGES ON VESSELS. As respects the charges on vessels at the port of Newcastle, the following statement shows the number of all vessels (exclusive of coasters) entered inwards and outwards at this port, and the charges actually paid during the year 1870: Total number of vessels inwards, 2610-689,968 tons ; the amount of dues paid thereon being £6157 4s. 6d. The total of vessels outwards was 2681-703,758 tons; the amount of dues paid thereon to the Customs at Newcastle Icing £7289 3s. 8d. These figures may serve, in. some degree, to show the extent of the present commerce of Newcastle, the nature of which does not as yet seem to be generally recognised. AMOUNT OF REMiNtfE FOR THE!

All the vessels belonging to Newcastle are now required to be registered in the Custom-house, at the corner of Scott and Holton streets, In that city the sub-collector of the port (Mr. W. R. Logan) furnishing in every case a certificate of such registration. The number of the vessels belonging; to the port of Newcastle on the 2nd of September, 1871. thus registered, with their tonnage, in pursuance of Acts of Parliament, was as followd;-Nineteen vessels, whose tonnage is under £0 tons, the total tonnage of which was returned as 692 tons. Also thirty-three vessels, whose term ice is over 60 tons, the total tonnage of which was to turntdas7197 tons. Grand total of tonnage of the fifty two vessels belonging to Newcastle seven thousand seven hundred and eighty- nine tons. From returns compiled from shipping registrars up to the 1st of January, 1871 (completed! with much care, and published in the Herald in April last, by Mr. Frederick C. Jarrett), it is an ascertained fact that Newcastle has the highest average tonnage of any port in Australasia namely, 100 per vessel. Auckland, in New Zealand, has the lovie only 50 per vessel. The like average for Melbourne is 165 tons and that for Sydney, 125 tons. The average tonnage of the Sydney vessels is greatly reduced by the river steamers and of carries. Mr. James C. Heywood has communicated to the Argus three columns of impressions about Australia. Concerning himself the writer's sole explanation is that he has recently arrived from England for the purpose of making a tour through the colonfe«,pursuant to instructions from friends who had entrusted him with an important mission. This mission, so far as can be gathered from the letter, is to make known in England some of the stem realities social, moral, and political which the daring immigrant has to contend with. It appears that Mr. Heywood commenced his peregrinations from Adelaide, where he purchased an outfit. and had advanced as far as Deniliquin in the course of zh> sagging the colonies, when the cacoethes ecribendicame upon him. and taking up his parable be has launched out in a strain of severe criticism upon colonial institutions, particularly denouncing the intense feeling of democracy that prevails, especially in Victoria. South Australia, has on the whole, escaped easily, but rather because her peculiar! - ties have failed to excite the attention of the distinguished stranger, whose presence amongst us at so recent a date as a few weeks back was quite unsuspoctod,-flissrixr,
