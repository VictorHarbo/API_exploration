ROOT ARY & COMMERCIAL "The Advertiser" Office, i ' Tuesday evening, March 12. The returns of gold output in five states of the Commonwealth-Victoria, NewSouth Wales, Queensland, West Australia, and Tasmania and New Zealand for the first two months of the present year (says the Melbourne "Argus" of March 8) compare with those for the corresponding period last year as follows: \- ? .?- acco. , 1901.

Wool is being shipped more freely from the various States than, has been the case since the opening of the season. This (says office Melbourne 'Age" of March 8 was only what was expected, inasmuch as it was plain that growers and. others would take some time to fall in, with ruling values, while the longer wool was held the better ' the chance of a rise appeared. According to Dalgety & Co.'s Mest compiled figures, giving the exports from Australasia, from July 1, 1900 to February 28, \- 1901, together with the corresponding periods in the two previous seasons, the decrease is now but 132,053 bales, against 210 000 bales at the end of January, and 217 000 bales at the end of December. The figures are as follow: Decrease on States. 1900-01. 1899-00. 1899-00 1898 Bales. Bales'. Bales. Ships. Victoria. 394,311 360,385 26,074 342.003 K.S. Wales ..441,031 470,067 25,8 576 255 6\.

The total import trade of Argentina for the first nine months of 1900 was, stated ' **Bradstreets" of February 2, 87,000,000 dollars in value, and the share of the United States (a trifle over 9,000,000 dollars), was exceeded by that of Italy, Which nearly reached 12,000,000 dollars. The most for nMdaible competitor is shown to be the United Kingdom, which sold the Argentine Republic during the same time goods to the amount of over 30,000,000 dollars. Ger- many also made a better record than the United States, her share having amounted to nearly 13,000,000 dollars. A significant fact is that as compared with the record for the corresponding period of the preced- ing year the export trade of the United States to Argentina fell off 1,500,000 dollars, and that of Great Britain 2,600,000 dollars, while that of Germany increased 2,500.000 dollars, and of Italy 1,000,000 dollars. These' figures show that Germany's well directed efforts to forge ahead in the markets of South America are bearing fruit. Italy's favorable showing is probably due to the immigration of Italians into Argentina. The. wheat market continues quiet and very little business of importance is doing; both shippers and millers are buying 1 gently and in no case has a parcel sale been mentioned. On the other hand farmers and holders are disinclined to accept the prices now obtainable. The low rates ruling in the London market and the little enquiry for Australian cargoes is solely responsible for the apathy on this side. There have been one or two small parcels placed at our quotations,' and some business is also reported in farmers' lots, but trade generally of extreteiely quiet, and there is nothing of importance to notice. Shipping parcels are still quoted at 2/8 per bushel on trucks at Port Adelaide, and farmers' lots at 276 per bushel on trucks at Port Adelaide. lena remains quiet at £6 5/ to £6 7/0 per ton for leading brands. Pollard is steady at 10d. to 11d. per bushel, and bran at 10d. to 10d. per bushel. With respect to the New Zealand market on February 27, Messrs. Kaye & Cafter report as follows The first. (ministers to lost six' weeks was granted toy unaltered. iwetttbw cowpea, bali the last half (with the exception of one day) has been excellent for harvesting operations, and the bulk of grain in our more iinmetn-aite districts has been safely got into stick', without any material damage or loss from heavy winds. Undoubtedly the yields are heavy, and already well accredited reports have come to hand from reliable sources of large returns per acre, and the whole look of the country indicates there will be decidedly above average yields. Wheat. Onay a few farmers are this season following the reprehensible practice of thrashing direct from the stock; hence, owing to the backwardness of the season, it will be fully a month yet before any reasonable quantity of grain finds its way to ports of shipment. Old wheat is well held, and some varieties are even scarce; and lers' needs therefore are likely alone to be sufficient to keep prices steady, whilst the tendency of steameR agents to reduce freights to London strengthens the general position for headers. Oats. Large quantities are now being delivered, and the quality as uniformly good, root, really excellent. The War Office seems to have been distributing his favors to our Victorian rivals, as we cannot hear of any positive orders having been recent ay. placed for execution in New Zealand; however, prices have now reached to such a level as will probably lead to salve business being carried -through in the near future; meantime Bluff B grade of old salts is pretty well sold out, and no quantity of now can be available there for ship- ment for scene time. Duns are very good quality, whilst Danish and Canadian are not far behind. We look for a busy time as soon as the new samples got distributed. sTour. Tile Millers' Trust has been formed, and will commence operations on March 1. All the masters have not joined in, but those who have combined are satisfied of the ultimate success of the ocanhination. We are somewhat sceptical, but prefer to wait awhile before passing judg-. ment. Prices of flour are likely to remain steady for the present. Barley. Undoubtedly this cereal shows signs of weather, but little more than taking on the bright bloom, otherwise the grain is uninjured. He mand is good, and prime lines being readily taken up at full rates, waist the less perfect, being cheaper, also finds a ready market. We are inclined to the belief that early buyers will come off beat. Slipping Little forward chartering, as so few ships are disengaged, and owners are in the strong position. We are wanting vessels for April, May, and June loading, and shall be glad of offers. A six-'wcelsily steam service has been started to run to South Africa, the ' first steamer being the s.s. Otarama, to sail March 9. Lititfle encourage- ment is being given to the movement, as freights are not found workable; lines are What, 45; oats, 55/; flour, 45; bran and pollard, 55; hay, 100; all plus 10 per cent, primage. These steamers will call at Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, di sufficient cargo offers. The import markets are quiet, and there is little doing beyond the ordinary demand for sorting up' lines. Sugars have fair no rice, and-a steady business continues to be done in grocery and manufacturing sorts. During the past week considerable business has been done in China teas, and sales representing, 1,200 packages of fine to common grades are reported. Coffees are without special notice; and only a retail enquiry exists at the present time. Dried fruits are moving a little more freely, but no large lines are going out. Preserved ash continues to sell freely, and a good distributing business is' being done. Kerosine is unchanged, and there is no altera- tion in values. The demand for teorting-up lines is well maintained, but we do not hear of any parcel business being put through. Agents for Robinson's patent groats and Keen's mustard report good Business. Metals are generally quiet, but there is some enquiry both for barb and fencing wires, and trade has been done in both fines. Bulli oils and chemicals have ordinary sorting up demand. In jute goods the only lines mentioned are small lots of bran bags at 4/3 per dozen. The usual sales are making in all leading brands of liquors. With respect to the London sugar market, Mr. C. ?zarnikow, in his weekly price current, dated January 31, writes:- The cold weather on the Combinent, interfering once more with' river navigation has caused a firmer tone in our market, and, assisted by bear covering, prices have advanced about 1½d. per cwt. for present crop. The trade remain more or less apathetic, and buy only for their í¡ramcdia!te needs, Still seeing no necessity, in the face of the etaiUs coal position, to anticipate requirements. Besides, the possibility of duties being proposed as the next budget does not us yet attracts much attention; the subject has been discussed on previous occasions without any action being taken, and bids renders buyers as yet sceptical of du ties now being imposed, even at a time when additional revenue must he provided. The -person market, notwithstanding fine in usual JJ Mine Mill and prices provement on him am... and have receded from 4 9-32 cents to 45 cents, caused I I doubtless, by sugar being offered more freely from Cuba, where the crop prospects are BathUaotory, ¡ though the density of the juice is somewhat dis- appointing. Early new crop shipments from Java are likewise obtainable at easier rates, which the three United States buyers view with mistrust, looking to the figures recently published of the increased area under ealtntucron in that island. Messrs. Rocke & Sons, in their skin and a hides report, dated London, January 31, write: [ Salted Petts. New Zealand With small supplies prices keep firm, and are now at a high level. The unsatisfactory- feature is that finished skins cannot be sold at prices relative to those ruling for pickled pelts. Business generally is quiet, but the demand for pelts is at present quite equal to absorbing the small supply available. Australian The few which have come forward have readily found buyers at fully late rates. Basils. New Zealand With a moderate demand arrivals continue to bring about late rates. Supplies are small. Australian Prices have been barely maintained during the past three weeks, but a fair business has been done. Owners show more inclination to meet buyers in the case of heavy weights, and some sales have been made at comparatively low prices. The demand is still chiefly for light seconds, which are worth almost as much as medium weight firsts. Hides At the auctions hold on the 10th inst. 8,373 Australian salted ox and cow were offered, and only 268 sold. The few Sydney's sold at last prices, but the Queensland Meat Works hides, which formed the bulk of the supply, could not be sold at 5d. reduction. Leather Business keeps quiet, and prices show no improvement. Sheepskins At the public sales held here on the 24th inst. 4,880 bales Australasian were offered, and 4,600 bales told. There was a fair attendance of buyers, but competition was not brisk. Some good lots of coarse combing crossbred skins were withdrawn. As compared with last sales' prices (December 15 we quote Combing merinos, par to 3d. per lb. lower; do. fine crossbreds, 5d. per lb. lower; do. coarse crossbreds, 5d. to 5d. per lb. lower. Rabbit Sims-On the 18th inst. 1,466 bales New Zealand and Australian were offered, and practically all sold. There was a full attendance of buyers and good competition, especially for best skins. New Zealand winter skins-which were in good supply were well competed for at M. to 1d. per lb. advance compared with December rates. Other qualities showed practically no change. Australian and Tasmanian skins sold at about last sales' rates, but off season's skins were sometimes 4d. to 4d. cheaper. We quote New Zealand, good to prime, 1/5 to 193; fair to good, 12 to 15; common, 7d. to 14; small and suckers, 6d. to 8d.; silver-grey and black (furriers), 1/6½ to 226 per lb.; Australian and Tasmanian, good to prime, 12 to 1/43; 'air to good, 11d. to 1/2; common, 5d. to 10d. ; small and suckers, sold. to 9d.; black and fawn, 7d. to 9d. per lb.; hare skins, 1/6 to 3/2 per dozen.
