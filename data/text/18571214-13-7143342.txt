COMMERCIAL DÍTELMGENÜJfi. Argus Office, Saturday Évèùiait. Export entries were passed to-day for only 97* ponces of gold, 72 ounces being for ship- ment in the European and 25* in th» Kent. lhere has been nothing doing m this market ¿£? £ank8 ari^e,A m&T; with raw gold and at present the demand for bills on Erv' land is so limited that they are not eager to Bbip.

The escorts have been fully maintained not withstanding the general dissatisfaction that the diggers express at the recent heavy de c mo m the market value of theirproiu.ee. We hear on all sides from the gold-fields; of miners refusing to take the prices at Present offered, and those who con nffoid to do so are hoarding. These report! are horne out income degree hythe inoréis" m the deposits in the local gold-offices, but unleaB the proportion held in private hands lar exceeds that stored in the places of publio deposit, hoarding cannot be said to be (tome on to any great extent.

Tho Maryborough and Dunolly district appears to be the most improving at the present time, the population and the escott returns maintaining a propor- tionate increase. There is nothing new from Ararat and Pleasant Creek, nor from the new fields still further west, now in process of being opened up : none of these have turned out rioh as yet, although gold has been ob- tained in paying quantities. The chief in- telligence from Ballaarat relates to the Carngham diggings, and Is not very en- couraging. The disputes with the owners of the Boil remain unsettled, and the popula- tion was being reduced rapidly by parties clearing out for other localities. A new rush is reported in the direction of Wardy Yallook and another to Bloomer Gally, at Iiinton's. Several good nuggets have boen taken out at the latter. Machinery is being erected at Avooa, and at the Glott- patrick quartz-reef about seven miles distant. The lead on the Bolivia Beef, at Castlemaine, has been recovered, and is yielding sis ounces to the ton. Gi ave complaints are made of the Chinese in this locality, for their waste of water, and for their not providing drains to carry, away the slush from the puddling-ma chines. This district has hitherto had to complain of the want of maohinery, but the works of the Castlemaine Quartz Crushing Co., erected under the superintendence of MebBrs. B. and W. Thomson, practical ma- chinists, are likely to obviate this complaint. The works are thus described :-1st. There it a series of binns in which the quartz, on its aulval, may be stowed Olid put under look and key, the miners at their option retaining the key in their own possession until their turn arrives for crushing. Tho quartz is then wheeled on to a large platform lined with iron, from which.it ia shovelled into the crushing boxes. The steam hammers, which are ' each connected with separate pistons and cylinders, fall upon it with an immense weight from a distance of two and a half feet, crashing it nearly to powder, and foroin? it through an iron grating, or solid cast steel block, with drilled holes, into a shute, which communicates with the Chilian basin; and ia order as much as possible to prevent the Io3S of fine gold, a stream of water is forced through a pipe with a number of holes ' divided in it, and falls upon the crushed quartz as it merges from the stamper-bosei, and by thus covering it with water before it enters the Chilian mill, prevents the leafy gold from floating on the surface of the basin. ' The tailings are discharged through fine wire gauze over the ledge of a oircular collar in tho centre of the basin, and find their way through holes drilled in the bottom, with a shute below by which they are carried off. This obviates the loss of mercury and large particles of quarti frequent in basins which discharge from the outside, owing to the centrifugal mo- tion of the water caused by the revolu- tion of the rollers. These rollers are four inches broader than those usually employed, thus presenting a larger surface to act upon the quartz, The edges of these rollers are wrought iron, which, from its nature, crushes much finer than cast; but whioh, from tha impossibility of manufacturing them in this country, save at an enormous expense, have not hitherto been employed. They hare been carefully turned, so as to render the pressure equal upon all parts, so that «moll I patticles may not escape crashing. The basin is a very fine piece of English casting, and the whole fittings of the machinery are.iroa bolted on to a solo-plate of solid iron, which is again bolted on to a foundation of timbs! and concrete. The action is easy ; and, coa sidering the power, the vibration is varj slight, A copious supply of clear water ha« been secured by sinking a large well of con siderable depth alongside the maohinery From Bendigo and the other mining dis triots there 1B nothing to report. At Steiglitz sixty-five tons of quartz were crushed at the beveral mills during the week, and produced R2R nnnrfinof amalgamated cold. In the Money Market a circumstance as singular as uncalled for has taken place during, the week. For nearly two months past rumors have been in circulation that changes were about tobe made-in tho Mel- bourne branch of the union Bank. Causes were assigned for theEe changes of a most ex- traordinary character. It was stated that the local directors had received enormous ad- vances from the management, and that ono of the London di.-octors, now in this colony, had come out purposely to set things right. Many other rumors arose out of these of tho most exaggerated character, which did not obtain one moment's credence in commercial circles, but which at length coming to the ears of that class least likely to be well ia' foimed In commercial matters, led to a three days' " run" upon the bank by the small do- I poBitora and note-holders. Not one single mer- cantile or trading account of any amount WJJ removed, but, on the contrary, everything . waa done in the "City" to allay the rumord, and prevent the spread of the movement. Air. Dalgety, the London dlreotor referred to, ad- dressed a letter to the editor of this journal, denying the existence of any cause for the " idle reports now being industriously circu- lated." Ameetingof theOhamber of Commerce was held, when, amidst general observations from the largest muster of members that hil ever been brought together, that the Union , Bank stood on too firm a basis to require sup \ port from theChamber, a resolution waspasBad unanimously expressing entire confidence in Union Bank notes. Before this meeting had taken place the tide was beginning to turn. and on the earrie afternoon many small ac- counts that bad been closed wera reopened. On the following morning the drain was en- tirely at an end, while tho-reflux of notes and t-pecie was considerable. There was one gool result from the meeting of the Chamber of Commerce. Some of the rumors were muda public in a way that would permit of thalr v being reported by the press.aud which enablai ' Mr. ll'Calloch, who had thought it . his dut/ to make inquiries, to give them an unqua' : lined denial. If some such a course lill ' been adopted when theso " idle reporta" j veie first 'circulated on tho arrival of tUa,> August mail, or if steps had been taken Jo ' allay «hem when they increased in oircurh. . Btantiuiity on the arrival of the September., mail, the run would not, in all probability have taken place. ' The Union. Bank of Australia is an un chartered institution, and numbers among its propriotaiy many ot tho wealthiest men ia London, every one of whom is liable to all the bank's obligations to the full extent of his foi lane. The arrangements said to be come to by tks managers of all the banks as to the redaction of the rate of exchange, tbo granting of inte- rest on deposits, and the raising of the rato3 of discount, have not yet bson carried out. Money Is by no means scarce, but for com- mercial purposes it is not obtainable outside the banks except at exorbitant rates of inte- rest. The banks charge 7 per cent, for dis- counting bills having under ninety-five diys' currency, and 8 per cent, minimum for those having ovor ninety-fivo days to run. For renewals and for overdrawn accounts 10 pur cent, is charged. Exchange on England is now, at all the banks, at 1 per cent, promium at sixty days' eight : for amounts under £50, at 2 per cant, premium at thirty days' sight. Freight on gold by direct Bteamersor sailing-vessels, 8Jd, per ounce deliverable in London : insurancB 1¿ per cent. ; by the overland route f par cent.-that is, 7d. per. ounce, a- nearly as pos- sible ; insurance, li to If per cent. The events of the wesk have checke 1 operations in the Stook and Share Market, hut prices are nominally the same. Colonial Bank of Australasia shateB have changa! hands at £5 16s" with numerous buyers at anything under that rate. Australasian Firs Insurance Company have been eold at 60 par cent, preminm. In debentures there has not teen anything doing. The Bhipments of gold specie have bean £13,470, of which £8,470 wero for Hong Koag, and £5,000 for Singapore. The Ohinr3e pas sengera to these two polls took with them other large sums, whioh wero not enterei on the ship:' books. One thousand one hundred and one immi- grants have arrived at the Port of Melbourne this week, consisting of 181 from the neigh- boring colonies, 822 from the United King- dom, 4 from Sweden, and 91 from the United States. The net addition to the population of the colony by the seaboard during the year up to noon to day, corrected by comparison with the official returns of the Immigration Department, has been 40,245 souls. The fol- lowing are the monthly totals of the returns for the current year:- Arrived.

The growers aro very firm in demanding full rates, and prefer prosing the lots to giv- ing way to the equally firm feeling displayed by buyers. The disposition to purchase is very plainly shown by the general nnxlety that prevails up to a certain point, beyond which there are no bidders to be found in tua crowded rooms. It is probable that larga quantities of the prcent clip wi" be shipped by the growers. The marks ond prices of loti publicly raid this weok «III be found la another column. ' The non-arrival of the steamer, now sit days overdue, has not caused so muoh annoy- ance this month as on former occasions, partly bc:auso the publiomind has had other Bubjech engrossing it-, att-.ntion, and partly because the Emtu will not bring answers to any mail despatched hence. As the tims approaebf -, however, when tho JSuropem will eall with the homeward mail, feau are begin- ning to be enteiiaincd that a conreo of pelt may be lost,-a circumstance to be regrette! in the present condition of commères. The European will sail during the night of the lath, or early on the 16th inst. The Com mitt ;o of the Ohaml3r of Commerce have, through their secretary, called the attention of the Pc3tmaster-General to the evils caused by the continued irregularities attonding the soi deo. Ihe Chamber of Commerce have caused the following letter to bo addressed to tho Hoa, the Po3tniD9ter-General, on the subject of the repeated failures in the performance of the mail cCuilacc: '"Sir,-By the direction of the Committeoof the Chnmber of Commerce I have the honor to bring before your notice the proccsdlngi which have token place at a meeting of thotr body for the special consideration of tue Mall Contract Service.

" Up to this time there have never t sen more than four vessels employed at one time, and lor the greater part of the period only three.

" In direct contravention of this engagement, the Company have never had an extra vessel at Suez or Sydney, at neither of which ports was there a reasonable probability of their being able to obtain by biro or otherwise aa efficient substitute.

I " In laying before you the foregoing atato I xtent of past irregularities, the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce feel bound to record their belief that the Infliction of penalties, ! ewe ver stringently exacted, is no sufficient reparation for the loseca ana inconvenlenoea ccmplalned of, and would euggeet that tho Home authorities would better serve oolo nfal interests by exasting preliminary con- trol, in insisting on the Company's placing fend retaining on the line the full number of efficient steam vessels contracted for. *' The Ohamber, while fee ling it to be their I duty to protest and romonstrata against this most inadequate dlsoharge of a contraot so liberally subsidised, express the hope that their views will meet with your concurrence and support, and be transmitted through the Government to the Homo authorities by the ensuing mail. » I " I have the honor to be.

The Register gives the following report of the state of the flour market :- . Uho period Just anterior to tho timo of harvest is usually dull, and the present scacon forms no excep- tion to tho rulo. There Is, however, no ground for complaint, ni transaction«, although limited, »re loud fide, ami credit Is well maintained. Several failures for Urge nmouuts In tbo sister colony hovo very naturally tonded tooroatounoa,«'no33hoio ; but thoie is nu cauBO whatever for Reprehension. Wo havo had long-continued rains, and tno crops are now fist maturing: addod to which, both our pastoral and mining Interests are flourishing. The flour market has been difficult of management, and Eoaie few losses have beonsusHfnodby dealors, through spcoulailvo holding. Hlthorto ViitOlla lim Been our chief marn«t for breaoMufts, that colony having- produced hut a small propoiilon of the wheat required by Us Inhabitants for domostto consumption. There Ima, however, been an incrcaced extent of culti- vation thero every succeeding year, and durlug the present year, irom the want of reliablo statistic!, ii. has been difficult to ascorts'n what quantity c1 wheat and flour wes held by producors and ulhtip. It was Buppc^ed that there was no1 sufficient on hand to moot the requirements of tho colony till the ond of the year. It was also sup- posed that our own stocks weroeoinowhat amollar thin they really nore. This led lo speculative doallugi hore, and although tho prlnoipal holders cleared out al remunerativo pnces, yet a few poisons who have hold on until the present are likely to become losors. Tin quantity of the last soason's flour on hand, for oxporti tlon, may bo estimated at under 8,000 tons. Har«3 operations aro now being commenced on tho plains and will sow be general throughout tho colony. Oilor of from fis. to 5s. id. per busbot of 00 lbs., deliver« lu Adolaido, aro freely mndo for the new crop. Bus brands of flour may be quotod at lil. per tin o 2,000 lbs. Our exports of breadstuff» to Vlctorli during tho present year have amounted to upwards a 30,000 tons; and although it Is not probable that : imaller quantity than that will bo roqulrod froo us each year, for somo years to carno, yoi it is clear that other markets w;n soouo or later have to be opened up for the salo a our surplus produce. There-ultof a triol sblpmon of flour sent to Eng'-ind hi the St. 3f<c/tael by i mercantile firm In this city during the early part o tie present year kaus us to hope that a peiannon mnrkot may bo found in tho mother- country whlol shall scouro to tho farmer a remunerative mullum t pilce for hisgr.%in when trading with tho othor colo nlcs becomes unprofitable.

Arrivals continue large, and as nearly every ship adds to the already over- stocked market, there is no present prospect of improvement, as, though there is a steady demand for most descriptions of labor, the supply is so far above all possible requirements that employment is difficult to be procured. Haymakers and thorough agricultu- ral servants are most in request of that class of labor; though most of the engagements of this description are made in the country ; indeed, for all source of field and rough labor, MeIbourne is the most unlikely market to afford employment. Competent domestic servants, both male and female, have no difficulty in procuring situations and wages are steady at the late reduced rates. Married couples with young families are most difficult to provide for, oven at a reduced scale on ge- neral rate of wages. The whole of the immigrants per Ebba Brahe are what are termed "assisted" ; many have already proceeded to join their friends ,and of the whole 440 conveyed here by this vessel, not one requires to search for employment. The following are the nominal rates of wages: - With rations - Mar- ried couples, without families, £60 to £70 per annum; do., with families, £50 to £65 ; gardeners, £55 to £60 do. ; grooms, £40 to £59 do. ; stockkeepers, shepherds, hutkeepers, £20 to £25 ; general farm servants, 20s. per week; ploughmen, 20s. to 25s. do. ; bullock-drivers on the roads, 25s. to 30s. do. ; do. on stations, 20s. do. ; men cooks, £70 to £80 per annum; female do., £30 to £40 do. ; thorough female servants, £25 to £28 do. ; housemaids, £25 do.; laundresses, £30 to £35 do.; nursemaids, £18 to £20 do. The following are considered the standard weekly rations :-12 lbs, beef or mutton, 10 lbs. flour, 2 lb sugar, ¼lb. tea. Without rations.-Compositors, Is, 6l per thousand ; do., by the week, 4l 4s. ; pressmen, 4l. 4s. to 4l. 10s, do. ; carpenters, 12s. to 14s. per day; masons, 14s. to 16s. do. ; plasterers, 12s. to 15s. do.; bricklayers, 18s to 15s. do. ; blacksmiths, 12s. to 16s. do, ; quarrymen, 9s. to 12s. do. ; woodsplitters and fencers, 4s. to 5s. per ton ; fencing by the rod, material to split only, 6s. ; laborers on the roads, 6s. to 8s. per day, - wood, water, and tents found. SEAMEN'S WAGES.-The rates of wages for this de- scription of labor are unchanged. There is a brisk de- mand for hands, but men come forward quite in pro- portion to all requirements. The following continue to be the current rates of wages paying:-Coasting voyages, 5l per month ; India or China and back, 4l. 10s. per month ; India, China, west coast of America and England, 4l. 10s. per month ; and same rate for England direct.

Argus Offlco, Saturday Evening. The Import maikut gonoraliy has presented a moro animated uppcuuuco during tho paît wcok, than for aomo time past. Tbo amount of business has been confined lo small orders, for consumption, but tin aggrograte has boin considerable ; when compared with tno utter stagnation which has la'torly dvorhung tin market, this lias c .usort nn appanrance of comparative liveliness. Tho abolition, lu a great measure, of the credit system formerly existing willi tho Inland trado, has naturally for a long period Induced country storekeepers to purchoso very sparingly, and the bono fit of the sound system of short credits is a'roady be- coming \Isiblo. During tho past week country buyers have boon oxtomlvo purjllasors, and although their dealings have boen inadequate to afford roliof to tho maikot,overburdened with goodsoi it is, it has eui« 1 a bettor fooling, and rovived a hopo of increasing confi- dence A partial cessation of shipments and vory consi- derable reduction in stocks must, howover, take place ero any pro»po"t of improvement li prices can bj looked for. Liquors.-Alos in bulk aro In steady domind, anl continuo of roidy talo. Bass's No. 8, has boon much inquired for, and salos made at 01.17s. 6d. per hogs- head, whilBt other brands in sound and good condition havo boon moro frooly purchased at proportionate ratos. Bulk portor is still voiy dull of salo, and although tho approach of Christmas has induood ord-», the pr'-s continuos unvaried. Bottlcl Beers, of undoubtedly genuine Importation, aro in vory good ii"]ulry, and those of most-preferred bottlors readily saleable at fully quoted prices. In Spirits a fafr amount of trade has been done-blandy having the praforenco over othor sorts. Wines havo boen of Vi 17' limited salo, without variation In pricos. Flour, Grain, io.-Tho flour markot has continuo! steady throughout the week, and considerable amount of buBlnosi has bcon done-sales being entirely for consumption. PurchasoB for country stations, to bo convoyed in by tho roturn wool-drajs, havo beon con Bidorsblo, and both bakers In town and country dealers have, lnducod by low pricos, bought Ïiretty freely. Thora has also boon inquiry for Gill- ian and Amorlcan flour, in bairol ; as, how over, stockB of both those descriptions aro vory low, orders havo been oxecutcd In other kinds. The report of an extensivo salo to a firm in town on speculation has. howover, not created any gonoral speculative fooling, and as tho heavy stocks of Ade- laldo flour so long hold back are beginning to bo , pressed on tho market, thero Is overy fear that i present prices cannot"bo sustained. A sale of 2.IJ3 tons Chilian flour is roportod to havo been lately modo at Sydnoy at 122.10a per ton. Wheat Is vory dull of salo. At this sea ion mlllors are of courso un desirous of purchasing, and although wo quoto 6s, as tho price of colonial wheat, we doubt if that prloo could bo proourod for any consldorablo quantity. Oats : Tho oxtremoly low price to which this artlolo has, consequent on Imtnonso arrivals, fallen, having induced a dogroo of speculation during tho weet, prices rallied a trillo, nnd advanced rates wero about the middle of tho week demanded. The jerrira1«, liowovor, or tho What Cheer, Aujusta Kaufmwn, and Fair Wind, from California, and the Auchneajh, from Glasgow (tho latter vessel having 23,000 bushell oatB on board) havo completely paralysed tbo markot, and rondorcd prices all but nominal. Scotch are held for 4s. Od. to 4s. Od , Calcutta have bcon slid atas., an I California 6s , whllo Danish havo changed hands as low as 8s. 2d. to 4s, per bushol. Barloy has boen offorod by auction to tost the markot, in Btnall lots, but nothing has resulted, good samples of Chilian having boon w Ithdrawn at 4s. Od. to fis. Several parcels of South Auiitraliaii growth have changed hands at from 4s, 3d, far lefurloi to 6s. Od. forgood. Bran, owing to short arrivals and the temporarily Improved rates rcqulrol for oats, has attracted attontlon, and some rather largo parcels havo been told, good sweet bran havlur brought Is. 7d. to Is. 8d. Stela lots aro, however, difficult of ialo at much lowor rates. Maize Is utterly l neglected, and is offering as low as 0s. Od. to 7s. per bushel. Grain has tornowliat rovlvcd. Tho batano» of the parcel per Dunsandle, from Calcutta, was s sid by auction on the Wharf yesterday to speculators at 9'. 12s. Od. to-101, being an advanco of 12s.0d. on tho rates procured tho previous week for a formor por- tion of the samo cargo, The stock of this artlclo li, however, vory heavy, and until consumption hu much reduced .ho quantities on hand, there ii little probability ofamoiidniontofanyconsequonce in value Provisions generally ara unaltered. There hal been, however, a marked Improvement in the de maud for hains during'., tbe week, , chiefly for country orders, which have, in < somo. In- stances, been ' executed na high - as Hid. per lb. Butter has also bcon in bottor Inquiry, and an Improved number of sales havo taken placo, though without augmented value accruing ; OJd. per lb. being, wa believe, tho highest figuro at which business in this artlclo has bcon done. Bacon, ehoose, salt provisions, &o.; aro unchanged. Candles are but In little roquet; amount of transactions have boon light and prices aro unchaugod. Oilmen's Stores have felt the benefit of country orders, and though the heavy amount of', atockb ns yet preclude improvement in. prices, thora has boon an improved demand during the wholo woek. Dried fruits also Improve in demand, for Christmas re- quirements ; tim opportune arrival of tho cargo from the Cape per FUWierty has supplied present wants. Th/> caigo hy this vessel was told byauotion during tho week, at following prices :-Almomls, 7id ; apricots, Od. to lOd. ; apples, 7Jd. ; noars, flat, 7Jd ; pulled, 13d. ; peaches, 7tl. ; quinces, 7Jd. ; raisins, SJd. to 101. per lb. Groceries.-lu Teas and Coffees there is no change Whatover to remark ; demand continues vory steady. Stocks are by no moana superabundant, ami being in few hands, prices aro firmly supported. Sugars have boon somewhat neglected during the pact week ; purchasers, having.gonorally suppliod pre- sent wants at tho last publio salo, havo not boon frcoly in tho markot, and present rates holding out no temptation to sellers, the markot has boon and remains qnlot, Cossiporo and Bally No. 1 have boon sold during the week at Bil. portón. Motáis af all kinds (except those used for building purposes) continuo dull of saloons, however, importa- tions aro evidently on the declino, and as consump- tion is large, improved amount of buslnoss and in- creased value may reasonably bo looked for, should arrivals oontlnue of modorato amount only. Tobacco fully maintains its Improved aBpect. Stock! are working down vory low, and, In tho absence o any heavy supplies, increased pricos may ho expoctoi i Penis contlnuoln vory brl»k demand. Thooirmo the Admiral Prinz Adalbert has boon disposed of by auction during tho woek, and although tho price realised show a declino on last sales, the quality o this lot bolng veiy Inforlor, hardly affords a orita rlou for tho market price of those of gooi quality. Timber of other klids is firm, and consider able amount of business doing at full rates. Coals havo, owing to heavy stooks, become mue depressed, and as the Benson naturally causes di creased demand, prices havo doollnerl to almoi nominal ratos, Soft goods, and boots and shoos, are still arriving I largo quantities ; tho weather having-, however, i length apparently settlod, has brought country buya moro frooly into tbo markot, and although wo canni report any improvement in prices fcnoraUy, there Is much Improved domand, and somo few articles, whk have become rather scarce, aro bringing very full rate £ 8. d.
