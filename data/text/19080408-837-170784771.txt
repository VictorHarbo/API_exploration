TELEGRAMS TALL T5ALk BY KIDSTON WHY IHE GOES HOME. TO ADVERTISl'] QUEENSLAND AND GET IMMIGRANTS. BRISBANE tuesday' An important sttement was .mnde by the Premier to a deputation, represntaing the primary industries of the state waited upon him to-day, for the purppse of pointing out to him the prospect of an unprecedented deficiency in the supply of suitable labour, and urging him the adopti tion of such steps as Would secure the introduction to Queenland of sufficient labour to meet the demands of the agri cultural and dairying industries. Mr. Kidston, in the course of a lengthy reply, said that it was eminently desir able that we should fill up this great em pty territory. They had considered the desirableness of filling up the State, but the position both of the -employers and what the position was in regard to the sugar industry. If farmers and sugar mills had any difficulty in finding men this season it was entirely their own fault. men who could get employees landed herq J for £5 had no reason to cry out . One of his chief purposes in going to the old Courtry at the present time was to ad- vertise Queensland primarily and to have it done as it ought to be done. Mr Kidston said he also wanted to u n^atv ise, not only the Agency General in Lon don but to get better and more central premieses and work it more on business lines, by adopting more suitable and modern requirements. He wanted to break it up into a number of agencies in different centres of Queensland, and to advertise Queensland, all over England, Scotland and Ireland. They would go to Germany laterand also try to get Danish and Swedish immigrants. First there is a system of advertising Queens land which will cost a great deal of money and which will inaugurate a steady stream of immigrants to Queensland. If queensland were in a proper. -condition in relation to the Old Country we should have 20 000 families a year, instead of practicallly stoppage that has taken place, but we are down in the estimation of Old Country and have been down for years and it needs very great efforts to lift it back into such prominence like Canada. We are primarily wanting farming and industries and not only labourers. He was going to take the question of advertising Queens in hand, and felt quite sure that that his arrangement would ernomously increase the number of immigrants from the Old Country. In conclusion, Mr Kidston said, 'When I say these things i mean them." '.?-'?.?jMid reporting on various matters.
