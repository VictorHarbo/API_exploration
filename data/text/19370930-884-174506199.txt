Iff m*st£ ^Europea* * countries ' , «ie poatttailis^rqrsffi &W; in Den mark! dairymen are too poor to eaf their own product, consuming, in stead, margarine. It' woufd seem that the best chance £or an extensive and -well .paidmarket for Australian butter producers, lies within the Com monwealth -itself. Every--- effort should be Jnade to increase our pop ulation. At present the Australian -rustomers of our dairymen 'Include 800,000 factory workers, With- their Wives and children 'they probably number Well over ^000,000 persons. *T5iey, and other; members oc me com munity, do not object to paying more than the English' consumer for their butter so that the dairyman here may not have to live like the Danish pro ' ducer does. No objection, either, is raised to the exchange rate set at its present level entirely to aid tne prim ary producer. It results, however, in 25 per cent, extra being -paid by the community for every' article import ed; and costs the taxpayers many millions more per annum in the set tling of our overseas interest toll. It also gives the dairyman another 25 p.c. more. for his exports, thus bring ing into line with Australia the prices 1 of British sales. Customers, sot competitors with the farmers, already, established here, are required to Australia. Our sec ondary industries offer the best means -if providing for new arrivals who -would be customers, not competitors, «£ the farmer. Population in Great Britain is declining: and a world auth ority recently stated that if British immigrants were not secured now it would toe impossible to do so later. —rPaul Caeyne.
