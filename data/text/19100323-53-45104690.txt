IMMIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA. MR. WADE INDIGNANT. " As already briefly wired to "The Miner," Â¿ne Premier (Mr. Wade) has received from tile New South Wales Agenl-Qoneral the text of a,warning to intending immigrants issued by the Banish Government. The warning in question was ns follows: "As inquiries regarding the state of affairs in Australia and New, Zealand are addressed to the Minister of For- eign Affairs from day to day, tho Min- istry points out that as the difficulties for emigrants to subsist in those coun- tries have latterly largely increased, Danes in search of employment are earnestly dissuaded from going- to the countries named." The Premier lins forwarded a cable message for publication to the British press:-"Wade, Premier of New South Wales; strongly resents the publication by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Af- fairs of the warning against Australia as a field for emigration." He states that no country in the world to-day offers a better field for industrious workers than New South Wales. Fully 10,000 genuine emigrants in 1909 wero satisfactorily settled without ' delay. There was practically no unemployed at the present tima, but a huge unsat- isfied demand for agricultural and do- mestic labor at remunerative wages. Since 190(1 New Scuth Wnlos has as- sisted l4,O09 immigrants. The Govern- ment was guaranteeing work for agri- culturists and domestic servants, and placing them in satisfactory employ- ment on the day of their landing. Hundreds of these ? immigrants had made homes On'the land, owning free- hold property, and were now ' pros- perous farmers. All the others were earning about double the wages re- ceived in tho older countries, , In the snnie period 179,591 people arrived in New South Wales and 278,619 in Aus- tralia from oversea."
