SHOTS FROM GALLERY PARLIAMENT DISTURBED. Danish Nazi Demonstration. COPENHAGEN, April 13.-Two shots were fired from the Visitors' Gallery to day while Parlian?ent was debating the new immigration law, to which the Danish Nazis are opposed. Erik Wester gaard, a young Nazi, was arrested. It was believed at first that an at tempt had been made on the life of the Mniseter for Justice (M. K. K. Stteinke), but it appears from later inquirles that the. shots were fired, not with the ob ject of harming anyone, but to draw at tention to Nazi leaflets which Wester gaard showered down on members. The leaflets accuse Parliament of corrup tion and misgovernment. Westergaard was sitting in the gallery with b number of others believed to be Nazis. All were arrested. No one was injured by the shots.
