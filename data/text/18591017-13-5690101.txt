AMUSEMENTS. The three Melbourne Theatres still continue open, the lion's share of attraction falling to the Princess's, at which Mr. John Drew has been playing to very large audiences for 48 nights. Mr. Drew excels in low Irish comedy. He is just about to proceed on a professional tour through the mining districts. Mr. G. Y. Brooke is yet the "bright particular star at the Theatre Royal, and by his masterly delineations of "Othen^,""Richelieu,"aodothorBof thekind,can atanytrraoensurethepresenceof large audiences. It would seem that he has lost more of his favour in the eyes of the population. Burlesque has also been playing at this theatre, and in the course of a few days " grand- opera," as it is called, is once more to tempt the lovers of music in this city. The corps- is not without food names, such as those of Madame Sara lower and Mr. Farquharson, whose fame in this part of the world is amply established. Madame Carandini, Mrs. Hancock, and Messrs. Slier» an and John Gregg, also figure on Mr. Brookes's list. Mr. Winterbottom will conduct, and five operas promised! comprise " Il Trovatore," " Le. Traviata," " Ernani," " Rigo Ietto," " Fra Diavolo" " The Bohemian Girl," and " The Rose of Castile." Much, is to be hoped; but, nous versions. At the Olympic Theatre a very excellent stock company is working, with laudable zeal, at light comedy and burlesque. The leading business is entrusted to Miss Rosa Dunn, a very young. actress of considerable ability, painstaking, and popular. Mr. Rogers and Mr. F. Younge, both at this theatre, are among the best comic actors we can boast of. In matters terpsichorean we have Madame. Therese and M. Schmidt, and the Leopold Family. The former have just concluded a successful engagement at the Olympic, and the latter are still at the Theatre Royal. The ballet, however, is decidedly at a low ebb here. A now " star," Miss Kate Howard, a London actress, is about to appear at the Princess's. Music is scarcely progressing. A succession of " People's Concerts are being given every Saturday evening in the Trades' Hall, Lygon-street, at which most of our principal vocalists and a very capital glee company have appeared. The profession is not to blame for the alas ! too often scanty audiences which attend its efforts. It is rumoured that a Signor and Signora Bianchi, from California, are soon likely to be heard of in Australia. If so, they are to appear in grand opera. i CHAMPION SWEEPSTAKES. ! The Great Australian Champion Sweepstakes of 500 sovs., and £100 entrance, open to all the colonies, was run on the 1st of October, and won by Flying Buck, a Victorian three-year-old colt, his light weight, 6st. 5lb., favouring him greatly. This race, which in all probability will be'atmual, the venue alone being changed, was initiated by Mr. W. P. Simons, Secretary to the Victoria Jockey Club, and promptly taken up by some of our leading sporting men. The magnitude of the prize induced breeders and owners from each of the colonies to enter horses. From New Zealand four found their way to Melbourne; three of them, Strop, Miss Rowe, and Co, bringing with them a great name. For Sydney Mr. Tait's chesnut mare, Zoo, very highly bred, alone competed. She came in second. A Victorian horse named Nutwith secured third honours, and has since beaten Zoe, the same distance (three miles), weight for age. Tasmania sent four. Quickstep and Sir Hercules-both well-bred animals, but unable to stay the dis- tance-and Camel and Swordsman, the less said about whom the better. South Australia had but one representative, Barber, '-a horse that swam ashore from the wreck of the ill-fated Admella, and was in no fit trim to race, on the Champion Day, Seven champions did battle for our own colony, the result being as above stated. Originally there were 24 entries, 18 of which came to the post. The winner, Mr. Yuille, netted in stakes 2,600, and about 8000. more in bets. Flying Buck was not much fancied save by his owner's immediate friends. He has since been beaten by Buzzard, for the Derby, though it is not clear whether or hammering or no. It is estimated that "there were over 4ü,OÜ0perSohs' present. The number of passengers to and from the Racecourse Station and Melbourne was 22,573. The amount of receipts for the traffic of the day was 87½. odd. POPULATION. The published returns of the Registrar General's Office enabled us to compile for our last month's report a statement of the numbers of the population of the colony on the 30th of June last. The totals were-males, 330,212 : females,, 187,154; total, 517,360. In the subjoined table, the arrivals and de- partures by the seaboard for the current year to the end of August are compared with those of the corresponding period of 1858 : 1850\. . 1858. - Arrived. parted.

It has become a marked feature of the trade and commerce of the colony that the commencement of the warm season is the dullest of the year. When the made roads to the interior were few, and the bush roads difficult of naviga- tion during the winter, the reverse of this was the case. The depressing effect of a falling market, and the uncertainty which has existed with regard to the maintenance of peace by Great Britain, have contributed to reduce the commercial operations of the four weeks which have elapsed since the departure of the Bombay to a purely retail character. With a falling market, money has, as a matter of course, become less easy. The banks have commenced putting on the screw, in order to ensure that their advances are covered by the securities held by them. This was to be expected, with flour fallen in value 30 per cent within a fortnight, and with wheat, oats, butter, and other articles of speculation following in the wake. The large sums locked up in mining companies, not likely to make any return to the proprietors for some months to come, have produced some effect, because of the determination maintained by the banks to refuse to recognise the shares in those companies as securities. On the first introduction of mining enterprises, to the share man go to, some of the bank managers did not hesitate to take part in their formation. A more cautious policy has succeeded ; a check has been administered to the stock-jobbing mania, which some two months ago threatened to drag all kinds and conditions of men within its influence. Two or three failures have taken place in the import trade, not involving very large amounts. Messrs. Mollenbaeck, Uhlhorn, and Co. suspended payment on the 3rd instant. At a meeting of the creditors a statement was produced, showing that the liabilities to foreign creditors amounted to £14,700 to Australian creditors, £8,90; total, £23,45 The assets were stated at-goods in stock, £4,012; debts due, £2,956. a. total, £0,068. Messrs. Smither and (Sark gave notice on the 10th instant to their creditors that they were unable to meet their engagements. The liabilities- of this firm amount to £25,000. The estate will be wound up under a deed of assignment, and is expected to yield 12s. in the pound sterling. There appears to be no immediate probability of the stocks of imported goods in Melbourne undergoing any diminution. The arrivals continue to be in excess of the consumption, and the warehouses are becoming crowded. The declared value of the imports for the current year, up to the 8th inst, has amounted to £11,399,G50, and of the exports to £10,053,803, leaving a balance | in favour of the former of £1,345,843 5 -up to the corresponding date of last year the imports amounted to £9,990,697, and the exports to £9,997,272, leaving a balance in favour of the latter of £575. These figures show very plainly that, while our export trade has been stationary, our import trade has beengroittly on the increase, and this at a time when the home powers of production are expanding to a greater ratio than is necessary to keep pace with the growing numbers of the population. The revenue returns for the year and quarter ending the 30th ult. have been issued, and are in' the main satisfactory. The general revenues have been maintained, and that derived from the alienation of Crown lands increased. IN another column will be found a detailed statement of the two periods, compared with the year and quarter entering Séptein-ber;30, 1858. The gold-fields returns are not quite up, to the average, and as the last quarter of the year is less favourable for mining pursuits- then, the autumnal and winter quarters, the prospect of bringing the production up to that of last year is now very remote. Up to Saturday the quantities brought down by escort amounted to the total of 1,736,869 ounces,, against 1,861,591 ounces for the corresponding portion of 1858.; and the shipments to 1,827, 41 ounces, against 1,949,795" ounces. The escort returns for the third quarter of the year are now complete, and we find that the aver- age weekly production was only 44,523 ounces, against 48,235 ounces for the third quarter of 1858\. The weekly average of the year has been 44,007 ounces, against 45, 1100 ounces for first three quarters of 1858. The yield of the older fields appears to be undergoing one of those periodical fluctuations which have always characterised the pursuit of mining industry in this colony. Political excitement may have had some hand in causing the decline of this month and its predecessor, and the share jobbing mania has undoubtedly exercised no mean influence. Prices have varied with the fluctuations in the rates of exchange on England, and parcels have been hold back. No new fields have been opened up, and the joint-stock companies are only making pre- parations they are not yet producers of the metal. In the following table the quantities brought into Melbourne by the escorts from all the goldfields are given for three months ending on Saturday. In the last column will be found the total for the corresponding period of 1858 : Saw,- c -ENOCH S CO 6-4 2 6 l 83' I 1 § I gaged Eg' Gg' 1 £2 1 >o I took too eiM to I liiiigigigii' Blg§lS§8ëS§§§ Ma^bMM^1 Ballarat and Smythe's Creek.

They are calculated on the basis of from £3 14s. 6d. to £3 14s. 10d. for standard gold, which, with the export duty, brings the price on shipboard to from £3 17s. to £3 17s. 4d. The Melbourne brokers have had very few dealings direct with the diggers. They quote prices nominal at-For Livingstone, 65s. to 72s. : Omeo, 63s. to 75s. 6d. ; lMoasnnt Creek and Goulburn, 75s. to 75s. ; Boggy Creek, Sandhurst, Castlemaine, and Jim Crow, 75s. to 76s. ; Maryborough, Dunolly, Avoca, Amherst, Fiery Creek, and Ararat, 76s. 6d. to 77s. Oil. ; Ovens and Yackandandah, 76s. 6d. to 76s. 6d. ; Ballarat, 77s. 6d. to 76s. 6d. per ounce. The escorts of the lost four weeks have rendered the comparison afforded by this table a very unfavourable one for the current year. The total quantities brought down by escort and shipped we have already given. The detailed comparison of the latest returns will be found in our ordinary commercial columns.

For some time past, neither the commerce of the. part nor the inland trade has been of a very profitable kind. The heavy amount of shipments coming to hand,, and the still heavier amount advised, have hung like a cloud over the markets, and the consequence is, that those car facts remain, to far too great an extent, in Mel ourne chiefly in first hands. The banks, always the first to detect any weakness in prices, have, as. a matter of caution, sought to increase the value of their securities, without increasing their accommodation, and the pressure has been felt. A falling-off in the demand for bills for remitting values, has followed the falling-off in trade, and the banks have lowered their selling rates of exchange on England. They now stand at 1 per cent, premium for 60 days' sight for large amounts, and at li per cent, premium for 30 days' sight, for bills under £50. Freight on gold by sailing-vessels is from 2d. to 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London ; insurance, 15 per cent. By the overland route the freight to the Bank of England, including insurance and transit duty, is 2 per cent. To Mauritius and India, freight 1 per cent. ; insurance according to the character of the port to which the shipment is made. The bank rates of discount remain at- For bills under 95 days' currency, 8 per cent. for 95 to 125 days', 9 per cent. over 125 days', 10 per cent. and for overdrawn accounts and cash credits, 10 per cent. Capital is plentiful outside the banks. Messrs. Vaughan and Wild report that the calls on shares in the new mining companies, and the frequency of Government land sales, have caused an extra demand for money, and for large amounts higher rates are demanded, oven for the best securities. For sums under £1,000 the supply is easy at the rates that have ruled for some time past in minor transactions." The usual quarterly comparative statement of the revenues of the colony have been published in the Government Gazette.

The revenue for the quarter amounted to £049,783, against £630,001 for the corresponding quarter of 1858; the increase being £«112,7y2._ The year and quarter exhibit alike a general increase in the Customs' revenue, except under the head of spirits, in which a decrease as exhibited for the quarter of £5,174, and for the year of £10,000. In the export duty on gold there is a decrease for the quarter of £4,802, and for the year of £28,404. The most important item of increase for the year is that derived from the proceeds of the sale of public lands £117,560. Licences, including the assessment on stock, have yielded an increase of £124,050. The Post-office department has contributed more by £12,916, during the last 12 months, than during the 12 months terminating September 30, 1858. In the stock and share market quiet has ruled throughout the month. Mining shares, which were sent up to some 300 per cent, premium during the mania, are now at from par to 25 per cent, premium. Messrs. Wray and Bryant report of the doings of the month : "Since our last issue a new and important feature has occurred. The erroneous quotations in the share lists before the public, and the dissatisfaction so frequently expressed as to the manner in which the business was done, led to the combination of the brokers for the purpose of establishing rules and regulations, and Issuing dilly an approved and correct list of prices. Tills movement has been favourably received, and must tend to enforce a more wholesome system. "The actual amount of business during the past month, although limited to a certain extent, particularly in mining shares, can hardly be said to have fallen off. "The success which at first attended, the establishing of mining companies was the cause of of many more being brought forward, and to such an extent that it was difficult to foresee a termination. It was soon apparent that the principle was to realise at the premiums, and to apply for new shares, which resulted in a decided fall in the price of every description of share, and increasing the difficulty of finding subscribers to any new company, however valuable its prospects. It is, however, a wnoles-oraei check, and one which must eventually have a beneficial effect, and which has already prevented the occurrence of disasters usually attending speculations. The delay in the anticipated successful returns from the old-established companies, Old Specimen Gully (owing to the difficulty of getting through with the tunnel and Bendigo Waterworks (from some derangement of the machinery), and the unexpected announcement by the old Punnyvv eight Hill Company that their capital was exhausted, and they would require more have caused during the last two weeks a want of that confidence in the success of public imbibing enterprises that it will take a career of success in some established companies to restore. Although It, is undoubted that small digging parties, with usual sized claims, and paying large sums for crushing, have In numerous instances realised enormous sums of money, and nearly always good wages, there has as yet been only a successful result from two or three public completes hitherto established. This has in great measure been caused by their commencing with too small a capital, but with the experience thus gained, and from the large claims hold by many of the new companies (In some instances nearly half a mile of reef we anticipate seeing some, very large results. " The generality of Melbourne shareholders seem to have expected a very quick return for their money invested in mining companies, an idea accounted for by their limited knowledge of the gold-fields ; a feeling of impatience, not to say doubt, has consequently spec ing up. We foresaw that a very considerable time must necessarily elapse before the machinery required by the numerous recently started companies could, be. erected 1, and put into working order, but the confident we have all along expressed in their ultimate success is by no means shaken, and when one or two have commenced operations, and shown a profitable result we boiler of that any amount of capital required for" bona pie mining enterprises will be readily forthcoming. Railways. Hobson's Bay were Arm when we last reported, at £75 to £70, since which a projected but direct to St. Kilda, and the London price being on £74 to 276, have depressed the ; they are now £73 to £76. Suburban, and St. Kilda and Brighton, remain stationary at Grey and 21-22 respectively, There has been a good demand for the former the last few days, a large quantity having been purchased by on of our c idealists. " Banks -The business done in the shores of the several banking companies has been large. Buyers of Colonial Banks, In anticipation of the dividend, at numerous Buyers of Bank of Victoria shares are scarce at £35. Nationals are extraordinarily dull a £2 12s. 6d, for which we are at a loss to account. *' Insurance Companies The only exception to the dullness in these shares Is the Australasian, in which considerable amount has been done, from the fact of their being about to establish a life and general insurance business in connection with fire. "Mining Companies Coliban Shares have been reduced from 300 to £20, and this change w enable the public to invest small sums of having; hitherto been a private undertaking). The prospects are very good, the company having purchased about 400 acres of rich auriferous land. The have not as yet attempted to work any of the numorous quartz reefs on their ground, but the alluvial portion is of a very favourable character, a rich lead of wash dirt having been struck in their new tunnel, and more than 20 ozs. of gold washed from 20 loads. The working of this rich stair Is delayed until the tunnel is widened, to admit two lines of railway which will shortly be completed, when very large returns may be an- _ ticipated. Scarcely any shares are in the market. Monte Christophe works of this company are progressing rapidly ; their machinery is in course of a erection, another have secured that great desideratum a water supply, until the repairs to their own water - race are completed. It is expected the w works will be in actual operation in the course of a fortnight Price, par to a pin. Sandy Creek, Poverty Reef, have maintained a good premium. 'The report of enormous returns to private parties on this reef have caused a great demand for these shares. Ono ma with a claim of 6 feet is reported to have realised £2,000 in one week. Price, 21 to 3. Both in Reef have commenced getting out quartz and made arrangements to have the same crushed unt their own machinery is erected. We hear that two dayS' crushing show large results, and the shares have risen from par to g premium. Wattle Gully The works of this company are being rapidly proceeded with, and we hear of some very rich quartz having been already obtained. Great confidence is felt in the success of this company from the appointment, by the directors, of Mr. Kitto as the mining manager From the absence of authentic Information respecting the proceedings of the numerous other companies w are unable to enter into particulars, but so far as we can glean most of them are progressing and among the many transactions that have taken place buyer have not been wanting for shores of a sterling cha. " We have not experienced the relief in the money market we anticipated by the arrival of the August mail conveying the continue state of peaceable affairs, and the further reduction of the bank rate, in fact, an increased tightness has been observed, and the defalcation of several houses of good standing has occurred, thereby preventing the flow of capital into the share market, which at present offers the best opportunity for investment." We have not a single commercial meeting of importance to chronicle this month. Allusion has been already made to the two failures which have occurred during the current month. In the insolvency circular, compiled by Messrs. Mackillop and Cooke, we find D6 schedules entered on the September list as having , been filed. The majority of these exhibit, as usual, liabilities under £300. In the two estates which figure at the top of the list, those of D. Bergin and Co., of Ararat, storekeepers, and J. Campbell, of Melbourne, contractors, the assets are set down at larger sums than the liabilities. Seventy-two of the estates are under £1,000 in point of liabilities, and of these 72, 54 are under £500. The trades and callings of the insolvents may be thus divided: One accountant, two auctioneers, one broker, four butchers, three bootmakers, one boot and shoe importer, three bakers, one builder, two carters, one carpenter, one cattle-dealer, three commission agents, mine contractors, on con- "t fectioner, one clothier, two clerks, one chemist and druggist, one dairyman, five drapers, one. designer, one estate agent, two farmers, one gold j broker, one interpreter, two millers, two master ' mariners, one milkman, eight miners, five publicans, one printer, two painters, one quarryman, r one quartz-miner, two restaurant- keepers, one saddler, one storekeeper, one solicitor, one ¡ spirit merchant, one sawyer, one slaughterman, ¡ one tragedian, one widow. Since the date to ¡ which tins extends the number of small schedules filed daily has increased to an extent sufficient to cause some uneasiness as regards the soundness of trade among the small shopkeepers, upon whom the losses in those cases chiefly fall, We have reviewed the condition of the import , market at length in the remarks prefixed to our list of the w wholesale prices current mile market. In the export trade little is doing ; but the new > clip of wool is gradually finding its way to the ports of shipment.

Our report of business In imported goods during the past month must necessarily be an unsatisfactory one to shippers. Doubts as to the character of the next European Intelligence kept the market in a state of suspension for the month, and purchases have been but insignificant. These doubts still prevail more or less, notwithstanding the pacific character of the news by the August mail. The commercial advices received have had a depressive effect generally. The extent of the supplies on the way to an already overstocked market has produced a feeling of uneasiness, which has given prices a downward tendency. Butter, owing to expected heavy arrivals, and a consequent deposition to quit stocks, has declined in price, and newly-arrived parcels cannot be quoted at above 12d. to 13d. per lb. Candles have improved in demand, and prices are steadier, although without much change in value. Bottled beers have met with increased demand, at improved prices, and a brisk trade, at well-supported rates, is looked for as the weather becomes more settled, bulk ales are very steady and draught stout, for some time past in but little demand, is now inquired for the advanc- ing prices of bottled beer bringing local bottles into the market. Provisions have undergone nooliango of importance. The plentiful supplies to hand have checked prices. This check will be of temporary operation only if shippers keep within moderate bounds, Flour has undergone a sudden and heavy reverse in prices. The neighbouring producing colo- runs, South Australia more especially, have throughout the car adopted a system, as the result proves, of concealment as regards the extent of their last year's productions, inducing the belief that their stocks would prove inadequate to the supply of the market towards the close of of the season, and that high prices must necessarily ensue. The consequence, has resulted in considerable shipments having been for warded from Valparaiso and San Francisco of both wheat and flour. The fact of several large cargoes having come in together, which were unexpected, has completely paralysed the market, and caused a thorough panic. Flour has fallen from £34 per ton to about from £22 to £23 per ton for Adelaide best brands, dragging down with them the value of Haxall and Gallegos to about 60s. per barrel, The demand for consump- tion is of course steady, and hopes are entertained that prices will settle to some fixed rate during the ensuing week. Teas and coffees firmly sustain prices, and are in good demand, without any prospect of decline In value. Sugars are very dull ; heavy supplies continue to come to hand, and the trade buysponngly and with caution. Imports of rice, added opinions stocks, have, in spite of the firmness of holders, caused a decline in prices, where sales have been made, and from £22 per ton rates have receded to about £18 for Patna. Timber shows no improvement the trade appears generally well supplied, and the existing demand is chiefly for country orders Spirits are still depressed, and with the large shipments made from the home markets the prospect of any improvement seems very distant. The heavy stocks of corrugated and galvanised iron have rendered sales difficult to effect,. and with the heavy shipments made prices are unlikely to show any Improvement. In other articles of general use there are scarcely any changes to report, but we proceed to remark on each in detail: Butter With the certainty of large supplies on the way, and the approach of the unfavourable season for holding the article, importers appear desirous of realising, and newly landed parcels of double rose Cork are freely offering at 13d. per lb. Buyers, however, are availing themselves of the disposition to sell, and offer from 12d. to 12d, at which latter rate some small parcels are reported to have been placed. Old parcels are moved off by auction, at prices varying from 8d. to 10d. for good samples. Boots and Shoes Goods suitable for the summer trade are the only score in any requests and as sales are chiefly effected by auction, it is difficult to afford correct quotations. Winter goods are, as a matter of course, in no demand whatever. Candles are In more steady inquiry. Stooks are gradually reducing and holders loss disposed to sell, except at full market prices. Belmont Bponns sell at 16d. to 15d. ; Ogloby's at 14d. to led and Neva stearine are quoted by the agents for the St. Petersburgh Company at 15d. per lb. Canvas The demand has improved, more, particularly for the more generally useful numbers of navy canvas, sales of which misreported at from 12d. to 156. per yard. Cement There is no very active demand Just at present ; prices are, however, supported, Portland being worth from 10s. to 20s and Roman, 17s. to 18s. per barrel. Coals -English household coals have been better supplied of late, and as the season, when the consumption is lightest being now set in, prices are hardly so firm, and cannot be quoted at above 40s. to 45s per ton in the Bay ; whilst Newcastle (New South Wales) soil at about same prices OIL the wharf. Confectionery. The demand for these articles is by no means brisk, but holders seem indisposed to submit to reduced rates, and prefer holding. Candied peel has been more plentifully supplied, and sales made at from 14d. to 15d. per lb. Cordage, Twine, Wed-The value of these articles has undergone but little change since our last report. Oakum is now well supplied, and has declined to 30s. to 35s. per cwt t. Twines, both roping and seaming, are heavy-, in stock, and dull of sale. Bags and Bagging Stocks of both corn sacks and wool bags are heavy, and although, the season naturally produces inquiry, prices are unimproved, the former article not being saleable at above 12s. to 12s. 6d. per dozen, and the latter worth only from 3s. 6d. to. 4s. each. Gunnies me largely supplied, and dull of sale at from 6s. 6d. to 6s. per dozen. Drugs and Chemicals -The articles under this head have undergone but little alteration value. Alum is in more inquiry, and worth from 14s. to 10s. per cwt. Soda crystals are better supplied, and above £13 per ton is not procurable. Flour of sulphur has become rather scarce, and brings 26s per cwt Arsenic has at last worked down in stock, and is saleable at 6s. per cwt. Fish, Dried and Salted But little has been, doing in these articles. Stocks are ample, and, in the absence of any brisk demand, prices have undergone no change. Quotations are White herrings, half barrels, £1 4s. to 15s ; do this, 6s. to 5s. 6d. ; do., half-tins, 3s. to 3s 3d. ; red herrings, 2 dozen tins, 2s. 8d. ; ling, 42d, per lb. ; cod, salted 2d. to 3d. per lb. Flour and Grain. Boy and the remarks already made on flour we have nothing to add, with the exception that it is asserted that the Surinam, announced as having arrived at the Heads from San Francisco, brings oats and barley only,' which, if correct, may in some degree tend to allay the excitement at present existing in the flour market. Wheat has, of course, been similarly influenced in value with flour, and millers appear indis- posed to purchase at above 9s. 6d. per bushel. The parcel of wheat per Hobo, from, the West Coast of America, was placed at 11s 6d. per bushel, but, it is reported, has been rejected on account of having become heated on the voyage. Barley continues neglected, and dull of sale. Fine malting samples are quoted at from 4s. to 4s. 6d, and feeding sorts from 3s. to 39. OJ. nor bushel. Maize continues largely supplied, the low prices of horse corn of other descriptions tending to keep down the value of this sort. Gram -Large arrivals have come to hand during the mouth of September, and caused further decline in value. Prices cannot be quoted at above £10 per ton. Importers, however, are not pressing sales, and appear disposed to hold for better rates. Melt is still heavy in stock, and, In the absence of any lively demand, prices show no prospect of any advance Oats. Large supplies continue to arrive and although decreased prices are reported to have induced speculative purchases to considerable extent, with the enormous stocks on hand, and our own harvest promising to be an ample one and near at hand, it appears hardly possible that any permanent improvement can be established. Several large lots have within the last few days passed the hammer, and indicate the present market value. A parcel of 3,000 bushels of Irish white was placed at 8s. 6d. ; 2,600 bushels Californian, of very fine quality, brought 4s. 3d. ; 2,000 bushels Danish, 3s. 3d. and 3,000 bushels colonial, from 4s. 4d. tossed. per bushel. Fruits, Dried. There has not been much business doing In these articles lately. Table fruit is in but little inquiry, and the summer brings fresh fruits in season. Dried sorts will be still less in demand. Pudding raisins and currants are of tolerably fair solo, If well conditioned: but at this late periods the year much of the stock on hand is getting in bad condition. Currants are worth from 5. to (k1. ; Cape raisins, Old. to 7d. per lb. By auction a few days since Blemo figs brought 8d. to 8d. ; Saldanha raisins, 8d., and Valencias, 63d. per lb. Furniture Good medium sorts and small assort- ments of first-class of English make ore in fair demand, at paying advances on invoice cost. Glassware Stocks have worked lighter, and there is more Inquiry, prices ruling at about 20 per cent. advance on any plea for well selected assortments. Gunpowder.-Consumption of blasting sorts Is increasing, and although the trade are reported to be tolerably well supplied, landed parcels are saleable at from 12d. to 18d. per lb. Hope The market continues well supplied, and the demand by no means brisk. Quotations are un- changed, last year's (Kent or Sussex) being about 100\. to Is, ; 1857, of good quality, 7d. to 8d. ; inferior and old, both English and foreign, nearly unsaleable. Groceries. Tons are in good steady demand, at well supported prices Good ordinary to fine congous meet ready buyers at from £10 to Allies., and hyson skin, of good quality, is worth from 76s. to £8 per chest. By auction coarse black teas have been placed at from 810\. to £8 12s. 6d. per chest ; good to fine ordinary congous, from £91 7s. 6d. to £11 10s. per chest and scented congous, inlets. boxes, 50s. each. Coffee continues In very steady demand, and prices are firm. The cargo of the Balcombe Castle, from Colombo, has been disposed of by auction. Good ordinary plantation sold at 6d., and middling native, Old. per lb., in bond Sugar The market is Inactive and heavy, and where sales have been latterly effected a reduction of about £1 per ton has been submitted to the trade seeming indisposed to purchase to any extent at present prices, with the coming supplies in view. Fine white Cossi pore and Bally sugars No. 1 cannot be quoted as worth above 50s. to 65s. per on t. and low to One yellow Mauritius, 36s. to" 42s. per ewe. Rico. Considerable quantities of the late heavy arrivals have been offered for sale by auction, but the prices offered being considered unsatisfactory, the greater portions have been withdrawn for better prices, is whom sales by this means have been effected, a reduction of quite £8 per ton has been submitted to the prices procured varying from £18 to £19 per ton. ' > Ironmongery and Hardware. - Supplies of both English and American manufactured goods keep the market well supplied, and no improvement in prices of any articles can be reported, with the exception of holloware, which is in improved inquiry, and quoted at from 10 to 6 per cent, off list prices. American cut rolls are easier, having declined to 17s. 6d. to 20s. per keg and American L H shovels, which are quoted at from54B. to 56s. per dozen. Camp ovens are well. supplied, and rather castor In prices. Quotations pro-Axis, Port oud Collins', £2 8s. to £2 10s, per dozen; do. do,, handled, £3 16s. to £4 per dozen; axe handles, 10s. 6d. to 14s. per dozen ; building ironmongery, 20 per cent. adv. ; picks, Collins's heavy weighted, £3 5s. to £3 10s. per dozen; do. do. light, 6 10s. to £8 per dozen ; shelf hardware, assorted, 6 to 10 per cent. adv. ; shovels, American, L H, £214s. to £2 10s. per dozen ; do do., D H, £2 to £2 10 per dozen ; do, English, best, £1 10s. to £2 nor dozen ; spades, American, £2 6s. per dozen ; English, best, £2 per dozen ;, do., long- strapped, £2 6s per dozen. ' Liquors. Bulk ales, of the most approved brands, have been in steady demand throughout the month, and prices have scarcely fluctuated. Holders have been and are firm in their prices. Bass's No. 3 Burton is saleable at about £8 6d.; Allsopp's at similar value ; Ind, Coope, and Co.'s at £8 and other sorts at proportionate prices. Draught porter has been dull of ] sale, the demand having been, as usual, but light during the winter months. Holders have, however, shown no disposition to lower their prices, and as the I high prices ruling for bottled stout has induced local bottling, inquiries are arising for the best brands, and an improved trade Is early looked for. Bottled beers continue of very ready sale, and prices appear likely to advance as the summer sets in, the repair of more moderate exports from the home market giving a firmer tone to prices here. Allsopp's ale, bottled by Friend and Co., is quoted at 11s. to 11s. 6d. ; Ind, Coope, and Co., of V. White and Co.'s bottling, has been placed at 11s. ; Byass's is quoted at 9s. 6d. to 10s, and other bottlers'ot proportionate rates, according to estimation in this market. Bottled stout is in very brisk inquiry, and is rather b> advance on prices of ale. Best brands sell very readily at 11s. per dozen. Wines. There is but little change to report in this market. The demand continues very inactive, although, as the summer sets in a better demand, more especially for light wines, is looked for. Holders of good wines are generally firmer but transactions in these descriptions are of very limited extent. By auction, sales of Lemon Hart's three-diamond port have been made at £57 10s. per pipe ; ordinary pale sherries, from £46 to £65; Cousens's pale sherry, £60 to £63 10s. and of superior brands, from some shipper, from £66 to £80 per butt "6800 sherry, at £24 16s. and Pontoc, at £24 per pipe ; Easdon, £31 to £10 per pipe ; champagne, 35s. ; claret, 10s. ; Saw terms, 14s. 6d. per dozen.

Spirits. No improvement in this market has yet presented itself, and the report of inactivity and and ness has to be repeated, and whilst continued shipments are added to our already heavy stocks still there can be no prospect of amended prices, and as the trade purchase only for their actual requirements, the market is not likely speedily to-be relieved. The latest auction sales give the following results, viz. Mar tell's brandy, 3s 9d, to 8s. 7d. ; Champagne line yard Proprietors', 7s. 6d. ; Otard's, 7s. 6d. ; United Vineyard Company's, 7s. to 7s. 4d, per gallon ; key brand geneva, 16s. 6d. per case ; palm-tree brand, 14s. 6d. : W.

By. auction INE matches have been sold in quantities, at from 4s. 3d. to 4s. 6d. per gross. Metals. The market, with few exceptions, is very dull and largely overstocked. Plate and sheet iron are scarce, and in demand, the former at £20, and the latter at £17 per ton. Pig iron has bean is more inquiry, and has advanced to £0 6s. to £6 10s. per ton. Quicksilver has also rather improved in price, and is quoted at from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per lb. Miller sheet lead is very dull of sale, and not worth above £28 per ton. Large supplies of corrugated iron have overstocked the market, and it is difficult to effect soles, even of best sorts, at reduced prices, and the large shipments now on the way will, in all probability, on arrival, cause still further depression. Patent corrugated gain vaulted tinned, 24 and, 20 gauge (Morewood's) is not worth above £40 ; galvanised tinned plain, very dull of sale at about some price. Scotch make, almost un- saleable.

Oilmen's stores Invoice parcels are still dull of sole ondJIkoly to continue so, whilst the opportunity is afforded the trade to select from almost any shippers brand the particular goods they require, and in moderate quantities. Large quantities have been thus disposed of lately, rendering the trade indifferent! to the purchase of Invoices, unless at reduced prices. Quotations are Blue, thumb Old, to 10d. per lb. ; fruits, bottled, quarts, 12s. 6d. to 13s. 6d. per dozen ; jams and Jellies, Mrs. jars, 12s. 6d. to 13s. do. ; mustard, In bulk.

Pitch and Tar The market is reported as being nearly cleared of both American, and Stockholm pitch and tar, and until supplies, come to hand, advancing prices may be looked for, Provisions The Food Supplies school have for the present overstocKed the market, and the trade being generally fairly supplied, sales have been loss readily effected. As, however, the season when consumption, Is largest is now approaching, with moderate supplies, some Improvement may be- looked for. Sinclair's bacon brings from 126. to 13d. ; English, 10d. to 120, ; Sinclair's hams, 12d. to 18d, ; York, had. to 1s. per lb. ; mess, pork has been, better supplied, and prices have declined to 52s. 6d. to £5 15s. per barrel ; cheese is ovcjsuppllnd and dull of sale, really prime parcels being the only sorts for which there is any inquiry. slates are in moderate, demand, but move off without briskness, although at rather improving prices. By auction a sale of a large parcel of blue Bangor, of countess size, has been placed at £12 15s. per 1,000. Timber The market continues generally inactive, and prices have not improved and as the trade are generally fairly stocked, and there appears a disposition with some holders to realise, any advance on present rates seems unlikely. American doors and sashes are overstocked. Tobacco. Demand continues brisk, and prices have undergone but little alteration. As however, heavy shipments are due from the United States, no advance on present rates can be looked for MELBOURNE MARKETS. THE MILLS.-The unsettled condition of the flour market, consequent on arrivals from Valparaiso and San Francisco, has caused a dull week, and millers report lighter than usual sales, at reduced prices. Fine flour is quoted at £20 to £27 per ton ; bran, 2s. to 2s. 1d. per bushel. Wheat, in the present uncertain state of the market, can scarcely be quoted, the millers being unwilling to purchase, unless at very reduced rites. RETAIL MARKSTB.-Butchers' Meat Beef, 5d. to 7d. per lb. ; mutton, 5d. to 6d. do. ; veal, 6d. to 9d. do.; pork, 9d. to 10d. do.

Bread, the 4lb. loaf, 2s. 2d. to 1s. 3d. HAY MARKETS-The near approach of haymaking has induced the farmers to send in large quantities of last year's crop, which, being generally of very low quality, has depressed the market, and reduced the prices. Best hay cannot be quoted at above £0 to £7, and inferior and stained sorts, of which the bulk at market chiefly consists, is difficult of sale at from £3 10s. to £5 per ton. Straw brings from £3 to 30s. per ton. EASTERN MARKET. There was an immense number of carts in the market this morning, and the quantity of produce quite equal to. If not in excess of last week's supply. There being a good choice of first quality of seasonable vegetables, inferior lots were unsaleable. The first strawberries for the season appeared this morning, and were early bought up at 4s. per pound. There were also a few unripe gooseberries for the first time, which sold readily.

As far as we can judge from the few lots that are to hand, this year's clip will be in good condition, as well as being well grown and sound in the stone. Our private sales during the month have been about 600 holes of scoured wool, at prices ranging from 20d. to 2s. per lb: " The following are the vessels that have sailed since our lost: Bales.

They also sold the entire horse Black Champion for £700, and two others, George the Fourth and Prince Charlie, for £250. Towards the end of the week the market was bare, owing, doubtless, to the V. J. O. Races. There are numerous inquiries for good-sized well- conditioned horses, and especially draught horses. , , LAUODII MARKETS-The demand which existed in the earlier portion of the weak has declined, towards its close, and the market has closed somewhat dull. Married couples unencumbered with young families, and suited for the bush, are however, still in fair demand, and female servants with references as to ability for household duties, and char fetch are readily engaged The late inquiry for male domestics has declined, and with the exception of a few coachmen, grooms, and useful farm servants, there have been scarcely any on gagements made.

CARTAOS ItsrOBT.-The amount of loading has been considerable, particularly towards the close of of the week. Many teamsters have, however, been disinclined to leave town during the race week, and in some instances a trifling advance on quoted prices has consequently been paid.
