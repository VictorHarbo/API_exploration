SIR DOUGLAS AT TEE SCBOOL OF ARTS. Mn Jon» DOUGLAS, as yot tho only candi date for tho lopreBuntation of tho olectorato of Brisbano in tbo Legislative ABaembly, oddroased a meeting of electora m tho School of Aits last evening Mi S. Eraser presided, and about 250 poison» woro present, Mossrs Hemmant and KniRsford boing among thoso on tho platform Tho OUAIBMAN, in introducing tho candidato, oxpiossod his regret at the unavoidable absence of His Worship tho Mayor, who had been proventod by indisposition from taking tho cb au. Mr DOUGLAS, who was loccived with loud applause, commenced by saying that as thoy woro awaro ho had, somo little timo ago, issuod a printed addroas, in which ho had ondouvorod to oxpioss his opinions on somo of tho leading topics of tho day. Thoso addresses, no doubt, wero gonorally oouohod m veiy general torms, and tho olootors very proporly required from nil oandidalee, who woro uboufc to eubmit thorn solves to thoir ohoicoA"nno moro dofinito exprès sion of their politicllviows Those addrojBOs, however, might bo aocoptod as loading guides as to what might bo oxpeotod from tbo moro dotailod statomenta to bo mado by can* didatos, and m that sonso ho bad there fore, to Bomo oxtcnt, prepaicd his hearora as to tho tenor of tho loraarks ho pro- posed to make Tho electors of tho oolony would bo shortly callod upon to give effect to tho now Electoral Aet which was in futuro to govorn tho proceedings of all Parliamentary elections. Ho was not quito auro that tho electors, BO far at any tate na their slight experience hadyotgono, woro very woll affected towards tbia Act, But it might bo na well to auapond their opinions until it was given a fair trial. Ho could not say that the Act approved itself to his judgment, as it appeared to linn that wo had, by an elaborate machinery ostensibly adopted with a MOW of guarding «gainst persouation, perhaps com- mitted oui solves to a vory muoli greater ovil in uunholesomely narrowing the consti- tuent body of the colony. (Cheers). Ho did not now wish to rofleot upon tho expo nonts or advisers of this measure, possibly thoy might havo boon actuated by tho bost intontions of enlarging the political franohiso, but ho «aB ufraid the vory contraiy effoot would piovo to bo tho caso. Ho found that tho oloo torato of Brisbans, for instance, contained on tho elootoial íoll 1090 names ¡ and this ho oon siderod was a vory diminutive number to bo accepted as tho roal representation of the man- hood sulfrago of thiB city-for such nominally was tho franchiso undor which leprcsontativcs woio now to bo elected. Yet oven that Bmall number was likely to bo still further diminished, for only yesterday by en- quiring ut tho Polico odlco, ho had found that only 460 electora had apphod for votoio' rights. It was truo that a space of time still intervened between now and tho ponod appointod for tho oloction, and it was quito possible that during this interval considerable activity might tako ploco in aplications for votors' rights. Thoro wero no decided indications of this, howevoi, as yot, and ho would heio strongly advise all oloo- tors whoao names woro on the roll to apply at onoo for their "rights." Do laya woro dangerous, and tho eoonei application waa mado the bettor. But whon wo contemplated this difEoulty as applied to this oity, how tnuoh moro did it apply to tho soattorcd districts. This Aet was passed on the basis of at any lato an attempted approxi- mation to the punciplo of (equal electoral dis- tricts ; eoino attempt was made to bring tho different electorates to a parity m population. But if tho olcctoral body of Bnabano was rendered co small, what, ho asked, was likely to bo the doctoral body of many outside districts? Ho waa afiaid their numbers would not exceed the diminutivo proposions which at ono timo attached to such electo- rates as the Wari ego and tho Mitchell. Wo had no veiy great right, thoroforo, to in- dulge in any fooling of confidonco in the Elec- toral Aot under which wo were soon to bo called upon to act. Ho had theroforo been somewhat Burprised to notico that tho Prime Minister had reooutly declared at Rockhampton that if thoro was ono mcaauio moro than anothor on whioh ho olaimod the gratitudo not only of tho Noith but of the wholo colony, it waa tina Act. Eor hiniBolf, ho (Mr Douglas) must confess that his foohngs of grntitudo woro not of a very supereminont chai actor No doubt tho increase in tho number of representatives waa justly demandod, nnd ospeomlly na íegarded the Northern districts. In thiB sonso mdood we might bo grateful to the last Parlia- ment as setting at lost to somo extent the ques- tion of Separation. So much for the Electoral Act ; and now bo was afraid ho Bhould hare to bo a little egotistical, although this was not a failing which ho had luthorto voiy much cul tnated, nor did ho feol it to be ono whioh was very muob to bo admirod. At the same timo, ho had come to tho conclusion that unless a man in his present position of a candidate gavo somo little prommenco to his personal vions and perhaps to his personal claims- there would bo many peoplo who would bo quito inclined to overlook them on that account. AB re- garded himself, thoy woro all awaro that tho field was at any rats open when ho announced himself as a candidate for tbo representation of Brisbane. Besides he bo* hoved bo had aonio claim to conaider that bia provioua position with regard to the electors and representativo system of the oolony justi- fied him in coming forward for the oity, oon eidonng thoro WBB a clear vacancy, with no one in tho ilold. Now, in conversation with many of his fnonds regarding hiB candidature, ho bad been moro than onco met with an enquiry, which ho felt under tho circumstances WAS "a fully justifiable one, although bo confessed Bomowhat fluttering to himself, but upon which he had been given to under- stand tbo cleotors would probably require a distinct and categorical roply. Al- though the question was not a usual one to put to a candidate, it had been moro than once put to himself, and ho thoreforo wished to distinctly rofer to it, and lo givo at onco the answer m public which ho had given in private. The question was-" Aro you a candidato or likely to bo a candidate for the Speakership of tho Legislative Assembly ?" As ho had remarked, tho question was possibly flattering to himself, but it was ono which ovory elector had a perfect right to ask, and he would therefore reply posi- tively that ho was not a candidate, nor was ho nkoly to be so under any oiroumstanccs ¡ nor could he conceive that during the next Parliament was he likely, if elected, to become oonnooted with auch an ofllco He felt it was necessary to say this becauso, situated as tho constituonoy 0£ Brisbano was at present, ho felt tho oleetora would not submit to tho disfranchisoment which to a great extont tho acceptance of tho Speaker^ chair by nny of their members would involve. (Choora ) Ho wished it theroforo to bo dis- tinctly understood that it waa simply in tho inteieet of tho electors that ho now oame for. ward, eimply as an aspirant for a Boat m tho Houao as member for Brisbane ¡ and ho did not considor that in tbo presont circumstances such membership would bo consistent with their lntereBt if it woro po=siblo that ho Bliould ao cept tho Speakeiship Ho could not but Bay howovei, that ho looked upon it as a matter of regret that nny candidate should bo oallod upon to ronounco such a position, being OB it WOB the highest which anj mombor of tbo Legislative Assombly could attain to , but thoro wero poh. tical necessities whioh must yield to ali others, and this waa ono of them Ho did not know whether it would be necessary to demand a similar disclaimer from his friends on the plat, form, and he hoped thoir old friend Mr Edmondstono would also bo called upon to ronounoe tho Spoakorship (^ laugh ) If this renouncement wore expected from him (Mr Douglas) na a party man, ltmnst certainly apply to the whole party with whioh ho hoped to act (Ohoora ) A similar difficulty to this had been felt in the neighboring colonies, and in Viotorm it had been proposod that after the Spoaker was olooted, a writ of elootion Bhould lSBUo for his constituonoy, and a now member bo oloctod to fill his place Whothor, howevor, this plan would bo found practicable, ho could not any, but in the meantime ho thought it was vory objectionable that a good man, from his party connections, should be precluded from uoceptiug the ofllco of -C'^kor, or that tho Assembly should bo proolud,.¿í from obtaining porhapB tho best man for the ofllco on this account Ho Bhould now proceed to mako a fow remarks upon eome of tho loading ques- tions which Parliament would be oallod upon to doil with, but boforo doing ao, ho should like to Bay that tho relationa of tbo mombera for tho city and ita neighborhood towards tho promeut or any othor Government, woro of a pool ' ' t respouaible ohuiactor. Thore woro cortara ges- tions in which the oity was materially interested, and which would havo to bo lookod upon vory carefulh. Thoeo were, ho might say, busincBB mutters not necessarily connected with politics, as for instance tho improve °»f of tho nvei navigation (which ho must aaj'NGi boen very fairly attended to by the prosont Government), tho question ot sowoge, and the very important question of the Brisbano Bndgo. Hia personal rotations with tho hoad of tho pre»ont Government had not beon of a very pleasant or vory cordial character. Ho could not say that (apart from being on tolerable speaking torins) tbo Ministry wero oifbor very friondly or likely to bo \ ery cordially disposod towardB him , but ho wishod to pay that ho should endeavor as far as possible, if ontruBtod with tho duty of guarding the mtorosti of tho olcotors of Bnabane, to conduct thcao purely business matters on a footing apart ultogothei from party politics AB re- garded tho bridge ho considorod this ono of thoso matters in which ho should be bound to act in concert with thoso gentlemen who should bo elected by the constituencies of Enoggera) Wickham, South BriBbano, and othor olootorates in the viomity of tho oity, and ho should thoroforo support whatever oourao thoso gentle- men ugrood upon as a lino of pohoy to bo pur- sued, and ho thought this would bo tho safest pinn to adopt Our anxiety was to relievo tha city of the excessive burden which would nttaoh to it if the wholo of tho dobt which ovorhung tho completion of this bridge wero per- manently fastened on tho Municipality. Ho thought it must bo patent to all who had watched the hiBtory of the nego- tiations connected with tho formation of thia bndgo, that tho Municipality had scarcely boon fairly troatod in many matters, and that it would be cortainly foi tho íntoioBts of tho city and tha wholo neighborhood that the bridge should bo mado free. (Chooia ) How this was to bo brought about could scarcely bo said oxictly ai prosont, but it was clear that Busbano would have to mako common cause in this matter with tho two northorn towiiB of Maryborough and Rockhampton, in both of wbioh thoro was a do* siro to havo bridges for the public convenience, ha presumed thorofoio that the onfranohisement of tho Brisbano Bndgo would havo to bo connootod with tho conBtruotion of similar works at Maryborough and Rockhampton. Ho waa sanguino onough to bohevo that tho original ondowmont of land at South Brisbano which had been estimated at the time at tho valuo of somothmg lite £50,000, might ovontually be found not far fiom renohing that sum if ]udi ciously applied Of course tho vory thought of disposing of it at present would bo ridiculous, but if tho Government undertook to froo the bridge and mako it a public work thoso endow- ments which woro connected with tho ongmol undertaking would havo to rovort to tho Government in patt liquidation of tho wholo dobt. On such matters, howovor, ho would be found quito willing to co operate with bia brothor mombors if ho should havo the good fortune to bo elcoted. And now as rogarded a fow of the moro important questions which wera likely to attract attention-and first, ho would tako that of immigiation, which to his mind was tho inoBt important of all. But beforo proceed- ing ho would iii st hko to soy a few words re- garding tho Polynesian question. Erom tha first dawn of tbis*institution amongBt UB ho had felt that it threatened tho colony with veiy con- siderable difficulties. Ho could romembcr the dissatisfaction ho and othors felt whon tho Poly iiesuin Bill was firstintroduced, but being ignorant OB all then woro of the vile practices which had sinco been carried on under the system of recruiting in tho Pacific Islands, they did not of course take that strenuous objection to the bill which thoy should haio taken if thoy wera aware to what it would havo led Still, there wero somo of them who felt that tho colony was committing itself to a system of labor which would bo fraught with evil consequences to the country; and ho had a lively recollection of having called down upon himaolf a vehement denunciation from Mr Palmor, for having even in measured terms expressed his doubt as to the wisdom of that legislation. Everything that had Binco occurred had confirmed him (Mr Douglas) in tho opinion ho then hold, and he had nover hesitated cither in England or m this colony, 01 under any circumstances, to ox prose his opinion that tho people of this country as a wholo had always looked upon that syBtem of immigration with tho groatost disfavor, and h.o had novel hesitated to say that tho practices carried on under it had been repudiated, and would oontinno to bo ropudiotod, by the vast majority of tho people of the colony. (Loud obeors ) But so far na Polynesian emigration was concerned, ho thought they might consider it practicallv at an end ; at all events, public opinion had now been so cloarly drawn to (he vile prac- tices, to tho robbery and wickedness which had been perpetrated under it, that the oivihsed nations of tho world had now got clearly to seo that it muBt bo put an end to (Cheers ) At least all those evils which had grown so rank woro now happily at nn end, for the great maritime powers bad made up their minda that tho evil should bo crushed out at its source-in tho îalandB thomsclvoa. With regard to Euro- pean immigration, romombering as ho did the unneoessarj difficulties, the discourteous treat- ment, and, as it Eoonied to him, tho wilful intontion, ho had mot with on tho part of tho Government ot that time, to put a stop to immigration, during the short time bo waa in England, ho confessed it wos with some surprise, but with no less gratifiootion, that bo now saw that tho Government had fairly com- mitted thomeolveB to sustain, and ho hoped to increase, this valuable moans of recruiting our energies Tho presont Act itself, bo believed, was certainly tho beat ovor passed, and ho would give Mr Palmer tho credit »hot in this matter ho had taken the advice of people compotent to give it, Tho Act was, ho considered, calculated to work most favorably, and under success- ful administration might be tbo cau«o oí the greatest benefit to tbo colony. (Cheers) To take one feature, alone, of the Act tho A"' twelve months aftor it carno Sto operation thoro were upwards of 1500 np lírationa for rcmittanoo passages Now ho had Plwavs lookod upon this form of immigration as of the very best, and ho hoped to hoar that fheso applications wero on tho increase Ho fherefore said advisedly that provided ho could to this system Btoadily maintained and in üreased not raBhlybut gradually, and in accord co with our wants, as well as also in accord face, with tho supply of emigrants Booking to omo out to Queensland-if, ho said, ho could eo that this Act woro retained in forco and with effective administration, ho would gladly seo tbo preaont Govornmeut itself continuo in nower piovidod wo could keep that Government a check by a strong and wholesomo Opposition He said this not that ho would commit any act ,« opposition to tho opinion of his political friends to keep tho presont Government in Inner but, being ra powor, it would bo a Jourco'of grcot satisfaction to him, whatever differences of opinion ho might havo on othor oints with tho Government, to know that they «.ero fairly committed to tho wholesomo, modo rate and effective maintenance of this system There wero somo points however, in tho admi nistration of this Act, whioh did not Btriko lum as verv satisfactory. Ho waa not ouite satisfied that wo got full value for our money, for it must be íomcmbered that the amount now expended on immigration was larger proportionately to tho number of itnmigronta wo reooivod than was ovor Bpent before Ho should wish, howat er, to spoak guardedly on this point, because tho prosont con- dition of things in England, of which ho waa un- aware, might necessitate glentor relativo expen- diture But thcrowero also certain points observ able connected with thopresentudmuustration of the Immigration Act from which it would np pear that immigrants had been Bolectod caro kssly (Cheers) We bad soon lnstonoca io contljC Y^ich ho hoped wore only exceptions, but which hu waa sorry to say wero moro frequout thon ho liked to seo, of a character of persona arriving m eomo of tho shipe, whom it waa not desirablo tbat¡wo should recoivo into tins country at all (Loud ohcors ) Ho Bald it would be far better that wo should havo ofily half tho num- ber of immigrants arriving than that wo Bhould hive such ohoractora na aoine of those lately ntroduced Ho hopod this would uot bo con etrued as said in discouragement of tho system, but morely as a wholesome warning of tho dan gera and difficulties of an immigration policy unless very carefully guarded (Oboers ) Ano her matter bo Bhould also hko to mon t on while on this Bubject was, that thore wei -oma pooplo who thought wo could not Lavo too much in tho way of immigration îiow b.9 did not ogroo with thiB opinion Ho thought tbo safest system of immigration was that which kept the supply well under tho demand, because the moment (hat tho supply esceedod tbo demand there was a risk of a reaction unfavorable to tho wholo system He would bo therefoio rather content with a moderate supply than risk an ovor supply Iho moment wo began to BOO pcoplo OBkmg for cmplovment and not able to get it, that moiuont Government immigration-artificial immigra tien-began to wane. But ho thought thero m5 no necessity for such an hour nrwng if tho market woro carofully notched, and tho supply kept woll in connection with tho demand Ho observod that Iho German Government had taken upon themselves to issuo an interdict upon all agents advocating emigration, and the flow of German cm granta to America had no doubt induced this Now ho must say ho was Borry that Gor man immigration mto Queensland was likely to be mterrupted by thia coureo, fo" ho lookod upon Germans as some of the host immigrants that could be introduced Wo novor hoard of thia class going to Now South Wales, for thoy nil as soon as they could, settled upon the land, and ho therefore rcgrotted that not only from the action of the Germans themselves, but also from tho action of tho Queens- land Govornmont, Gorman immigration was likely to bo put a atop to altogether But be would like to remind the Government that thoro waa a class which vtoio equally valuable, that could be obtainod from Denmark, Swedon, und Noiway. Ho had recently road in tho Lifo of Mr Brassey, a lottor by that gontloman, show- ing that he plucod tho Danish navvies only tccond to thoso of tho United Kingdom Ho would also wish to Bay that wo nii(,ht obtain n very suitable class of mon for our purposes from Northern Italy, the peoplo of which wero «' o a vory uno race Ho hoped, thoro fore that the Govornmont would not con daer booauBo thoy thought thomsolves laut out of tho Gorman markot thoy woco thora fors shut out from au equally good source of immigration As to the ships that carno out, ho thought it was a mailor of regret that thoy wero oil leaving tho pott of London, as ho thought sb ps might also bo despatohod, with vory httlo incouvcnionco, h oin Liverpool and Glasgow 01 Greenock Intimately connected with our îm migraliou policy waa our pohoy in connection nth the alienation of Crown lands, whioh vvnB i question that tho now P"rhamont would un- doubtedly bo called upon to deal with, and probably to logislato upon Looking bock upon the period during whioh the Ciown Ian Is Alienation Act of 1868 had been n foi ce there could bo no doubt whatever that whatever woro ita faults, tho alienation Knell had taken ploeo under that Act had boen of the gicato t benefit to the country (Oboers) "No doubt evils might havo anson undor it, and it -as tnoie than probable that thero had been a freat deal of oollusivo dealing in many mattera co i ted with it Iho full scope of the Act vra3 ] erlupa not Been on ita paBsmg, but apart io t! it, a tai go amount of improvement and J» file occupation and rosidoncohadtakonplaco u u r it, and ho was quito confident that tho eou itry had been put to very much groatcr use i e th-n before it was alienated, as could bo Ly a journoy through East and West ^f '?> Vs a whole, the working of tho Act ' a b cn very successful, although it might nar b en inorrcd by deficiencies, and porhaps o no io poets by maladministration, but they »lew that tbo administration of tho Crown '» 3s ! ad provod a great diflleulty even to the r-J t expciienced Miniatera Ono of tho moat I oi ta t aub questions in connection with tho II g ot the Crown landa which would i " during tho next session would bo tho juc tiou of the ten yours' loases, and tho more «t nded area w'noh would bo now demanded jo settlement With regard to the ten yenra' ie-s s and tho modo of dealing with them, ho «emly Baid that he found tbo last legislation on ton subject, the Homestead Areas Act, waa in m» opinion a measure which was calculated to lau to further improvement aod occupation auch being the case, if further demand arose, a .unir further extension should toko place, :or " ''10 hind were rcquirea, in whatever quan ?V m l0"" flde o00uPBtlon> >' must bo 5 (Cheers) Ho found, on consulting on ic lient map at tho Brisbano Lond omeo taat 8 JcRar^Ci* 'bo subdivisions of runa tbo nreo w« had at present dealt with waa onlv a fleabite i comparison with what waa in reservo, and T t v>as m reserve Bhould, when necessary, bo i J j 'w,th In connection with this, ho J-ia draw attention to tho powers which Par I'nent now had m dealing on an extended 0 « they clioso with the question of the 'ion nf lands throughout tho colony But doing so ho would draw attention , PrcßEtmt fact that tho whole lea T nt Prosont raised from the 1 3 of Crown lands in the pastoral !r çja did not exceed £115,000, the eatimate ^ -being £120 000, which betook it waa a e u°aerato rental for the magnificent public te which wo poa»ossed.

Clause 55 of the Pastoral Leases Aet of 1869 re a erred ampio power to the Executive for tho time being to reservo from any run a block of 2500 aorea, or to reservo any ex- tent of land by giving six months' notico to tho lesseo ; and thiB took tho effect of law, unlosB it was di«sentod to by both Houses of Parliament. Therefore, if it wero considered necessory to extend tho alienation of Crown lands, it could bo dono without giving an eqm valent rémunération tothcloscea foi their land, as was demanded by Mr Wienholt. No such claim could bo put forward under the Pastor ii Leasoa Aet, and ho should sticnuously resist anything of tho kind And ho must claim hore, without any attempt at falso modecty, to lay somo claim to popular support, as having taken a firm position on this matter, foi unless ho had taken tho stops ho had dono to sccuro this guarauteo which wo now possessed in that Aet, the pooplo of the colony would find themsolvoj in a very much woiso position than thoy were. Ho had felt his responsibility as member of the Government at that time, and ho was dctorminod to givo effect to his opinions j if they had not boen acted upon by tho Cabinet, ho would certainly havo left it Beforo leaving tho land question, ho would eay that ho had ncvor dunug his political career aoted with the extreme squatting party, as would bo Been by rofornng to his votes. Ho did not wish to Bay anything hard of that powerful, consistent, and ooheront party, among whom ho hod had many friends, and ho would only say that ho was not ono of thom-ho had never boon ono of them, and ho was not likoly to bo ouo of them. (Loud cheela) He now como to education, and be would apeak quite distinctly and oxphcitly on tho ques- tion, so that thero could bo no doubt as to Ina vione. Tho question had not in his opinion boon placed in a vory alluring light at present. There had been vory many ohangoa and vana tiona in the pursuit of the question, so that ho confessed ho did not approach it as it now Btood with any vory hearty feeling. They know that at tho closo of tho last sossion an Education Bill was introduced, and ho felt himself that the occasion was an uufortunato ono to ohooso for tho introduction of such a moasuio at suoh a timo Howovor, Binco thon -aftor Mr Lilloy'a bill being brought in, and aupportod by Mr Palmor-wo now hoard of Mr Palmor, eftor haviug nocoaaitatod tho resignation of ouo of bia collooguoa through bia (Mr Palmor's) support of that bil), going up to lîookhamptou, nnd bringing out u new bill which ho called his own, but pronouucod it a privato measure, while stating his lutontion to " stand or fall by it." This of courso, coming from a Mimstor who profosBod at least to bo tho bead of a Kcsponsiblo Ministry, appoarod to him (Sir DouglttB) exceedingly extraordinary , ut any roto it waa perfectly unusual, and ho took it to bo a completo solecism in tho hietory of legislation Looking at this, ho said ho should cortainly-apait nltogothor from the monts or dementa of Mr Palmor'a bill-voto aguniBt it on tho pocond rooming, and if possible on its first reading. For his part, ho thought it was botter to stick by tho old ruloa of party warfaro thau by any now fanglod notions of pcisonul responsibility such us Mr Palmor appeared to tako upon himsolf in thiB mattor-but not tho responsibility of Go- vernment. (Ohoors ) His voting aguinst tho bill, howovor, might provo unsuccessful, und of course undor tho"o circumstances ho should go into tho monta of tho bill, but his judgment refusod to go into it at present In comparing, however, tho two billa ho found thoro woro eomo pointa on which ho ngrcod with Mr Lilley, somo on which ho coincided with Mr Palmoi, and somo on which ho ngrood with both. In tho first place, ho did not hko Mi Palmer's idoa of putting ut tho head of the Educution-ofiloo a responsible Miuiatoi without a Board Ho did not moan to Bay that an Education Act might not bo adminiatored by u roaponsiblo Miniator i but ho uttorly dissonted from Mr Pulmor'B axiom at Kockhanipton - that ho would lather havo a bad roaponsiblo Minister at the hoad of tho Education Department than an irresponsible Board Wo know how hard it was to fix responsibility at present, and ho would ask thom how would it bo poasiblo to fix tho responsibility of a bud Minister. Ho did not bollero, howovor, that there waa any nocca aity for an irresponsiblu Board, ns ho bo hevod a Board could bo mado to a groat extent responsible and pructioally waa responsible. Ho bohoved that on tho wholo tho working of tho Queensland Board had boen adinuablo, as oomparod with Boards of Education in somo of the neighboring colonies (cheers) , but if there woro to bo a chungo, ho waa not ushuuicd to tako an cxainplo from Now South Wales, whoro thoy had now au admirable Board of Education, under tho Chairmanship of tho ProfoBaor of tho TJnivorsity. Ho obseivcd that many candidates had expressed the i selves unfavorably towards tho university clauses of Mr Ltltey's bill ; but apart from tho clauses OB drafted ho liked tho gouoial outline of tho notion, and considered it far superior to tho proposal mado by Mr Palmoi. Ho considered tho idoa of Oommon Ohriatiamty howoroi aa impracticable, although it would bo cortainly vory desirablo, if possiblo to bo ear- ned out. However, it was not practicable, and wou'd at least rccoivo the strenuous opposition of a largo portion of tho oommunity , and thora foro ho considered it better to confino the ope- rations of tho State entirely to such subjects as woro not conneoted with religion or religious denominations. (Loud ohoors ) In adopt- ing this principio, ho behoved wo Bhould bo only oarrying out the policy wo bad alroady distinctly adopted-tho abolition of State a d to religion, Ho waa far from seeing that the toaclnug of purely sooulai education by tbo State would necessarily lead to nny lack of interest in religious mattors, for it could not bo said Ihoio was lcaa dono in tho way of rohgioua exposition now than before Stato aid waa abolished. Ho hod thought a gieat doal upon tho Bubjoct, and his mind was completely made up, BO that if they elected him thoy must not look to him for any further development of tbo systom of connection be- tween Church and State us applied to education. In conclusion, ho must insist that thoy should exactly understand Ins position as regarded party rolotions. He.did not aupposo for a mo- ment that any of thom anticipated ho was going in as a Ministerial Bupporter. Ho would go mto tho House as ho hoped a courteous, but a decided and moderate, member of what bo hoped would bo a strong aud consistent Opposition. (Oheors) And he was quito willing to Btato that if such a combination could bo found amongBt tho Opposition mem- bers as would entitle thom to believe they could foi m another Govornmont on a sound BubBtan tial and progressive basis, ho should gladly devote his best services to that party. Mr Douglas concluded by stating that although ho would not bo disappointed if he were rejected in favor of a moro suitable candidate, aa he had lost most of his former lore of political life, still ho would do his best to servo them faithfully and disin- terestedly if they put their truBt m him. After Mr Douglas had replied to a few quos tiona, Mr COOTE moved, and Mr Alderman SPBNOE seconded, a vote of confidence in Mr Douglas as tho representativo of North Brisbane. The motion was put and carried unani- mously. A voto of thanks to tho chairman terminated the proceedinga. THE appointments of Sir Andrew Clarke as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Straits Settlements and their dependencies, and of Mr Cornelius Bendenschen Kortright as Adminis- trator of the Government of Her Majesty's settle ment on the Gambia, appear in the Gazette.

THE Eov. Georgo Eose, formerly vicar of Esrls-Heaton, near Dewsbury, having Boeeded from the Church in consequence of tbo "Ben- nett judgment," has been baptized at the Metro- politan Tabernacle by Mr Spurgeon.
