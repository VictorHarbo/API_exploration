She left Plymouth on the 30th May, crossed the equator on the 27th June, and the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope, in lat. 44deg. S., on the 18th of the following month. Captain Reynell reports having had fine weather to passing the Cape ; since then she has encoun- tered a succession of heavy gales, especially when, in lat. 43deg. S., long. 60deg. E., she expe- rienced a cyclone, which commenced at E.N.E., and went round southerly to S.W., blowing furiously during which she split several sails. About a week afterwards she again encountered a very severe gale, during which she had one of her life- boats washed out of the davits, and carried away her foretopsailyard. Throughout this very severe weather the Yorkshire behaved splendidly, fully maintaining her high character. On this coast she has had to contend against a succession of northerly winds, with rough unsettled weather. Her passengers have enjoyed good health, and the ship is remarkably clean. THE GREAT BRITAIN.—The Great Britain steamship anchored in Hobson's Bay at noon on the 14th instant, having again accomplished a rapid passage. She left Liverpool at two p.m. on the 15th June, with 556 passengers and a large and valuable cargo. She crossed the equator on the seventeenth day out, and the meridian of the Cape on the thirty-seventh day. On the 1st, when in lat. 45deg. 20min. S., long. 67deg. E., a terrific gale was encountered from N.E., and which continued for seventeen hours, throughout which the ship behaved nobly, not sustaining the slightest damage. No death occurred, and the passengers were all in good health. The ship was, as usual, in first rate order, reflecting great credit on her commander and his officers. THE ship Acrington anchored in Hobson's Bay about eleven a.m. yesterday. She left South- ampton on the 5th June, crossed the equator on the 6th of the following month in long. 23 W., passed the meridian of Cape of Good Hope on the 29th July in lat. 40 S., and passed Cape Otway at six p.m. on the 21st instant. Captain Christie reports having had at the onset of his passage contrary winds, which lasted for the first nine days, then had fair wea- ther to passing the meridian of the Cape. Since then she had encountered very severe weather. The Acrington is a magnificent iron ship of nearly 2,000 tons register, with fine lofty accommodation for passengers. She brings 436 Government immigrants, all in good health. Five births have taken place during the passage. The ship is in first-rate order. The classification of immigrants is as follows :—Single women, 306 ; single-men, 13 ; married couples, 30 ; children, 49 ; infants, 13. WOOL SHIPS SAILED SINCE OUR LAST SUMMARY.
