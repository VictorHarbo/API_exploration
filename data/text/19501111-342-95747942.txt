British Visas Refused SECURITY PRECAUTIONS London, Nov. 10.— Strict secur ity precautions were taken at all British ports and airfields to-day in readiness' for the first mass ar rival of delegates to the Commu nist-backed World Peace Congress which will- open in Sheffield on Monday. A number of immigration officers had their week-enc .e..vj cancelled to cope with the delega tions. So far Britain had granted only about 220 visas, including 25 i for 'Russians, out of a total of 1900 applications. More than 152 applicants have been banned on the grounds that they are personally unacceptable to ;the British Government. They include 40 Russians. 14 Czechs, 12 Bulgarians, 14 East Germans, 17 Hungarians, 14 Poles and 13 Ru manians, according to information reaching the congress organisers in London. Transportation Troubles The Soviet, . Chinese, Mongolian and Kore-.n delegates wt e : c. g transportation difficulties in Prague because Britain had ban ned 18 special flights to bring them to Sheffield. A spokesman for the BruV.sh Ministry of Civil Aviation said in London tha.t the ban was imposed after reconsideration by a 'higher authority,' believed to be the Foreign Secretary, Mr Eivesr, i Beyin. The ban applied t .-.ine j charter flights booked by Czech' airliner ahu nine ui£,noj uy Bt i sh European Airways acting as agents for the Czechs. None will be allow ed to land at British airfields. The delegates booked on the planes — more than 300 bookings were made before the visas were granted — will have ? to fly by scheduled flights, but many of ? them are believed to have been j weeded out by the lack of visas. They will be unable to cross Western Germany by road or rail; but about 38 Rumanian and Polish delegates are coming by sea from Gdynia (Poland). -, About 250 Italians, 200 French-' mens-and the Belgian. Dutch and Luxemburg delegations . are due in Britain on Sunday.

Three clerical persons in the delegation, Calvinist and Luthe ran bishops and a Catholic priest, were all refused. The paper said they were 'deeply hurt.' Possible Cancellation In Prague reliable persons .in close touch with the Communist heirarchy said to- day that the peace congress might be cancelled and held later in Prague or some other Eastern European city.
