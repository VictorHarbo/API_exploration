. COMMERCIAL.. ? ?? ? ? ?. ? . ??- — ' ? *- ? ?? ......... Age Office, Saturday Evening. There were no export entries passed for gold at the customs to-day. The early part of the week was characterised by great dulness in the import market, and a strong disinclination to enter into any business operation was obsorvable. As the week advanced, however, a much better feeling was noticeable, and, on tho the whole, a fair amount has been done, though not so general as could bo wished, articles most in favor being those chiefly in demand for the New Zealand market. Balk ale continues to drag heavily, a slight decline having been again submitted to. Bottled stout has been quiet, and the turn easier. Com sucks have been almost neglected. Candles show no im provement in value. Fruits have been firm, but transactions limited. Flour and wheat havo both been active, and an advance of 10s on the former, and 4d per bushel on tho latter established during the we ek ; prices still tending upwards. For horso feed tho market has been steady. Malthas declined slightly, and ovidently looks sick. Provisions havo again been extensively dealt in, and a rise of fully 2d per lb, since our last report, has been realised upon butter. Hams, and bacon continue in demand, and lots offered either afloat or ou the spot, are eagerly bought up. Rice is very dull and drooping, but without any transactions at present by which to es timate its value. Coarse salt has been unnoticed ; fine, in fair demand. Sugar, with the utmost diffi culty, can maintain its position. Teas continue in a healthy and improving state. Sales of deals have been made at better prices. Tobacco attracts no at tention but for trade purposes. Wines and spirits have been dealt in to a fair extent, prices of fine brandies, and first-class geneva being well supported. The English and foreign arrivals comprise five ves sels from England, two from the Continent, ono irom California, one from America, one from Cal cutta via Adelaide, one from Java, one from China, and one from Mauritius. Ale and Stout. — Bulk alo continues in the same unsatisfactory position it has occupied for some time ; the demand, being confined to supplying trade wants, is far from sufficient to carry off tho ship ments now freely coming forward; the price is con sequently again lower. Bass' No. 3 is offering at £8 10s, sales being difficult to make. Marian's can bo bought at the same rate, and numerous buyers are found for small lots. Joules's has also suffered a corresponding decline with the others, £3 10s being the figure at which it is offered. A slight reduction has in tho like manner been conceded on the Colonial Company's, sales having been made at £8 los to £8 10s. The Carlisle Company's sells at £8 5s. A fair demand is experienced for stout, cliiedy met by shipments of Taylor, Walker and Co.'s, and Whit bread's, at £7 2s 6d to £7 us. Bottled ale, in prinie condition, is inquired for, tho demand appearing larger than it really is, from tho difficulty of meet ing with anything first- class. There is little Brass's or Bass's triangle offering ; such might command 9s 9d to 10s 3d ; in the absence of these, however, tho trade find a satisfactory substitute in Joule's and the Colonial Company's, which can bo bought at 9s 6d, other brands realising from 8s 6(1 to 9s 3d. Bottled stout continues in limited request. Danphy's, in prime condition, brings 10s ; inferior, which several shipments have turned out to be, is offered at less money. Machen's finds buyers at 10s. Henry White and Co.'s 10s to 10s 6d. Very little Guinness's is offering ; it would realise 10s to 10s 3d. Byass's goes into consumption at 9s 6d. One parcel was sold at auction at 9s 4.Jd. Hibbert's and Bridge's are worth 9s 3d to 9s 6d, and R. Porter's 9s. Bagoi.no. — Corn sacks have been quite stationary, and notwithstanding the small stocks held, were sales pushed, a decline on former rates must be the result. We do not alter our quotations from 22s to 23s, though in tho absence of any transactions, it must be considered nominal. Wool packs are with out inquiry, at 4s 6d, Bran bags sold for 12s. Candles have received moderate attention, from some who are of opinion they cannot go lower, though they may go higher, and several sales of con siderable parcels have been effected quietly in tho market, at Is for full weights, lib packets. Large quantities of damaged are continually offering at low prices, which adds greatly to the difficulty of placing sound ones. 2000 boxes of this description wero sold at auction this week, at 10;}d to ll£d. In the ordinary course of trade, Belraonts bring 12Jd, in prime order. Considerable parcels of this brand, however, held over for a very long period, and de teriorated in consequence, and sold lately, realised bnly 12d to 12Jd. Cramer's are valued at 12£d. Brandon's, 12Jd, and other English and foreign brands, 12Jd. Light weights (ordinary description) are nominal at 9Jd to lOd. A parcel sold at auction, and designated light weight stearine, are stated to have realised lljd. ' Cement remains without much notice, and may be quoted at 10s to 12s. Portland realises from the trade 22s 6d to 25s. 300 barrels. American plaster, arrived tliis^yeek, brought at auction only 20s, not withstanding the small stock and tho high figure do- , manded privately from consumers, but, from the pe culiar circumstances attending its sale, we can hardly take the price thus obtained as a fuir criterion of the market.- *?-'-?- Chicory, continues unaltered at 3d to 3Jd. Coffee. — Considerable parcels have been quitted of this article at the advance recently established, plantation meeting with buyers to a fair extent at. Is ; native lOJd ; Java, lOJd to lid, ono lot of the latter having been cleared off at lOgd. Confectionery. — A steady trade is doing for con sumption at unaltered rates ; assorted, selling at lid; jujube'), Is ; and candied peel, at 13d. Cordage. — Manilla at present evinces little signs of improvement ; assorted sizes cannot be quoted over £47 to £49. Seaming realises 14 Jd to 15d. Chemicals are not in much favor. Soda crys tals, though not offering over freely, show no im provement on £8 5s to £8 10s. Muspratt's caustic soda is valued at £21 ; and other brands fully 20s less. Soda ash is almost unsaleable, but occasion ally a sale at £12 ia reported. Sulphur is worth £21, but dull and inactive. Carbonate of soda at this season isjalways heavy ; 17s 3d to 17s 6d is its present ''value. Coloaial-aaade sulphuric acid sells at 4d to 4»d. ? Fish. — Ling, in prime order, has beon sold at 5Ad per parcel, while 5|d has been paid for small lots. Herrings, are in steady trade request, at 28s for barrels and 10s for firkins. Fruits. — Currants are firm at 4Jd. Ono parcel, to clear out a shipment, was sold at 4 '.d; but un less supplies come to hand more freely, we fully oxpeot 4Jd will bo the ruling figuro for some time. Sultana raisins are held for 8d ; Capo 7d to 7;{rd ; Muscatels GJd. Figs 7d to 7Jd ; Barcelona nnts, 6Jd ; soft shell almonds, 7Jd. Flour akd Grain. — The trade in breadstuff's has continued active, with a rising market, ordinary silk dressed Adelaide flour having advanced to £14 5s, which price was realised yesterday for a parcel of fifty tons Bulterworth's, Hart's, and Magarey's have reached £14 10s ; stocks of all descriptions are very light, and prices firm. Mogue mills brings £13 ; other Victorian brands £12 10s to £13 10s ; Adelaide wire dressed £13 10s. Wheat has met with a corresponding improvement, ono parcel of Adelaide having been placed at 5s lOd. Victorian is worth 5s 6d ; feeding at auction brought 4s lOd. Oats liavo been tolerably active. Colonial for feed ing purposes have sold freely at as 4d to 5s 9d. Danish, at us 3d. Several parcels to arrive have been placed at extreme rates. Dutch have beon sold all faults, at 4s Id to 4s 5d. Seed oats bring Cs to Gs 3d. Feeding barloy is rather difficult to sell at Is 3d to 4s 6d. Malting is saleable at 5s Od.to 6s. Maize is dull at 5s 9d to us lOd. Bran is worth Is 4d to Is 4Ad. Pollard at auction brought 14Jd to lud, and hay £1 10s. Scotch oatmeal sold at £28 to £30, and colonial at £35. Colonial pearl barley £37. ' Gunpowder is in slow saio at 7d to 8d, according to brand. Hops arc saleable at 2s to 2s 2d for '62's, though not in active request, nor can largo parcels be dis posed of. Malt has come forward freely, but tho demand having greutly Blackened, prices have been con siderably easier ; 9s 9d to 10s is the outside value of small trade lots, and although 9s 6d generally is asked for bins, wo have heard of sales at less money. We fear it is doomed to go lower yet. Metals. — Pig iron is very quiet at £3 12s 6d. Corrugated, English sorts, are still scarce. Gospel Oak is worth £34 10s. Hamilton and Skaifo's, £33 10s. Lion brand, 26 gauge, 7 feet, sold for £37. Star brand, 0, 7, and 8 feet, 20 guage, £84 5s ; same brand, 6 feet, 2i gauge, £34 ; same brand 7 feet and 7 feet C, 24 gaugo, £34 ills. Damaged Eagle brand sold for £2'.i to £29. Sheet lead is worth £20 10s. Zinc, £30. Tin plates are valued at 20 per cent, ou invoice. 300 boxes, damaged, brought, IC, 9si 6d 'to 12s Gd ; IX, 10s to 14s Gd; IXX, 16s to 17s 6di Oils. — Though considerable sales afloat have been made of kerosene, yet en the spot business has not been so active, the trade having been well supplied for some time past. Prices are decidedly easier, Cousin's and Downer's not being worth over 3s 8d, and other brands from 2s 9d to 3s 3d. Linseed is firm at 5s Gd, but not selling freely. Castor is wanted, and would bring 5s 6d, Chinese sells slowly at 4s 3d to 4s 6d. Colza and olive are very little inquired for. Oilmen's Stokes generally have not been brisk, though some stores, being scarce, have been actively inquired for. Bottled fruits the market is quite bare of. Ono parcel, arrived this week, was placed, unseen, at 12s. Jams, lib, are worth lls 3d to 11s 6d. Supplies of colonial having ceased, the market will now have to depend entirely on English makes to supply its requirements. Pickles find buyers at 7s 6d to 9s Gd. Mustard, 8d. Sago, 4£d. Salmon is scarce, and wanted at 17s 3d to 17s 6d. Sardinas are in rather better doinand at improved ratos. Sales have been made at 9s 7;,d and Gs 7Jd, but they are now held for 9s 9d and 6s 9d. Quarter's faulty, were disposed of at Gs Id. INE matches, 2s 8d per gross. Provisions. — Butter has again been very active, and largo sales, to arrive and on tho spot, have been effected at considerably enhanced rates. Several parcels, of 200 firkins each, wero placed at 14Jd on Wednesday, subsequently offers of 14Jd to 15d, to arrive, all faults, were freely made, but rejected. Yesterday, 15Jd on the spot was refused, and sales were made since at 16d. A further sale of 500 fir kins, afloat, all faults, at extreme rates is reported to-day. Hams and bacon continue in grout demand but business ia almost at a standstill for want of supplies, many orders for New Zealand lying over unexecuted in consequence. The last arrival rea lised, for secondary brands, lOd for bacon, and 16Jd for hams. The whole on the way advised by the last and previous mails, have changed hands at 14d and 16d for bacon and hams respectively ; and even futurity has been drawn upon to satisfy the demand thus created, one firm having disposed of all shipments expected to be made up to the 20th March. The brand principally sold is Sinclair's, but at tho present moment brands usually looked upon as in different are as eagerly bought as those considered tho very best. Cheese is fairly supplied, fine qua lities being 13Jd to 14d ; medium, Is ; and Dutch, lOd. ? ; Quicksilver sells slowly, at Is lOJd for Cali fornia, and 2s for Spanish. Rice for the past fortnight has been extremeiy dull, and in tho absence of any reported transac tions we find it diflicult to give a quotation ; holders speak of former rates, £20 10s to £27, but it is im possible to say what would be taken were an offer made ; in the ineantimo the trade is amply stocked. A parcel of Java was offered, and a portion disposed of at £23 los, the remainder being passod in for higher rates. Spices. — Cloves wore sold for 4Jd ; cassia, Is 2d ; black pepper, 4Jd ; white do, 4§d; nutmegs, Is 4jd; and mace, Is 3d per lb. Stationery. — Yellow and green double demy paper was placed at Gd ; sup. royal, 16d ; double foolscap, lCd ; sup. fine printing double foolscap, 7.Jd; double demy, 7Jd; large folio post ruled, 16s per ream; pink demy, 7 d; King's foolscap, 12id. Salt. — Course has been remarkably dull. Our nominal quotation is £3 10s to £3 12s 6d. Holders are unwilling to sell at less, and buyers do not just now feel inclined to come forward. Fine has been dis posed of at £5 10s, SbOAR. — This market is not at all strong, though the determination of holders not to submit to any concession has as yet prevented any manifest decline. The residue ex Rialto and other shipments was offered on Tuesday, but the trade showing equal un willingness to operate at current rates, the auc tioneer only succeeded in placing a small lot of counters at £36. The cargo of the Qarl was offered on Thursday, and the greater part was sold — 3500 mats rations at £24 15s to £25 10s, the balance being placed privately at an advance. Mauritius sugars were also offered tho same day, white crystals being disposed of at £41 7s 6d, and counters at £34 12s Gd to £35, evidencing a slight decline. Tea. — A large and extensive business continues to be done in this staple, and almost all tho congous offering under 2s have been cleared off the market. The sales made have been at Is lOd to Is 10} d and Is lid, while latterly a disposition has been evinced to buy tho higher and better qualities, as purchases have been at 2s to 2s 3d. Hysonskin has been placed at lid to Is. ? Timber.— The Guldfax cargo of deals was offorod this week, and being of a very superior quality, realised o^d for 9x3. Oregon timber, ex Pallas, was also also sold. Square timber at £12 2s Gd to £10 2s 6d ; the deals at about £8 per 1000 feet. Scotch flooring realising an advance. Tobacco. — Sales have been confined to supplying trade wants of a very moderate natnro, prices, how ever, have been sustained. Our quotations being unaltered, are 2s Gd to 3s for ten's, and 2s 9d to 3s 3d for halves. Twist being worth 3s 9d to 4s 9d. Wines and Spirits. — Unless offered at a suffi cient sacrifice to draw the attention of a speculator, port and sherry are difficult to move. One largo parcel of common Port was placed at rather a low figure, of this description trade parcels are offered at £28, in bond ; good medium, £39 to £42. Sher ries are offering at £20 to £40 for low to medium. Geneva is rather firmer, but not higher. J.D.K.Z, for duties ranging from 25s to 2Gs, is offered at lls to lls 3d. V.H. and Co. is worth 10s to lls. Other brands are unsaleable. Brandy : Dark Martell's is scarce, and 12s 6d is generally asked for the small quantity held; for pale, no quotation can be given, inasmuch as there is none to be had ; 13s, however, would bo got for mode rate parcels. Hennessy's brand, in bulk, has almost disappeared from the market. A parcel of pale, held for some lima, was sold at 12s net cash. U.V.P. is worth 10s Gd to 10s 9d ; Renault's, 10s 6d to 11k ; Otard's, 10s Gd and 10s 9d ; C.V.P., 10s to 10s 6d for dark and pale respectively. Clozeau, an old favorite brand, is again offering, and realised 10s 9d for pale. The market, we aro informed, is to be kept supplied in future by regular shipment. Mediumsare firmer, and better for pule. Dnpont's dark brought 5s lOd ; and Rizat's pale, 7s to 7s 8d, an advance of Is on the latter ; low descriptions are quite neglected. In case, Henuessy's 'ommands 34s in small lots; Martell's has been scarce, and wanted for New Zealand. A shipment just in is held for over 30s ; parcels afloat are offered at considerably loss money. Reinault's brings 28s ; Otard's, 28s to 29s : U.V.P., none in the market at the moment ; C.V.P. is worth 26s, at which it is saleable; mediums bring 17s to 21s, and common, 12s 6d. A parcel of rum, 10 o.p. ; was placed at 2s Gd ; trade lots are disposed of at 2s lOd to 3s ; 30 per cent. o.p. is wanted, and valued at 3s 4d to 3s 6d. Whiskey is easier ; Campbelton, in bulk, has beon sold at 3s 9d ; for Saucel, Dundas Hill, &c;, 3s 9d is also asked ; in case, there are buyers at 10s to 10s 3d, and sellers at 10s Cd to 10s 9d. ? Colonial Produce. — The week's transactions in wool have been of a very limited nature, few lots having come forward, and us owners refuse to take the prices offering for what is now in store the probability is tho greater part will bo shipped home on grower's account. Sheepskins havo been sold at 5d to 7jd per lb. Tho market has beon well cleared of hides by shipments to England. Heavy wet, salted, are quoted 9s to 10s 9d, and dry, 4s 6d to 5s each. There is a good inquiry for tallow, and any lots offering are placed at fair rates.

California. — We take the following from the Daily Alia California (San Francisco), of 21st February : — Mercantile business has been exceedingly quiet. Plenty of notes are offering, but the dealers, in the ubsonce of any considerable demand, have been loth to purchase largely. The buying rate was nomi nally GO c, and the selling rate 64 c. Early in the day there was some demand for gold bars, but to wards noon this fell off, and there was scarcely any thing doing. The supply would scarcely havo been up to the wants of ordinary steamer day, but tho result of business showed a surplus. Tho rate was 900 finepar. The limitedbusinoss iu silver bars showed no change in rates. Sterling exchange was easier under the small requirement, bankers' 60 days bills ruling at 47 d. Sight on New York, cash payment, ruled at 5 to 6 pur cent, premium. Currency sight drafts on New York were drawn at 45 to 50 per cent. |)re rmnin on gold — equal to 31 to 83J per cent, discount on face of bill. The New York nuotation of yester day; Civ} per cent, premium for gold, made the Le gal Tender dollar in New York worth a fraction less than 62c, while in this market these notes were hard to work off at 60c.

Very little demand exists for oats, which are quotedjat from 5s to 5s 3d. Cupe barley, 4s 3d ; English, Gs to 6s 3d ; peas and beans at former quotations. Potatoes are very plen tiful, and cannot bo quoted higher than £5 10s per ton. Onions, from £13 to £14. Loose hay, £5 10s to £6.' Butter, Is 4Jd. The Launcenton Examiner of 30th April says :— Flour and wheat continue firm, the former at from £12 to £13, und the latter at us, but transactions are limited in extent. As wo have before said, wheat comes in very slowly, and stocks are not large eithor of it or flour. Oats are in some in quiry for shipment to Now Zealand, and 5s are of fered for clean samples. Trussed hay is in de mand at former quotations, namely, £5 10s to £0 ; hydraulic pressed is worth £8. Wo observe that at Duuedin pressed hay is quoted at £10 10s, and at Invercargill at £16 per ton. Potatoes are easy, and have been sold at £4 10s to £5. Tasmaniun oatmeal, £34. Bran, Is 3d. The Mills.— Union : Fine flour, £13 ; seconds, £11. Wheat, 5s for very fine samples. Bran, Is 3d.

There is not any change in quotations, which aro — Flour, £11 10s to £12 5s per ton ; and wheat, 4s 9d per bushel at ths Port, and 4s (id in town. New South Wales.— We take the following from tho Sydney Empire of 29th April :— Much dissatisfaction has been expressed by holders of rice, in consequence of alleged published misquotations of tho present value of the articlo in this market. With this we have nothing to do. Our last quotation of the market value of l'atna rice oc curred in our monthly summary on the 21st instant in which £24 per ton was given as tho price at which sales had been recently made, and that holders generally then asked £26 per ton. Since that time sales have been made freely at £24 10s per ton ; and holders now are firm at £25 per ton. We have not heard of any transactions under £24* during the past week or ten days, and we do not believe that any such sales have taken place. Stock and Share Market.— The transactions of the week have been confined to a limited range of stocks. Buyers havo shown a marked preference for those whisk may be most surely relied on for steady — if not extreme — return for investment. The high price to which such shares as Bank of New South Wales and Bank of Victoria havo reached affords no encouragement to buyers, whilst at the same time holders are firm and generally easy in circumstances, and their limits when changed are advonccd. Hobson's Bay Railway havo hardened, and are now wanted at last week's selling prices. The now issue of Government Railway Debentures to tho extent of a quarter million ?checked transactions in the lattor ]-art of the week Earlier sales wore at the full price of 109J. Tho high rates lately current being due to the compara tively small quantity of debentures in the open market, it can scarcely be hoped that any thing so good will be obtained for the new issue. There is the further prospect of a £200,000 loan in six per cent, bonds, retnittable to London. The latter will probably find more ready buyers than tho railway bonds, as they will bo available as a medium of re mittance. The object of the loan is the building of Lunatic Asylums. Tho Provincial Government of Canterbury is in the market with a six per ' cent, loan of £100,000, part of £500,000 authorised. The debentures are repayable in fifty years— rather a long date. The interest will be paid in London, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, or Cliristchurch. a' sinking fund of one per cent, per annum will ba set apart for the redemption of the principal. We do not imagine this will be an attractive loan in Mel bourne. The sales reported this weelc by the broken of the Stock Exchange have been, on Monday:— Colo- nial Bank of Australasia, ex. div., at £fl los. Na tional Bank of Australasia, at £4 14s Gd. Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway, at £50. Victoria (in. vernment 6 per cent. Debentures, at 109.}. Ajax Mining Association at £5, do shares 10s, paid at £2 10s.

Sandy Creek Poverty Reef shares at 12s Gd. Colonial Bunk have decidedly improved since the meeting, although not to any great extent. The disposition of holders is not to accept less than par ex divi dend ; buyers will not as yet concede this. The sales have been at from 4s Gd to 5s Gd, discount, at which there is a good demand. National Bank are to day quoted with Is margin between buyers and sel lers. The balance-sheet is regarded with great satisfaction by the shareholders. The dividend, at rate of 8 per cent, per annum, will doubtless be confirmed at Tuesday's meeting. Thfe are no pressing sellers. The Bank of NowSe^^., Wales maintains its splendid dividend of twenty per cent, per annum. Bank of Victoria have this week advanced. Sales at £37 15s aro tho highest effected for years. To-day £38 5s asked, and £37 5s offered. Ballaarat Gas wanted at £6 13s Gd. For Bondigo Gas there is a fair demand, although not at any ad vance. Collingwood are supported at £1 premium. The consumption of this and tho Melbonrno Gas Company aro both increasing ma terially. For the latter an advance to ten per cent, discount was to-day established. Australasian Insurance are dull of sale, except at a de cline. To-day 47s was best offer. Allianco and Colonial Insurance Companys' shares are both dnll. For the first, 10s, and for the latter 10s Gd, offered. Colonial are held for 12s Gd. It is said their losses for the last two months have been very light. Victo ria Life Insurance not much offered. Victoria Firo and Marine are marked £22 — £26. Melbourne Ex change shares are very steady at quotations. Minini Colliery are obtainable at some slight con cession. Since Hobson's Buy Railway have chunged hands at par, holders have withdrawn their shares, and £50 is continuously offered without inducing business. The tendency of this stock is towards the English register, and ere many yeurs aro past, local proprietors will be rare. The buying orders for Victoria Government Debentures havo been withdrawn, and the market is likely to be un supported until the now loon is tendered for. Tho Savings Bank, it is confidently stated, is in a position to take the whole quarter million. Melbourne Railway Debentures are at last week's prices. In Mine shares transactions have been confined to Ajax and Sandy Crock. Tho Achilles has had a brief chock from an accident to the machinery. Beehive are wanted at 22s. Enterprise, Maldon, are again in the market, with £160 asked. For Clunes, £575, or even more, would bo given. Hust ler's Reef marked 3s— 4s; and Johnson's Reef, os 6d— 6s Gd. Eaglehawk Union hold for 10s. The mine promises well. Maryborough are saleable nt a low. figure. For M'lvor, 7s Gd, and for Now Chum, 8s offered. Sandy Creek aro said to have really struck the reef, after repeated prematuro announce ments to the same offect. Sales at 12s Gd evidence faith in the news from the mine.
