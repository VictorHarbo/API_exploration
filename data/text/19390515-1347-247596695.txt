Danes In Jail Want Hard Work "My/friends and me, we want hard work here. It is very good here, but it is jail." One of three Danish youths in the remand section at Long Bay Jail said this in an interview. He is Knud Jensen, 20, steward, of Copenhagen. With him in jail are Laurets Svensen, 21, and Ellarid Larsen, 18, of Sladen. Last week they deserted from the motor vessel Asia, now on its way to China. "We Want To Stay" Jensen, who can speak a little Eng lish, was spokesman for his two friends. "We know Australia is where there are plenty of kangaroos and plenty of work," he said. "We don't want to go back to Den mark. We didn't want to go to China. We want to stay in Australia. "Me, I very good carpenter; my two friends very good sailors and can work on farm. "In my country they do not punish you for getting on train with no money. You just give them your name and where you live." "Jumped The Rattler" The three youths tried to go to Mel bourne by train. They had no money and "jumped the rattler." They were arrested at The Rock and charged with having trespassed on rail way property, and with being prohibited immigrants. On the trespassing charge they were sentenced to four days' imprisonment with light labor. On the other charge they were remanded until Thursday. The three youths are popular at the jail and warders are convinced that they are good types. They are not discontented, and have comparatively few restrictions placed on them. To Marry Danish Girl They spoke of sport to Denmark. They play football and enjoy skating, swim ming, and tennis. Jensen is engaged to marry a Danish girl. He displayed a ring on his finger. It was customary in Denmark, he said, for the man to wear a ring too. They are anxious to see the Consul for Denmark (Dr. Hoest). Arrangements have been made at the penitentiary for the Consul to visit them. itiiiiitiiiititiiiimiiimiiiiiiimiimiiiiiiimiitiimiiiiiiHifiiiiiiiit'.
