THE FAK EAST. O RUSSIAN DESERTERS. STRANDED AT COPENHAGEN. DISHONEST SHIPPING COMPANIES. Rkuter's Telegrams. London, Tuesday. thousands of Russian army reservists, who have deserted to avoid service in the Far East, are stranded at Copenhagen. _ Many of them have been victimised by Rus sian shipping agents, who, while purporting to give them oversea passages, supplied them with tickets which were goocl only as far as Copen hagen. The Danish shipping agents, with a view of relieving distress, are giving the poorest of them free passages to America. Owiug, however, to the prevalence of tra- cohma among the deserters, it is recognised that numbers of them would not be admitted uuder the immigration restriction laws of the United States. Those suffering from the complaint ; referred to are, therefore, proceeding to Lon- : don. (Tracohma is a disease of the eye, characterised , by hard pustules or granular excrescences on the inner surface of the eyelids, with inflammation of the membrane.)
