We subjoin the 1 latest market reports : HOBART Town, Sept. 10, In the absence of he July mail due here to day, there was nothing doing in imported goods, and a g: liberal complaint of dulness prevailed in coa 1 (sequence amongst the mercantile public. In i Colonial produce, with the exception of age w t sales of wheat at from 83. to' 83. 3d., and of potatoes at from £7 to £7 10s., there were no transactions of any moment. For oats there was a little inquiry, but at prices too low to be submitted to by holders. in the timber trade, there was considerable slackness, and upon reference it will be seen that a decline has taken place upon our last week's quota- t ions.

Tar reasoner Times. BALLARAT, September 11 The rumors of the difficulties experienced in settling transactions by several houses, and the stoppage of some have had a some- t hat depressing effect upon business generally. As usual under such circumstances, prejudicial statements, affecting the credit of firms in no way compromised, have been current, adding considerably to the ' feeling of gloom and distrust experienced. The forced sales in one or two of the estates-for as you assign merit and composition have been accepted in preference to the loss and delay of the Insolvent Court time partially checked operations in the class of goods dealt with by the firms in question. The origin of the present state of affairs is not difficult to account for. Went of adequate capital, in the first instance (he absence of due caution in the extension of credits ; living " up " to the means, and a ' general falling off in the productive Interest! if the district : these combined, have had the effect of summarily exposing weakness, and may prove eventually the incentives to a sounder system of trading. The flour market is firm, and shows signs of advancement One of our local mill i is on the eve of' ceasing work, and the other is not likely to have very large stocks on hand, as a steady trade has been done by its proprietors during the liston. Fine flour is selling at 252 10s. to 262. 10s., according to quality. Wheat is nominal, at 95. per bushel. Bran is in demand, and the price has as yet led to 2s. 6d. to St. per bushel. Colonial oats are steady, at 7s, 6d. to 8s. Cracked maize, 10s. Potatoes, 92 to 90'. per ton. Good seed potatoes are inquired for. To command a sale, however, they must be of the best quality, and each sample of one distinct variety. In sugars there is a general declension in value the tone of the market is feverish and unhealthy, on the one hand we learn that the number of Australian demands keeps up the price of an over- stocked market, and on the other, that cargoes are selling at a loss, and that prices at the port of shipment must eventually full considerably. There is no doubt that sugar has been sold here stan exorbitant profit to the importers, and the consequent temptation to embark in speculations very great. The utmost i sullen the part of purchasers is requisite, as prices for some time to come must have a downward tendency. Butter continues scarce. Imported first quality commands 2s. 8d per lb. Wholesale, and yet fresh butter is readily obtainable by retail at 8s. 6d. per lb. Salted provisions are easier. Bacon and firms are full 1d. per lb. lower than last week ; as also cheese Rice is quoted at from 282. to 312. per ton. In wines, spirits, and English beer the transactions of the week have been very light; the trade having been in fluenced considerably by the sales at suction, Quotations do not show the real state of the markets. Cash is reported on all sides as very difficult of collection, and generally our population is not at the present moment remunerate ely employed Star. THE OVEKH, September 31. It is gratifying to be as c to report a decided improvement in the tone of business during the past week ; sales have been more freely made, and cash has been rather less scarce than usual. The flour trade has been in an excited state. She stocks have been reduced so low that as much as the per ton has been paid for a small quantity. 462\. was paid on Thursday for a few tons, and there was every prospect of a positive dearth of the commodity, until the news was received yesterday morning of the arrival of the Gundagai at Wahgunyah, with about 150 tons on board. This will supply the market for the pre- sent; the price may now be quoted at 492. Gold has been also ruling high, as much as 42. Is, having been paid. Competition by the banks is the probable cause of the high price. There is no material change to note In other articles in the prices current. Price of gold Alluvial, SI. 16s. to 82. 18s. 9d.
