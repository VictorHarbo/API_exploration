The Wild Wave was reported by the mail steamer to be inside Cane Borda, but on account of the northerly wiud she was not Imarded until midnight on Friday, when Captain Fisher kindly supplied to the Press Port Louis papers to April 31, and reported having experienced very boisterous weather during the voyage. She was towed to the Port on Saturday afternoon, and moored at the Queen's Wharf. The Fanny Nicholson was ready for sea on Saturday at midday, when a fair wind down the river was blowing; but as the barque did not float till late in the evening, the steam-tug Young Australian was engaged to tow her out. Fletcher's Ship- Yard.— The erection of the new Patent Slip is in progress, and when com pleted in all its details it will prove of infinite ser vice to the shipping interest, and place Port Ade laide in favourable comparison with other colonial ports with regard to appliances for effecting repairs to vessels. SniP-BuiLDDfo.— The Gem schooner has brought from King George's Sound the greater portiouof a carjio of Jarrah timber, which is being landed opposite the Port, at the new shipwrights yard recently taken by Mr. John McDonald, who pur poses immediately laying down the keel of a schooner, for the construction of which the Swan River mahogany has been specially ordered. The vessel is intended for the coasting trade, and the following will lie her dimensions:— Overall 84 feet; twain, 20 feet; depth 9 feet; of about 80 tons burden: and if present intentions are matured, she will be launched in six months. New Steamer.— At Fletcher's Yard a gang of artificers arc constructing a steamer for the Murray, and already the work is in such forward state «3 to give a fair idea of her ultimate form. The Lady Daly being already tested, the stern-wheel plan is introduced into the new boat, which is, however, somewhat smaller than Murray and Jackson's former essay, being 95 feet overall, with carrying capacity for 50 tuns, and 21 feet draught o! water. The engines are being manu factured at the works of Messrs. Fulton and Co., whose former performances in the same line are highly spoken of.
