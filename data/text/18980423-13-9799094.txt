The proposed railway from the Gowrie Coal Mine to Goombungee passes through the estate for nine miles, bringing all. parts within easy access of railway communication, thus rendering the whole area admirably adapted for cutting into farms, and would, no doubt, leave a large margin of profit for a syndicate or company as an investment. ? ? . .
