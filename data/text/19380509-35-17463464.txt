DANISH NAZI. COPENHAGEN, May 8. Erik Westergaard Jensen, who last month fired two shots in the Parliament building while the Legislature was debating the new Immigration law to which Danish Nazis arc opposed, has been sentenced to 40 days' im- prisonment, less the 16 days that he has already been in custody. His four accomplices who threw down pamphlets have been sentenced to 20 days' im- prisonment, but three of them have been liberated, having already served the period in custody. _
