Hundreds of people may ask tho above to-day. Thousands will find out In one of the carly to-morroivB. Why! Becauso Lake George ls tho largest and grandest lake in New South Wale«, and thc Royal the largest and finest hotel on the Great Lake George watorthed. WHAT IS LA ICE GEORGE t A grand fresh water lake, 2500 feet above the sea, 23 miles long, 12 miles binad, 174 milos from Sydney, surrounded by noblo mountains and bush-clad hills. In- dented by promontories, and grassy canes and bold headland«, broken bv innumerable tmyn, made glorious by shado and gleam- ing sunlight and mystic mirage-now oabn as a mirror, now lashed into a mimic sea. WHAT IS THE ROYAL t An hotel replete with modern com- fort, near Lako George, In the township of Bungendore, the present tonninus of the Great Southern Railway. From its front projects a splendid balcony 60ft x 14ft, standing upon six massive stone pillars, flower»anil plants decorate the balcony. Through a wide gateway at tho side you cntor a spacious gravel courtyard, surrounded by white palisading, evergreen trees and fruit tree« nf luauy kind», reminding the travoller of tho courtyards of the hotels of sunnv Franco. To tho right, beneath a verandah, ls a long rango of kitchen offices, also tho largo billiard room, and the gentlemen's bath loom and stockroom. At the upper end I» another neatly gravelled yard, where ls tho extensive stabling and forage stores and other offices, while separated by thowhtto palisadlnz only, ls a largo orchard and kitchen gardon In admir- able ordor. Turning back to tho hotel again, we find a maaitvely-bullt house, with walls two feet thick ; parlours and dlnlng-roonu seon oveiywhoro, und bedrooms still more numerous ; while tho lavish table appointments and modern furnishing, the unlimited fabio and admirable attendance, thc ladies' bath- room, and tho butler's pantry-even the lounge chairs on tho front and back balconies, indicate tho completeness of provision made for tho comfort of visitors. A lorpe Btoro belonging to thc hotel ls alto on thc property, and a bank is planned as a further convenienco. From the b'ack balcony you seo Lako George and its noblo mountain ocenory. whilo froiii tho front you look out upon a fertile plain six miles long, bordoied by mountains right and left, while at thc end is an endless vlstu of Villis and moun- tains until tho eye catches sight of tho highett peak of a rango 30 milcB distant. Cod of all flees up to 051b. are constantly caught in the Luke, while wallaby, black swans, and wild fowl abound. Leaving Sydney by the 0 o'olock evening train, the visitor whether for sport" among tho mountains or on the luko, or for health In the briiuing mountain air, eau be floating upon 'Lake George by 6.30 tho next morning, and bo suro of a hearty welcome and comfort under tho roof of that most genial of hosts 3.
