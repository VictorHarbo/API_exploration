The Sydney Morning Herald. THE report of the Tasmanian Government Geologist upon the Mount Huxley Mine was tabled in the Tasmanian Legislative Assembly yesterday. It states that there has been foul play, as the samples were "salted" in order to assist crushing. FURTHER, the report states that foul play had vitiated all the tests, and the Government Geologist cannot tell the value of the deposit, if any. He believes that a little gold exists, but not enough to make the working payable. IN referring to the report, the Premier of Tas- mania stated in the Tasmanian Assembly last night that at the proper time steps would be taken with the view of punishing the guilty party.

It ia also difficult to see why, in such con ditious, time should be wasted ovor such a question as the method to be followed m endeavouring to mitigate the evils of dis union and opposition at the polls In connection with this last matter it is to bo lerueraberod that political action heie is not and cannot be conducted on the same lines as in the United States We havo not the same " machine "

of concerted action as may conduce to the settlement of disputes by fuondly appeals, by keeping common amis and interests clearly in view, and by suggesting before it is too late means of escape fiom embarrassing situations which would otherwise ínjuio the common cause The Legislative Assembly spont all of last evening in discussing whethei it should accept, as it ultimately did, the amend ments made by the Council in the Mining on Pnvate Lands Bills, and so save the bill, or by rejecting the amendments cause the loss of a moasuio which had occupied both Houses toi some weeks Tho question at issue was one oí considerable practical impoitanco, but the consideiations on which it depended were few and simple, and the whole matter might have boon despatched m a fraction of the time taken In the opinion of tho lesponsible Miuistei the bill as amendod, though not all that ho desiied, would bo ícceived by the mining community as satisfying a large measure of tho demands made The chief objection taken was to the clause re- moving land under cultivation outsido the apphcation of the measure But, as Mr COPELAND pointed out, this merolj ox empted about 1£ millions of awes, and loft 58J-millions of áoies of 6old land subject to the provisions of the bill The specula tions about the constiuction to be put on the words "under cultivation" seemed much liko elaborate trifling m view of the smallnoss of the consequences either way in comparison with the lorge area affected bythe bill The whole matter in disputo was one of degree, and it seemed a very unbusinesslike way of rogaiding the matter to risk the saonfice of the woik done and the attainment of legislation I affecting this vast aroa, all because a 1 relatively small aioa had boon taken out of the bill Those m favour of this couise were in danger of appealing to care much more for the bill as a subject ot dispute between the two Houses, or an item of electioneering, than for the jiractioal mining mteiests which it has tniough out boon maintamod attached to tho gassing oí tija measwa utf*. law. Mr. CMOIC cited the acceptance of the amendments of the Oounoil in Mr. BnuNKEn's Land Bill in 1889 as, a good precedent for the guidance of the House in dealing with a measure of a similarly practical nature ; and there can be no question, looking back upon the results of that compromise, that it was infinitely prefer- able to the sacrifice of the bill. Mr. COPELAND, in urging the House to accept the bill as it stood, used the argument that tho necessity that would arise of correcting a point or two in the bill by nn amending measure nest session would serve as a "nest egg " to keep the subject alivo and supply an opportunity to carry the provisions further if that wore desired. Spoakiug generally, it is ahnost invari- ably a mistake in policy to prefer, at the end of a session, when further nego- tiation or compromise is impos- sible, to sacrifice a useful measure because it has boen cut down from the proportions in which it first appeared. It is much to bo questioned whcthor tho English Liberal party does not now con- sider that it was led by party considera- tions into a blunder when it de- cided at the ond of latt session to lose the Employers' Liability Bill rathor than submit to take it with some unwelcome amendments mado by tho Lords. It, would havo been a similar mistake had Mr. BKUXKER'S Land Bill and Mr. COPLAND'S present measure been thrown aside in like manner because they did not contain all that their authors desired. In all such coses it is to be remembered that we livo under a Constitution in which both Houses have equal powers in matters of general legislation. It is certain when such is the case that differences of view, some- times serious ones, will arise between the two Houses. The form they usually take is a restriction by tho Upper Houso of the provisions which the Lower House desires to onnct. If that disposition on the part of tho Upper Chamber is some- times unwelcome it has to be remembered that it is largely for this purpose that Upper Houses are established. Aflor all, what is dono only amounts to putting tho brake on the wheel and making progress somewhas slower. And when wo remember the experimental character of much of our legislation, its occasional crudity, its doubtful wisdom, and its frequently unsatisfactory re- sults, tho fact that progress in cairying it is made a little more difficult and more deliberate is hardly ono likely to occasion serious troublo to the patriotic observer of the working of our political system. Increasing intercourse with Oriental countries threatens to make us acquainted with diseases that seemed to have become only historical. Wo have to remember that >, o aro coming closer to the sources from which emanated those plagues whose memory was a terror to eui- fore- fathers, and that, if in the altered condi- tions of life those scourges cannot find so readily the support necessary for their making distant j'ourneys, they may be lurking in their old haunts as virulent in their nature as ever they were. This " Plague of Boils," or "Black Death," or whatever name it may be called, which is raging at Hongkong, has, it appears, been long known in Canton and other pontres of population in China, and is described as being similar in its symptoms and action to the Great Plague of Loudon. Being tv filth disease, it has in the unchanging lives and habits of Oriental populations the conditions neces- sary for its existence. Instead of our being surprised to find it there, the wonder rather seoms tobo that this and other pesti- lences have not broken bounds-as they did periodically long ago-and at least threatened AVestern civilisation with tho terrors of the old plagues. Cholera appears to bo the only one of thom that has retained the migratory power or tendency ; and even it in its later visitations ta Europe has shown that it can bo beaten back by sanitary weapons. There is little doubt, therefore, that, if this plague which has shown itself at Hongkong has a tondenoy to emigrate, it will find itself bailled with tho gonernl sanitary arrangements which wore not in action when the Great Plague dovastated Europe All the same, this movemont of an old disoase from its ancioufc lurk ing-placo is not to be lightly thought of, for in tho mysterious goings forth of theso pestilences it seems to bo " the first stop that costs." Though known inland well enough in China, this appears to bo its first visit to Hongkong, and from such an entrepôt of commerce the reads are open enough for it to pursue its course if tho conditions only are suppliod. Happily, those conditions seem to be a con- tinuance of tilth. It is neither infectious nor contagious apart from unwholesome emanations, and it seoms to be tho sort of malady for which science has found the romedy for shortening ita career. But its oxceeding fatalit}--roaching as much as 80 per cent, of the soizuros-is enough to claim for this plugno exceptional precau I tions of quarantine, and it is to be hoped that we shall see no more of that un federal feeling and action in rolntion to quarantining which were so unploasantly conspicuous in some recent casos. The medical authority who reported on tho soats of the disease in Canton said that " tho poison was deve- loped from atmospheric conditions beneath the houses." And when wo think of the areas in Sydney, nnd in all the largo centres of population in Australia, on which rows of residences have been reared on sites filled up to lovel by the foul rubbish tip tilted there, wo may havo special reason to not bo indiííeront to tho character of this plague at Hongkong._ It is pitiable that children should need protection ; thnt they do is shown by our experience as a community as by that of otfier peoples, and this need is the reason for the existenco of the society which held its annual meot iug the day before yostorday. The public will recognise with satisfaction that tho society has a due sense of the delicacy of its work, and strives to prevent the ill usage of the young without weaken- ing family life and its ties. Though it may soeni over- particular to rospect tho parontal relation where it does not spare the children from abuse and cruelty, still that authority is not lightly to be swept away, if for no other reason than that it is so difficult to find any substitute. The sooiety also d»es well to refrain as much as possible from prosecution, eveu though there may not be much risk of the parents retaliating upon tho inno- cent causes of their exposure. It sheds a curious and agroeablo light upon human nature to find it stated, as has been done in connection with this very work in England, that parents who have been dealt with in the police courts under the Act for the prevention of cruelty to children do not appear to boar malico. It may be tear of the law that brings forth this lenity, but ono would rather think that natural feeling reasserted itself, 83», proposals for new legislation ara un- questionably well-meant, but wo have to do with a subject that is not adapted foi summary measures Why should no person under 21 be suffered to go to the theatre unless under parental guardianship? Another debatable ques- tion is íaised by tho demand that certain objectionable hteiature be not sold to children Who shall be mado censor ? Under existing laws the worst of such publications cannot be sold safely to old or young Then as to employments of ohildien The society holds that the law should prevent paients from sending their childi on to gaiu a living in the streets without a license The community does not desne that the area of juvenile labour should be increased, and something might be said for licensing Girls should be kept to other employments. As to boys, it ia all but impossible to fix a common ago bolow which they cannot be ti usted to work about the streets Beyond this difficulty is that of aibitianlv inteifeiing with thou means of livelihood The society desnes the tiue welfare of the young, and few will deny it acknowledg- ment But the questions involved in new legislation on this subject aie complex and difficult VIOE-REUAL NEWS -Tho Governor and Mr Robert Duff loft Sydnoy yesterday by tram for Coolangatta, whoro thoy will bo the guests of Mr Hay Tlioy expect to return to Sydney on S itur day LxTnA'SlTTINO 01?
