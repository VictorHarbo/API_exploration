MAEcn 20.— The vessels bring windbouad here so long bos qulto stagnated trade andput a stop to any circulation of monoy for the , time ; It is more difficult to get Bupplics of rations here than ever it was at Kiandra. This river, that so little notioc la taken of, has now sixteen vessels lying ready for sea: butowingto the want of a small tug boat that could bo worked by the assistance of an engineer ana the pilot and crew the vessels lay here week after week and month after month, and, strange to say, these vessels, all hut the Jrtflcnhino and Kancho Pane*, am owned hv fivdnov mnn : not one of them raise their voioc to assist in obtaining tlint which would cause their vessels to make a trip in a fortnight Instead of four months. Captain Bommervillc of the Jane Som* tnervtile, took to 8ydney n sample of wheat, grown on the bank of the North Arm (ninety miles from the Heads), pronounced by the oomdcalcrs to be tho best sample in Sydney. Vessels drawing nine feet when loaded can navigate up and down without difficulty ; but we have no steam to carry our grain to market. Ere long we hoi-c to sec on agricultural population settling horC| then some steamship company will seo the propriety of sending a steamer to the Richmond River ; we do not profess to be able to employ a steamer to carry our goods and passengers. The river bchig known so little of, yet within forty-eight hours soil of Sjdncy, and navigable ninety miles for vessels or nine feet of water. There is a petition on its way to our member, Mr. Clark Irving, praying that he will bring our necessary wants before the House, and let the Government know the)- have a river within forty-eight hours' sail, and an average of eLxiosttc&scLb; trading thereto with ' out ftehm communication.

Tiie Steamer Premier.— This vessel* under the command of Captain Cooncy, cleared from Moreton Boy for Sydney, on the 20th ultimo. She bad, however, to return, as appears from the following paragraph, taken from the North Australian of the 20th : — ' Tho steamer Premier returned to Boylond's Wharf yes terday (Sunday) morning. Wo are informed that she sprung a leak off Cape Moreton on her way to Sydney, and that Captain Sholl wait off from the pilot station, seeing the Union Jock hoisted downwards as a signal of distress ; the pilot, therefore, will claim aalvagc for saving her.' Termble 8ronv op a SmrwcEcx.— The following narrative ofthe loss of the steamer Jersey City, on Long Point-beach* 2tth November, while on her way from Toledo to Buffalo, appears in the American papers ' Captain Monroe immediately ordered every one to the hurricane deck us the only chance of safety. A number, heedless of his warnings, lumped into the lifeboat and mode for the shore. They were all lost among the breakers. Soon after grounding ithc propeller heeled over, broadside to the. seas, end with tar dock exposed to the action of the waves. Her deck load was at once Washed off, and the repeated blows of the huge waves stove in her decks, and dashed nor aides into pieces. The hurricane deck, with its load of half-frozen sufferers, floated towards the shore. About thseo o'clock in the afternoon the hur ricane deck grounded within a short distanoc from the shore in shallow water. At this moment a boy was washed off, but was rescued by Captain Monroe. After this the boy became frightened, and clung eagerly to his*' preserver. Captain Monroe fastened a plank life-preserver to his body, and taking the boy in his arms leaped the water and waded ashore. As the boy was landed* his suspenders broke* and his pantaloons fell about his ancles, where they froze in a solid mass, chaining him to the snot where he stood. In a few momenta the half-naxed boy was dead. Captain Monroe walked back to the piece of wreck and directed uis comrades where to leap so as to strike in the shallowest water. One by one the leap was made in safety, until but one was left on board— Mr. Derby, the clerk of the propeller. He was seen sitting on the wreck with his head bent down, as if in despair. Captain Monroe called Him by name, but he did not answer, although his mouth opened. To a second hail, he again opened his mouth, without giving on articulate sound. Captain Monroe and engineers Manchester and Cummings went to the wreck, and, taller considerable difficulty, got off the helpless man. Captain Monroe took Derby- on his back, whilst the two engineers steadied his legs so as to prevent the waves washing htm off. In this way, the party waded through the water, ice making on them at every stop, and surf dashing around them, the bitter wind freezing their hands and faces, and the blinding 6now obscuring their view. On reaching tbc snore, Cap tain Monroe attempted to lower Derby to his feet, but found it impossible to let him go. The living bearer had frozen fast to bis dead burden. The captain's anus were frozen stiff nnd olaepod around the arms of the dead man. The two engineers were also so frozen about the hands that they could render no assistance. Finding it impossible to rid himself of his terrible burden in any otber way, Captain Munroc flung himself on the ground, head foremost, and thus 44 spilled ' the dead man from his shoulders. But he had escaped from one horrible dilemma only to And himself in another. His trousers were frozen so stiff up to his hips that he was as much unable to rise as if his legs had been encased in a length of stove pipe, and his companions could render him no assistance. At a short distance was the body of a man, frozen in a sitting position. Captain Monroe managed to roll himself to the body, and by it climbed to his feet. The little party of survivors now set out on their painful march towards the lighthouse* which was &t; no great distance. They had got safely along until within about 300 yards of the house, when a small crock impeded their progress. Engi neer Manchester attempted to cross the creek, but abandoned it, and returned to the Bhore, where he sat down* exhausted and de spairing. Engineer Cummin gs endeavoured to encourage him to further efforts, but in vain. Captain Monroe begged Manchester to rise to make an attempt to get around the creek* telling him the lighthouse was close by, 44 It's of no use, captain*' said the unfortunate man* 44 1 can't go any farther.' Cammings placed his arm around the body of his comrade in order to lift mm to his feet, but at that moment the icy hand of death was laid on both* and clasped in each other's arms* face almost touching faec, with, words of friendly cheer frozmi in the utterance, these two men* Manchester and Cummings* perished within a few minutes' walk of safety. Captain Monroe succeccdcd in reaching tbc lighthouse, although badly frozen. Out of the twenty-two who had formed , the crew and passengers of tbc ill-fated Jeroey* but five survived* The others either, perished in the waves, or were frozen to death in that awfnl death march.
