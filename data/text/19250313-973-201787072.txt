Foreign Migration, SOME -FACTS AND FIGURES. (Ipsund hy Publicity Branch, Prime MiuiWterVDepartment) The'irnpreSston is widespread thai persons of foreign birth are entering Australia to numbers so large a8 to menace the preservation of the preponderant British element of our population. The present position. ..For the thrpe years and sis month9 »nJeid September 1924, the average annua) excess of arrivals in, overd^partures from Australia, of British peoples, was 29,1'20. During the same period, the aver age annual ezcese of arrivals over departures of persons of foreign birth was 4,610. The average an nual increase in the population hy excuse of birthiinverdpaths during the same period was 82,000. Assuming that only 20,000 Britishers (a decrease of 9,120 nn the above figure) c«ine here each year during tlie next dncade—and tliel 20,000 aliens (an incre^s* of 15,390 on-the .figure above Riveu) weTe admitted annuaII)' duiii)g the same period—also assuming thHt the natural increase in the population rt'tnainod Btationary—the British population of Au«lrulia at thu <*nd of 10 years would represent 95 par '• cent of the toral—a dilution of the preBenl British preponderance tij the extent of only 2 per cei>t. I;i all probability, however, the Dumber tjf British assisted migrants will—whin the new agreement about to ho eatpred iotu by the British and Commonwealth (JovHrnroeutb and the GoyeralU 'iits of tho Bix States is in operation—show an increase over the, ourabcr Who arrived durinSfVJhB poriod above stated. Tr.e oxiru'ber iif unHbsisted British migrants is unlikely to riecreHse. If is safe to assume that the gain by natural increase, which is generally cu mu lative, will also he greater in the future. From present indicati ins in view of the agrpomeots entered into between the Commnnwralth and certain Foreign Governments to restrict the istue of passports or the grunting of visa^, it iB likely to be noma years before the number of Foreign arrivals reach 20,000 per annum. The' Italian Government tas agreed to limit the granting of paifipor^B to persons who have been nominated hy p»rsons in A ustralia and who are in i)CBses»ion of ^.40 each. In the case ol Greeks, Juan-Slavs and AILaniann thn British authorities, at the req iest of the i!iiiiiinuuwealth Government, are limiting the granting ot visan to pt»£spor:s to 100 per ntoath in Pach case, and visas will not be granted to persons uness the." are individually in possession nf £40. The Foreign Element. The Census of April 1921 showed ttut the number of parBons in Australia not born here, or in tne Brilisli Irtles nr New Z <aland. wus 139,073, or slightly over per cent. The number owing allegiance t:> Foreign Governments whs 48,529 or .08 per cent. Duringlhe past few yeais, and pnrticiiUrl since July 1924 (»vhen the latest Immigration Restriction Ant passed hv the United States Congress came into operation), there has henn a quicker movement peoples from southern Europe to Australia.
