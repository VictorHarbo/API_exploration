Newman, addressing Captain Grainger, Bald he bad been deputed, In the absence of the re spected President of the Marine Board, Captain Ferguson, to express the deep sense of biB ability as a oommander which was entertained by the subscribers to the testimonial, and more par ticularly of the manner in which be bandied tbe steamer Bal cluthB on the occasion of her late accident. The energy, skill, and noble-mindedness which he hod exhibited on that occasion had celled foith tbe eulogy of her Majesty's representative, 'as well ae of tbe Government, the Press, and the public generally. {Hear, bear.) Governor Weld, pf Western Australia, as well as Mr*. Weld and tbeir suite, who were passengers by tbe Balclutha, had expressed themselves in the highest terms of the character or Captain Grainger as a gentleman and as a skilful seamBn, and he believed it woe his coolness in the time of danger that had been the means of saving many valuable lives. His conduct had also been recognised in a substantial manner by the owners. He felt Eure that a man wboBC conrege could carry him through such difficulties must have tbe highest veneration for and dependence upon God, and it was that which enabled him to gain the confidence of his crew in the hour of need. Mr. Newman then kutdfd a pnrse containing 80 sovereigns to Captain Graineer. requesting bis accept- noe of it aB a mark of their good wisheB towards him. He remarked that it contained a few coins, eacb of which bore the head of royalty, and if each could tpeak it would do honour to noble Captain Grainger. (Applause.) Captain Grainger said he felt scarcely able to acknowledge the kindness which bad been shown him. He was sincerely obliged to them for their good opinion, and trusted he might elwayE enjoy it. As regarded the present, he should certainly devote it to the purchase of some suitable memento of the occasion Cheers for Captain Grainger and Mr. Newman concluded ice proceedings,— South Australian ileaister.

W. Collins Rees, Secretary for Harbours and Navigation. Office, Melbourne, 22nd September, 1869, THE WRECK OF THE VICTORIA TOWER. rFrom the Argus, 18th October.) The intelligence in yesterday's publication relative to tbe wreck of the clipper ship Victoria Tower, on her passage from Liverpool, contained the main facts of the disaster, and but little more con cerning the details need be recorded until the official investigation into tbe cause of tbe loss or the ship is beld. State nents more or lets conflicting and conjectural relative to tbe occurrence are BUre to be in plentiful circulation, and can onlr be confirmed or disproved when the matter comes before tbe Steam Navigation Board. The commander of the ill-fated ehip, Captain John Kerr, arrived in town yesterday forenoon from Geelong, and the follo«irjg further particulars with regard to the vessel, the voyage out, end its trsgic te ruination, have been supplied by him. Captain Krrr reports that th- Victoria Tower ten the Mersey en July 24, and passed Tusoar on July 26. Ligbt con trary winds were experienced to the Equator, which was crossed on the 29th day cut. In the latitude of the 8 E trades the winds were well from the soutbward, and the ship was ctase to the Brazilian coast. Very tempestuous and unsettled weather pre vailed afterwards, until passing Kerguelcn, where a number of icebergs were seen. From the meridian of Cape Leeuwln light N.E, winds continued until abreast of Cape Northumberland, which was psBsed at noon on Thursday last, and the wind then freshened into a strong breeze frem the S.W. Land was msde on Friday, and the ehir- passed Cape Otway at 6 p.m. on Saturday, 'and soon afterwords soil was shortened, and tbe Ehip ran down under easy canvas until half past 9 pm. The weather was stormy and squally, and the haze increased in density as tbe night advanced. At this time blue lights were burned, and rockctB sent up every 10 minutes, but at 10 o'clock, tbe tignsls not having bees answered, Captain Ken close hauled the sbip oa the starboard tack, and stood towards CapeSchanck. At half-past 11 p.m., judging tbe vessel to be near erough to Cape Schanck, be called all bandB and wore ship on tbe port tack, and stood ont west, the weather gndtatly becoming thicker and dirtier, and the wind increasing to a gale. Fully an hour afterwards she took tbe ground, about a mile and a half 8.M'. of Breom Creek. On the sbip striking, both anchors were let go, and orders were given to let out the starboard lifeboat with tbe second mate and four hands in it, to be in readi ness to take the women sad children on shore. Almost as soon as the lifeboat was lowered the foremast went by the board, smash ing tbe pinnace and cutter as it fell, and te escape a similar fate the lifeboat that was in tbe water hod to put off from the ship. Several attempts to regain the ship were made by the lifeboat's crew, but they proved altogether ineffectual. The wind was still blowing s heavy gale, and soon afterwards the raciotopgallant mart and mlzen topmost were carried away, the ship all the while rolling and striking heavily. The women passengers were then ordered into the saloon, and tbe crew proceeded to get the star loard lifeboat oft ob to the poop, when it was placed on the sky light and tbe lee pooprail, and, with a long painter attached, it was safely launched and hauled up under the lee of the vessel The boat, with the third officer and font of the crew in it, was kept for the women and children In place of the one which had to leave the ship. Although the ship was still striking heavily, tbere was no immediate clanger to life appre hended, and the passengers, with wonderful equanimity, re mained quietly in the cabin until daylight. As soon as it woe clear enough to make out a safe landing-place the women and children got into tbe lifeboat, which was placed in charge of 3aptaln Liddbctter, one of the saloon passengers, who proved limself of great service. The bulwarks of the ship were now level with the water. After getting the women and children Bofely in the boot, a line was passed to it to be made,fast on shore, so that the boat might be hauled backwards and for wards; but on getting into the surf the boat filled, snd as it wu found impossible to drag the line along, Captain Llddbetter bad to cut it away. The women and children were, however, landed In safety. During the next six hours all attempts to launch either of the boats from off the beach were unsuccessful, although both boats' crews, and a number of by standers wbo had collected, tried their utmost. In the mean tine Captain Kerr and the crew bad constructed a raft of size sufficient to bold all wbo were left on board, and after testing it and finding it reliable they not on board ship again, keening it fast to leeward. Captain Kerr bod the raft mode with a view to the caving of life, lest tbe sbip should break up before assistance wob rendered from en shore. Tbe lifeboats, after tbe weather ind n oderated, put off to the shin, and at 3 p.m. the whole of the passengers and orew, and Captain Kerr and his officers, were safely conveyed to land. Of the behaviour of passengers and crew during the trying emergency Captain Keir speaks most feelingly. The agents of the sbip, Messrs. Lorimer, Marwood, and Rome, lave not abittd the activity and zeal manifested by them on Sunday for the welfare of tbe passengers. Acting oa their Instruc tions, Messrs. Holmes, White, and Co., of Geelong, dispatched coaches to tbe scene of the wreck yesterday, to convey the ship wrecked people to Geelong, from whenoe they would reach Mel bourne by train. About one-half the number availed thenuelves or this opportunity, and reached Melbourne at a quarter to 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. The women, some of them, were accommodated at tbe Government Immigration Depot, where lreparatloiis for tbeir reception bad been made by Mr, L. A. doorty and MrB. Connor, tbe matron. The crew wae sent to the Bailors' Home, and tbe ppBBfcngers were distributed over various hotels and boarding-houses, by direction and at the expense of the agents. The steamer Resolute, whloh left the bay on Sunday afternoon with a quantity of material from the Government dockyard, arrived at Queensolln* towards dark, ana Captain Fullorton found the lifeboat ready manned, but, as It »o happened, its services were not needed. Yesterday morning be lUpolttte arrived at tbo wicck, and was followed by tbe Titan, another of Messrs. Norton, Graham, und Co,'b uteam tugs, Tbe Titan went alongside tbe sbip, to -- Men a number of the passen gers and crew had returned. All tbe saloon passengers' luggage, together with the greater portion of the cabin fittings, barorao ters, . curblott, plate, crockery, shelves, trays, &c;, snd a piano and harmonium, were placed on board the Titan, and the remainder of tbe passengers and crew, with their effects, returned with her to Melbourne, where she arrived last nieht, The property recovered was sufficient to fill three trucks. The passengers ana crew who come np in her were accommodated similarly to those who had arrived by train earlier in the day. The ship lies in three fathoniB water, and although opinions vary as to her ultimate fate, it is generally believed that there ie very little hope of saving her. Should the wesiber keep moderate, however, there is every reason to be lieve that the hulk of ber cargo will be recovered. To tbis end Messrs. Lorimer, Marwood, and Rome have taken prompt and energetic action, and completed arrangements yesterday for the immediate ditcbargc of cargo. Tbe work has been undertaken by Mr. J. K. Collins, stevedore, and the lighter Salsette, in tow of the Titan, with a double gang of men, left the bay last night, and ere expected to be herd at work this morning, The agents have also determined to make ample and effective arrangements for tfee cemfirt and Eafcty of those working at the wreck in order that there may be no Ides of life or limb. The action taken by the sgents with regard to the wreck has been cordially approved of by tbe underwriters here. With regard to Captain Kerr, the commander of the Victoria Tower, there has been but one expression, that of profound sympathy. Ho has bees long end favourably known in this port, and duriag biB career in tbe Australian trade he bos gained the esteem and respect of all grades of passengers, from the highest to the humblest. Amongst his brother shipmasters he is also regarded with great favour. Great sympathy is also expressed for Mrs. Kerr, who nccrmpenled Captain Kerr on this voyage, but whose name did not appear in tbe list in yesterday's paper. Although but ill fitted in ber present critical condition of health to undergo Euch peril and anxiety, she endured the trial most unflinchingly, and did her utmost to Becond tbe exertions of Captain Kerr and thoBC who worked to ably and nobly with him, NEWCASTLE.

Unerwritebs' Association.— A movement 1ms been quietly preocedining Adelaide for some time salt for tbe establishment of an underwriters' «uods- lion. The- various marine Inranncs companies, feel ing that they are subject to disadvantages which by a little - care and arrangement they could protect themselves against, tave, through their representatives, held several prelimi nary meetings to disease the best means of eolf -protection. One of the chief points to which they directed attention was I the evils resulting from tbe careless or negligentetowage of I wool and other cargo. Experience has shown this to be a I fruitful source of Iobi to the underwriters, the damage re- j suiting from this negligence being charged against them, I snd not against the Bhip. It was thought highly desirable) by the original promoters of the association to provide that the various companies should employ a competent enrvayor, thoroughly independent of the shipmasters and of parti cular insuranoe offices, to carefully inspect vessels, and superintend the stowage as well as the discharge of cargo. Tbe adoption of these precautions, it wee considered, would free the underwriters from rietg to which they were not properly liable, and ensure greater care on the part of the carriers. la framing the constitution and defining the object* of this new association, the promoters have been largely guided by the roles of an organisation in Melbourne, whloh in' Augnst, 1868, started under the title of the Melbourne Underwriters' Aeeociation, but which has sinoe expanded into the Merchante Shipping and Underwriters' Asso ciation of Melbourne. Amongst the objects contemplated, by the latter are tlw obtaining by all lawful means of in formation with respeit to the state of vessels owned in, trading to, or otherwise connected with, the Australian colonies, tbeir condition when loading, the quantity and nature of cargo taken on board, the mode of stowing cargo, the state in which cargo is discharged, the investigation of the oaUBe of loss or damage, or injury to vessels and' eargeee. Tee Adelaide association is more modest in its aims, but it ib likely to be of the greatest service to the underwriters in South Australia, Each of these arc to contribute something towards the expense*, which will certainly not exceed £400 or £500. There are at present, including tie one just established, four local and eight branch marine companies carrying on business in the city, and the contributions from each will not exceed tossy great extent the amount at present paid for sur veys. Of- course the great object to be attained is a nil and satisfactory examination of the vessels and their cargoes, and it in of the first importance that the surveyor employed Khali be free from all suspicion of partiality. A final meeting is shortly to be held, when the feeling of the whole of the companies towards the proposed association will be known, and when, judging from tho support that has been given to the movement hitherto, arrangements for carrying it out will be complete!. Baby Lobt in tub Bush.— Narratives of men being loBt in the bush and perishing there from thirst, heat, or the effects of strong drink (observes the S. A. foguter) are of such frequent occurrence in this part of the world, and especially the Kiverine district and outlying country, that comparatively little notice is taken or inquiries made about them whon their remains are accidentally discovered, and they are sometimes left to bleach, or a hole is dug on the spot to receive their bones. But it ie not often we hear of such an occurrence as the following in connection with* very young wanderer. A well-sinker and his &muy; camped near a waterhole in the Darling back country, ana somehow allowed their child, a boy, not more than eighteen months-old, to Btray from their sight early in the forenoon. of Friday, October 1, and searched in vain for him until dark. They then sent in to WUcannia for the aid of the polioe and a black tracker, who started early sen morning, but did not succeed in finding the poor little fellew until the afternoon. The tracker had then discovered him asleep with his cap ever his eyes aadhu head as far under a bush as he could get it, thus no douot preventing the crows from picking his eyes ont, as a great number of these bold and ravenous birdB were waiting and hopping round him ready and eager to pick the fleeh from his bones as Boon as they could get the chance. The little fellow must have walked, according to his tracks, a distance of not less than six miles from the oampand through a thick scrub, and but for the timely and sncoesi 1 ul ail of Constable Arthur and his Mack tracker would so doubt eoon have perished for want of sustenance. Ameeica and the Fiji Islands,— We find the fol lowing in the Fiji Times of 4th September:— A petition | to thePretiiJent of the United States has been prepured. fl and signed by upwards of one hundred of tho pnncipu | residents in the Fiji Group, praying that the preteutton ; g of the United States Government may be extended over ? the 'Looal Belf-Qovemment of Ffil.' The Unite! g States Consul here has expressed a hope that the boon B asked for may be granted, and certified to his recognition H amongst the numbers of the petitioners men of reepeoW- I bility and property, who are bona fide residents ot tbe . 1 country, likely to have tie general good of Ffii at heart. H It is, we believe, the intention of the movers in tbs H matter to got the petition extensively signed, both in n Sydney and Melbourne, and then to send it to its destin- f ation. The Vunivalu (Tbakotnb.u) hae likewise exprewfl- I approval of Out movement, and intends to iiddress the Ame* I riosn Government in support of tbe prayer of the pebllpo- I
