Thus runs the resolution wh'ich '.;the Wesieyan Conference passed -with .a great majority, and, in moving -which Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P.,;,re lharked that the problem of social unrest had reached a stage where .-it could not possibly be ignbred.i. It was, he said, so comprehensive ih scope, so^ unparalleled in intensity, so menacing- in- its tendencies; as to concern all classes of ; the %v com- ! munity.

Or,, agadn, eugenics, may be exp'ressedy: -iti' ' 'this ' -way ': ' ' T w,d ?' great . factors infiuence,- life, ' heredity ' and ; Environment. ' Eugenists choose to deal with the former, not depreciat ing or taking from the value of the work, already being carried out in betterment . of the second, but taking the - factor which \ seemingly. : is ' mos,t neglected, j Any . steps that - we may_ take to improve racial characteristics will undoubtedly benefit future , millions. Therefore, to ©ligenists, to en deavour both to study the . laws of heredity' and practically to apply the knowledge to the regulation of life seems';.tovbe the paramount duty owing to posterity. Perhaps' the matter niay. be made more clear if 1 give briefly a few , of '; the views of ! various -speakers at the congress. It was' stated that' the first efforts of eugenists is to establiS'h such. a moral code- as would ensure that the wel fare of the unharn should be held in vjew in connection with all ques tions concerning marriage and the organisation' of;. the State. Then again,. the President, referring to the knowledge that natural, selection, or nature -playing the part .of breeder in ;ref using to breed from mferior iStock,in the case of cattle, said that i we by our ? social methods were at I tempting to prevent further . pro Igress.along those lines. , The unfit ;- are . no longer necessarily killed off . by hunger and disease ; 'they are cherished with care, and enabled to I reproduce their kind, however bad r that progeny may be. While we 1 could not voluntarily go back to the law of natural selection, it was weak ness and folly to feel satisfaction at succouring distress without at the I same tdme considering the effects likely to be produced on future generations. A Cambridge professor of biology, for instance, held titat there was every reason to expect ''thai a policy of strict segregation [ would rapidly -. bring about the elamination of feeble-mindedness. Of epilepsy , the same would appear 'to be true, , for it was stated that where ' there were . two epileptic parents defectives were al ways produced. The hon. secre tary of the Danish Eugenics Com mittee said that the radical ^method of coping with the progenitive ten dency of epileptics was complete sterilisation, Ibut another way adopted with great success in. Den mark was the establishment of land I colonies where the sexes were segre- I gated, and where it had been 'found j possible to induce diminution of hypertrophy of sexuality by the pro vision of a tranquil atmosphere. To sum up the views: Conscious selec tion must replace the blind forces of natural selection ; men must util ise the knowledge of the past in order to promote moral and physi cal progress in the future ; and there must be se-gre Ration of the ! unfit, so as to render impossible th-e i recurrence of hereditary taints and the production of unfit progeny. What is done in the casa of cattle, witn certain limitations imposed by our moral obligations to all men, shouil be done, said the- speakers ar the Congress, with the race, if we j are to ? build up the future .perfect j race. ' We; a-Pe told by eugenists (pr --at leas!... 'by some studeat-s of science) ti-aA upon tile outcome ? of th's studies wbieh- the Congress is meant 'to' promote depends the an swer to the question whether civilis ation is to go on or t-e?ish. ? But eugGnisjfcs are.aotthe first who have human sv ciety, and they will fiird in, earlier experiments that it haa been found necessary to resort, to methods from which they would - probably recoil in order to obtain the ends to which their _ speculation^ point. To play Providence to-. at race- of men is rather a big under* taking, : and it calls for. more drastitf and thorough revision of accepted and cherished ideas than the eilgeiu ists are apparently aware of.
