The Fremantle Harbour Works returned for the last 12 months, clear of all expenses, an amount equal to 33 per cent, on the total expenditure A this work. This is exclusive of the returns from all other Harbours in the State. The Cold fluids Water Supply is fast approaching completion, and the net revenue from this and other water schemes this year will pay nearly 2 per cent, on the capital involved, and at an early date there it every justification for the expectation that the schemes will pay full interest. On 30th June, 1903, the total amount expended on Public Buildings, Roads, and Bridges amounted to £2,550,000, but of this large sum only £209,203 has been expended from Loan Funds, the balance having been paid from Revenue. The expenditure under the Heads of Develop- ment of Goldfields" and "Development of Agri- culture" contains about £500,000, which is directly reproductive. The balance can only be classed as indirectly reproductive, although each year in- crease the direct re- productiveness of the expenditure under three heads. The bulk of this expenditure was incurred some years ago, and was rendered necessary in the earlier days of the Goldfields and Agricultural Development, but an ever-increas- ing proportion of the votes specified is now paid from revenue. The State is constructing from Revenue a number of public works which are distinctly reproductive. From this year's Revenue provision is made for Railways £87,00, being for part cost of The Malcolm to Laverton Railway, The Gooseberry Hill Railway, The Owen's Anchorage Railway, and the Jandakot Railway. A further £23,000 is provided for Public Batteries, which pay working expenses and interest; £72,787 for Additions and Improve- ments to Open Railways and Maintenance and Repairs of Rolling-stock; £28 000 for Rabbit- proof Fencing, or a total of £212,7 is paid from Revenue for works which elsewhere are paid from Loan Funds. An equal sum was provided on last year's Estimates for similar works,. , . Every industry in the State is solidly prosperous. Nearly £9,000,000 worth of gold was produced for the year ended 31st December last. The agricultural and pastoral industries, owing to the never falling average rainfall, are experiencing phenomenal development. The Timber, Tin, Copper, and Pearl industries were never sounder. The population of the State during the year just ended increased by 14,000. employment is regular and capital profitably invested. The Mining Dividends were paid during the year ended 31st December totalled £1,0S8,755. Taking the nominal capital of the mines now working at £30,000,000, this is very 0) per cent, per annum on that sum. Three facts stand out prominently in the FI ounces of the State: 1\. The rate of interest on our Loan is £3/0/0 per cent., the lowest of any State in Australia. 2\. The proportion of Interest on Loans lo total expenditure is 13-16 per cent., or including the State's Sinking Fund (amounting to £177,000 per annum) £18/11/4 per cent., us against the next lowest Australian Slate of £20 per cent., or the average of Australasia of £20 per cent. 3\. Every Loan bears a Sinking Fund, varying from 1 percent, to 3 per cent. This Fund is not under control of the State Treasurer, but is sent to London to Trustees, who in- vest it in purchasing the State's own Stocks. Owing to the low price of Australian Stocks generally, the State is by these mean., purchasing its own Stocks with its own Sinking Fund at a Discount ranging from £4 to £14. The annual contribution to this fund is now £177 ;000, and, at the end of the present Financial Year, the fund will total £1,012,030, or nearly one-half of the total amount provided by all the Sinking Funds of the whole of the Commonwealth. The Stock now offered will rank pari passu with the Stock issued and held under "The Loan Act 1891," and all subsequent Loan Acts, and will be settled in a register to be prepared and kept for that purpose at this office, where it will be transferable (without charge and free of stamp duty either by the stock-holders personally or by their attorneys. The principal and the interest will be payable at his office, or, if desired, in any of the Commonwealth capitals, free of exchange; or will be sent by post to any address at the stock-holders risk. Applications, addressed to the Colonial Treasurer must not be for a less sum than £100, and above that amount must be for multiples, of £50, and be accompanied by a deposit of 25 per cent. P. ment in full will be required on the 10th February, 1904\.
