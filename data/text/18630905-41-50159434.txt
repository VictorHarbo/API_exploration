The Kule of the Road.— In reviewing the regulations for preventing collisions at sea, which came into operation on the 1st of the present month, we referred to the new rule for steamers approaching each other, where there is dancer of collision, but where the vessels are not directly end on, which seems to imply that in such cases steamers are to pass to 'starboard of eajh other. We are reminded by a correspondent that such a reflation, if followed, would involve considerable risk. On looking again at this portion of the regu lations, we find that the rule is that, where steamers are approaching as described, the steamer having the other on her 'own .starboard side is to keep out of the way of the other.' This would not involve, it is true, the passing to starboard by each vessel, but it gives a discretion to the steamer having the other on her starboard hand to keep out of that other steamer's way, by adontingauy coarse which may appear advisable under the circum stances. Our correspondent appears to think that the safest course would be that each vessel should pass to port, instead of to starboard of each other. We have considered the cases he puts very atten tively, and we come to the conclusion that no general rule can be laid down which will meet the variety of cases which may arise. The new regu lation simply states that the steamer approached by another on the starboard hand shall keep clear, and allow that other to keep her course. The manner in which tlu's ride must l-e complied with will, it is obvious, differ with the positions of the vessels, their proximity to each other, and the extent of sea-room and other circumstances, and must be left to the discretion of those in charge of the vessel whose duty it is to keep out of the way.— MUchelC s Maritime Regixtcr.
