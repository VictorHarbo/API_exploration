Wednesday's Arrivals.— When day broke on Wednesday morning a sharp lookout was evident, for at each watch-box on the sandhills there were seamen scanning the horizon; but it was broad day light before three vessels were made put coming up the Gulf, bringing a light southerly wind with them. What added rather to the excitement, each had a flag forwards; so that it was pretty evident the cutters were not on the alert as usual, and in con sequence three pilots from the beach were put on board. The first vessel in the anchorage was the Crest of the Wave, a very smart fore-and-aft centre board schooner, which has been purchased by Mr. Mortiss for the coasting trade, and from her build nothing can be more suitable, especially as she sails well, and carries a good cargo on a light draught of water. She left Hobart Town on March 13, but called at Swan Island to land stores for the Lightkeepers. The Gem, frem Brisbane, is timber laden, having on board a specimen cargo of cedar sawn at the mills of Mr. Walter Smith, who has settled in Queensland after a long residence at Port Adelaide, and sent his son as supercargo, to arrange if possi ble fora permanent trade. She has also some sam ple logs of Elm. which are said to be of very superior quality. The Prince Edward has a full cargo of potatoes from Port Fairy, add having made a beautiful passage may be expected to turn out tke tubers, in excellent condition. This brig concluded the first batch of arrivals, and the boats landed in time to breakfast and find a second edition of signal flags hoisted denoting more work for the beach rangers. The Sarah will be remembered as a smart ves sel, long commanded by Captain Craig, but now in charge of Captain CaUo, who may be congratu lated on the completion of a very good voyage being only 81 Uay3 from Kangaroo Island to Port Louts and back, the return trip , being a highly favourable one. The barque Formosa, belonging to the same firm as the Sarah, arrived at Mauritius on the 15th February, after a good passage from Melbourne. The barque Robert Passenger sailed from Port Louis for Sydney, sugar laden, on the 12th; the Sea Nymph, for Melbourne, on February 5; and the barque Pacific, for Adelaide, took final de parture about the same time, and was spoken in Instigator's Straits on the 20th, but up to sundown yesterday had not put in an appearance, though anxiously expected. A large ship, guano laden, from Callao, had become a wreck outside the Bell Buoy at Port Louis, and in breaking up had so distributed her contents that thousands of poisoned fish were thrown up by the surf on every tide. An auction had been held, at which the abandoned ship and argo were sold; but the prospect of a good specula tion vanished on the approach of a gale. The Trevelyan is a handsome iron clipper ship which has made her passage out in 95 days, and this after being delayed forover a fortnight beating aoout in the chops of the Channel against most j~,Tetse, weather; in fact, she was at sea during the Cl V!'!? *» deMluctoe to the ill-fated .London. But after storm then calm, and the SSft&Srffl;^1™^ fe*6 NorthAtirtic w^ 90 January 23, The southerly trades merged, into mch strong easterly winds that the ship was com jelled to keep well to the westward, and it was February 10 before sighting Gough's Island, and :ight days after the meridian ofthe Cape #waa passed. Then a long succession of fine fair winds induced a hope of a speedy termination to the pas sage, and a rapid headway across the Southern Ucean was made in 46 S. ; but not an lcebere hove hi sight to break the monotony of the everyday Bpectacle. On reaching Cape Leuwm, however, the usual local winds were in vogue, and over a week has been spent in very slowly attempting to make Cape Borda. After seeing the light two more days elapsed before receiving Pilot Weltamap on board. She anchored at the Lightship on Wed nesday but as Boon as the noodtide made pro ceeded 'in tow of the Young Australian to the stream moorings. ,.„.,?*- (?The Aldinga reports leaving Hobson's Bay at 3.40 p.m. on the 19th, and Warmambool at 3^0 p.m. on the 20th.
