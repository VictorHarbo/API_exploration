The steamer Havilah returned from Melbourne on Monday night about 9 o'clock, having left Hobson's Bay on Saturday morning, and not on Friday night as reported. During her absence of several months trorn Port Adelaide Captain Saunders has resigned the sea for more congenial pursuits on shore: but on the steamer proceeding to the scene of his former labours he resumed charge, and made a voyage from port to port in the usual time. On his arrival near the Semaphore Jetty his knowledge of the coast line allowed him to proceed within hailing distance and round-to to anchor within half a mile, consequently the duties of the boarding officers were accomplished in half an hour. Captain Saunders reports passing the barque Stag, hence, off Cape Bridgewater, and the steamer Aiding off Cape Northumberland, on Sunday last. The following telegram from Queenscliife appears in Saturday's 'Argus .-—'The Malta, with 213 standard deals, is ordered to Adelaide.' The Cooroxg was to sail from Melbourne for Adelaide on Thursday, the 4th. VESSELS IN HARBOUR. ALWfNTON, barque (British), 491 tons, John Hole, master, from Auckland, N.Z. J.
