EUROPE. INTRODUCTION. The Columbian, with the Australian mails of January, takes her departure to- morrow morning. The Salsette, with the English mails of November, arrived in Hobson's Bay on the evening of the 8th inst. A proposition by the Peninsular and Oriental Company to alter the route of the mail steamers from Mauritius to Galle, and to give a fortnightly service for an additional subsidy of £25,000 a-year, was received in Melbourne by the last mail. Unless accepted, the company declare their determination to retire from the contract, on account of the returns from freight and passengers being insufficient, with the subsidy, to cover their expenses. A meeting of the Chamber of Commerce has been held to consider the project, and a reso- lution has been unanimously come to, recommending the change of route to the Government, and suggesting that, should the other colonies be unwilling to accept their proportions of the additional subsidy, the whole cost should be borne by Victoria. In this colony, it is the unanimous feeling that the change of route and the additional service will be of great ad- vantage to the public. The old route via Galle has always been preferred to the present one by Mauritius, as being not only shorter and more conve- nient, but as uniting us directly with India and our Eastern possessions. And it is also felt that the time has arrived for a more frequent intercourse with Europe. The Peninsular and Oriental Company, whether rightly or wrongly, has been accepted as the only possible instruments for securing to these colonies the benefits of a regular and speedy steam communication with Europe; and although some delays have occurred in the performance of their present contract, the service, on the whole, has never been so punc- tually executed. Should the terms now offered not be accepted, it is probable that we shall have to pay more for a future monthly service than we are now asked to pay for a fortnightly one. Parliament returned to business on the 10th inst., after the Christmas recess. There is still much political apathy. The quiet tenor of Mr. Nichol- son's reign has been unbroken. Although, in some recent instances, showing many signs of weakness and of an accord not perfect, the Ministry stands secure in the face of an Opposition still weaker and more divided. The Land Bill, after a long and desultory debate, has been carried through a second reading without a division, the extreme reformers reserving their minute cri- ticisms until the measure is in Com- mittee. The belief is that the Bill will pass in its substantial integrity, al- though there may be considerable modi- fications of the clauses respecting im- provements, the system of tender, and special surveys. Public opinion has not expressed itself in any direct manner on the Bill ; and there is a general disposition to accept it as the best approximate measure towards a settlement of the much-vexed Land question. The operation of the commercial crisis having led to the retirement of two of the members of the House, their places have been filled up by Mr. W. M. Bell (for Evelyn) and Mr. Wilson Gray (for Rodney). The elections, in either case, have no material significance. Mr. Wilson Gray, as the leader of the Land Reformers, had become inevitable ; and Mr. Bell, as a gentleman of high character and respectable position, is a welcome acquisition. The intelligence of the wreck of the Royal Charter has been received here with profound sensation. The Argus telegram from Aden, published here on the 13th December, had announced the arrival of the vessel at Queenstown, so that her subsequent fate was peculiarly painful to the friends of the hapless pas sengers. The volunteer movement is progress- ing most hopefully in this colony, in spite of the stupid and dastardly oppo- sition which it encountered from a cor- tain class at its outset. A very respect- able force can now be mustered for the defence of the colony in case of invasion, and though it is yet practically un- armed, it is expected that a sufficient number of Enfield rifles will shortly be at its service. In connection with this sub- ject, we may mention that the receipt of an order from the War Office, directing the immediate discharge of all soldiers from the 40th Regiment who have served a term of 10 years, has caused much dis- satisfaction among the colonists. We are not in a position to spare any por- tion of our military force, and it is a very paltry economy which would make our small army still smaller, by the withdrawal of some seventy or eighty soldiers. Other news will be found detailed under the usual heads. THE POSTAL SERVICE. The subject of the Postal Service between Australia and tho mother-country has earned some anxiety. A special (renoral meeting of tho Chamber of Commerce was held on the morning of Saturday last, the 14th inst., for the purpose «f considering the proposal of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, for the future conveyance of the English and Aus ?WlUa mail«. The meeting was very numerously attended, and the chair was taken by til» Presi- dent, Mr. 0. E. Bright. The subject to bo con- sidered having been duly stated hy the President, the Secretary proceeded to read the lettor oí Mr. Sparkes (tlio Peninsular and Oriental Company's Victorian agent) to tho Chamber, which stated that the company was apprehensive that it would not bo ablo to carry on the mail service without a further subsidy of ,£25,000 per annum, for which sum a fortnightly mail would be carriod between England and Australia, via Point do Galle, . mid , requesting tho attention ' of tlio Chamber to the matter. The correspondence between tlio soorctary and tho company nnd the Lords of the Treasury was also read, by which it appeared that tho latter consented to the altera- tion of route, without, however, agreeing to the oxtr.a subsidy. The matter was then dis- cussed by tho members of tho' Chamber, and Mr. Franklyn proposed the following reso- lution :- "1, Resolved-That the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company having proposed for an increased subsidy of £25,000 per annum, or £205,000 in all, to run semi- monthly steamers for tho Australian mails, ria Ceylon, in conjunction with their India and China steamer?, instead of the present through lino vid Mauritius, this Chamber recommnnds that tho o.Tur be accepted on tho following con- ditions, viz. :-2. That Victoria shall pay her share of the additional subsidy according to the present mode of assessment, or, if necessary, that tho Victonan Government shall guai anteo the moiety payable by these colonies of the £25,000 required, and arrange with the other colonies for tlio repayment of their sharo of such inoioty. 3\. That Victoria be made tho first port of arrival, and South Australia the lait of doparture, ex- cept as for as rogards King George's Sound." This was seconded by Captain Colo, and somo objections to it wero made by Mr. Sichel, who thought tho colonies wero boing 'hurried by the Peninsular and Oriental Com- pany, without sufficient cause, whilo no gua- rantee was being taken that vessels of so largo a size as would secure tho safety and comfort of passengers would bo put on. tho line.' Mr. 'Dickson was the next speaker, and ho ad- vocated tho adoption of the Cape route, with Glasgow as tho port of arrival and departuro in Great Britain. A discussion ensued, in which it was considered that nny variation in the con- tract might bo taken up by Sydney as a rçason foi« the withdrawal of their moiety of the subsidy, while tlio alteration with' respect to' Adelaide' would onsuro the opposition of tho South Australians. An amendment was proposed by Mr. Morris, and soconded by Mr. Ham mill, expunging tho last paragraph' in the resolution, but an opinion was pretty gene- rally expressed in fitvonr of the guaranteeing by Victoria of the « whole of the Australian sub- sidy, terms boing made with the other colonies afterwards. Eventually Mr. S. lord proposed an amendment to the following effect :-" That if it be necessary, in conscquonco of tho varia- tions in the conditions of tho present mail cm tract, this colony guarantco tho wholo amount of the moiety which it is proposed tho wholo of tho colonies should pay." Mr. II. Vf. Farrar se- conded, but it was arranged to make the amend- ment' a fourtli paragraph in Mr. Franklyn, resolution, mid on tho question being put to tho îneo'inpr Mr. Morris's amoudmont was rejoçted, and the resolution as amondod was carried very nearly unanimously. Mr. Bain ' introduced tho subject of an additional penalty, which ho thought should bo conditionally imposed on the Peninsular and Oriental Com- pany. He thon proposed a resolution recom- mending tho Homo Government to fix Buch a condition in the contract, but it was not seconded, however, mid having authorised the forwarding of the resolution to tho Chief Secretary with, a view to its transmission to the Homo Govern- ment, tho meeting soparntod. THE GOLD-FIELDS. The nov.« year has opened most promisingly for tho gold-fields. The discoveries of tlio last few weeks aro important, and even if no moro be mado for somo time, will afford ample scope and occupation to a largonumbor of miners, who wero previously in a, state of uncertainty as to whero best they might dispose of thomselvcs and their labour. And these discoveries aro not only im- portant from tlio extent of tho new ground thus opened up, but they give further indications and most unmistakable proofs that others must fol- low on further explorations of the country. Thus one of these now fields, on which upwards of 20,000 peoplo have already collected, and aro earning more money, perhaps, than has been realisod at any of the great " rushes" of late years, is easily accessible, situated in an opon country, and «as partly tviedbofore, but with littlo success, ncre perseverance in tlio search has at length opened up deposits of apparently almost boundless ex- tent, and very tolerablo richness, and such as aro eminontly calculated to afford remunerative employment to the numbers of men drivoii off many of (ho older fields by the want of water, mid of ground also suitablo to tho miners of limited means. Lamplough, as tho diggings of which ivo speak aro now culled, is m the Avoca district, not many miles from whero fold was first found at the Pyrenees in 1831. Tho ground is shallow and easily worked, tho auriferous deposits being reached at depths varjing for the most part from 20 to 30 feet, but like all the ground yet opened in that district it is patchy, and no clearly-defined leads of gold havo yet been struck. Tho patches nro, - howover, pretty numerous, and no great distanco apart, so that, although there are no superficial indications of their position, tho miners strike in without much hesitation, especially ns Uley so soon loam the valuo of their claims. Good shallow diggings aro a great boon to the miner, and hero ho has thom apparently of great extent. The second now iiela, opened up about the same limo, is some distanco to tho north-eastward, and near Sandy Creek, so famous for tho yield of its reefs, and tho production of the heaviest cakes of amal- gamated gold yet retorted m the colony. This tract of auriferous ground, tho Ingle- wood diggings, is in the midst of a dense scrub, and littlo or nothing is known of its extent at present, -lie nearest wator, too, is 5 miles away, in the Loddon, so.that the difficulties in the way of exploration aro vory great. Still roads have boen cut through the scrub, several gullies havo beon proved to bo auriferous, quartz-roofs havo beon laid bare, and much gold lins been obtained from tho picked wash-dirt deomed worthy of being carted to tho river. ' The absoluto want of water, even for drinking purposes, will prevent the development of the Inglewood dig- gings until winter comes round again, but these are fully expected to turn out exceedingly well, in regard to both the alluvial ground and the quartz-reefs. Of the third new field little or nothing is known as yet, except from the dis- closures made by the discoverer. According to his account it is situated among the dividing ranges from which the Yarra, Goulburn, and some of the tributaries of the Ovens take their rise, and it extends for a distance of some 40 or 50 mile« at least. So far he has traced it by following the water-courses, but the country is so densely timbered and impervious that the actual extent of the auriferous formation will not be known for years, even though a large population should be attracted to the ranges. Gold was found by the explorer in black sand, taken from the bed of every creek which he tried, and the samples brought to town yielded, on analyses, proportions of from 5o¿. to upwards of 301b. of gold, and about an eighth of the total weight of pure tin, to the ton. All the rivers flowing from these ranges have been found at different times to contain gold m tho sands, so that this last dis- covery only adds anothor to the many proofs already existing that tho wholo of the southern- most portion of the Australian Alps is more or less auriferous. Tlio scarcity of water and tho timo lost during the Christmas holidays aro quito enough to ac- count for tho late falling off in the escorts, and wo may hopo that theso will bo restored to at least their Bummer average now that work lias been generally resumod. Even if thoy should not tbero will be no causo for alarm, as very many of tho men on the older fields aro now eta ployed in the erection of machinery and the construction of works that will not for some time help to swell the returns of gold. Tho companies havo dono nothing worthy of men- tion as yet, but nearly_ all, except' thoso never intended by their originators to get boyond the first stage on paper, have beon busy with their preliminary preparations, and will soon be setting fairly to work to .test the value of their claiiiiB and holdings. Tho share mania was at an end some time since,-indeed it never reached any greatheiglitonthegold- field8¡ BO that nono but the bond fide companies, looking to legitimate divid- ends for their profits, aro now before the public. Somo of these uro hamporcd in thoir operations by the difficulty of getting in calls, but most have a sufficiency of funds, ana will shortly be launched as working and very promising enterprises. In regard to nuartz-cruBliing, there has been nothing unusual of late, nor havo any nuggots large enough to be deserving of special mention been found for »ovcral months past. AGRICULTURE. This 1ms been, taking it altogether, ono of the most propitious seasons wo have had for somo years. Tho crops aro good, and the woathor has been on tho wholo favourable for getting them ii . A period of hot nnd rather dry woathor has been succeeded by cold and showers, but these have not been heavy enough to causo any serious in- jury or much delay. Everywhere tho grain is allowed to be of superior quality, and in few parts of tho country are tho returns not declared* to ' bo abovo the average, Sinco tlio commence- ment of harvest there havo been few actual interruptions from bad weather, ns there were last year, and these havo been of no long continuanco, BO that tho formers have not suffered so much as they otherwise might, from the high rate of wages (hey have hod to pay. It is some timo sinco they were obliged to beat aboutfor extra hands at this season, but men havo not been lately going about in such numbers seeking work, nnd tho masters havo had this year to go tp tho labour marts and road parties to make up tho complement required, and have done so only willi difficulty. This al- tered state of things was of course quickly taken advantago of by the mon, who, by striking work, or threatening to leave their employers, obtained higher and higher vvagos, until these havo risen to nearly double what they wero last year. The scarcity of labour, with tho higher rates to be paid, and tho consequently greater cost of getting in tho crops, in tho faco of low and foiling prices, rather alarmed many, but thore_ was no time for inaction or ropining, ns the grain vyas ripening fast and liad to be gathered. It was feorod that much would have been lost in the field, by reason of tho reaping not having been commonced soon enough, but Uiero has boon no ' actual dearth of of mon in any one district, and the altorcd state of the weather has allowed of tho reaping being protracted ovor a longer period of timo with safety. The reaping-machines havo also been pressed into the sorvico, and compollcd to do extra work in the emergency, and good friends they hove proved to many farmers who thought slightingly of thom beforo ; so that, alto- gether, tho harvest ÍB passing over with' less difficulty thoa was anticipated a fow weoks since ; and although tlio farmers cannot caleUlnto on as high i prices' ' for ' their produce us thoy might wish, the country will enjoy tho benefit of a largo quantity of grain housed and secured in good order. Tho late rains' too havo caused the'grass'to spring again, and havo very much refreshed tho fodder and root crops. ' i ' _ At this season's trials of reapiug-inacliiiics in different parts of the. country the prizes havo all boen'tokonby colonial makers. It'wa*t hoped that a machine with n good side-delivery would havo been brought out m a state satisfactory to the judges, but, although one firm has succeeded in producing an automaton raking ammiatus that works admirably under ordinary circumstances and has satisfied tho'prnotical formers, tlio judges did not award them tlio prize at the trial near Melbourne. Tho best machine in tho field was declared by tho judgos to be one of Nichol- son's, nearly similar to tho machine Mr. Nicholson took with him to England, and tried thoro at last harvest. All tho colonial machines aro strongly ¡nade, and cut well ; but an efficient side-delivery is a great desideratum, especially when labour is as scorco ns it threatened to bo at the commence- ment of this season, and may in reality bo next. In tho northern parts of the colony, towords the Upper Murray and Ovens Hivers,' whero agricul- ture has been extending rapidly of lato years, the Adelaide reaping and thrashing machine has been rather oxtorlsivoly used, and with great ndvontago to the farmers. A fow of these machines havo also boen tried near Melbourno and Goolong, and Havo answered well in light crops, for tho gather- ing of which they must come into moro general uso each year, as prices fall and labour becomes moro scarce', both which contingencies may be calculated on for another harvest or two at least. The saving effected with these machines in the gathering of crops to which they aro adapted is so great that it cannot bo much longer overlooked,' and their merits will have to be recognised as economy becomes moro needful. Preparations for the autumn shows of grain and stock | havo ulrcady commenced, and tho first of these,, in connection with the Port Phillip Farmers' Society, is to be hold noxt month. Then will follow, at short inter- vals, tho shows of tho two other branch societies, to bo succeeded by tho annual grain show at Melbourno about the ond of March. Wo always have very good samples at these, but this year, from tho goneral character of tho crops, tho grain ought to be even bettor than usual. It is rather early to look forward to our noxt spring bhow of stock at Molbourno, but the Into impor- tations from England hove caused much spe- culation as to the distribution of prizes at this, and it ia thought that more than one of the horetofore-unvanquished animals will have to succumb to tho now arrivals. Mr. M'Dougall has returned, with the loss of only ono of tlio 10 vory valuablo shorl-horns shippod by him; nnd, besides theso, numbers of horses, cuttle, sheep, and swino havo been landed from the sanio and other vessels that havo arrived within the last few months. And by tho late homo papers we learn that numerous purchases for Australia wero continuing to bo mode at all the sales of pure stock, so that it will not bo from want of tho best blood, and plenty of this of tho most esteemed strains that wo do not nt somo future day produco animals so superior is to jus- tify the apprehension now beginning to bo enter- tained in England, that sho will eventually hove to resort to American or lustraban broedors for the means to preservo the oxcollence of her on n stock. LABOUR. For yoars post reapers and mowers, and men capable of assisting in tho work of the harvest field, have not been in such request as they were duriug tho last six weeks. Now, however, much of the grain has been cut, and tho farmers aro no longer under tho samo obligation to securooll tho men to ho had from far and near, and, as the ovent proved, at very much higher wages than they oxpected to bo obliged to pay. Finding themselves sought after with Buch eagerness, of course the mon asked moro and more for thoir services, and the masters had to givo way, until' at longlh tho former wero receiving a higher scalo of payment, whether as woekly wages or for task work, than many skilful mechanics or tradesmen would be only too( glad to engago at. Molbourno was quito drained of men able or willing in any way to assist in tho horvost fl«ld ; hut now the hurry is over, and none but really good ploughmon, or generally- useful and experienced farm servants, aro inquired for. Mechanics and tradosmon aro still out of employ- ment in great numbers, but it is not known to the public whether this is the result of combina- tions among themselves, or of thiro being no work for thom to do. Whatever moy be tho cause, many of theso men aro Soverely pinched in finding tho means to livo, anti aro glad to go to work in privato sorvico for vory much less than tho arbitrary standard of wajres fixed by tlio authorities amomr them. The differences between tho masons and tho rail- way contractors have not beon yet arranged, and it is stated now that tho Gormans nro on strike too. These men havo beon rather restless since their arrival, and havo tried on different occasions to escapo from the torms of their original agree- ment with Messrs. Cornish nnd Bruce, but the magistrates beforo whom thoy have been brought havo rulod that tho contracts entored into in Germany aro binding hore, and havo com- mitted those men to gaol who would not return to thoir work. Only about half the so-called masons 'aro skilled tradosmon, tho others having deceived tho eon tractors' agent, for tho purposo of getting a passago to the colony, and with tho roto of, pay allowed for the short time they work-eight hours per diem, and the deductions for the repayment of their passage-money, thoy recoivo scarcely onough to support thom. Tlio unskilful mon, of course, receive still less, working as navyles and otherwiso, so that it is not much to bo wondered at if these men havo all struck work onco more. Thoro is still the samo want of really good do- mestic servants, both malo and female, but espe- cially the latter. Country girls, unused to house 'work, aro numerous enough! but employors now look for capability, and good character, and tes- timonials of ability and good conduct aro seldom forthcoming. Desirable and trustworthy servants are so eagerly sought after, that thoy; do not need to look for 'situations out of the circle of the family with which they have lived. Good useful married couples for the country aro also in great domand, but they must bo unencumbered with children. As thoy aro mostly required for house- work, children would ho in the way, and the more of these a couplo may have the moro diffi- cult they find it to obtain employment In the present state of the domee.ic labour market hero wo could absorb with advantage, and much to the comfort of housekeepers, a large number of good servants of tho kinds required, but of incapables and uninfltructed ones we. bave enough and to [ spare. RAILWAYS. Theio ia very little to report with respect to the progress of the works on tho two main lines of railivnys. The- difficulties which havo from timo to time arisen« between, tho workmen and their employers have died out for the present, and activity is the order of the day. During the holidays the several lines in opera- tion liai o reaped rich harvests, the effect of which will be manifested in tho noxt monthly returns. Those portions of tbo Govein«nont lines between Melbourno and Williamstown and Melbourne and Sunbury , whioh have been opened to publie truflio during the past year, havo yielded a revenue amounting to £00,103. Tho cxponses of working these por- tions of tho lino havo been greator than the receipts. This result was looked forward to as a matter of course. 'The Government and the public were anxious for tho first Btep to bo taken, Without regard to immediate revenue. The sum realised, however, in tho traffic of 'the 30 miles oponed up has been sufficiently largo to give ns suianco of thoeventual success of these under- takings, as auxiliaries to tho public resources of tho colony.

The rumours of war that each succeeding mail has brought us for some months back, have had the effect of giving somewhat of an impetus to the volunteer movement, although it has by no means taken such a hold upon the population here as it appears to have done in the mother country. From an official return published by the authorities at the latter end of last month, we find that on the 12th of December the total strength of our volunteers,, including commis- sioned anid non-commissioned officers, was 1,600. Of these about 1,100 were enrolled in Melbourne and the immediate neighbourhood, tho remaining 500 being residents at Geelong and on the seaboard. Of the whole force, the artillery numbers about 300, the yeomanry cavalry 120, and the remain- der, with the exception of about 80 naval volun- teers belonging to Williamstown, form a rifle corps. Although the rilfes have been enrolled only for a few months, the various companies have attained a high state of efficiency, and at a parade of those belonging to Melbourne and the suburbs, on the 2nd instant, Major- General Macarthur expressed his entire satisfaction at the results of the training they have been sub- jected to, under the superintendence of Lieu- tenant-Colonel Pitt, the Acting Adjutant-General, and the head of the Volunteer Corps. A generall order to a similar effect was subsequently issued. In his exertions Colonel Pitt has been well aided by his brother, Captain W. A. D. Pitt, and Cap- tain Hall. Since the commencement of the year, how- ever, there seems a probability of there being a considerable increase to the corps, no small number of gentlemen having come forward to join; and a meeting is to be hold this day for the purpose of forming n company in North Mel ourne, a locality which, although gazetted at the same time as the others, as a place where the inhabitants might enrol, has hitherto taken no steps to forward the movement. In opposition to what has been found to be the case at home, few of our leading men have taken a prominent pair in aiding the formation of volunteer corps, and there is scarcly any one of note who has ventured to enter the ranks as a recruit. When the movement originated, a, strong feeling set in against it on the part of the working-classes, and at some of the public meetings that were hold on the subject they openly refused to join, on the ground that they had nothing to fight for. Although, of course, the whole of the working-classes did not participate in so thoroughly an un-English feel- ing, it has been found that few, if any of them, have as yet enrolled themselves. The greater portion of our volunteers consists of clerks in Governnent, mercantile, and professional offices, with a few respectable tradesmen. There is no doubt, hewever, that, by proper management, and with encouragement on the part of the Government, there would be but little difficulty in not only greatly increasing the strength of the force, but in attracting to it large numbers of those classes that have hitherto held aloof.

Tho pantomime of " Humpy Dumpy," at tho Theatre Royal, had only a fortnight's run, and thon tho story of " Nipporkin and tho Enchanted Statuo" was made the subject of the introduction, but tho only offeot of tho chango was to prolong tho life of the pioco for another week. During these three weeks Mr. Lambert and Mr. Hudson (the Irish comedian) have both taken their fare- well of the Melbourne boards, the latter having intimated his intention of returning to England and retiring from the stage. Italian Opora is announced to follow the pantomimo ¿season. Signor and Signora Bianchi, a tenor and soprano reputed to bo of high class, havo just arrived from California, and having united nilli MÍBB O. Hamilton, Mrs. Hancock, and Mr. Farquharson, it is expected that the lovers of music will have a treat of which thoy havo been deprived sinco Anna Bishop took her depnrturo.

December is hut a dull mont" OB regards racing in Victoria, A few countiy meetings are gcnciolly held, but tho value of the prizes offeicd is, for tile most) part, so small that local hoi ses alone enter tho lists. Tho Williamstown Races, inaugurated this season, have proved an eAceptton, for not only van "consideiable amount of public money given to be run for, hut tho ar- rangements wero such as to induce proprietors of first-class horses to put in an appearance. Mr. Duppa's houe Camdon (Now Zealand bred) added another to his long list of victories; and tho Adelaide Barber, whoso mirajulous escape from the ill-fated Admella has rendered him an object of interest to Victorians since his arrival from tlio sister colony, achieved his maiden triumph here on tho some day. Tho Town Pinto of 50 sov s. w os a w alk-ov er for tho vv iniior of the Cham- pion Sweepstakes-Flying Buck, his ' formidable name appearing to have precluded any other cut ry. His owner, Air. Yuille, competition for tho Town Plato being deterred, govo ¿E50 to bo run for under the title of the Flying Buck Ptuso. If this was dono from bravado and utter disregard of public opinion relative to tho late Victoria Jockey Club Delby, and subsequent action token by Mr. Yuille, no comment ¡3 required ; but if tho prize vv as offered out of compliment to the Williamstown peoplo, amongst whom Mr. Yuille ícsides, then wo trust the complimcht will bo duly appreciated. Apropos of The. Buck and Buzzord matter, it may bo addeil that the latter has boon scratched for nil his Gecloiig engage- ments, the reason alleged being that the colt has caught fever in his feet. Wo need hardly say that very few ' disinterested persons out of tho stablo believe anything is the matter with tho horso. For the Geelong Races an excellent pio grammo has beon issued. Littlo public interest is, however, excitedj nor do wo think the most attroctivo bill of fin o will enlist general sympathy until tho black cloud of I suspicion at present hanging over the Ttuf as it is in Victoria bo dispelled. Unfoitunately, men in high places havo rendered themselves open to distrust, otherwise' the process of purging would bo compointivcly simple. The Victoria Jockey Club held its annual meeting on Mon- day, Jonuaiy 0. The report showed a falhng-off in îeceipts from subscriptions, goto money, and letting of bootliB. The election of certain' members to servo on'tho committee for tho present j ear is not likely to improve tho position of the Club-to which, in commou justlce,lwo must nttributo the credit of having successfully modernised racing in this colony. Saturday noxt'vv ill be a day for tho Americans. If1 tho ontcrpiiso bo successful, Of which there seems to bo littlo doubt, we sholl havo trottirg gatherings annually. Tho Melbourne Racecourso.hos been selected ns tho icnuc, and a buggy race, tho pnzo .£100, has seven entries. Tho saddle race may liavo na many moro. A hock hotting match winds up the day's sports. On the ovo of (he fifth oiiutiol ' ciickot match betw eon Victoi ia and New South Wolcs, wo are sorry not to hove it in our power to report that much has yet boen dono on our" side tho continent to secure a victoiy to the younger colony. Still, as between the 17th January and the 2nd of Fobruary there aro 14 dies fasti, and inasmuch ns there aro quite that number of cricketers capable of maintaining our kudos, the íesuít may bo looked to with a tolorablo decree of complacency. If the Sydnoy men win-and they have, from oil wo can learn, ».pared neither ex- penso nor practico the victory will bo gained, not by superior skill, but must bo attributed to assiduous and rigid disci olino.

Trade pave place to rumours, confidence was destroyed, and the dangers of a commercial ori_Si appeared to bo imminont. Happily, a b_b tex'feeling, set in with the first ot the cuxec_t year ; but the effect of tho over-trading spirit of , the past j car will bo fuit for many months lo como. As regarda the general resources of the colony, the year 1859 does not compare so very unfavourably with its predecessor. Tho prevail ing commercial depression has not materially jiff, fectcd the yiold of the gold-fields. The escort^ which at rived al the i Treasury during tho week ending tho 31st December brought down 30,240oz.',! which completed the returns for the year. Th'e total yield of tho gold mines . amounted to, 2,205,19 lo¿ against 2,33R,20fioz. for 1858. When; it is rcror-mboicd that labour h.is boen continually i attracted to other sources, the decline, which is equal to about threo avcrago weeks' production, is not to ho wondered at. Tho last quarter of 1850 was au epoch of transition. A vast amount of labour was diverted froinimmediateproduction to preparations for tho future. Joint-stock' mining companies have been formed on all sides. Largo sums of money havo been expended in erecting machinery and providing for iho' supply of water. Nouo oE theso companies have yet contributed to any extent towards the weekly escorts. It cannot bo denied, however, that the year, has been behind its fellow, in the jield'of tho precious metal, as will bo seen bj the follow- ing statement of the escoits and shipments for threo j cars : -_,_ 1857 1S5S 1850 .hlpments oz. dwt. 2,810,278 14 ¡>,500,544 1 2,220,351 2 As some discrepancies will bo found to exist between these futures and thoso previously given by ourselves anti by toilier compilers, wo may mention that thoy aro 'made up from official data for the Customs j ears in all cases. « The money market has boen subjected to several fluctuations. In May the.banks reduced the rate of discount for three months' bills 1 per cont.-from 8 per cent, per annum to 7. In July the old rato was suddenly re-established. At the commencement of the year tho banks wero sell- ing GO day bills on England at par. Tho rate was raised to li per cent, proniiuiu in Muy1 and to 2_ per cent, premium in July, and was low cred to .Vper cent, premium in October and to pur in November. During the wholo year tho maiket has been gradually becoming tighter, notwith- standing tlio. large ' sums raised in tho London .market on railw ay debentures, and expended on the two great trunk linos. Goods havo poured in upon tho colony, and havo beon stored, whilo every succeeding week has found the market less open to óperiu ions. Speculation has been shunned by tho moro prudent, becauso of the impossibility of foreseeing the ' supplies that were to come. . What littlo lins arisen has been, in too many ' instances, feverish and unsound. Mercantile houses luve required largo advances, in order to enablo them to hold the merchandise consigned to them. Tho buyers havo had the command, and the credit system has been fostered by the strong temptation to quit goods at a price showing anything uko ii profit on the transaction. Every reaction has been- checked by the succeeding mail's advices of shipments on tho way ; and amidst all this,i competition has been too keen, expenses too ' heavy, and pro- fits too small. Rents, which have given way everywhere else, havo boon maintained in the business part of the city. Goo'd1 situations havo always been eagerly taken up, the crowded con- dition of all branches of'trade notwithstanding. The great speculation of tho year has proved a present failure, whatever tho ultimate result may be. In May last, when only one,mining company was beföro the public, we ventured to predict that such would, be tho case. In our share list of to- day, the names of 46 companies are to be found. The cause of tho fuilure'may bo traced directly to the spirit of spéculation raised by tho 'BUCCCSS m'a share-jobbing view I of the Victoria Life aud General Insurance' Company and Sa- vings Institute. This scheme I was introduced into the market by whispers, and on the first day of the share-list being oponed a rush was estab- lished, until-tho projector, w ho at tho time occu- pied the honourable position of Commissioner of Trado andl Customs, with a seat in the Cibinot, 'suddenly closed the doors against further applications by taking np 20,000 shares himself, add declaring their prieo at 100 per cent, premium. Share jobbing became the order of the day beforo oven-the prospectus of the Institute was published ; ,apd largo sums (on paper) wcie apparently mado in a few hours. On this occasion a protest,was entered by this journal, in .the following words :-"The com- mercial charactor of the colony is just now on the eve - of undergoing' an ordeal of no common kind. In order 'to keep up tho pro- duction of our most valuable staple expoit, tho aid of capital is about to be asked. Small joint- stack companies w ill bo springing up in a few months on every auriferous creek, roof, flat, and gully in the colony. Much will depend on the Btraighlforwaidness and honesty with which theso companies aro placed before tho public. If they uro to lead tho small capitalist into a vol tax of stock- jobbing, thoy will bo the means of w orking incalculable injury to the future of tho colony. If they lead to the iurcMmcnv of the spwo savings 'of all classes in legitimate enterprise, they will be the means of enriching the entire community, and of aiding in tho establishment of the character of the colony on a firm bas'iB. With Buch an ordeal in prospect, it is much to bo re- gretted ¿hat a Minister of the Crown should have laid himself open to the charge of encouraging that kiiul of speculation whose aim and end is obtained by tho mera buying and selling of scrip." The history of the joint-stock mining companies in our list has proved that a stronger protest was required. _ Scrip was in nearly lovery casa sale- able, ' a,t its issuej'at án"'immense ' premium. Everybody joined .in the scramble until calls were made and money became tight,' and everybody Bought to realise. A ¡comparison be- tween- the pi-iccB ruling for shares in these under- takings , now and six months ago will show the consequence. It is to bo feared that jthis stock- jobbing spirit is only allayed for a time; jthat its greatest injury to the gold mining interest ¡\ miins to bo done when the Hist fruits of legitimate enterprise find their way to Melbourne. , ' The revenue statements for the year and quarter ending the 31st December, 1859, have boon issued from the Government printing-office. A digest of theso and of the ex- penditure for the quartor will' bo found in another column. The rovonuo proper for the year 1839 amounted to £3,257,724 (omitting fractions) against £3,039,791 for 1838, showing an increase of £217,932 on tho year. The rovenuo for the quartor amounted to £818,320, against £U0G,859 for the corresponding quarter of lfa58, shqwing a decreaso of £88,539. Taking the returns tor the years, wo find somo very marked fluctuations. In the Customs Department thero is a not de- crease of £55,259." In' the following import duties an increase is shown :-'Beer, £8,574 ; tobacco, £19,234; cigars, £3,185; tea, £4,4G3; opium, £8,223. In the item of spirits there is a decroaso ' of no less than £42,340 ; in i wine, £612; coffee, £1,303; sugar and molasses, £10,656. In the export duty on gold, thero is a falling off of £34,027. In the revenuo derived from the gold-fields .department, thoro ia h total decroaso of £2,049. ' In the proceeds of salo of Crown lands, there is an,increaso of ,£116,074. Under tho head of licence, wo find. an increase of £22,958 in the assessment on stock, _c, £4,225 in publicans' licences, £1,556 in Whole- sale spirit licences, nnd a net increaso of £3/103 on other licences;. The post-office department ex- hibits an increaso of £11,674. In fees, fines, and forfeitures, the two periods very nearly balança each other. In the miscellaneous items, tho railway revenue, amounting to £6Gjl93,' stands as an increase, thero not having been any traffic in' tho previous year, Thero Í3 an increaso Hi the passcnger-rato of £23,442; in the1 electric' tele- graph, department of £10,715. The increaso or decreaso in other items is unimportant. ' Tho decrease in the Customs rovonuo is a matter calling for somo inquiry. 'If that on the ¡spirit duties, amounting| to £42,340, may bo taken as ovidenco 'of "a settled and' voluntary improve- ment in the habits of tlio population, it is a matter of congratulation1; but if.it must be construed to- represent a forced « abstinence, brought about by the pressilro of the ¡times and a decreased nbility to purchase, luxuries, it Will require serious consideration, A Uko falling off ÍB noticeable^ in the 'quarter s roturns. ' In tho item of spirits there is a decreaso of £19,950, in wiuo £4,519, in' beor'and cider £4,314,, and in.sugar of £3,878. There is an increasoin tobacco of £7,019, in tea ofl £1,484, and in opium i of £2,245, . The foiling oft'iñ'tlio export duty on ' gold'us slated at I £16,271, The chief item of decreaso in tho quarter's revenue is 'in ' the; pío-' ceoäs of tbo sale of Crown' lands, which yielded £270,976 during die Jost I quarter1 of 1858, and only £187,415 during the last quarter of 1859. The: imports'ofl specie jdurim,' the past year amounted, to -£442,893, and-the exports to, £1,287«,390. Duritfc the year 1858 tho totals 'Wore -.-Imported, £553,933r;'exported, £604,162.

' The'prospects of the year 1S60 aro'no1 bright. The heavy weight of stocks- enough for a year's consumption-lias rendered its opening a most uni ronusing ono. With moi o f roquent auf. readier communication with England, much may bo done to render it a more prohtnblo one than ' its rirideoe&sor.; _ The puisuit of gold-mining is giadually becoming a moie settled and less ex oitinï occupation.

The contract for the " row" was taken by Mr. Holton, and is to cost ¡£3,100-a less sum than if bluestone had been used in thoir construction j besides which, their appearance will be moro ornamental than it would have been had that material been selected. THE PAss-jraEK ACT.-A Mr. William Tiibo was summoned before Lieutenant Crawford, P.M., at Williamstown, on January 4, to answer the complaint of 34 persons, for whom ho lind undertaken to próvido passages for San Fran- cisco by tho ship Pierre. from tlio ovidonco it appeared that the dofondant lind chartered ibis vessel for tho sum of 1.020, bnt hod only paid £-168 on account, and hod at tho snmo time put 60 passengers on boord, from whom ho had received pnssnso-monoy amounting to £G00.

THE SUBJECT OF TUE REMOVAL OP THE LAW COURTS was revived on tho 7th inst. by a* depu- tation from tho Chamber of Commerce waiving on tho Cliief Secretary, to- urgo upon the Govern- ment the desirability of such a proceeding. Mr. Nicholson acquiesced in their opinion, but stated that though the Government had effected a reduc- tion of £300,000 in the Estimates of thoir pre- decessors, the expenditure required for now law courts was too considerable to be undertaken in tho present aspect of'affairs. Tho site to which it was desired to transfer the law courts was thro of tho proposed Western Market, and Mr. Si P. Lord, ono of the deputation, said that, in the face of the refusal of tho Corporation to give up tho ground, ho should considor the Government were quito entitled to exorcise its prorogative in re- suming possession. The deputation retired, wijlji tlio understanding that the Government declined for the presont to interfere in tlio mottor. GEODETIC SUUVET.-It will bo seen by the followim; that the long-talked of geodetic aurvoy hos been initiated. The' paragraph is extracted from tho Geelong advertiser of January 7 : " IBs Excellency the Governor, accompanied b tho Chief Secretary, the President of Land and-' Works, tho Postmaster- Goncrnl, Captain Pasley,, tho Survoyor-Goneral, and several othor gontlo men, proceeded by tho 12".45 train to Wyndham, for tho purpose of iixinp? a datum or starting point for tile commencement of the geodetic Burvov. The company left the train at the Sur- veyor's Camp, about a milo on this sido of the Werribee, whero the initiatory rite was per- formed, as wo beliovo im a most satisfactory manner. Ills .Excellency and party returned to Melbourne by tho last traini" MAJOR-G-WiRA- PRAirr, tho now Com monder-in-Chiof of the Australian eolonios,. landed at Sandridgo on January 9, in the bargo of II.3I.C.S.

Snip BUBNED IN BOESON'S BAY.-Tho American ship Marilla, which arrived in Hob son's Boy, from New York, on the 25th ult., with a cargo ehiotty composed of lumber, woo-. discovered to>bo on lire shortly after midnight; on the morning of the 31st, omi although tlio alarm was at onco giveni and ovory endeavour made to savo her hy thoso belonging to tho vessel, tho authorities, and1 several captains and other parties, connected with various ships in the Boy, it was vvithouti suoeess. Tho Marilla wo» towed away from amongst; tho shipping, and left at about a milo'fi distance from the St. Kilda. 'leach. She continued to burnjilurhig all that* day, and the Rreater.portion of her cargo floated out of her on the ensuing night, partially con- sumed. Steps wero at once takon to prevent-it drifting amongst the shipping, mid most of it went ashore on tho beaoln MELHOFUNTÎ- CUSTOM IIoubE.-The Long Room, Custom-house, will, when finished, be 88 foet in lfcnglh by 55. in broodtli, and 30 feet high. It is nt-present only 32 feet wide, as it is intended to complete a pot tion of it f or tem- porary uso. Tito roof- and one sido aro also only temporarily completed. Tlio pavement will bo of marble, which is daily expected to crrivo from England. Tho floor is now a mui of dtbrit and rubbish, and as tho interior ¡3- in a very unfinished state tho scaffoldings remain. Along the north and south sides »vro to -lie lu Ionio lj'llnrs, fcight only of which oro yet built. Those will add finishi and character to tho hall, and impart to it, at tho same timo, a light anti airy appearance. Tlio columns aro built, but rest upon pedestal», of stono. Tho designs woro prepared in tho Public AVorks Department, and tho contractors are- Messrs. Foi time nnd Glynn. At the west-end an entronco leads into a fmo lobby, 33 feet squoro, ascending from which is a flight of bluestono hanging stops, 10'foot long, resting upon columns of bluestono o£t the most substantial character, and affording;» splendid specimen of masonry. The npartmonrs abovo tho hall oro at present occupied by tlio Commissioner of Customs anti his immediate »taff and tho Comptroller of Accounts. Tho rooms and corri- dors are largo and ndmirabl/ ventilated, and from tlio solidity of their structura nnU'inotcriols will maintain within thom a cool atmosphère oven on tho hottes!/days. Tlio building ¡s.oxpqctcd, when finished, to. suffico for the transaction of the business of the colony for many years to como. THE ADDII'ION TO THE PAI__AH_N T IIOUSES is now approaching completion., for moro than nine months havo tlio works been carried on, and; in throo months moro the portion in question willi bo completed. Of its effect iii contrast with the unornamonted mass of bluestono, variegated with brick, which constitutes tho ©thor portions of the Houses, we will say nothing-, for tlio comparison is more than ordinarily odious. The latest addi- tion being the only Boction,of tho ontiro building which will bo actually completod according to-the terms of the original design, nearly accomplished a« tho.work io, still presents nu unfinished ap- pearance. Thoso who.aro in tho habit of passing the locality daily have- soon tho base, and thon tho first story with tho fluted columns u.front, gradually rising ; but, until tho plans are_ con- sulted, but a vory small idea of oven a portion of tho building con bo obtained. Only tho other story remains to bo erected ; and until the ugly scaffolding is removed, it is bettor bo leave the imagination full1 room for action than to give a necessarily incomploto notion thereof. Of the interior, though moro incomplete, a hotter ¡dca con bo given. Tho lower story in to bo devoted to culinary purposes, and above thnt is the lower part of tho library, which willbonmost hand Bomo room. The dimensions of the main body of tho latter will bo about 6_ feot by 42 feot, whilo the lower part will include oven moro Bpoco than this. Surmounting the wholo, anti sup- ported, by pillars disposed aftor a somewhat similar fashion to thoso in tho Publie Library, will bo a gallery ; and, abovo all, rises a doma of panelled glass, through whioh a subdued light will pass to the hall below. To keep the room cool, the sun is prevented from boating on the dome oxeept through a Rhylight. This plan has beon pursued in tlio lighting of the Legislativo Chambers with tho best effect. On tho same story as the gallery, tea and dining rooms aro situated, which oro communicated with, by tho handsome circular staircase which rise» on each end of the library. The columns iiiBide the library woro first intended to bo constructed of iron, but brick is now substituted, which will bo plastorcd over to represent proper Corinthian pillars. The wholo is after tho Doric stylo of architecture, and constructed of Darloy freostouo. The total cost of the addition was originally intended to bo £34,000, but tho extra work will cause n trilling excess over that amount. ARRIVAL OF GAME FROM ENGLAND.-The game shipped by the Lightning for Mr. Thomas Austin, of Barwon Park, was landed on the even- ing of December 20 on the wharf at Geelong. One partridge died on the way from Melbourne. There are now left 56 partridges, four hares, and 26 wild rabbits, all apparently in good health. They were forwarded on the following day to their destination. Tn_ VICTORIAN PUBLIC LIIUIAKY is an in- stitution of a noturo that suggests quietness and reposo, and during tho few month» that have elapsod since our last official visit this character has boon so well sustained that hut fow alterations havo taken placo.

' A ISEMABKABLY GALSANT ACTION Vlas n«iv formed on tho 4th, at tho junction of Collin» «¡A Swanston ¡.trcots. A horso had taken fright ami run n-way with a dog-cart, in which a littlo bov of nbout nino or ton years of age, was situ's. The lad screamed with terror ; and it was or pected" that an accident would result from tho' moro thus probablo collision with the fountain. At tho very crisis of the danger, n man pas5m. by ran after tho horso, ronuhed it, and coticht hold of the shaft of tho dog-cart, by which ho hutigfor re few seconds. Whilo tin» fixed, «it thi imminent peril of his lifo, he managed to catch hold of the reins, turn the horse's hoad and gradually pull him up, without any injury boil» done. An enthusiastic spectator offered thom!» (whoso name was John Weir) a handful of silver which ho refused, and quickly loft the spot. ' SNAKE KILLING.—Another exhibition of the skill of the mongoose in killing snakes took place in tho Hippodrome on the 24th ult. The snakes were all large, in full vigour, and most tenacious of life. The instinct of the mongoose was displayed immediately upon being placed in view of their quarry. Without a moment's hesi- tation, they each made for their respective snake's head, fastened at once, and spite of all the writhings and convolutions of the reptiles, main- tained their grip until they had annihilated the power of using the poison fangs. Some unbe- lievers amongst the spectators ventured to im- pugn the venomous properties of the snakes, which were then and there removed, examined before witnesses, and found not wanting. One gentleman took a handfull of them home with him, but whether for culinary or scientific pur- poses it was not stated. The relentless hatred borne by the mongoose to the snake was admira- bly exemplified when the dead reptiles were re- moved. Both the ichneumons followed the man who took them away, and sat up with nose erect and ears pricked, for some time, in expectancy of another feast. Neither of the little creatures was the least hurt, although between them six or eight venomous snakes were destroyed. AN INTEUE STING LKCTUKE was gi von hy Mr. Michio, M.L.A., on tho 19th December, to cele- brate the inauguration of the St. Kilda Jloehauies' Institute. Tho hall, which adjoiiiB that built by tlie Government, is a very flue room, ami filled as it Was with a largo assembly, including many ladies, appeared to great advantage. The subject selected by. Ml«. Michio was, " Colonist» Socially, and in their Eolations witli the Mother Country ?" and thero n» fow gentlemen who could have so-ably handled it as tho learned lec- turer, he having, been a closo obsorver oí the various phase» ot colonial lifo forsovcral years. FESTIVAL O. SOIIOOL CHILDREN-.-The Exr hibition Building.on December 31, at noon, pre- sented a very gay, and animated appearance. About one thousand children, from tho different schools in and near Melbourne under the Deno- minational Uonrd of Education, wore assembled in'holiday trim, the occasion boing their annual musical fostivitltand'cxhibitioii of drawings. Tho parents and Monds of tina children attended in great numbersj.ond.nearly fillod the body off the building, at. tho western end of which, upou a raised platforai) .woro several rows of reserved seats, ocçupiod.by the moro fashionable clous of visitors. The galleries woro also crammed vi ith lookers on, and the children must have beca delighted at suoli an opportunity of displaying their acquirements ; nor wero the audlonco (miscellaneous) disappointed with the faro sot beforo them. Tho progrnmmo, although rather long, contained a tasteful selection of songs.and choruses, particularly adapted to tho agu and voices of tho performers ; and tho children, ¡edby Mr. Allan, and« with the assistance of «¡piano accompaniment, acquitted themselves very cre- ditably. At tho conclusion of the hinging, Mr. Justice Poülman addressed the children,, and at tho close of-his remarks, said ho was ghtd-to bo able to stato, from a return just handed. to hini. that of the 31)710 scholars in the Denominational Schools noi leas tliau 9,852, or nearly one-third of the wholo number, belonged to tins singing classes, and. 4,201 wero also membeis of tho drawing classes.
