STATE BUDGET. TREASURER'S STATEMENT. A SURPLUS OF £526,984. In the Legislative Assembly, on Tues- day afternoon the State Treasurer (.Mr Bent) delivered his Budget Speech. Mr Bent, who was cordially gieeted, said that the total revenue for last year, excluding raim.j=, L3, 900,537, or L131.167 more than he estiniai ed on the 11th of Oc tober, last year. RAILWAY SURPLUS. Turning to the railway accounts, he said that the gross revenue paid by "our great trading department" into the Trea sury was L", 621, 051, or L171.051 in excess of the estimate. The railway expendi ture "was LI. 933.708. or a saving of L3897. H'1 thought that the mere fact that L171.051 over and above the estimate was named with a saving of L3S97 spoke more forcibly than any words he could use. The Commissioners closed their financial year in the Treasury books with a surplus of L41.629. It hod been said that he (the Trea surer) should thank Providence for such satisfactory results. So he did thank Him for bountiful rains and propitious seasons, but he also desired to give cre dit to those whose management and foresight had, taking advantage of such favorable circumstances, brought out such beneficial results (Hear, hear). THE ACCUMULATED DEFICIT. The Treasurer next directed the atten tion of honorable members to the fact that the Consolidated Revenue accumulated deficit on the 30th of June was LI, 959, 119. Slowly, but surely, he observed, the State was proceeding in the right direction in having madci a reduction of L237,000. To the accumu lated deficit must be added the amount at debit of the Land Sales by Auction Fund, viz., L267,490. Since 1893 that debit had been reduced to the extent of L23u,327. When he wast in a posi tion to place on the market the land that had been so largely benefited by the fund, he hoped to largely reduce the present deficit, if not wipe it out alto gether. LAST YEAR'S SURPLUS. Summing up the result of last year's transactions, Mr Bent shelved that the total surplus was L526.984, or L18.867 more than was appropriated in the Sur plus Revenue Act passed a few weeks ago. The LIS, 867, therefore, remained to be dealt with as Parliament might di rect. CURRENT YEAR'S ESTIMATES. Hon. members' attention was then invited to the estimates for the current year. On accounts exclusive of j-ail- ways, Mr Bent said that he expected 'a surplus of L6S.424, but as the Railways Commissioners anticipated a deficit In their Department of L56.187, that would reduce the estimated surplus to L12.327, How, then, could he reduce taxation? It might he said that it was preposterous to talk of a deficiency at the railways for the current year, but he gave the estimate, he stated, as fur nished by the Commissioners. Mr Tait looked for a gross revenue of L3, 500,000, or L121.051 less than last year, explain ing that the Commissioners had in an ticipation, should the prospects of the harvest continue to be favorable, the giving of concessions in freights and fares during the latter half of the year. That would, to some extent, account for the reduced estimate in the receipts. SOURCES OF REVENUE. In calling attention to the sources of re venue, Mr Bent laid stress cn the fact that the amount expected from the Com monwealth, LI, 907, 914, would be L109.464 less than was received last financial year. In State excise and inland revenue he expected a falling off this year of L33.000, and Mr Prout Webb calculated that the income tax would yield L17.000 less. That would be oartly accounted for by the de cision of the Cabinet that mining divi dends should be taxed only once. CROWN TENANTS' PAYMENTS. Continuing to deal with sources of re venue, Mr Bent slated that the Minister of Lands reckoned that L120,000 less than last year would be received from Crown tenants. He hastened to explain the rea son of this large expected decrease. Pressure had been brought to boar on selectors last year, and the year before, with the result that arrears which on the SOtli of Juno, 1903, stood at L3G5.418, had been reduced cn the 30th of June last to L117,393. In getting in so much money he assured the department had not dealt harshly with the tenants. Mining members would, he supposed, be interested to hear that there would be a reduction from L40G0 to L1500 in the receipts from royalties under the Cyan ide Patents Purchase Act, As the L20.000 paid for the patent rights would, after the receipt of the L1500 have been reach ed, there would no longer be any cyanide royalties exacted. ESTIMATES SUMMARISED. Summarising the figures for the cur- ' rent year, Mr Bent said that, with three large decreases— as compared with last year — of L110.000 in Commonwealth re venue, of L120,000 in territorial pay ments, and of L1Q9.000 In railway re ceipts — L339.000 in all— hon. members would understand why he brought down a total estimate of L7, 145, 753 or L74.000 ; less than the estimate of last year, and L363.904 less than the actual receipts for 1904-5. MUNICIPAL SUBSIDY. The municipal subsidy, would remain .at L50.000, and a .Bill would.be intro duced to fix it acordingly. LOCAL OPTION. Dealing with the question of amr ending the local option clauses of the Licensing Act, Mr Bent said that when the proper time arrived the Minis try would bring in a bill on business lines, the proper time arrived the Ministry would bring in a bill on business lines, a bill that would be in accordance with what was right between man and man, and which would not be based cn any hare-brained schemes. SERVICE INCREMENTS. The salaries shown in the estimates had been increased, Mr Bent showed, by L14.132 as compared with last year. Of that sum L12.296 would be required for increments, L4455 having been already sanctioned, and the balance, if recom mended, would probably be sanctioned from the 1st of January next. OTHER VOTES. For works and buildings, Mr Bent stated that L139.965 had been set apart, or L21.952 more than last year. Included in the vote was L30.000 for the building and repair of State schools, in addition to the large sums already voted in the Surplus Revenue Act. The money, he was assured, was urgently required, and would result in a saving of rent. Mention of the State schools caused Mr Bent to remind the House that there was a movement in progress to reorgan ise and extend agricultural education in the State. For the "furtherance of the mining in dustry," Mr Bent next told the House, L14.820 had been provided, in addition to the L13.000 in the Surplus Revenue Act. THE PUBLIC DEBT. Passing on to the State's indebted ness the Treasurer said that .the Public Funded debt on the 30th of June was L51.763.766 — a reduction of L56.193, as compared with a year before. Having stated that the Interest bill for the current year would be LI, 866,325, Mr Bent remarked that that total did not include the Interest on any further bor rowings during the year. LAND SETTLEMENT. The last important subject dealt with by Mr Bent was land settlement. It was his intention, he said, to introduce a Bill this session providing for estab lishing and controlling small improved holdings of land. The Bill, he explained, ' would be chiefly founded on the Danish system, and under it probationary ten ants would receive assistance, under su pervision, until the land was sufficiently improved to become self-supporting. He expressed the opinion that the Closer Settlement Board had done good 'work, and that it had been unfairly cri ticised by the Press. Should there be any . lack of applicants for closer settlement land, the Government might have, he said, to con sider the advisability of placing some of the land at the disposal of In tending emigrants In England. Should that be done, he thought that a recom mendation of the Closer Settlement Board, to make provision for a home stead and necessary fencing, was well worth considering. IMMIGRATION. Referring next to immigration, Mr Bent observed that some of its advocates looked at the question from a selfish point of view, and some only from sym pathy and consideration of our kindred at home. He was actuated by both feel ings, hut he could assure the House he would not go in for any haphazard scheme of immigration. SUPPLY BILL. A Supply Bill for two months was passed, and the House rose for the day.
