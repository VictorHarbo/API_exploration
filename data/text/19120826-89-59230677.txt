Tim snosrt tYlrd-ardiaary feature was the high j-aijc of both butter aod cheese wJ-ethn :iiey were Lome made or'irjiported. It is juaaiasaiy to jjo back to 1870 and 1877 before iimling a parallel -for the year's ngjures. Jn thtwa years the ofiici-l quotation of Danish butter avorasi'd 123 kroner (138, 4) and L'o Icroner (140/7). while ior the year ended on Jane 30 the average was 110 kronfi 1123/9). r_e records of 1876 and 1877 dif fered from the past year, inasmuch as tliej occurred at a uime when' extroordimiry high jirices prevailed, while tile quototkus for tJic 12 months just encied were phenomen ally higher than -in auy immediately preced in; year.

It was an opportumty U»at is not likely to occur again for a lifctini..'' The average price of choicest Australian salted butter in 1911-12 was 121/9 per cwt., against J05/ in 1910-11; 111/9 ia 19(«-10; K6/9 in 1908-9; arid 111/10 in 1907-$. In reviewin^'prospects Weddel's reniarks:— 'Xohnthstanding the large in crease in the consumption of margarine and the many strikes that have arisen' in the past year, it is anticipated that the demand tor b'utter aud cheese will be well main tained during the coming season. Trade in general aud employment in all indus tries show no .-ijnis of retiring from their present strong jiositions. Ainid so many ccailietir.£ conditions it is difficult to maie any reliable forecast, but a survey of the world's poHtion of butter and cheese leads to tlie conclusion that prieqs of both articles will be much beiow those of 15)11-12. bur above the average of, the preccdiuj; four yeats. / — Ca- nadi's Dairj' Exports.— J_wt week it was cabled from Ottawa thut liiruivs published by the Department of lrude and Commerce indicate that Canada's exjwrts of butter and cheese aro dwindling to nothing, and that -New Zea land is securinj; the British market and Qisplacinji Quadii. The department ex plains that Canada's sreat increase in XJpulation requires all local supplies, and leaves noihinsr for export. A|)ropos of this it is notewonhy that 10 years ajjo the importation of Canadian butter into the Inited Kin«dom totalled 13,000 tons, while in the 1SH0-11 scjisou only 770 tons was received. Fur the 1911-12 season, im ports grew tu 3.000 tons, but it was only bi'caust- n! ilnj excussivejy high prices rulins that this niciv;u-e ^-cura'd. As a matter ot fact. Canada orerohipped, and ia tlic winter h;ul to import Austrahan and New Zealand butter in large quantities at higher prices than had been obtained for her own exports to lii cut Britain. Weddel's Re view states that on the London market, for the year ended with June. Canadian butter was not once in sufficient supply' to .spt-ure an official quotation. In recent years Canadian butter has been imported into I j real liritain. mainly for cold stor Hi3 to supply winter raiuirements. In the ftitiin* these requirements will have to )c filled from Australia aud New Zealand by fresh landed goods. This will be an ad vantage- to the Loudon trade, as well as to the Commonwealth, and the Dominion of New Zealand, fur however well the butter mav keep in cold store, it is not so palate able .is when it is freshly made, and there is likely to lie an increasing demand for the better article. Of course last season's experts fioni Australia suffered by reason of dry condition;!, but even so, the totals make a .-ijriiih'cant showins in comparison with NY iv Zealand's and Canada's exports.

XS.U77 1O,1S3 '2,!W7 Sti far as cheese is concerned Weddel's note thiti Canada. is increa.-injr in popula tion so rapidly that it cant-ot keep up the supply of cheese to its home population and at the same time continue to export to tile Utiitpd Kiujjdom. This development in Canada is bringing prosperity to New Zealruid. wiiicii is prppariiiR to take over the business which Canada year by year is less and less able to earry.pn,. In the past 10 years Canadian, imports have fallen off by lo.lXH) tons, while -Now .Zealand im ports have increased to the extent, of 22.0JO tons. Tiie statements made in Canada by those who know the cheejse trade there, that C-Hiiada will cease tff. export by the year 1910, though of an alarniM character, may have some foundation, in view of the enormous rate of increase in her popida tion. mostly by immigration.

Cangda lies so close to the over-populated countn'o of Europe, and the means of ac cess to her boundless areas of fertile soil are so nhenp, that the Btreani of immigra tion will most probably steadily increase in volume, and the declining years of .her export trade come juueh carUer than, now Eccms jirobable. —Sqlraoa Piices— Contr.jiy to general expectations, ^he opening (iiiotations for red Alaska salmon received from the Alaska .Packers' As sociation are 1/ pyr dozen b_lo.w last year's price. Anlifipationswere that an advance would )jc made in keeping with the higher British Columbia prices, lu view of the Irop jrnod orders have ben cabled from Australia^ for Alaskan fish: The question on which' trade attention is centred at present is whether the British Columbia canners are likely, to reduce prices, owing to the very wide difference betweeu Alaska ajul/Briti-h Columbia prices' this reason, t is lmderstood that sarong representa tions (o this effect have already been made it hfinjj feared that unusually lane diffe^ reme will materially affect future busi ness in British (Xrlinnbia fish, besides im mediately aifcctinjr consumption. Takinp ast yeiu's rates as a basis for comparison there is this season a margin of 9/ to 0/C per case betweeu the prices for British Columbia and red Alaska fish. Discussing the positionj Tho Age remarked:— ''Local importers were utterlv unable to of fer any adequate, explanation of Dais un precedented fluctuation. It was regarded as possible — although not necessarily prob able— that the drop hi red Alaska rates miiht be part of a tactical battle between the lar^e con-^rns affiliated with the Alaska Packers Association and organiza tions which in a s-mall way arc threaten ing trade rivalry, the motive suggested be im lo Scare off competitors.
