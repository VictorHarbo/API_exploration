Kick off at 3 o'clock sharp, This seamen's missionary, Mr. Hounslow, informs us (V. A. Register of 2nd instant that he found on Thursday night on the wharves, hungry, homeless, and friendless, a party of immigrants by the steamer Port Adelaide. The party comprised five Arabs, their wives, and two children, 'They came from Port Said, and were possessed of only a few shillings amongst them. None of them could speak English. With difficulty a Greek was found, who discovered that amongst the Arabs was one who knew a little of Greek. By this means the party was understood to say that they had lived at Port Said, and having been burnt out by a fire, emigrated to " Australia," of which they had heard. One of them had just enough money to pay for a deck passage on the steamer to Australia.'' They thought they would be landed at Sydney, though what they would do there they had but little idea. However, the captain landed them at the first port of call. It is said the deck passage cost them £2 a head, and they slept on deck during the passage. The Arabs bcviu able only to drive camels. After about two hours' search, a house of about three rooms was the only place which could be procured for them, and it is far too small for so many persons-twelve in all. During the night one of the women was ill with some heart complaint, although the party appears to have enjoyed good health during the voyage. Dr. Toll, the medical officer to the destitute, visited the woman and prescribed for her. The curiosity of persons in the locality is so great that a policeman has been sent up to keep the throng away. The immediate question is, What shall be done with them ? They cannot be allowed to want the absolute necessaries of life, and the Government will probably find them thrown on their hands. Then the more important question arises, What assurance is there that other steamers may not bring further consignments of destitute immigrants ? as this appears to be one of our privileges as the first port of call. The Destitute Asylum authorities sent an officer down Friday afternoon to investigate the case, and he ordered the Government storekeeper to issue them a dozen loaves of bread per diem. Meanwhile the sick woman has been sent to the Port Casualty Hospital, where with proper treatment it is expected that she will speedily become convalescent. A report will be laid before the Chief Secretary to-day and some decision will be arrived at respecting the future of the party. It has been suggested that a tent should be erected on the Park Lands until something definite is done for them. We understand that neither in Melbourne nor Sydney could such a party be landed without a bond he::):' entered into that they were not destitute persons.
