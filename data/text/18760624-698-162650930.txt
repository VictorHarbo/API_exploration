May, the City of Panama (s.) while aporoaching the Company's Dock collided -with the Zealandia (s.) . The blow crushed through the plating and inner fastenings of the Zealandia, making an aperture of serious dimensions which admitted the water freely. In a moment after its occurrence our whole force beaded by oin- superintendent and assisted by the com mander, officers, and crew of the Zealandia commenced work and very soon had the noble vessel relieved from all imme diate peril. 1'hc next morning our own workmen, directed by our superintendent of hulls end machinery, under the eye of the captain, Ferries, commenced work, removed every piece of plating and iron of every description which had been damaged in the slightest degree. All the injury done by that collision hat* bnen carefully, soundly, and thoroughly repaired, and to-morrow the Zealandia will proceed to sea (24th) as staunch and perfect in every regard as if the collision had never happened.' Ship Launch at Sovth Buiklds.— On Thursday, the 20th April, there was launched irom the iron yard of Mr. I. E. Ethingham a line iron paddle steamer of. the following dimen sions—length, 120 feet; breadth, 20 feet: depth, 10 feet 6 inches ; and is built to the order of Captain Hcsclton, of Whitby. Her engines arc by Messrs. Rcnnaldeqn and Son, South Shields, and are on the (surface condensing disconnecting principle, two multitubular boilers to cany 40 lbs. steam, and 80 horse-power. She has patent wheels and tteam windlass, and fitted with all the latest improvements for a first-class steamer for the towing and passenger trades. She has been built under the inspection of Lloyd's and Board of Trade Surveyor*, and is of the Al clw. The christening ceremony was performed by Mrs. Heselton, and the vesEel was named the Francis Hixeon. *he will ran her trial trip about the SOth May, and then dismantle and stow everything away into her holds, and be rigged into a three-masted sailing schooner to sail out to Sydney, New South Wales, where she is intended to run in the abovenamed trades. LAUNCH OF MURRAY RIVER STEAMER. — The correspondent of the Argus telegraphed from Echuca on the 12th instant :— To-day was launched from the south bank of the Murray the largest craft ever yet built for the river trade. The boat is owned by Messrs. W. McCulloch and Co., and has been built by Mr. William Wilson, of Moama, under the direction of Mr. Robert Leys. Her carrying capability is 200 tons, including engines. She is con- structed of picked red gum; she measures 115 feet in length, with a beam of 22 feet 6 inches, and depth of hold 8 feet. Messrs. Roberts and Sons, of Sandhurst, are to immediately fit her with engines of 100-horse power. The launch was made the occasion of quite a gathering of the most influential of the townspeople. The christening ceremony of the Ethel Jackson was gracefully performed by Miss Fehon, a daughter of one of the members of the firm, and everything went off as well as could be desired. In the course of the speeches made on the occasion a strong hope was expressed that this extension of the shipbuilding industry at Echuca would lead to still greater results in the shape of the con- struction of seagoing vessels. The new boat, with her barge of 300 tons burthen, will be capable of conveying to Echuca a cargo of not less than 2000 bales of wool. The S. and A. R. M.S. Brisbane, Captain R. Balfour, arrived at Sydney Heads at l^OJp m. on June 21; she left Hongkong at 4.80 p.m. on 20th ultimo, with the wind from the £ and N.E. for the first twenty-four hours and thick weather, after that strong S.W. monsoons until arrival at Singapore, at which port she arrived at 5.80 p.m. on 2Gtb ultimo ; left again with the English mails and passengers on 29th, at 6.40 a.m. ; experienced very strong easterly monsoons until arrival at Somerset, and fresh S.E. winds as far as Townsville; sailed from Somerset at 6 p.m. on 9th instant; arrived at Cooktown at 12.20 p.m. on Hth; left again at 2.10 p.m. on 12th; arrived at Townsville next day at 4.45 p.m., sailed at 12.20 p.m. on Uth, arrived at Bo wen at 11 a.m., left at 5.45 p.m., arrived at Kcppel Buy at 9 p.m. on 15th, ?sailed at 11 p.m. ; arrived at Morcton Bay at 9 a m. ou 17th, left the toL'owing day at 3.15 p.m., brought up at the Heads at 5 p.m. in consequence of a hard blow from the southward; got under -way at' 10.30 a.m. on -9th: wind S.S.K. strong -with drilling rain and heavy sea ; midnight, breeze moderated, but the weather still continued thick, and the wind flying about from S.E, to E. and back to south' pasted Smoky Cape at 5.10 p.m. on 20th, and arrived as above.

The Bcbnixg op the St. Ratha-x and Rescue oftiii; Cfcirw. — The following is an extract from a letter from a lady passeiiger by the ship Yorkshire, from Melbourne, bound to London, re specting the saving of the crew of the ship St. Raphael, burnt at sea :— ' And now 1 am going to tell you the sad story of the ship wrecked crew that we were fortunate enough to pick up and save on the 3l6t January, when we rounded the Horn. Their ship, the San Raphael, was burnt at sea, and when we found them it was twenty-seven day6 since they had left her. Early in the morning the captain of tfce Yorkshire was signalling the John Bnthie when he noticed something on the horixon. On taking his glass he saw at once that it was a boat ; so we began to heave to. The John Duthie began to do the same; but when they saw we were doing it, they sailed on. Whether thev saw the boat, of course, we do not know, but at all events they might have waited to tec what -was the matter, or if they could lend any assistance. I then heard there was a. boat coming to the ship, and, standing at the cuddy door, saw the men being helped over the main deck. They looked fearful, such poor wretched creatures, their arms all covered with frost-boils, their teeth chattering, and shaking all over as if they had the ague. There were six sailors and the first mate, Mr. Kilgour. Just as they came on board we heard a second boat was coming to us, with five men in her. They were got on board safely. The men were so weak that they fell back into the boat as they were trying to get on the ship. Their feet -were all frost-bitten. One poor fellow's sufferings were dreadful. The doctor had to amputate both bis great toes. He was ill for a long time, but you now see him shuffling along tLc titck. Tbcy suffered very much when circulation was 'return ing. It was one of the saddest sights I ever saw. The poor I fellows wept like children directly they came on board/and I ? God bices you all ' was their first exclamation. They all I lived, and are now on a fairway to recovery, but the doctor I t a-v6 they will all be rheumatic They say their feet feel quite I dead, and it is now two months since they were picked up it I was twenty- seven days since they had abandoned their ship. I She was a larger one than ours, bound for Valparaiso I with a cargo of coal. They had most tempestuous weather, and, I of course, they had to round the Horn where the winds are I nearly always contrary. So they had been out a good deal over I 100 davs. 'Mr. Kilgour told me it was SOu days since he sailed I from Liverpool, and that, of course, everybody would £ive them I up for lost. ? The vessel took fire when they were near the Horn ; I spontaneous combustion. The hatches blew up. They dis- I covered the lire three days before they left the rtriD, and made all I necessary arrangements. The captain and his wile were in the I longboat with nine others, and they had all the provision s, charts,. I andcomcas&es; put in her, intending all to keep tosataer. But I the captain, who used to drink, became so disagreeab o that tbe I first and second mates, -who each had charge of the othei I boats, agreed to part ? from him. ' He then fr-ivc tii«in ae 1 much provisions as he deemed sufficient, but tccping I the lion's share for Himself. They had only enough to I allow each man 2 oz. of preserved meat a day. They lancicd oiw I some of those rocks off the Horn, and agreed that when on land I they would touch none of the provisions, but keep ttauftctviw I alive on what ther could get ashore. The only thing they coulrf , I get was mussels, but ther had plenty of fresh water and plenty or I boxes of matches; but with the fearful cold their fwtwerein. I such a state that they could hardly crawl on the rocks, so those I who were not so bad gathered for the rest; bat yon nuy fancy I the amount of mussels it would take to make sufficient food for a I meal. They used to cruise about, and had hoisted a rec! shirt for I a sail. They saw several ships, but were not seen. They had I been back to tbe island twice, and when we took them np had, I been cruising about two days. Mr. -Kilgour told that it was a* ? much as he could do to get the men into the boats again. They did I not seem to care for life. They had almost given up hope when we paw them. Of course, we do not know whether the longboat hes been picked up. They bad determined not to put back upon the island again, and that if they saw one boat in danger to turn their backs, as neither ol the boats were targe enonph to take them all. They showed Spartan courage about refrainin!-r from., the food, when they were almost starving. They had sufficient left when we took them on board to have lasted them three days longer. Just think what it must have been to be twenty-seven dajB out off Cape Horn in those fearful waves (it blew a hurricane for seven days, when they were obliged to remain on thu land); the careful rowing: it required, for if they had «nec I a a wave get over the boat they would have gone over in a second. When they came alonssidc both the boats -were half full or water; the'y had both been hurt in lowering over the side? of ihi? San Raphael. The day after they were rescued theie wa- a dreadful storm and sea in which neither of the baats .could have Sved, fo they had a most marvellous escape from a watery LAtixcu op asotitkr STrjucER. — The Mnrwy fleet i-? rapidly increasing in its proportions. The competitive entcrinist' of our large shipping firms is never at rest. No sooner does one mag nificent barge or steamer leave the slips for one of the local leviathan river carriers than others follow for their rivals in the trade. To the four splendid river boats which have, within the past few weeks, been launched for Messrs. M'Culloch and Co., Dorwood and Davies, Mr. James Laing, and Messrs. White, Con sol, and Co., to-morrow will be added a magnificent new steamer, ? built for Captain Randall, by Messr6. Air and Westcg;mrd.— ? liiverwr Herald, June 17.

Sa^hy Cxts: Siioai,. — As some doubt exists as to ilic distant* which the Bare 11 ill should be kept open west of the bush on Bush Fatcb, in order to pass clear to the westward of Sandy Cape Shoal, mariners are hereby advised that, -when a ve.=su is on the line shown on the chart for clearing the shoal to the westward, tbe relative positions of the bush and Bare Hill will be just tlic reverse of those shown by view D for clearing it to the eastward. Care should be takee, however, not to bring these marks on until - the vessel is some four miles northward of tbe Cape, its within that distance they lead rery close to the outer edge of Breakseu Spit.— G.
