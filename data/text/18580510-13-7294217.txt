The ship-atio» has boon taken alongsldo the Rill way Pier, Sandridge, to discharge. , Tho American ship Sumatra, with a hoavy cargo, was discharged alongside the Railway Pier in the short tpaco of four days. TUE QUICKEST PASSAGE TO CALIFORNIA_It Is be- lieved that the Golden Age, on nor arrival yester- day, at Folsom-streot wharf, completed tho quickest passage ever mado to California from Now York. This, howovor, is partly owing to tho groat Bpoed of the new steamship Jlfoics Taylor, from Now York to Aspinwall. She loft tho dock at New York, at u quarter beforo tbroo o'clock p.m. on the 6th ¡nat., and the Age touched Folsom-streot wharf yostorjay at a quarter beforo two o'clock, making (Including the three hours and thirteen minutes added for the dilloronce of longitude,) twenty-ono days two hours and thirteen minutes from dock to wharf. This in- cludes, of course, the detention at Aspinwall (12 hours), for tho New Orloans passengers, the putting in at the ports of Ar-.pulco and Manzanillo, and the stopping off North Boaoh for tho new boats, Tho actual ruuning time of the trip, at sea, has boon within a fraction of 10 days and 23 hours. A con- noisseur In nautical matters at our elbow suggests that the Uncle Sam oneo arrived from Panam i, with the Now York passengers, in lofs than the abovo time, having lett a number ol bor passengers on the Isthmus, In tho hasto to get away. If tha figures can be produced wo will admit the fact, but not without.-Alta Californian, 27th February. TUE C0C03 ISLANDS.-Thoso islands, about to be annexed by England, aro not, as florao supposa, tho famous " COOOB ¡Blands " of tho Pacifie Ocoan, whora threo millions of troasuro wera said to be burled from a Spanish galleon, on tho passage from Aoa pulco to the Philippine Islands, some time during tho lost century, and in Bcarch of which sovoral un- successful expeditions havo boen mado from San Francisco. Tho Cocos IslandB proposed to bo an- nexed to the British Crown ore sltuatod In the In- dian Ocean, on the direct route of the EngUih steamers from Cojlon to Suez, and tholr position Is such as to lacllitato communication betweon tho In- dian Archipelago and tho Island of Mauritius. The position of tho Cocos Islands is also well suited for a naval station, and tho harbors aro good. It is stated that a depot for the Ceylon and Suez lino of Btoamers will be established on tho Islands.-Silt Francisco Herald. THE MISSINQ SCHOONER "ROSE."-In our issuo of tho 29th ult., feats were expressed of the loss of tho flat bottomed schoonor Rose, which loft Black Point, Yorke's Peninsula, on the 15th ult., with the master and two men on board. Wo regret to say that it is now generally believed she has foundered. On the day lost mentioned she was seen by tho master of tho Omeo steering for this port, deeply laden with wood. In tho evening the weather became so stormy that tho Omeo was obliged to lie-to; and such wcathor as would cause tho Omeo to resort to that expedient lor safety it is feared would swamp tho Rose, whoso sea-going capabilities wero much inferior to those of tho former vessel. It is sup- posed that a hoavy soa struck tho Rose, causing her to sink immediately-a supposition which, unfortu- nately, is borno out by the fact of hor overladen con- dition, and the heavy nature of tho wood composing her cargo. The boat sont in search of her has not roturued ; faint hopes, however, are ontertalned that it will bring any tidings of tho missing schoonor. S. A. Register, 4th May. DISTURBANCE ON BOARD THE "STORM CLOUD."- James Munro and John Murray, seamen, were charged with incltlng the sailors on board to resist the police ; also with assaulting Sergeant Sullivan. Mr. James appeared for prosocutor. Sergeant Sullivan stated that on Satur- day evening, at the request of the captain of tho Storm Cloud, he went on board to apprehend two sailors for entering tbo berths of the single women. Accompanied by the captain and doctor,he proceeded to the forecastle, where the two defendants demanded to know by what authority their comrades were to be arrested. Wit- ness was dressed in uniform, and he told them who he was. One of the defendants took him by the collar of his coat, and the other struck him twice. Effected the arrest, and, having secured the prlsoners, returned with more police with the captain and doctor to tho forecastle to apprehend the defendants. On entering the lights were blown out, pannlcans wero thrown into their faces, and a general scrimmage ensued, resulting in the apprehension of the offenders. The defendants, who did not deny their guilt, were fined £5 each, or in default of payment to go to gaol for three months.-Thomas Murray was oharged with being a participator In the last affair. He pleaded guilty. Ser- geant Sullivan said he thought defendant was the instigator of the row. Convicted in a similar penalty. -James Dixon, of the Storm Cloud, was charged with being absent without leave. Chargo withdrawn. Another seaman was fined 5s. for drunkenness. Thomas Mathias and Thomas Taylor were charged with unlawfully entering the berths of the single women on board, the Storm Cloud. His Worship intimated that the charge against them could be properly laid only by the Immigration Agent. Re- manded. The former prisoner was then charged with an assault on the chief officer, which was not denied. He was ordered to gaol for three months ; and Taylor was sentenced for one month to the samo establishment, for dlsobedienco of orders. --S. A. Register.
