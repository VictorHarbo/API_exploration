HÃ© Fled From Reds MELBOURNE, Thursday. - A Ukrainian, Korney Korsh (29), told the City Court to- day that he stowed away on a ship to Australia because he did not like the Com munist conditions in Europe. Korsh was charged with being a prohibit ed immigrant. When asked through an interpre ter how he pleaded Korsh said, "I know I came here against the law, but I want to remain here." He j added that he ran away from the Communists. Korsh was sent to gaol for three months pending deportation. In a statement read by an immi gration officer, Korsh said that he was bom in Russia in 1922. He boarded a Danish ship early this year at Bremerhaven, Germany, and arrived at Fremantle three months ago. He stayed on board until the ship reached Port Pirie. The master and crew were not aware of his presence and he stole food from the galley in the early hours of the morning. i The immigration officer told Mr. M'Lean, S.M., that Korsh was arrest , ed yesterday and had failed to pass ! a dictation test in English. The Minister for Immigration (Mr. Holt) said to-night that invariably , the Commonwealth Government did I not intervene in such cases. If stowaways appeared to be of a good type they were generally advised to apply for admission to Atistralia in the normal way when they reached Europe or whatever country they were sent to. i
