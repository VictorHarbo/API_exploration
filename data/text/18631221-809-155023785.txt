COMMERCIAL. Aoe Office, Saturday Evening. There were no export entries passed for gold at the Customs to-day. Business in tho import market has this week been brought to almost an entire standstill by tho extra ordinarily heavy rains with which wo were favored in the early part, all attention having been absorbed by tho floods, tho enormous destruction of merchan dise consequent thereon, with endeavors to save from injury property endangered thereby ; and it was not till to-day that the city assumed anything like an activo business appearance. It is not, therefore, to bo wondered at that, in such circumstances, the telegraphing of tho mail steamer, and lier subse quent arrival, should havo passed over without even the excitement usual on receipt of English news. The Bombay roacliod the Bay on Wednesday, and tho letters wore delivered tho samo afternoon. Ad vicos regarding shipments to Victoria show an in creaso for tho month over that of tho previous of £68,010, chiefly in season's goods ; a decrease of £31,674 is, however, shown on shipments to New Zealand, which is more satisfactory. In the wool market an advance of ljd por lb is advised. Monev was easy, and discount rates had fallen to 2 to 2.j per cent. From Calcutta intelligence has been re ceived of only ono vessel, tho Pactole, loading for Melbourne and Sydney, while the Brunswick from Foo Chow to Sydney, with 291,3001b tea ; and the Tchcniaya, from Hong Kong to Melbourne, with a chow-chow cargo, are tho only departures advised from China. Though tho effect of advices on tho market has not, for reasons already given, been yet realised, yet, wo venture to say, very few changes will lake placo, and on tho whole no improvement is likely to follow. Sugar has again risen, and is firm at tho advanced rates now required. Corn sacks are held for much higher prices than formerly. Flour, as also rice, is stiffcr, but this is all that can be said. Holders of malt, suit and gunpowder havo likewise enhanced views as to tho valuo of thoso al tides; but these constitute tlio principal altera tions that liavo occurred. Tho British and Foreign arrivals are — the Great Britain, from Liverpool ; the Congo, from New York; tho Silentium, from Mauritius ; and tlio mail steamer. Ale and Stout. — Tho heaviness which has cha racterised tho market for bulk beer is still its most noticeable feature, and it is now ovident no improve ment can possibly take place during tho remainder of tho season. In a couplo of months at most new beer will begin to arrive, nnd importers havo too lively a recollection of tho difficulty of quitting old to allow themselves, if nt all possible, to bo caught with heavy stocks of that description iu such cir cumstances ; it is, therefore, likely that tho present low, if not lower, prices will continue to rule during tho interval, and closo ono of tho worst seasons that has yet been experienced, for bulk ale more espo is'well known less moiiep 'OTfrjlj' i&Q;, 1™' ii?. can bo effccto 1 at this figure. Wo boliovo £6 lias been taken for a parcel, and not more than £6 5s can ho quoted. Allsopp's has gone off' in trade lots at £6. Marrian's, also, has shown symptoms of a decline, though wo are not awaro of any sales having yet been made under former rates — viz., £7 12s 6 I to £7 15s. Small lots of tho Carlisle Company's havo been purchased at £7 12s 6:1. Joule's is main tained at £7 10s to £7 15s, ut which a fair quantity goos into consumption. Tho Colonial Company's heavy alo realises £6, and tho light is readily dis posed of at £6 17a Od. Ind, Coope and Co.'s brings £7 for any of this brand that is sold. Scotch sells at £5 to £6, but, as sales aro strictly confined to sup plying trado wants, tho amount of business dono is insignificant. The quantity of bulk stout quitted is but trifling, though holders are anxious to meet the views of dealers. Taylor Walker's brings £6 12s 6d to £6 17s Od. Whitbread's realises £6 6s ; and Allsopp's 1ms found buyers at £5 10s, a decline on previous prices. Bottled ale has not been in so much request ; us tlio slackness, however, is consi dered to bo temporary, no variation in prico could bo reported. Best brands of Scotch command 10s 3d to 10s 6d ; Aitken's and Jeffrey's realise 103 ; Bass's and Allsopp's aro offered at 9s Gd to 9s 9d. Sales of Joule's are mado at 9s 6d. Tho Colonial Company's is wanted, and over 9s could now be got. Blood's and Arrol's will bring 10s. Tiio demand for bottled stout has been light; full rates aro, however, obtained for any disposed of. Henry White and Co.'s is maintained ut 10s to IO3 3d ; for Arrol's 9s 9d i3 required ; Macheu's lias a free sale at 9s to 9s Cd, according to quantity, tho most dis posed of being at 9s to 9s 3d. Burke's Guinness sells at Gs 6d. Byass's has been quitted at 8s 6d in largo parcels, and at 8s 9d iu trade lots. Diuipliy's is not in much request at 9s to 9s 3d. Tho Colonial Company's has been sold at 8s Cd for single and 9s for double stout. Ilibbert's is valued at 8s 3d. At auction, 300 casks Barclay's stout, sold with all faults, brought 4s to 8s. Shipments from England for October, of bulk, aro far below, but those in glass aro much abovo, tho average, tho former being 943 hhd, and tho latter 19,890 four-dozon cases. Bagciing. — All sorts of Dundee goods having risen considerably at home and being lightly shipped, havo beon in moro request at higher ratos. Gornsacks havo beon placed at 17s Gd and 18s ; thero aro also holders at 19s and 20s, but we have as yet heard of 110 sales over tho rates named. Wnolpacks are valued at 6s 3d to Gs Gd. Ship ments of bags aro eqiuil to about 50 bale3. Wool packs amount to 15 bales. Candles. — This market has been quiet, little or 110 effect having been caused by the marked decrease in exports to this quarter, not moro than 70 tons having beon despatched in October., From Rotter dam, however, there appears to bo no diminution, 8000 boxes having been shipped from that port. Prices, if anything, may bo said to bo firmer for full weights, but light woights aro not improved. Wo quote tlio first named — fino foreign, lO.Jd to 10§d ; Belmonts, 10 M ; nnd tho Nova Co.'s, lid. Roulmix, in small lots, havo: brought 10Jd. Souud lights arc worth 8d to 8 jd. 1500 boxes of badly damaged sold at 6gd to 7j(l. Cement. — Portluiid is again easier, and cannot be quitted over 15s to 15s 6d. Thero is 110 American plaster in first hands, und 20s is required by dealers. Shipments are 3212 barrels moro than 0110-tliird of thoso of tlio preceding eight months. . Confectionery. — No change can bo reported, the business of tho week having been exceedingly small. For assort oil, lOAd to lid is obtainod, and lid for jujubes. Candied pool has been sold at 14d. Cordage. — All descriptions continue heavy, and difficult to soil. Manilla und Europo Manilla rope, assortod sizes, aro valued ut £46 to £46 10s. Com mon turrod movos off slowly ut £40 to £12. Fino_ Europe is held at £55, and bolt-ropo realises 57s 6d. Seaming twino sells at 14 Jd to l'l.jfd. Chemicals. — Soda crystals aro freely sold at £9. For caustic, nt £19, thero is no inquiry. Bicarbouato is valued at 19s. but thero is little soiling. Flour of sulphur remains neglected aud nominal at £13. Chest opium is firmer ; ono holder has been cleared out to-day at £250, and we believo £255 will short-'y bo got. Tinned brings 32s 6d. Coffee. — Trado sales only havo as yet boon mado, at 13d — the prico now asked for plantation. Un picked is without oltoratioii on lO.Jd ; and Java has been sold, duty paid, at 12jd. ? Chicory. — A largo trado lias not boon done ; tho prico, howovcr, is maintained ut 3jd, for best brands. Shipments avo 720 cwt., which shows a largo iiicrcaso. ? Fish. — Tho demand for ling has been small, best qualities bring 5d to 5 Id. Shipments advised arc £5819. Herrings are dull, at 24s to 25s for half barrels and 9s for firkins. Red herrings sell at 31s to 32s. , Fruits.— Currants, even at the concession granted, do not go off very readily : 4Jd to 4$d is reckoned full value at the present time. Muscatel raisins have gone largely into the hands of tho trade, tho remaining portion of tho Ziska's cargo having been cleared off. For looso Muscatel 7.{d to 7Jd has been got; layers have been sold at 8d to 8Jd, but wo believe that moro money is now asked ; elemes and Capes are worth 7£d ; sultanas, though quitted by auction at 7Jd, cannot be quoted loss than 8£d in sound condition. Almonds liavo been placed at 14Jd to l-lgd and dried apples in bond have been disposed of at 5 Jd. Shipments of enrrauts advised are 80 tons ; and of raisins 31 cwt. Flour and Grain. — Flour has not been in active request ; prices have, however, stiffened slightly in consequoncc of tho tempestuous weather prevailing in the early part of the week, as it was then feared considerable damage to the crops would ensue, but thero has been nothing like elasticity in tho market. South Australian best brands in bakers' parcels, realise £14 to £14 10s for town, and £13 10s to £14 for country brands. Moyno mills is saleable at £13 and for California!], £12 10j to £13 is wanted. There is no old Adelaide wheat offering, and new has not yet reached Melbourne. The balance of the Black Hawk, Californian, has been cleared off at 5s 3d ; Victoriau realises os Gd ; damaged Californian brought 53 to 5s 2d. There has beeu little done in oats of any consequence, with the exception of Californian, of which a con siderable parcel lia3 been placed at 5s Gd in the bag ; faulty brought 4s 4d. Colonial still range at from 5s Gd to 6s. Danish are heavy at 4s 9d, and Scotch are almost unsaleable at 4s 3d.

Portion of Panama's cargo, faulty, was sold at auc tion, at 3s to 3s 4Ad. Malting is worth 5s 3d. In maize there has been little doing, and though wo still quote 4s 9d, the market is evidently not so stroug; tho arrivals to-day aro heavy. Colonial oatmeal and poarl barley sell in fair quantities, at £30, and Scotch aro offered at £23 to £25. Gunpowder. — Blasting powder, which, previous to the mail's arrival, was selling at SJd to 9d for best brands, is now held for much more. Ship ments amount to only 107 cwt, most of which is canister. Hops aro in no great request, prices ranging at from Is 2d to Is Sd for 1862, best descriptions only being wanted. Damaged sold at lljd aud old 1858 brought 6Jd. Tho quantity advised from England is 2003 cwt. Malt has beeu improving for somo timo past, aud tho favorable advices by the present mail have imparted an additional stimulus to the article — 9s Gd is now generally asked for good bins and 10s lias been obtained for trade lots. Shipments aro 15,000 bushels. Metals. — Pig iron is held for £3 15s, but wo hear of fow parcels changing hands. Corrugated realises £32 10 3 to £33 for Smith and Hamilton's ; Gospel oak being saleable at £b5 for 26 gango ; Scotch is worth from £26 10s to £30 10s according to gauge and length.

In kerosene thero have been no transactions. We do not alter quotations of 3s 4Jd for Couzzens's and Downer's, aud 3s 3d for Oriental, sound and well conditioned. Tho koroseno store liaviug been nearly' under water during tho continuation of tho floods, it is anticipated that a good deal of damago lias been, in consequence, dono ; the market lias not, however, been effected by it. A speculative purchase of 500 cases of Couzzens's, with all risks, has beon made at 2s 2d. Castor is steady at os 3d in wood, aud 5s 9d iu case. Colza and Chineso are still scarce. Oilmen's Stoiies have been in little request during the week. Bottled fruits are saleable at 13s 6d. 1 lb jams have been sold at 10s 9d to lis.

Sar jjjue^ halves^Jmv^Jjeen^sold^at 9s, and quarters at Provisions roniain exceedingly quiot : for butter lOJd is asked, but thero is no trado doing. Hams and bacon aro also inanimate : wo quote for Sinclair's 14Jd ; for Cooy's, 13Jd and 14d ; for Campbell's, 13d ; for Moffatt's, 13 jd is wanted ; and for York, 12d. Irish bacon, sold as per samplo, brought lOijil. to 10|d. Cheei;e, fine quality, commands 12d to 13d. Shipments of butler are 1830 firkins, and of hams nnd bacon 73 tons. Quicksilver goes off slowly afc 2s for Spanish ; Califoriiiatt is also held ut this figure. Rice. — Advices from Calcutta state that only ono small vessel, the Pactole, was loading for this quarter. Notwithstanding which, with the excep tion of a little more liriime3s, no other cliango has been experienced ; we quoto £24 10s to £25. Broken table rico lias been sold at auction for £22. Salt. — It is estimated that the floods have de stroyed about 2300 tons of this commodity ; we fear, howovcr, prices will not go up so high as is anticipated. Sales of coarso, during tho week, have been made at £3 5s to £3 10s. Fino has been placed at £5. The English October shipments are exceedingly moderate, being only 450 tons. Sugars. — Advices from home of large purchases being made in Mauritius, prices hero have sinco con siderably advanced. Sales, as may be supposed, have not as yet hoen large at tho rates now asked, but these have beeii established, nnd submitted to by trade purchasers.

A parcel of orange pekoe realised 2s 3Jd. Timber. — This market continues very depressed. No sales of any importance have beeu reported. Tobacco. — There is very littlo excitement in the market, and sales for trade purposes have beiu to a moderato extent.

English shipments amount to 77,873 lb. Wines and Spirits. — Ports uud sherries are in active. Low mixing port has boon sold at £17 15s. Tho wreck of the Iquiquo imparted a firmer tone to brandies, but since it has been ascertained that most of the cargo is saved, and will bo offered on account of the underwriters, the market has become weaker. 1 Martoli's in bull: is valued at 9s, and pale at 9s Gd ; Hennessy's at a liko figure ; U.V.P.'s aud Otard's, 8s 6d ; Yinegrowers' nnd C.Y.P.'s, 8s 3d to 83 Gil ; Renault's, 83 3d ; Leger Freres', 8s ; Clozoau, 8s.

SocTn Australia. — We take tho following from the South Australian Jleijisl°r of 15tli December:— Flour : Price.?, £11 103 to £13 por ton. Wheat : Prices aro still ns beforo — about 4s 3d to 4a 4d por bushel for quick delivery. New Zealand. — We tako tho following from the Otago Daily Times of 12th December: — During tho last few days, a fair amount of busi ness has been done, and the impression begins again to gain ground that wo only require settled fino weather to induce a decided increase in the extent of business, if not an improvement in prices. Transac tions have beeu chiefly confined to Hour, provisions, oilmen'3 stores, dried fruits, bulk and case brandy, and geneva, in which articles considerable sales have taken place at the following quotations : — Adelaide flour at Port Chalmers, £16 10s; Sinclair's bacon and linms, Is 3d ; Wilts cheeso, Is 2d ; Batty's pickles, 12s 6d; salad oil, half- pints, lis Gd; pints, 17s Gd ; jams, 133 Od ; bottled fruits, 223 ; sar dines, halves, 12s ; quarters, 8s ; salmon, Is Gd ; currants, 5Jd; sultanas, 8Jd ; figs, 7Jd; Martell's pale brandy', lis 3d ; Hennessy's case, 31s Gd ; ge neva, JDKZ, 12s 9d ; small contents. The cargo of sugar, ex Amicus, offered at auction yesterday, was all bought in, with tho excoption of a good yellow counter, which sold at 28s Gd, and a low white at 35s. The attendance of the trade was good, and the bid ding, though slow, came within Gil of tho reserved prices at which the sugars are now firmly held. The teas were also bought in, buyers preferring to wait the arrival of tho lnrgo shipments now on tho way from Melbourne before stockiug themselves. Mauritius. — Wo take tho following from tho Fort Louis Commercial Gazette of 9th Novem ber : — Thero has been much activity in our sugar market since the publication of the telegraphic message of the 6th October from France. There is 110 doubt that tho arrival in Franco of tho mail from Mauritius and Reunion, announcing a reduc tion of nearly 100,000 tons in the production of thoso two colonies, was the cause of tho sudden rise, as the reports from London of the 3rd were not so favorable.
