Large Influx of Iron Curtain, German Nationals MIGRATION FIGURES SHOW (BY OUR SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE) CANBERRA: Over 190,000 migrants from countries behind the Iron Curtain, Germany and Austria settled in Australia during the ten-year period after World War II. During the same period 416,240 British and about 240,000 migrants from non- British western countries .arrived in the Commonwealth. These figures were issued recently by the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Holt) in answer to a series of ques tions by Mr. G. W. A. Duthie (Lab. Tas.). Mr. Duthie, a former Metho dist Minister and graduate of Melbourne University had asked Mr. Holt— • how many British mig rants had arrived in Austra lia since 1945; • how many had returned; • how many non-British migrants had arrived; • how many of these had been naturalised; • what was the total cost of the assisted passage scheme since 1945? MORE NON-BRITISH MIGRANTS In his reply Mr. Holt listed the number of immigrants ac cording to their nationalities, Showing that a total of 846,670 people had settled in Austra lia during the ten-year period ending June 30 last, of whom just over 430,000 were of non British stock. Mr. Holt released these sta tistics about the number of non-British arrivals: American 9,097; Austrian 4,086; Belgian 627; Bulgarian 849; Czechoslovakian 11,618; Danish 906; Dutch 58,095; Estonian 6,187; French 3,932; German 29,501; Greek 18,015; Hungarian 13,824; Italian 93.264; Latvian 19,825; Lithu anian 10,084; Norwegian 1,053; Polish 71,643; Ruma nian 2,131; Russian (includ ing Ukrainian) 20,864; Syrian -Lebanese 2,761; Swedish 485; Swiss 1,770; Yugoslav 25,633; other nationalities and state less 24,180. Mr. Holt said that number of non-British migrants who had returned to Europe did not exceed 2 per cent. HOPES FOR MORE NATURALISATIONS Mr. Holt disclosed that from January 1, 1946 to June 30 this year 23,769 non- British migrants were naturalised. He added: “It is to be re membered that non-British migrants must be here for five years before applying for naturalisation. As the great inflow of such migrants began in 1949, it is only now that they are becoming eligible to apply in substantial numbers. “The rate of application is now about four times what it was one year ago, and each month is showing an in crease.” Mr. Holt said the Govern ment had spent £19,350,000 on assisted passages for British migrants and £8,877,000 for non-British people. JEWS IN GERMAN QUOTA Political observers here are reluctant to comment abodt these figures, pointing out that the number of German migrants, for instance, also includes people of former German nationality, such as Jews. They say that origin ally, migrants admitted to Australia from Germany, were people who had been deprived of their nationality by Hit ler, But for purposes of sta tistics they were regarded as Germans. These observers say that one reason why the number Of British migrants was not larger is the heavy cost of transport and ‘ their demands for superior accommodation in Australia. The statistics show that although the num ber of British migrants was smaller than that of non British settlers, the Govern ment spent more than twice as much on their assisted pas sages.
