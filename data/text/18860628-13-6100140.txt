SUMMA EY KOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. Parliament may now be .aid to havo fairly and earnestly entered upon its .work, although the attainment of this advantageous position was unduly de- layed. Tho debato on the address in reply to tho Governor's speech blocked the way. Although there was no sus- picion of a hostile amendment (becauso of tho absonco of any ground for attack- ing tho Government), mombcrs kept this dobate goiug for three weeks, until at last weariness overcame thom, and a collapso resulted. It would bo difficult to find a parallel for the last weok of this discus- sion, for it was marked by an almost eutiro absence of any utterance abovo commonplace spoaking to constituents. No leading momber on either Bide of tho House took part in it, and very few in what may bo called the second rank woro hoard. _ Generally speaking, however, the position of tho Government was groatly improved, for tho Opposition became convinced that there is little ohanoo at present of inducing members supporting tho Government to waver. There woro somo in tho' Ministerial Corner who wero regardod as weak in their allegianco, but tho debate has left it clear that the Government uro to have \- tile fullest measure of fuir-play-that thoy aro to bo judged by their measures, l'or tho most part tho Opposition attempted to saddlo tho Ministry with the burden^ of their predecessors, and tho strongest demands made wero that tliis Government should amond somo of tho prinoipal moasures introduced by the last, auch ai tho Licensing Act, the Factories and Shops Act, tho Public Service Aot, and'tho Slining on Private Property Act. To those demands, however, the Govorn .mont declined to yiold. Thoy woro muoh more interested in a movement radiating from Geelong, to have tho protoctivo duties on woollen goods made prohibitivo, in order that local factories may bo pre- served from ruin. One of their sup- porters, Mr. Andrews, who roprosents Goolong, declared that this agitation must bo mot, otherwise ho will cross tho floor. The Premier kept hjs counsol on this point, and tho Geelong mon aro waiting for the budget to soo what the Government intend doing. Tho irrigation proposals of tho Go- vernment, which are of vast dimensions, wero oxplained m tho Legislativo As 'sombly on Thursday by Mr. Deakin, Minister of Water Supply, in a speech of four hours' duration. A synopsis of the nddross is given in another column. It will bo seon that tho Government will ro quire to borrow £4,000,000, which is to bo oxpondod on works capable of irri- gating 8,242,000 acres. For tho most {xwt this money is to bo advanced to ocal trusts, whioh aro to construct works and levy rates. Tho annual cost to the farmers is estimated to bo about 11s. per noro. The unfolding of this policy has boon awaited with anxiety, but no oppor- tunity has yet occurred of onabling publio opinion to bo expressed upon it. Tho Legislativo Assembly was sud- denly called upon on Tuesday last to deal with a motion by Mr. Gaunson sympa- thising with Mr. Gladstone's policy of Homo Eulo for Ireland. Tho mover him Bolf was unprepared, but proceeded on a request by tho Premier that tho notice Bhould not bo allowed to remain on the businoss-papor a day longer than neoos lary. Mr. Murray, of Warrnambool, was seconder, and Mr. Gillios Bpoke for tho Government, and, indeed, bo the cheers' indicated, for almost tho whole House. Ho asked tho lion, members to withdraw their proposition, and in giving reasons for this request absolutely de- clined to bo drawn into a discussion of the morit3 of the Gladstone proposals. Tho home country, he said, must bo left to fight tho battle of her constitution by horsolf, just as wo would insist upon being loft alono undor similar circum- stances. Thor, was practically no debate on the question up to tim timo the House rose that evening, and noxt day tho leador of the Opposition (Mr. Bent) interfered, and induced Mr. Gaunson to withdraw tho motion. What lias boon termed a " country Îiarty" has boon formed in tho Legis ative Assembly. It Í3 a league of mombors representing other than metro- politan, Ballarat, Sandhurst, and Geelong constituencies, and its object is to givo ?ßubstantial support to rural interests. The mombers assort that the party is to have no political complexion whatever, but it is admitted by somo of thom that thoy havo combined to resist what aro supposed to bo tho over-reaching designs of Ballarat and Sandhurst representa- tives. So far no necessity has arisen for thom to aot in unison, but thoy antioipato that thoy will have to make somo demon- stration to ensure that the farming con- stituencies aro liberally dealt with in the matter of irrigation. The New Hobrides difficulty assumed an alarming phaso a fow days ago, when news based upon good authority ioachcd . Australia to tho eflecfc that the French expedition which left Noumea, Now Cale- donia, had actunlly hoisted tho French flag at Havannah Harbour and Mallicolo in the New Hebrides group. Provious reports had somewhat propnrod us for this dovolopment, and tho Governments of all tho colonies immediately inter- changed telegrams on the subject. Tho agent-general of _ Victoria received preciso instructions to reprosent tho serious nature of tho stop to tho Imperial Go- vernment, and ho was informed that tho Ndo Calédonien, published in Noumoa, had actually assorted that the annexa- tion of tho islands by Franco had boon accomplished. It was vory satisfactory to note that tho English press dovoted attention to tho matter, and that tho Foreign Oflico was urged to demand that the Government of Franco should instantly romovo tho ling, and it was »till moro satisfactory to hear by tele- gram on tho 19th hist, that M. do Froy cinot, Premier of Fiance, had ordered tho Governor of Now Caledonia to haul down tho flag if it had been hoiBted. A fooling of security was at onco restored throughout tho colonies. Sitico thon H.M.S. Undino, which has beon cruising among tho Now Hobrides, has arrived at Brisbane. Captain Cross lias roported that the rumours of tho annexation wero without foundation ; that tho French flag ¿ad not boen hoisted ; that tho expedi- tion appeared to havo no othor mission than to protect French settlers, and to punish murderers of French subjects ; and that tho wish had been fathor to tho thought to tho Nc'o Calidonien, SOCIAL- AND G1 NLRAL Sundav, the 20th mut being the nnmver Bury of the accession of Her Majesty tho Queen, the spécial service prescribed for the occasion was performctl in many of the Anglican churches of Mclbourno and suburbs Xtefcrence was also made in the sermons to the event of the daj, and the Nationil Anthem was sung ¡it the close of some services lhe day waa similarly observed in the principal provincial cities and towns.

The Argus Office, Saturday Evening. The U.M.S.S. Valetta, with the Australian mails, left tho bay on the 15th inBt The gold »pecio taken by her was of the value of -31,400. TheR.M.S.S. Shannon, with the mails from England mid the 3-aat, arrived in Hobson'a Bayon the 10th insu The Shannon made an excellent passage. The R.M.S.S. Sorata, of the Orient liue, arrived on the 13th from Lon- don with the mails and files of English papera to the 7th ult. The Sorata had a large passenger-list During tho past fortnight business has been extremely quiet, and this has to a great extent been caused through the tightness of the money market and it being the close of the half-year, when most of the principal houses are stocktaking and balancing. The money market has become decidedly firmer, and the banks huve raised their rates of interest from 3, 4, and 5 per cent, for deposits for 3, C, and 12 months to 4, 5, and 6 per cent tor deposits for similar periods. When such an increase is made in deposit rates it has generally been followed by an advance in the discount rates, but there ueemu to he no disposition on the part of the munugers, in view of the compe- tition that is likely to prevail, to increase the minimum charge of OJ per cent, for accom- modation given in this way. lu the face of this, however, the fututo outlook for trade is cartumly encouraging. The late general downpour of ruin throughout this and most parts of al I the other colonies, together with the large rise in the valuo of.wool in the London market, must soon tend to give business a goud impetus. There iiuvo been one or two insolvencies on a slightly larger scale than usual, but thoy in no way in- terfered with general business, having buen principally brought about through out- side speculation-. Actual sales reported have been ot a, very limited character, and, with the exception of one or two lines, pur- chases have been principally for trade require- ments. Hulk ales are very slow of snle, and holders of large parcels have had to submit to a large re'duction in order to effect sales. Bottled ules have been moving oh' slowly at late rates. Battled stouts have been 111 good request, and all well-known brands hnvu a ready sale. Jute goods are very quiet ; Bmall trade lots of cornsaeks have been sold at fis.

Cutidles are very weak, and large sales of Schiedam and Gouda have been mnde at7|d., duty paid. Ageuts for D.R O.'s and D.R.J. s are holding lor more money. In coffee there hua been nothing doing. A good demand continues for Uah, ami' a specula- tion in fresh herrings resulted ni the market being cleared of till stocks cm the spot at full prices. Salman is worth Sa. .Jil. Sardines have lind a good inquiry,' and luir sales have been reported tit late rates. Kippered herrings and ling have hnd small sales at about late quotations. The brend BtulTa market hna been extremely dull, und business has not been characterised by a single sale of much importance. Flour is not so hrm, and tor small parcels £11 has been accepted, while for a line an oller of leaa money would have been nceepted.' Wheat ¡ina been very quiet, und the recent largo purchases at high pnccB have now checked the market, mid, the holders in some instances having to realise, the market ¡ins become much weaker. With these prospecta and liio probability of the Sydney market being Hooded with wheat from San Francisco, the millers have held off buying for the present, but we expect lo see more inquiries and better business carried .through in the immediate future. The demand lor export ia ot a very limited character. Fruits have lind n considerable amount of attention, and the lute lurge speculations in currants havo been followed by boiuû large sales of Kieme und Sultuiia raisins ut very luil prices.

Galvanised iron is selling neely at late» rates. In oils there bus been more dointr ; kerosene lins had the bulk of attention, and borne 20,000 casca of high-test oil huve bet-n tnlten up at a lull price j this purchase clenrs the market of all uvailuble stocks of high-test on the spot, lu suit, 100 tonB of Liverpool course sold at ogenls' ruten. Oilmen's Blores of most descriptions are moving oil freely at late rates. Only a mode- rate demand lins been noticeable for BUgars, and sales have been of a restricted character. This, however, bus been grently caused through the firmness of holders, who reluse to sell except at full, market prices. Crush- ing hue been grently interfered with in most parts of Queensland through very heavy rains, and this must malte the supplies inter in reaching this market The Com- pany's ougurs continue to sell freely nt lute rates. Teas have been very quiet, purchasers not being anxious to buy until the arrival of the new season's, which is expected about the 7th July. The timber eales have been well attended, but buyers have shown no animation, und prices for most descriptions are lower. Winns of aood quality have had good trade sales at current quotations.

The Mercantile, Finance, Guarantee, and Agcuc) Ci-J'he li ill-)early meeting of this company was held on Friday at their offices, 46 Lhzabeth-stieet, Mr. G. G. Crespin, chairman ot the board of directors, pre- siding Tho Chairman, in moving the adoption ' of the report and balance sheet, said that the business had been very progressive and successful-in fnct, more so than hud even been anticipated when it was com menced a year ago-and it was still Bteadily increasing. It would be seen from the balance sheet that tlio profils for the bull year amounted to 15 2U8 2s. 8d., out ot which lhe directors recommended tho pajment of a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, absorbing _1,5C2 10a , and proposed to plaee -2,000 to the credit of the re nerve fund, making it í.3,000 ; to w rite off _1,000 Irom the goodwill, and to carr) forward a balance to next hnlfvear of 1735 12s 8d Their profits for the whole of the j ear dunn, which the company hid been in existence, amounted to £8,382 The directors were of opinion that it would be well to have a larger subscribed capital, and would probably soon bring for- ward a proposal to carr) out that view. Mr. IL It R-tD, in seconding the motion, congratulated the directors and manager on the success which lind been obtained. The motion waa agreed to Messt _ O. Fen- wick, B Fink, M L A, and C. J. Ham, M.L.C, retiring directors, were re-elected ; and Messrs A. Burna and C. M. Hoi mee wero appointed auditors. Colonial Investment and Agency Company. -lho fourteenth ordinury general meeting of the shareholders of this comp my was held at Scott s Hotel, on June 2L Mr. 1. Inglis was was elected as chairman. There was a large attendance ot shareholders The chairman, in moving the adoption ot the half-yearly re- port, said that at the preceding meeting there was a 5 per cent bonus declared, in addition to the 10 per cent dividend. There bud not been the same turnover m the last as in the previous year, and that might account for the met that not so much probt had been made. But the proposed dividend of 10 p'er cent was a very good one. The company was in a splendid position. Mr. R. Kingston seconded the motion, which was carried. Messrs. F. J. Smart and T. Bennett were ro elected directors, and the retiring auditors, Messrs. II W. Sinclair and J, li Staples, were likewise re-elected. Tho following a» tho goaural prlcce current : Air (bulk; £. 8 d.
