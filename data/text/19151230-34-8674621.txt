When, after receiving the best medical attention and all hope of cure bad germs, and when in almost a state of collapse, you took his case in hand, and by some miraculous process you have now restored him to full health and strength. Brother Johnson is to-day a striking example of your abilities as Tuberculosis Expert. Not only the Brothers of MT Order, but hundreds of other residents of Adelaide can testify to his almost incredible return to health. We little expected to have him in our midst again.
