Gentlemen— I feel highly honored by com plying with your requisition, and, if elected, shall be perfectly willing to devote my best services'to the business of legislation. I am, Gentlemen, Yours, obediently, JOHN CROZIER. To George Green, Esq., John Hodg fcias, Esq., and the other Gentle men signing tiie Requijution. TO THK ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen — Having been requested to come forward and offer myself as a Candidate for one of the vacancies of the Legislative Council at the forthcoming Elections, it is necessary, as I am not known to many of the Electors, for me to introduce myself, and to place before you my opinions, and the measures I would support which are likely to come before the Legislative Council. I have been in the colonies for twenty-eight years. Although residing in New South Wales and. Victoria as a squatter, I have for the last seventeen years done business here, and have now come to reside in this colony for the purpose of remaining and educating my family, and am in no way connected with trade or business to inflnence me from giving my support to any measure that would be for the benefit of all classes and the advancement of the country. Land Systems. — Desirous of encouraging bona fide settlement, I would carefully consider any plan that could be devised to render agri culture more remunerative, and to enable thiB colony to compete with the liberal land systems of New South Wales and Victoria. wipmg — I consider that to encourage the de velopment of our mineral resources more liberal regulations are necessary. That measures should be devised to protect the actual dis coverer in the enjoyment of his rights, and that a small royalty uught be preferable to rent. Squatting. — I am in favor of a classification of runs, and liberal terms in the dry coun try. In favor of the princqile of an assessment at per head actually depastured, the rate vary ing according to the value of the run. Railways. — -The great want of the country is improved means of iwt'-w^miTlrmT'^Qtfonl and cheaper carriage for its produce. WhOsteupport ing liberal outlay on ordinary roads I would sup port railway extension, on a cheap scale; also 4 system of tramways for horee traction. Am in favor of guaranteeing private capitalists in the execution of reproductive works. The Tariff.— I believe that taxes should inter fere as little as possible with trade ; I am opposed to the imposition of protective duties, as these increase the cost of growing, and enhance the charges upon raising produce, thereby ^S^ftKliTiy; our miners, and farmers, and others from competing in the markets of the world ; but I «™il'l not object to admit, free of duty, such raw material as can be worked up into manufactured articles in the colony, and would favor a bonus to any positively new industry beneficial to the colony. Insolvent and other Laws.— I consider they need amendment so as more effectually to pro tect the public against reckless extravagance and fraud, and at the same time better to secure the honest but zeaBy unfortunate debtor. I &1bq w'M|jdftr that a revision and *rimplififMi tion of many of the lawB would be beneficial, as from their intricate and complex forms they as often create a crime as prevent it. Education. — I am in favor of Government aid to Education, if wholly onsectarian ; would sup port |the extension of Education to the out lying districts, and generally to assist the estab lishing of schools in thinly-peopled localities. Constitution Act. — I am in favor of amending it in gCTCTai pai-Hptila^ Mirh am malrrng flip ^ffi^-o of Attorney-General not necessarily political!; preventing Government contractors getting into Parliament ; giving the Government power, as in Victoria, to remove a Judge on the aflflrp«* of both Houses. Immigration.— At present none is needed, but I should favor introducing suitable labor when wanted. PublieExpendiiure. — I am opposed to the mul tiplication of offices, and would advocate strict economy in the Government departments ; sup porting the appropriation of a larger share of the public revenue to opening up the country dis tricts, and for the convenience of country set tiers generally. Intercolonial Affairs. — I am in favor of fede ration, or mutual agreement for certain definite objects, each as the free interchange of colonial produce, co-operation in schemes of coast de fences, postal and telegraph arrangements. On all (he various questions that may from time to time arise, and which I have not touched upon, my best endeavors will be put forth to advance tile interests of my fellow-colonists, without respect to. class or party, should X be returned. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, JOHN CEOZIEB. Oakland*, Start, July 18, 1867. d3xl EAST TORRENS ELECTION.— The following Genflemen have formed themselves into a.

Gentlemen— I have much pleasure in acced ing to your request that I should allow myself to be nominated for one of the vacant seats in the Legislative Councfl. In accepting this invi tation I desire to express my sense of the re? sponsibility that devolves on members of the Upper House to «onserve its constitutional privileges. As members of the Legislative Council axe elected for a lengthened period, more depends on their general character than on an expression of opinion on the 1-*flJing topics of the day. especially oonsideriiig £he rapid changes in colonial life. I shall therefore only very briefly refer to a few of the prominent questions now before the public I am in favor of borrowing English capital to a, reasonable amount, to be expended infreproduc tive works and works calculated to open op the resouitvs of the colony. I deeply regret the temporary distress which prevails amongst the working classes at the present time, but I trust that the dark cloud which for some months has hung over the colony wfll speedily pass away and better times wfll dawn for all classes in the community. The trade with the Biverina districts requires thejcareful consideration of the Legislature, and any measure tending to develop that trade and remove obstructions from this important branch of its progress will have my earnest support. I shall oppose any impost or restriction calcu lated to fetter or embarrass the development of the resources of our pastoral, mitiBral, or agricultural interests. I am, Gentlemen, yours faithfully, W. MORGAN. To tiuTHon. Thos. English, the Hon. A. Blyth, the Hon. J. T. Bagot, and the other gentlemen signing the requisition. dxc T7LECTI0N FOR THE LEGIS Hi' LATIVE COUNCIL. TO WILLIAM ROUNSEVELL, ESQ., GLENELG.

Glenelg, Jnly 19, 1867, Gentlemen — I have much pleasure in acced UgtoyouTTequestthat I should aUow myself Election Notices. to be nominated for the Legislative Council, and if returned will do my best to forward the interests of the colony at huge. As my political views may not be widely known, I feel it my duty to glance at the most important political matters of the day. I consider that immediate action should be taken in reference to the Immigration Act and the large surplus fund now lying almost idle, which I should endeavor to expend in public reproductive works, which would give employ ment and relief to hundreds of starring families now in the colony. I think the time has arrived for the revision of the Tariff, as the duties now fall heavily on the laboring and farming classes. I am in favor of free distillation by erecting good public stills (under efficient management) in the centres of winegrowing localities, - so that any gardener could take his produce and have it converted into a marketable article that would be saleable in any part of the world. This could be done at about one-fifth the ex pense of working by the present Distillation uct, which seems to me sunilar to proposing that every farmer should have his own mill, to waste his time and spoil his grain, as many winegrowers now do their tune and produce. I would advocate the development of the country by a. system of cheap tramways, where trade and the natural resources of the colony warrant such outlay. I would also support a reconstruction of the and regulations, so as to enable the legitimate farmer to secure the land he requires for culti vation direct from tile Government on reason able terms. I am of opinion that the Parliament can, with advantage to the colony, adopt such measures as wfll alleviate the squatters, who have so greatly suffered by the drought, and am in favor of an assessment on the stock depastured rather than a fixed rental These seem to me the most prominent matters now before the public, but I should be prepared to give every matter due considera tion and earnest thought for the welfare of the colony. I am, Gentleman, Yours faithfully, WILLIAM ROUNSEVELL. To Hon. Thos. English, M.L.C., Hon. C. G. Everard, M.L.C., W. Everard, Esq., M.P., J. B. Neales.
