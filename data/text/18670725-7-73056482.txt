Gentlemen— I have much pleasure in acced ing to your request that I should allow myself to be nominated for the Legislative Council, and if returned will do my best to forward the interests of the colony at large. As my political viewB may not be widely known, I feel it my duty to glance at the mo*t important political matters of tile day. I ^fAyisiilft1* that imiyMwiiot-o m«tiAn should be taken in reference to the Immigration Act and the large surplus fund now lying almost idle which I should endeavor to expend in public reproductive works, which would give employ ment and relief to hundreds of starving f»mil«»« now in the colony. I think the time has arrived for the revision of the Tariff, as the duties now fall heavily on the laboring andfarminfir classes. I am in favor of free distillation by erecting good public stills (under efficient management) in the centres of winegrowing localities, so that any gardener could take his produce and have it converted into a marketable article that would be saleable in any part of the world. This could be done at about one-fifth the ex pense of working by the present Distillation Act, which seems to me similar to proposing that every fanner should have his own milL to waste bis time and spoil his grain, as many winegrowers now do their time and produce. I would advocate the development of the country by a system of cheap tramways, where trade and the natural resources of the colony warrant such outlay. I would also support a reconstnction of the la««i «»gi^Wtiftng| so as to enable uie Ipgit^iimi^a farmer to secure the land he requires for culti vation direct from the Government on reason able terms. I am of opinion that the Parliament can, with advantage to the colony, adopt such measures as will alleviate tile squatters, who have so greatly suffered by the drought, and am in favor of an assessment on the stock depastured rather than a fixed rental. These seem to me the most prominent matters now before the public, but I Bhould be prepared to give every matter due considera tion and earnest thought for the welfare of the colony. I **** Gentleman, Yours faithfully, WILLIAM ROUNSEVELL. To Hon. Thos. English, M.L.C., Hon. C. G. Everard, M.L.C., W. Everard, Esq., M.P., J. B. Nesles.

Gentlemen— I fed highly honored by com plying with your requisition, and, if elected, shall De perfectly willing to devote my best services to tiie business of legislation, lam, Gentlemen, Yours, obediently, ? JOHN CROZD3R. To George Green, Esq., John Hodg kiss, Esq., and the other Gentle men Mg»i«g the Requisition. TO THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen— Having been requested to come forward as a Candidate for one of the vacancies of the Legislative Council at the forthcoming paprfinng, it is necessary, as I am not known to many of the Electors, to place before you. my opinions, and the measures I would support intheeventof their coming before the Legisla tive CouncQ. I have been in the colonies for twenty-eight years. Although residing in New South Wales and Victoria as a squatter, I have for the last seventeen years done business here, and have now come to reside permanently in this colony for the purpose of educating my family, and am in no way connected with trade or business to influence me from giving an impartial support to any measure that would be for the benefit of all classes and the advancement of the country. Land Systems. — Desirous of encouraging bona fide settlement, I would carefully consider any plan that could be devised to vender agriculture more remunerative, and to enable this colony to compete with the liberal land systems of New South Wales and Victoria. Mining.— I consider that to encourage the development of our. mineral resources more liberal regulations are necessary. That measures should he devised to protect the actual dis coverer in the enjoyment of his rights, and that a small royalty might be preferable to rent. Squatting. — I am in favor of a classification of runs, and liberal terms in the dry country. In favor of the principle of an assessment at per head actually depastured, the rate varying according to the value of tile run. Railways.— The great want of file country is improved' 'w*m of intercommunication, and cheaper carriage for its produce. Whilst sup porting liberal outlay in ordinary roads I would support raQway extension on a cheap scale; also a system of tramways for horse traction. Am in favor of guaranteeing private capitalists in tiie execution of reproductive works. The Tariff. — I believe the taxes should inter fere as little as possible with trade ; I am op posed to the imposition of protective duties, as these increase the cost of living, and enhance the charges upon raising produce, thereby dis ablins our miners, and farmers, and others from competing in the markets of the mil; bull should not object to admit, free of duty, such raw material as can be worked up into manu factured articles in the colony, and would favor a bonus to any positively new industry bene ficial to the colony. \- Insolvent and other Laws. — I consider they need ««ncn-liinmt bo as more effectually to pro tect &B; public against reckless extravagance and fraud, and at the same time better to secure the honest but really unfortunate debtor. _ I also consider that a revision v'9 jimpUfi''**'*' of many of the laws would be beneficial, as from their intricate and complex forms they as often create a crime as prevent it. Education. — I am in favor of Government aid to Education, if wholly unsectarian; would sup port the extension of Education to the outlying districts, and generally assist the establishing of schools in thinly-populated localities. Constitution Act. — I am in favor of amending it in several particulars, such as making the office of Attorney-General not necessarily poli tical; preventing Government contractors get ting into Parliament; and giving the Govern* ment power, as in Victoria, to remove a Judge on the address of both Houses. Immigration.— At present none is needed, but I should favor introducing suitable labor when wanted. Public Expenditure.— I am opposed to the multiplication of offices, and would advocate strict economy in the Government departments; supporting the appropriation of a larger share of the public revenue to opening up the country districts, and for the convenience of country settlers generally. Intercolonial Affairs. — I am in favor of fede ration, or mutual agreement for certain defi nite objects, such as the free interchange of colonial produce, co-operation in schemes of coast defences, postal and telegraph arrange ments. On all the various questions that may from time to tame arise, and which I have not touched upon, my best endeavors will be put forth to advance the interests of my fellow colonists, without respect to class or party, should I be returned. lam, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant.

Gentlemen— I have much pleasure *n acced ing to your request that I should allow myself to be nominated for one of tile vacant seats in the Legislative Council. In accepting this invi tation I desire to express my sense of the re sponsibility that devolves on members of the Upper House to conserve its constitutional privileges. As members of the Legislative Council are elected for a lengthened period, more depends on their general character than on an expression of opinion on the l««i?ng topics of the day, especially considering the rapid ritmnpmi in colonial life. I shall therefore only very briefly refer to a few of the prominent questions now before the public. lam in favor of borrowing English capital to a reasonable amount, to be* expended in reproduc* tive works and works calculated to open up the resources of the colony. I deeply regret the temporary distress which prevails amongst the working classes at the present time, but I trust that the dark cloud which for some months has hung over die colony will speedily pass away and better times will dawn for all cusses in the community. The trade with the Riverina districts requires the^carefulconsiderationof the Legislature, and any measure tending to develop that trade and remove obstructions from this important branch of its progress will have my earnest support. I shall oppose any impost or restriction calcu lated to fetter or embarrass the development of the resources of our pastoral, mineral, or agricultural interests. I mi Gentlemen, yours faithfully, W.

Gentlemen — Having been requested by nu merous friends to come forward as a Candidate for the Upper House at the forthcoming Elec tions, and having acceded to their request, I think it my duty to lay before you my views on the most important questions likely to be brought before the Legislatam, and which are already, in great measure, the subjects of public discussion. L The first and most important question, in my opinion, relates to the extreme distress at pre sent existing amongst the working classes of tile colony. I was until very recently a working man myself, and csn fully appreciate the con dition, into which so many hundreds of our popu lation bavebeen thro wnby the present scarcity of employment. I have given the matter my best consideration, and would advocate animmediato repeal of Sutherland's Act, and the disbursement of the present accumulated proceeds (amounting to £291,000) in public works likely to give em ploymant to tile working classes, and to facili tate the thorough opening and development of the colony. I am inclined to flunk that a judicious expenditure of money in tramways, and in otherwise improving our internal means of communication, would be of most permanent benefit to the colony. 2\. I would advocate the borrowing of one and a half millions, to be epent in reproductive works. 3\. The next important question is that of Pro tection vartut Free Trade. Iaminfavorof ad mitting raw material dnty free. I consider that' bonuses to assist in advancins; colonial manu factures from colonial produce would be benefi cial to the country at large, and I certainly think that so long as we impose a duty on im ports, such duty should be in Us nature pro tective. 4\. I am in favor of a more liberal Distillation Act, as applied to the produce of the colony. ELIoonsiderit essentialthatourpresent popula tion should be fully employed before any more cash be sent from the ColonialTreasury to assist immigration. Should imniigrMita hereafter be required, as I taut may be the cue, I am in Election Notices. favor of assisted immigration to suit the wants of the time. ? 6\. Our mining regulations should afford greater protection to the actual discoverer, and there should be a right to thorougly test land presumed to contain nninamlH without the ex plorer incurring any liability for rent. 7\. In the thinly populated districts I would assist Education, strictly unsectarian in its character. 8\. I am in favor of a more liberal Land Act, believing that a proper division of the land amongst the population is the surest mode of arriving at stability and prosperity as a State. a In conclusion, the Electors may depend on my giving any matters brought before the Legisla ture my best consideration. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES WRIGHT. Adelaide, July 19, 1867. 02x1 ?^LECTORS OF THE PROVINCE. X-i Gentlemen— The following is a brief out line of my views upon the leading political questions «f the day: — In the present depressed condition of the labor market, I am of opinion that immigration should be discontinued, and that Southeriand's Act should be repealed. I would advocate the immediate expenditure, in public works of the large sum now at the credit of the Immigration Fund, for the purpose of affording relief to the numerous unemployed. I would encourage native industries by an ?Hnratiwi of our tariff, to admit, free of duty, all raw material, piece-goods, and paper ; and by giving bonuses to the successful establish ment of any new and useful industry. I would advocate a very liberal alteration of our Land Act, to enable bona fide settlers to obtain land on such terms as would enable them to compete successfully with the neighboring colonies. . ^consider it essential to the prosperity of the agriculturist, that he should have a cheap means of conveying his produce to the nearest outlet, and to that end would advocate cheap tramways throughout the various agricultural and mining districts wherever practicable. I would seek to encourage the development of our mineral wealth, by a more liberal code of regulations. I am in favor of a fair.classincation of squat ters' runs, and would grant liberal terms to the lessees of the Far North country. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, JAMES C. VERCO.
