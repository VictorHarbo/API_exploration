Gentlemen—Not being able to visit the numerous districts in the colony, it is desirable that H should state to you what I am in favor of supporting in case of being returned. I am in favor of opening up the Murray Mouth, and making Victor Harbor suitable for large ship ping.; improvements of Port Adelaide, survey of new roads for stock travelling, a liberal Land pfil; ajarger area of acres for the farmers, im migration when necessary, properly selected.; railways, where necessary, 8 liberal amended ; Mineral,.Act and royalty, water supply for ; townshyao where needed,. outer harbor—give > bacilitiesito a private Company for .itseonstruc- ; tion, amend the Constitution Act, utilise the ■ Murray "Bridge by railway if thought necessary, jetties and. lights on our coast, support a force for the defence of the colony, and the ereetion of batteries; also a Military-road near the Semaphore- . ,, x The federation of the colonies should sot with, the Real Property Act; support the sinking of wells in the Far North, to open up the eountey for pastoral purposes; should support the.colonization of the Northern Terri tory with eith.er European or foreign labor; liberal leases .to the squatters where land is not Bui table for fliers; support an expenditure for all necessary public works; simplify and lessen the costsiyi the Supreme Court; support to give the power^to the ratepayers of any dis trict to decide by their votes the number of houses that may . be licensed for the sale of strong drink. In ^pking for your support, you have s<»en my votes in print during 12 years in Parliament, if you g^prove of them support me, and if returned shell legislate for the best in terests of this colony-.that I have resided in for 39| years. ••. w I am, Gfiuri^men, Your.jfibedient servant, PATRiCgl BOYCE COGLIN. Brompton Park. 69 wa92x69-90z jo THE ELEGTOES OE THE COLONY. SIX PLAIN REASONS WHY WE SHOULD EACH GIVE ONE VOTE TO MR. JOHN CROZIER FOR THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. 1\. Because although a New South .Wales colonist, he has inade South Australia his home, and has thoroughly identified himself in every way with our colony. 2\. Because—no Absentee, be has freely in vested his capital in South Australian trade. 3\. Because he has been a spirited and liberal supporter of mining in South Australia. 4\. Because we are all anxious to secure the Riverina trade, and the pre- eminence of South Australia as an Australian colony mainly de pends npon our getting it. Ia the River Murray Nature meant we should have it. Mr. Crozier has for many years brought the whole of his New South Wales and Riverina produce to South Australian Ports, and has taken his supplies from us, dealing with South Australia alone. The example of one man like Mr. Crozier is worth the advocacy of a hundred others. No one has done so much as Mr. Crozier to secure to us the trade with Riverina, by showing that it can be best done here. We can only get it by New South Wales and Victorian tradesmen, and squatters following his example. 5\. Because he is a man with a thorough practical knowledge of what is required to develop .country, a hard-headed Scotchman, who has raisei1 LIlQself to his.present honorable position, and whosetjJviceus worth having, for he really understands what" he is talking about. Unlike many, when he does not tiiOr°ughly understand, he holds his tongue and listens. 6\. Because he has served us well" in the past. He was an independent but consistent sup porter of the Morgan and Boucaut Government." yielded his own opinion on subsidiary matters, so as not to endanger or delay the execution of - a great policy which the country approved. He is no obstructive. A severe domestic affliction and consequent illness have compelled Mr. Crozier at this time to seek a short change. No one can blame o resent his absence; it was unavoidable, and I trust his canvas will not suffer from this cause. Do not forget him therefore, but give ONE VOTE TO MR. JOHN" CROZIER. 72zcx76c AN ELECTOR. i^AST TOBBENS ELECTION. E Mr. J. A. HOLDEN, will address the Electors at SUSSEX ARMS, WALKERVILLE—Satur day.
