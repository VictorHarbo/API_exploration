The Malta is a barque timber laden from the Baltic where, at a place named Negham. she was loaded at the same time as the George F. Patten, and it is rather a reumkable fact that the two vessel* reached their destinations on the same day. the former beina for orders in Melbourne, and the latter at Adelaide. Further, they were t-oth dispatched, the one in Melbourne for Adelaide, and rice verm. Captain Corrigiu reports bad weather throughout the voyage. The Malay, from Newcastle, has managed to make the passage in 13 days ; out of which she was driven to spend two at anchor under Green C ape. and another at Flinders Island in consequence of the very boisterous state of the weather, yet, not withstanding the above detentions, a couple of veuels which sailed before her from Newcastle bare not arrived here. The Camilla, from Hobart Town, has not been exempt from the prevailing heavy gales which had the effect of greatly retarding her progress. She was boarded by a pilot on Saturday ni^'ht, but uid not reach the anchorage till Sunday morning. The ATHOL arrived oi; Sundav morning at the anchorage, and Captain Brou-n landed in the Lor sair in order to procure instructions for the desti nation of his car;:o. He reports leaving J- e wcastle on January Itf, ami thence to Cape Howe moderate weather prevailed, but from that time till the Athol passed Cape Otway a succession of westerly ales caused her to anchor under the eastern side of Flinders Island, where she remained weather bound for three days in company with the brig Wolverene. The Athol left the anchorage there on the 30th. and made a favourable trip to the The Cooroxc saikd from Melbourne on the 5that 2.30 p.m. ; on the- feh when oil' Port Fairy. exchanged signals with the brig Anna Maria and barques Tomatin and Formosa, aiikh wished to be reported. TheCoorons arrived at about 7 o clock on Sunday evening; and as soon as boarded pro ceeded towards the bar, but it was scarcely ex petted there wou'4 be sufficient li^lit to go over. Mr. Joseph Co em m's steamer Letty, after a gomewhat lengthened d-toition, is now in working order. On Saturday she made a trip down the river and towed up the Contest.
