FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1861. Taking a general survey of public affairs, it must be admitted that the position is most unsatisfactory both as regards the state of business w Die Assembly and the prospect before the colony. The former consideration may not be a matter of serious moment, but the latter is Most of the measures, before the House might be dropped without any interest suffering and with out most of us being any the wiser, but the uncertainty as regards the future for which Ministers are largely answerable affects, and that deeply, ever y interest and every citizen As regards the Assembly business, (he Remark has to be made that never before has a Government been so much aided by in Opposition as the present Ministry,, and seldom have measures been more delayed Not only have the Opposition refrained from obstruction, but the principal measures of the session, such as the Federation Bill, the Land bales Bill, and the Local Govern- mont Bill, have been earned for the Government as against criticism from the Government benches The only attempts at obstructions have been made by Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN and "Mr 150, who were sitting on the Government side at the opening of the session, and in both matinees then appeals to the Opposi- tion for aid have met with no response There have been no holidays and not a day's stonewalling, and yet in the last month of the session the House has all its business before it, and the Govern- munt has to face its difficulties shaken and discredited in itself such a situation points to some inherent incapacity in the Cabinet But the great end of the day is the undefined connection or alliance between the Assembly Ministers not the Council Ministers and the Trades hall The delegates of the Lygon-street body sit behind Mr Munro and support him through thick and thin, while he coquetry with them and then aggressive political organisation Apparently Mr MUNRO IS quite ready to play the part essayed by Sir HENRY PARKES in New South Wales, and attempted by Mr, BALULNOK, with more success to himself and disaster to the country, in New Zealand. Mr. BAIXAÎÎÇIÏ, under the evil influence of the so-called labour party, has passed mea sures that threaten and affright capital, and but for the Legislative Council he would have passed more," and now if the Crown will assent he is committed to the destruction of the Council by swamping it with trades union nominees, who will give effect to his wishes. The idea, the dread that events may take this course in Victoria is the heavy cloud that hangs pall- like over the community. "What men fear is that the Trades-hall will seat a substantial minority that this minority will hold the balance of power that it will find political tools and that by rash proposition and by violent language it will give colour and substance to the theory daily promulgated abroad that Australia is on the eve of a wild burst of legislation against the capitalists. The English capitalist cannot read the Trades-hall programme, even in its modified "fighting " platform," without an inclination to button up his pockets. First comes the proposal to confiscate the "un " earned increment" of land. " That," says the British investor, means " the lessening of tho value of the " securities I am advancing on." Then there is to be a heavy penal- tax on absentees. "And I am an absentee," he reflects ; " and if the " start is made with the man who has " left his property in the colony, the " turn of the man who has sent money " to the colony may come next, and no " one knows how soon." Then there is the progressive income tax, all artisans and labourers to be exempt. " That," he will comment, is the many dipping " their hands into the pockets of " the few. Where will this end ?" Nearly every item adds to the suspicions of the British reader. Under some circumstances we could afford to disregard outside views of ourselves, and could address ourselves doggedly to the tasks of the day, but the loss of the good opinion of the capitalists and the investors of Great Britain is a matter of grave financial import. We want to borrow largely in order to further develop the resources of the land, and we do not want exist- ing deposits and investments to be withdrawn, for we know how serious the consequences would be. We are in exactly the position of a bank which does not desire to alarm its constituents, for though it is thoroughly solvent yet a run upon it by its depositors must occasion injury and loss. The soundness of Victoria is absolutely undoubted, and yet neither she nor any other colony which has borrowed largely could sustain a stoppage or a withdrawal of investments without for a time every man, woman, and child, every property-owner and every labourer, feeling the situation keenly < MI Nor are those fears confined to British investors. The local investor does" not know what adverse industrial legislation a Trades-hall Legislature would impose, and nearly everyone with funds shrinks from putting money into new industries, and thus for the time industry and development are crippled. Most unhappily this is the moment which, the Assembly Ministers have selected for adopting the Trades-hall voting scheme. " Give us the one man " one vote," say the unionist leaders, " and we will do the rest ourselves." This is their "jemmy," and the Ministry is content to put the crowbar into the hands of the Lygon-street agitators, professing not to be responsible for the use to which it is avowedly to be applied. Possibly Ministers never intended to give the Trades-hall its "jemmy," but thought only of playing with and utilising this body for its own purposes; but with that the country has nothing to do. What is evident is that this coquetting of Ministers with' the''Lygon-str¿et league adds to the present sense of insecurity. We do not believe that the Trades- hall is about to obtain its "jemmy," and we do not believe that it is about to win in the constituencies. On the contrary, we venture to assert that the Trades-hall is on the eve of a big doctoral failure. The next Assembly, we feel sure, will be composed of steady colonists, who will conserve the national interests, sanctioning no attacks on capital of any kind, but maintaining freedom of contract, the repression of disorder, and the security of property. With such an Assembly in existence we might expect that confidence would be largely restored abroad and at home, prosperity would probably return with a bound, and therefore it is that men, tired of the present uncertainty, and disgusted with present ill-omened alliances-city men and others outside of the political circle are looking forward to a new House, and are saying about a dissolution, " the sooner the better." We publish to-day a special appeal which has been made to the members of the Church of England with the view of raising sufficient funds to extend the operations of the church in the suburbs of Melbourne. Everyone who takes the slightest interest in the affairs of the denomination is well aware of the object for which the Bishop of Melbourne's Fund has been established. It is intended for the assistance of the weaker congregations in the diocese, which find a difficulty, either because of the sparse ness of the population or because of the want of organisation that is inevit- able in a new suburb, in maintaining the ordinances of the church without some extraneous aid. Hitherto the greater part of the money has gone to the country parishes; but an appeal is now made, not only on behalf of the country districts, but in order to extend the work of the church in Melbourne, itself. Tile reasons for this demand upon the liberality of the Anglican communion are perfectly obvious. Every denomination has found difficulty in keeping pace with the rapid growth of population in the metropolitan area. In the centre of the city churches are planted closely together, some of which serve a comparatively small number of people in other places, where a large population has been brought together, the churches are far apart. It is only within the last few days that the Presbyterian authorities have been asked to consider not for the first time, the advisability of amalgamating congregations in one district of Melbourne in order that they might be more free to establish churches in other places, where large numbers of people have fixed their homes. It must be said that the Anglican Church has recognised the necessity of extending its work in Melbourne. A considerable sum of money has been borrowed on the security of the church lands for the purpose of erecting buildings, new parishes have been formed , a fairly complete scheme has been drafted for bringing the Anglican service close to the doors of all the Anglicans who are residing in the suburbs be for a certain amount of progress has been made There is a practical guarantee that suitable build again, will be erected in all of the new parishes There is an absolute cer hint) that local workers, who have the welfare of the church at heart, will be found in every suburb But money is required for the support of the each and for the payment of the expenses that are necessarily mere red in conducting a regular service. It is for this object that a special appeal is now made And by the result of the appeal the loyalty and the sincerity and belief of the Church of England will be tested In this colony no religious denomina- tion can look for any extraneous aid The voluntary system, the separation between church and state, has been deliberately. chosen, and is strongly approved of by nearly every elector in the country, and upon the member- of each church, therefore, devolves the duty of supporting it, of extending its work, of increasing its progress and adding to its usefulness With them it rests to decide whether the Church is to be merely a respectable institution, or whether it is to be extended over town and country, so that every family may have an opportunity of attending the religious ser Mees of one or another denomination It lies with them whether the Christian sentiment is strong enough to support the Christian Church, 01 whether the separation of church and state is to result in diminished energy, in the slow extension of religious effort, and in the paganism of a section of the people To show that the churches are alive, the members must cooperate in every possible way, by spending their money 01 giving their time on behalf of the creed which they profess It is, however, a misfortune, which is keenly felt in many country villages and which hampers the efforts of the church in more populous places, that the Protestant denominations are all competing against each other Three 01 four congregations are often formed, and three or four edifices built, where one building would suffice for the meetings of the church going population We cannot expect that this dissipation of energy will be immediately checked, or that it will ever be stopped Each denomination wants to establish itself, the people of the neighbourhood like to have their own church and as long as differences in doctrine and in the method of church government exist this desire will continue but we may ask the churches to consider whether they could not co-operate in many matters As a matter of fact, the charitable work of the colony has become unsectarian The Scots Church Society for assisting neglected children has almost ceased to be regarded as Presbyterian, and is supported simply on account of its meritorious work A corresponding society in connection with the Australian Church, which will hold a cake fair next -we seek to increase its funds, will doubtless be supported by people of all denominations and of no denomination In such cases people simply look to the fact that a good work is being done, and the dogmatic differences of the denominations count for nothing Is it not possible to extend this movement ? Is it not to them the power of the churches to co-operate in teaching the young, to arrange the order of their services, to manage that in struction will be regularly given to the people, even if there be a lack of buildings ? 'There is surely much work to be done, beyond the reclamation of street arabs, which can be managed in the un sectarian spirit that characterises the best charitable efforts of the churches 'IIio action of the Assembly last Tuesday in rushing through the Legal Professions Practice Bill furnishes a curious and by no means edify mg illustration of the unsoundness of a large proportion of the legislation of the day The bill w IIB passed in the first instance almost without consideration , certainly without any man) six of its objects, much les of the provisions for carrying them out "DIC " bill means amalgamation, seemed to be the cry, and Unit was enough Under some incomprehensible impression that amalgamation will produce cheap and prompt law, the lay members of the House simply voted for the measure en bloc, and the most striking feature of their proceedings was the fact that when legal members, who in the nature of things were alone able to give com patent advice, offered opposition and criticism, they were immediately silenced by the sapient exclamation, ' Oh, if the law j ears are against the bill " we will pass it 'Towards such senseless intolerance and rediscount nating folly as this, what face could those who knew something about the matter present? The history of the bill in the Council was no loss unsatisfactory A small band of laymen, aided by one profession in member whose experience did not qualify him to guide, resolved upon an entirely new bill 'they altered every principle embodied 111 the 01 small measure , they " fused the two branches of the profession in place of mci el) amalgamating them, they expressly prevented all) student from learning solely the practice either of the bia 01 of the solicitors office , they injuriously low 01 ed the educational standards for the former, and needlessly) raised the tests for the latter , they shut the door to many intending hamsters by making three years articles obligatory they pro seabed modes of examination that will be mg the whole legal educational system to a standstill if the University authorities is not change their curriculum, they answered a meaningless proviso that the amalgamated pi petitioner shall not be an officer of the court and jet shall be liable to all the pains and penal ties follow 111 upon such 1 position-and in short they produced a conglomeration of inconsistent and unvvitUablo sections which no skilled lawyer could possibly have sanctioned Having done then work of tension in this haphazard fashion, the promoters of the bill seemed its return to the Assembly, and Iii it Chamber a copy d the prodigy with all the complacency of the world, and, deaf to remonstrance and careless of justice, con CHU ed oil hand The result of law making on these lines is more easily imagined than described Vgreiterex hibition of Legislative carelessness, 111 competent), and bungling has rarely reached the statute book It would almost seem that any ladies may now plays tiny whatever property he wills through Parliament, if only he set about his task with address and hold out vague promises of benefit to catch the fancy of the uninformed TaUacy may mean gunny are alike welcomed The change in the political situation yesterday was 11 change now artie peace and not far, as had been anticipated on the previous evening On Wednesday, after the Government had cut what was generally considered that it very sorry figure in the presence of some of its supporters, the feeling among a large number of Opposition members was infavour of the immediate motion of want of conn dence which they had reason to believe would be agreed to in order, however, that no precipitate action might be? taken it was decided to have an Opposition caucus yesterday, and accordingly at 3 o'clock the party) met to discuss the situation in private Mr Gillies was in the chair, and there were about 33 members present. The whole question was discussed, and the older members, who were to be relied upon for sound advice, pointed out that great injury might be done to the public interests if a crisis were to occur at the present juncture The Local Government Bill, which was in fulfilment of a promise of many years standing, had now reached almost its final stage in the Assembly, and, as an adverse vote against the Ministry would inevitably lead Goodisson lution, that bill must be sacrificed in such a motion were carried In addition there were several other measures requiring considers tion, and the question for the caucus to decide was whether or not the Opposition should give its aid to the transaction of business, with the view of dealing with all passing measures, or adopt aggressive tactics and force the Government to the country After a long debate, in which the demand for a dissolu- tion was not only strongly expressed, hue warmly supported, the caucus came to the conclusion that it would be detrimental to the public interest to precipitate a crisis It was accordingly decided that the business before the House should be facilitated, but that the Government should not be allowed to go on with the Railway Management Bill which would be practically new business and which if it were now proceeded with would block more important measures likely to be passed If it were found that the Government did not lead the House in accordance with this programme, the Opposition will re-consider its position with a view of hostile action When it was found that no further com- plication was likely to arise in connection with the political situation yesterday, members of the Assembly devoted themselves earnestly to business, and had a long Hitting A few minutes after half-past 4 the Estimates were proceeded with, and the votes for the Public Works department, Commissioner of Customs, Postmaster General, Minister of Mines, and part of the Minister of Yttitei Supply were disposed of this leaves very little work for committee of supply Such discussions as arose on the items were brief and of a non party character, members on both sides seeming to be actuated by a desire to get rid of the absolute!! necessary business of the session as quickly as possible, so as to be prepared for a dissolution should an appeal to the country be considered necessary at a later stage the more important subjects dealt with were as to the findings of the two courts of marine inquiry in regard to the Chamber and 1 ashy collision, which were strongly condemned by several members, particularly Mr Patterson, Mr I L, Smith, Mr 0 Young, Mr Dixon, and Mr Nimmo The proceedings were declared to be farcical, and the punishment awarded to the captains very inadequate Mr Turner was urged to take further action in the matter, but he pointed out that there was a legal difficulty in the way At any rate he promised it time permitted next session to bring in a bill to amend the law on some important points 'The Bechervaise case was also debated on the votes for the Post office, and an animated discussion arose on the question of irrigation and water supply Ventures Just before half-past 10 o'clock Mr Munro, who had been absent from the Chamber for the evening, returned, and moved that progress be reported to enable new business to be begun that night the motion was agreed to, much to Mr. Patterson s chagrin when he found that the new business was to be on the bill for paving members of the Railways Committee 'The bill was subsequently passed through committee and reported, and the House rose at 25 minutes to 11 The haste shown by the Government in the Assembly last evening to have the bill to remunerate members of the Railway Com- mittee passed was easily understood by members general!) Mr Patterson was greatly annoyed because the matter was brought on late in the evening and showed his indigna- tion in a demand for a division on the principal clause appropriating the necessary fees The clause was as, however, agreed to by 2') votes to 19 On another clause, providing for the payment of expenses in addition to fees, a very sharp discussion arose, Mr Patterson again leading He declared, with some vehemence, that he was impressed with the belief that the committee should consist of non Parliamentary men, and he also announced the startling fact that the bill was sapping the patriotism of the House and lowering the dignity) of every member He had himself been challenged by members of the Railway Committee because of the attitude he had assumed towards the measure, which he considered to be very indecent His attack was replied to by Mr McLean and Mr Turner, who pointed out that the late Government contemplated the payment of members of the committee Mr Patterson, however, would have nothing to do with what was contemplated He was satisfied that no definite promise had been made Subsequently Mr Arm) tage caused some diversion by protesting against the proposed payment " Mein hers," he said were already paid £100 a year, why should they sponge on the country for another £400 ' ' Mr L L Smith led of the cries of " Shame, and then asked the Chairman if the remark was in order. The Chairman jocularly replied that he did not know what sponging on the country " meant, and therefore could not decide the question The clause was passed, and a new proposal li) Mr Gillies to limit the operation of the act to the present Parliament was negatived by 21 votes to 17 Mr Bent, in the fulness of his pride at a hut he considers to be the success so far of the Railway Committee, last night suggested to the Legislative Assembly that a body of a somewhat similar constitution should be appointed to inquire into the expenditure on irrigation works travelling through the country has led him to believe that the farmers will not pay interest on loans, and in the excess of his sorrow he declared that " God only knew what the so called irrigation game of Mr Deakin had thrown upon the country " The farmers could not get water in many instances, and when they did they would not pay for it, so that interest had to be found out of municipal subsidy Mr Deakin was touched on a sensitive point, but somewhat turned the tables upon Mr Bent, by remarking that the late Government had actually proposed that the Railway) C committee should also inquire into irrigation proposals that he would be delighted at any time to see a committee appointed, and that the only failures so far had been in connection with trusts formed under the administration of the O Loughlin Government, of which Mr Bent was a member He was convinced that the farmers would not repudiate that Parliament would not permit them even if they desired to do so and he asserted that where irrigation had had a fair trial it had been remarkably successful Mr Walter Madden also " quizzed the chairman of the Railway Committee as) saying that if the information the committee supplied in regard to railways was no better than that given about irrigation it was not very reliable As a matter of fact, so the hon. member contended, the water trusts were pin mg the interest due by them, and there was not the slightest probability of repudiation Mr Graham endorsed Mr Deakin s statement as to the failure of the water supply schemes based upon the reconciles dations of Messrs Gordon and Black The discussion would have been continued with some warmth but that Mr. Munro moved that progress should be reported Colonel Smith, in bringing up the case of Mr Bechervaise in the Legislative Assembly last night, was not the Colonel Smith who moved for the select committee some months ago. He was mild mannered and moderate, and had nothing to say in denunciation of the Deputy) Postmaster General, who figured in his previous speech as a tyrant and an oppressor All that Colonel Smith wished to urge last night was that the Postmaster General should see that justice was done to Mr Bechervaise, in regard to whom the committee had reported that he should have had a chance of showing whether or not he was fit for the position to which it was alleged Mr Caldwell had been improperly) appointed It came rather as a surprise to the House to hear Mr Foster, who was one of the members of the select com- mittee, declare that its appointment had not been justified except in so far as it had been proved that the Public Service Board had appointed the right man to the right place when it selected Mr Caldwell Mr Derhnra commented upon the mill and water report submitted by the committee, and expressed the hope that the proceedings would be a warning to members not to bring up such involotts cases in future Mr Bechervaise was described by the hon. gentleman as one who ought to be happy, but was a firm malcontent, and it was not desirable that such officers should, be encouraged to sow dissension in the service Later on Mr Duff) praised Mr Caldwell as well as the Deputy) Postmaster General, but sad nothing material as to the issue raised by Mr. Bechervaise When. he had concluded Mr Derham remarked sharp) that he should have shown more firmness at the outset, and not have allowed the committee to be appointed Colonel Smith caught the contagion and warmly asserted that Air Dcrltam, during his term of office, had been nothing more than is subordinate to his officers has brought from Mr Derham the retort that Colonel Smith thought only of Ballarat, and did not care anything about the interests of the colony The subject soon after was allowed to drop, to the evident satisfaction of the Ballarat contingent, who had championed Mr Bechervaise s complaint. The President of the Legislative Council, Sir James MacBain, entertained the members of the Legislative Council and a number of leading citizens at a dinner at the Australian Club yesterday evening His Ex- called) the Governor was the guest of the occasion The toasts were the Queen' and the Governor, and the rules of the club were transgressed upon to a certain extent to admit of the host

yesterday into sectional committees to consider reports on country lines, and they " deliberated in the absence of the press a 1 committee spent the greater part of the day in discussing a line

Fullarton, who is now recovering from a very severe attack of influenza, has been granted 12 months' leave of absence by the Harbour Trust, but this leave does not affect his position as president of the Marine Board He is not yet well enough to resume his duties in connection with the board, and has now been granted leave of absence till the 31st of next month It is suspected that Mr. Robert Beni, the Vice president of the board, will leave the colony for a trip to Europe early next month, and under the circumstances it is said that some difficulty will be encountered by the Government in
