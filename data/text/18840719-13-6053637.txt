The deceased was brother of the late Mr John Murchison, a very old Victorian colonist "Major Murchison was descended from a gallant old military family His father, the late Captain Murchison, joined the 78th High landers m 1792 nt Fort George, and served in that regiment until 1812 when he was transferred to the 3rd Royal Veterans. Altogether, he served his country for nearly 40 years. Captain Murchison was highly respected in Inverness where he lived for many years, and died in 1855\. Major Murchison was one of five sons, all ot whom entered the army. The deceased joined the 3rd Foot Guards in 1822. In 1831 he was transferred as Serjeant-Major to the 29th Regiment. Eight years later he was presented with a commission as ensign, and in 1840 he was appointed adjutant of that corps, which position he filled till promoted to a company in 1845. The Major was present at the battle of Forogeshah (horse wounded). At Sobroon, on the 10th February, 1846 he was selected by Sir Walter Gilbert and Brigadier Taylor to command three companies of the 29tb Regiment, and three of the Goorkah battalion to advance and drive in Sikh out posts, and he was badly wounded at the close of the day. He also served in the campaigns of 1848 and 1849. He was in the general action of Chillian-Wallah, and had the honour of carrying with his company (the Grenadiers) a Sikh battery of six guns, and subsequently he recaptured some guns that had been lost by the British artillery, in which 34 out of his company were killed and wounded. Deceased was also present in the general action of Goojerat. He gained a medal and one clasp for the Sutlej campaign, and a medal and clasps for that of 1848 and 1849\. Major Murchison has left a widow and family. His only son, Adjutant-Lieut. Kenneth Murchison, is in the Royal Artillery."
