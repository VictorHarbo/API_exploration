The smart little topsail-schooner Marv upih io re turned from Norfolk and Lord Howe islands )esbT- day with mails, passengers and cargo. On this occasion the little vessel has boeu absent from p».rt a littlu over a month, having cleared r-ydney Heads on Jaiitiarv 31, at 1 p.m. Captain Garth reports that the winds were vC-ry unsteady oil the run to Lord .Howe L-iand. but the ves.wl madc.fair heaJwav and w.u off the Bland at 4 a.m. on. February 5. Captain Garth ran his vessel close tip to the Island and remiJned there fur 13 hours, and then us night was approaching und none of the 'boats had ventured off from the shore to pilot iiini iu, he determined to go on to Nor folk Lil.ind. From Lord Howe Island t o llc.jteful Island, chiefly south-cast and eu.se soutb-oa.-t winds were met with, uud although the little vessel was jammed nearly all thclwayj she made very guud time, arriving! oil tbo island on February 9. The Mary Ogilvie anchored on the following day on the west siiie of tho Island, and the passengers and muils were landed tho next morning. Strong south-vast ntid east-south-east winds cuutinticd at the Eland, ami it was not until February 15 that the vessel could be boarded by one of the whale-boats from the C.iic.oh-s containing the pilot, the vessel having been kept dodging about tho Island for eight days. «Jn the 17th a start was made to land the cargo; but alter one boatload had left theiworl: had to be stopped iu con sequence of nn accident— two of the isianders en gaged discharging the freight being washed off the rucks. Fortunately, the men were go.H swimmers, and they were rescued little or none the worse fur their immersion. Uu the 18th, the whtd shifting, tho schoouer had to get under weigh again and proceed to the opposite side of tho istand. where the remaindv-r of the cargo was lanuvd. Tho schooner then made preparation for her return trip, und got under weigh lur Lord Howe Island at 7 p.m. on Saturday, the 19th. Fresh South-east wind.: were fallen in with, and full advautagc was taken of them, but uufortuuatoly -the topgallant sail nud square-ail "came in" themselvc, proving a great loss to the Schooner. Nevertheless excellent time w-s made, and the vc.wl arrived off: Lord II owe island at S p.m. ou the 22uJ, but the weather being thick and dirty, with heavy rain, she was hove-to until daylight. '1 be following day the Mary Ugilvio entered tuo Harbor by the north passage, aud Captain Garth learnt thai the reason why the boats did not put off ou the pa-sage down was owiug to the heavy sea rnuning, which pre vented tneir going through tho reef. >Mrong scuth- ea?t aud east-south-east winds coutlnucd during the stav of- tho rcasel at the island. The schooner left Lord liowe Island ut 1 p.m. on-Ttie.sday, March s. ami met with modenite north-north-west wind- all the way to port, tiho arrived off the ile.els at 8 p.m. ou Friday, making the splendid passage of 56 hours, or a little over live days from Noriolk Island, This is a capital' performance, and is another go. d proof that the schooner still retaiusher reputation in the matter of sailing. AKIUYAL OE THE GAUONNE. This steainsliip, of the Grieutlino, added another of the many successful voyages she has made between 1/jitdon and this port, yesterday bringing a number of pas.sciigcr3 and a large general cargo. The Garonne entered tbo Heads shortly after 7 o'clock, ami w.lis at once taken nlongsido the Circular tuay. No time was lost in lifting the hatches, aud during the day tho cargo wub being rapidly discharged. It L expected that the Garonne will bo "out" early n-xt week, ami she will then go off to tho moorings iu Neutral Bvy to make room for the new Orient liner Ormuz. which takes up her runuing, sailing hcucc ou the 26th inst. The present vovagc of tho Garonne has- been accomplished in good time. The mails brought otil by the ship reached Sydney by special train from Melbourne on Sunday last, f-evcral d.i;.s in advance of contract time.

Thence the winds were light and variable to l'ort Said. After coaling, the Garonne entered tho canal at 11 p.m. on the 3rd ult. uud anchored at .SU'./. at 7 p.m. on the 4th tilt. Some 330 bags of mails anl eight packages were received, aud the voyage was resumed at 9 p.m. same date. Light north-vast monsoons were carried to lat. 2dcg. south, and lung. C6dcg. cast.
