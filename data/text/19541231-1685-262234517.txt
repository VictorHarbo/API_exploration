HOPES FOR MORE NATURALISATIONS Mr. Holt disclosed that from January 1, 1946 to June 30 this, year 23,769 non- Brltlsh migrants; were naturalised.

As the great inflow of such migrants began, in 1949, it is only now that they are becoming eligible to apply in substantial numbers. ‘,‘The rate of application Is now about four times what It wjas oiie year ago, and each month Is showing an ln crebie.” Mr. 'Holt said the Govern men.t had. spent £19,350,000 on assisted passages for British nijgrgnts and £8,877,000 for non-Brltisl} people. JEWS IN GERMAN QUOTA . Political observers here are reluctant to comment about these figures, pointing out that the number of German migrants, for Instance, - also. Includes people of former German nationality, such as Jews. They say that origin ally, migrants admitted to Australia from Germany, were people who had been deprived of their nationality by Hit ler, But for purposes of sta tistics they were regarded as Germans. These observers say that one reason why the number of British migrants was not larger Is the heavy cost of transport and their demands for superior accommodation in Australia. The statistics show that although the num ber of British migrants was smaller than that of non British settlers, the Govern ment spent more than twice as much on their assisted pas sages.
