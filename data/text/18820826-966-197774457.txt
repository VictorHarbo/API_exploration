I believe in the Sacred Scripture, as being the Word of God or the Divine Truth itself; winch is ' the fountain of wisdom to angels and men, and is>. able to make me wise unto salvation. I believe that, if I would be saved, I must shun all evils as sins against God, and live a life according to the Ten Commandments. I believe that when I die as to my natural body I shall rise again in a spiritual body, and shall ba judged according to my works; and that if I am good, I shall go to heaven and become an angel,4n# be happy for ever; but if I am wicked, I shall go to bell and become an infernal spirit, and be miserable for ever. \- I believe that now is the time of the Second Coming of the Lord and of the commencement of the New Church, called the New Jerusalem., 147t PUBLIC NOTICES ONT FORGET the LAND LEAGUE D MEETING at the TOWN HALL on MON- DAY Evening, 28th inst. 233-40z MEETING of PLUMBERS, GAS- A FITTERS, and IRONWORKERS- -will lie held at the SIR JOHN BARLEYCORN HOTEL on MONDAY, Angust 2S, to consider. the desirability of forming a Trade Society. 237"40z AMALGAMATED SOGEETY OF ENGINEERS, Adelaide and Port Branches.— The TESTIMONIAL to Mr. WHITEHILL will be PRESENTED on TUESDAY, August 29, at 9 p.m., at the METROPOLITAN HALL, Grote-street. x GENERAL MEETING, of tlie A SOUTH AUSTRALIAN COACHBUILDEBS' CRICKETING ASSOCIATION will be held at the Plough and Harrow on Monday,.-at 8 o'clock, to finally arrange all Delegates.
