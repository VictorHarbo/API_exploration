EMIGRATION. VICTORIA'S FORWARD POLICY. SCANDINAVIAN?" AND DANCES WANTED. Melbourne, January 26. the Victorian Government contemplate! an extension of immigration operations to. European countries other than Great Britain, and efforts are being made to induce farm workers in Denmark and Scandinavia to come out to this country. It is considered that Scandinavians and Danes would be suited to Victorian conditions and an answer to farming. The Ministry, with a view to the adoption of the new method in regard to importation of farm laborers, has issued a circular to farmers throughout the State police to og information as to their labor requirements for the current year. Numbers of immigrants who have come from England as I farm laborers have been found to be quite inexperienced and unsuitable for work in the country, and they have drifted back to the towns and found employment in hotel rouseabouts, kitchen men, &c.; These are poor advertisements for State immigration, and it is felt that measures should be taken to ensure that future arrivals are competent to under- take the work for which they are intended. If it is possible to secure suitable Britishers the department will give them preference, for it does not want to be charged with having unpatriotic methods. The Danish Government do their best to encourage immigration, and the immigration officers who will shortly visit that country will necessarily have to operate quietly. Another feature of the Government's immigration policy is a new arrangement which will permit of friends and relatives of country settlers coming to this country at reduced rates. The department, however, intends to discourage the importa- tion of persons who prefer to remain in cities rather than go to country districts.
