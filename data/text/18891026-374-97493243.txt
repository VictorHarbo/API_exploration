Brisbane October 25. STONEWALLING CONTINUED. In the Assembly the stonewalling tactics of the Opposition were continued all day after a night's sitting, until the usual time for the House meeting this afternoon, when the speaker took the chair and the chairman of committee reported progress. OUTRAGE IN PARLIAMENT. Immediately, on the House resuming, Sir S. W. .Griffith moved its adjournment to call attention to a ruffianly outrage com mitted on a stranger |during the previous night's sitting, which was alike a disgrace to the country and to Parliament, and was all the more marked by the fact that the stranger was well known to be an enemy of the Government. A long debate followed, in which Government strongly denied any knowledge of the matter, but the speeches of members on the Opposition side sbowed there was truth in Sir S. W. Griffith's concluding remarks that no one who durirg the debate had watched the faces of the occupants of the Ministeral benches could have any doubt who the guilty party was. The outrage alluded to was that a stranger was incited to the Parliamentary refreshment room by members of the House, and while he was asleep on a chair had been mutilated with a pair of scissors. Very strong feeling was shown during the debate over the matter, every one admitted that the offender had committed a blackgardly action, and de served expelling from the House. The motion tor adjournment of the House was negatived on the voices. FAT STOCK MARKET.

It has, however, to be sub mitted to like many other evils. It is hoped the Opposition members will soon tire. For oiuv.p^ii^re dso-noJt think the question at isBue dhe" ofgreat importance. To vote a million for unspecified railways ja not a large or unsafe venture, particularly when not a penny, we are assured, can be spent until the authority of Parliament has been obtained, and.then it can only "be spent onparHculat^SWork sanctioned by Parliament. It injurious as is the bad practice of voting for ft tseries, of. railways in globo, i which haB been dolse by a Liberal Govern-,,' ment and party before now. We hope the' present deadlock will soon cease, and that the session will speedily be brought to a -close.' " ' ? * "■ "The ••Conqueror" Shears have the Aus tralian record, 209 sheep shorn in one day.

Mr. Crookston, of Toowootnba, and the ReV. Mr. Aldep,;of Dalby,-;who had baeu deputed by the Presbytery of Too wootnba to visit Roma. The visit had, we understand, reference so church matters. The rev. gentlemen returned yesterday. On Tuesday night last Bishop Dawes arrived in Roma, and next morning went by train to Charleville. The right rev. gentleman is, we understand, on a confirma tion tour, bat his trip will be extended to jpupnatnulla and Thargomindah, returning to Charleville byway of Adavale.

On his return Bishop Dawes will hold confirmation services at Roma,where the incumbent, the Rev. Mr. Tatham, is now preparing candidates. The Department of^ Agricnltore will shortly remove to the old Immigration Depdt in William-street, Brisbane, where it is intended tb fown, in connection with the department,: a jhristie)n' ot agricultural, horticultural, and botanical products, im plements,--^.,-for the instruction-of-our farmers and others. The Under Secretary being of opinion that i&oaels.of; the various implements of agriculture could, with a ad vantage to the farmers, be placed in the musuem which will be formed, is prepared to receive from implement makers, who may be disposed .to. place.at the disposal of the department,' photographs, drawings, and working ..models of the latest designs of agricultural implements, &c.; Specimens of all kiuds suitable for exhibition and in struction in agriculture, horticulture, or botany will also be received, Any further particulars desired in. connection, with the foregoing scheme will be gladly giren by the Under Secretary for Agriculture. The other day, Mr. Benjamin Leach received one of McCorinick's reaper and binder of latest design and with all recent improvements. It now awaits the arrival of a properly qualified fitter to be sent up by the agents to put the machine together, when it will be immediately set to work. It is feared that a portion of the wheat crop will be ready for harvesting before the machine is ready to cut it, and if so that fact is much to be regretted. The last few days of warm clear weather have ripened the wheat wonderfully, and some of it is fit to cut now. The crops are excellent. Themachine, it is intended, will be put to work on Mr. F. Bourne's farm ; after that is cut it will be taken to Mr. O'Malley's place, on Cattle Creek, and then perhaps to Mr. Keiseker's, but the heaviest work will be at "Readjng," Mr. Leache's own farm stead, where 117 acres will soon be ready for cutting. We learn that Mr. Leach is also obtaining a steam threshing machine, which is expected to arrive in the coarse of next month. The present favorable season has restored the confidence of our farmers in the agricultural capabilities of this dis- trict. With favorable seasons there is no sort of doubt we can grow almost anything, and plenty of it. Also with favorable seasons it is not one reaper and one threshing machine that will be required but fifty. •^T hospital hfM 3^'aa^^^tnoo^fcfflee ten(, opined fffir the siiSy ^^bSohcr'fl^ the Inst^tio^^t of .wi%d^4l «W 5^??^?r aSni^LQf ' r r<)N W^nes^r TSls. lllrriby, Ira'teiriaiul^ from previous day charged with stealing a 1 brown gelJing, *4»; .again brought „befofo"T .. • Mr. .Perry wa^ put io .^t^ie 'wltness-bosPand stated that after interview in{fSornby~again he^TOi|U ldenfify ^iim as * majy^p^iJoldi hin\ytK|%o^e^«JE8^fprd/ The prison er'was committedlOTlirial'at*the ■ next sittings ofthe District jQoort at -Roma.
