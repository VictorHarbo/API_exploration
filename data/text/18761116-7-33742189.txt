Bbowh lef^ Sydney fn,October 34\. She had light; wjnds at starting,.bnt suc ceeded in passing Cape Howe op the 27th.. On lete anb at midiu^it war off Kelt's, Group, when a sUong BonUi-weat gale cui?menced, before the force of which-the vessel was laying to under Pyramid Sock. It blew so^heayily that at daylight 4?. the 30tJi the master ran her «otride t£e Gconp v and hove-to under a balanced-reefed mainsail. On November 1 the weaker moderated, and the wind shifed to fioutii-east. On November 4 passed Wilson's Promontory, and next day sighted Gape Otway light, when, the wind shifted suddenly toifest norjii-^est, and blew a full gale, which lasted fa fix. days. During its continuance a heavy sea was shipped, pry which bulwarks yrere amashed, and ti)ie hrigaotine labored so heavily that tine bobstay was carried away, and tjhree lanyardsof the foreriggingtooke. It blewhard till the 11th, when Cape Jaffa was sighted.! At midnight the wind backed to W2T.W, and; the vessel was again hove-to. She eveotnaUyj got a slant, sighted Cape WOloughby on tiie 14th, and on the next day had a lead through Back* atairs Passage. ! The OoLLoroBOVE had a night of very'bad . weaflier after making Cape Borda on Mwaiay, but it was verypleasant on Wednesday dom ing, when aistnmg breeze set in which took her to ttie roads. The vessel looks but little changed. On he? list of passengers will be noted some ' colonuts. returning from visits to the old oonhtry. The treatment of her people daring the voyage has been so excel lent that a flattering testimonial to that effect was presented to,the master shortly before Die termination of the passage. The ship left London on August 23 r and had a ' norjflierly wind to take her clear of the channel. Bather a startling Bpisode occurred when off ~ ftpygmp^a, where a steamet Inatromy dkcaped 'rttmungtnto'her, and, fceforte she ,had -steamed itS, ran fonl of a Bhip and caused considerable ; 4amaM.

On the 18th was off 4he Gape in 38? 30' south latitude, and on the 31st passed rPfc. Panbl. The passage of the Southern Ocean was marked by much stormy weather,, but no serious damage was sustained. The only loss being a jibboom and a lot of small spars. On reaching the anchorage the vessel was kept nnderw^y to await a fag, but al tfte afternoon passed^away she anchored, to.ataait the next dayj? wde.
