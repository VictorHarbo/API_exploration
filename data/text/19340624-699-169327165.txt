On November 11th, 1871, trie 'Cospatrick' lhe Lo,painck . 1^00 Jo™. was joggjng along to the soutti'ard ot the Cape with a light Nor'-west wind on the quarter, it was the middle watch. Suddenly there came the wild cryot 'Fire' from forward Soon the whole ship was en veloped In smoke, which was pouring up tbrougn the lore. peak hatch which contained the Bos'n's stores, consist ing of such Inflammable material as oakum, rope, oil and paint. The Ore engine was rigged as quickly as possible, and for a time it looked as though the tire would be conquered, but somehow ur other, whether from negligence on the part of those In charge, or because tne sheets and running gear of the sails on the foremast had been burnt through, the ship came up bead to wind, and the men at the fire engine were driven back by dense clouds ot black smoke In a short while flames began to burst lortn in the tween-decKs, through every scuttle bole and air vent. The starboard water boat was lowered away, but as soon as she touched the water the frenzied immigrants piled over the aiae Into her, and she was soon capsized. The long boat caught fire whilst she was being swung out of her chocks; and in the end only two boats got sately clear of the ship the first with 42 and the second with 39 souls on board. THE 'Cospatrlck' did not sink until some 38 hours otter the outbreak of the fire One can hardly imagine the horror of those 36 hours. As the Qames sped alt, the people left on the ship crowded on to the poop. The shrieks ot the luckless wretches who still remained alive never ceased The boats dare not. approach to pick them up. as they were already overcrowded. Lastly, the Captain was seen to throw nls wife overboard and spring alter tier himseu. Nothing but a charred and smoking hull, trie 'Cospattsck ' sank beneath the waves. The two boats managed to keep together until lhe night m the 21st, when it came on to blow. The Second Mate's boat survived the night, but the other was never heard ol again. On the 27tb they were picked up by the 'British Sceptre.' The Second Mate and two able seamen were the only survivors out of 473 souls.
