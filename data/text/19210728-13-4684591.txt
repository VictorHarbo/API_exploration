The cost case of the Port Pirie smelters, said Mr Somerset, depended upon the attainment of smelting costs which would give the indus" try a reasonable profit when compared with that obtainable Ivy exporting concentrates overseas. Attractive offers- for Australian silver-lead ore- and concentrates had al- , ready been made by European ore buyer-, , who were favored by the slump in freight! rates, and the economic and international exchange conditions. The proposals were that the men should either work Schemes instead of 14 hours, and receive the present rates of pay, or continue to work 44 hours nally and receive 44 hours pay, instead of 48 hours' pay for 44 hours' work, as at present. these terms would be recon- sidered before December 31, 1921. The acceptance of the company's proposals would necessitate a joint application to the Court by three of the four unions on cerned, and also by the company. 2 The proposals submitted are being referred by the representatives to their various unions for consideration.
