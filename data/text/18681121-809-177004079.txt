II. SPURGEON. ' Sanctify thorn through Thy truth.' — John xvii. 17. Sanoiiflcation begins in re generation. The Spirit of God infuses into man that now living principle by which ho bocomca ' a now creature' in Ohrim Jesus. This work, which bogles In tbo now birth, is carried on in two ways— mortifi- cation, whereby tho luata of tho flesh are Buirtuod nud kopt under; and viviflcation, by which tho life which God has put within ua is made to bo n well of water springing up unto overlaeting life. This iB carried on every day in what is callod ' perseverance,' by which the ObrlBtiania presorred and continued iua gracious state, and ia made to abound in good works unto the pralso and glory of God ; and it culminates or comeB to perfection in ' glory,' when tho bouI, boing thoroughly purged, is caught up to dwell with holy beings at tho right hr.nd of tho Majesty on high. But while tho Spirit or God Ib thus tho author of ranctia cation, yet thoro ia a visible agency employed which must not bo forgotten. '? Sanctify them,' said Jesus, 'through thy truth. Thy word ia truth.' Tho pas sages of Pcriptnro which prove that tho instrument of ourBanctiflcationis tho Word of God aro very many. Tho Snirit of God brings to our minds the precepts and doctrines of truth, and applies them with power. These are heard In tho ear, and beiug received in tho heart, they work in us to will and to do of God's good pleasure. Tho truth ia the sanctiQer, and if we do not hear or read tho truth, wo shall not grow in sancti flcation. Wo only progress in Bound living aB we progress in Bound understanding. ' Thy word is a lamp unto my feet find a light unto my paths.' Do not pay of any error, ' It ia a more matter of opinion.' No man indulges an error of judgment, without Booner orlator tolerating an error iu practice. Hold fast the truth, for by so holding tho truth shall you be sanctified by tho Spirit of God.
