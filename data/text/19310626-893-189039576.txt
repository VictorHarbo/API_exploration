NORSE FLIERS TRIUMPH. Two Immigrants Going, Home for Visit. ROMANTIC MEETING. Berlin, Thursday. Otto Hillig and Holger Holries, two Norsemen, who left St, John's, Newfoundland, 10 hours after Post and Gatty took off, made a forced landing at Krefeld aerodrome at 5.30 p.m. They refuelled and immediately took off for Copenhagen. rTHEY stated they lost their way fly ing across Spain and France. Bad weather obliged them to fly 13 hours 12,000 feet above the clouds. They descended, in the morning, and flew close the sea, until they sighted the coast of Spain, They 1 crossed the German frontier late in the afternoon and landed at Krefeld after 32 hours' flying, averaging 1125 miles an hour. They said they subsis ted on chocolate. The absence of news of these trans Atlantic fliers caused great anxiety at Copenhagen and St John's, as tbey should have landed in the morning, and were not reported after leaving Newfoundland at 3.30 a.m. on Wednes day. 1 Zeppelin Disappointment.
