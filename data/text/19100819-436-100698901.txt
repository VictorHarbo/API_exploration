In a. letter' to a Melbourne newspaper advocating the 'con- struction or excavation of. tanks and ?other reservoirs, he. winds up as follpw^s:— 'My ad v ica is, ' D am ! d am ! and pray for w is- dom.'

The Postal Department is nothing if hot1 economical. The other day a case was re l-orted of a man attending the telephone requirements of somo rural centre, who received as three months' pay something xinder two shillings and sixpence. Presum ably^ he did no more than half-a-crown's worth gf work, but 10/ per annum is not an extravagant retaining fee even if the ' billet were a sinecure. The case of Lhe telephone man, however, is distanced in connection with a little incident which oc curred last weak. The Tuin'ut Municipal. Council seems to have been of opinion that the telegraph posts in themunicipul ity should be painted, whereupon the. De- partment suggested that the expense of the work should be divided between the Government and the Council.

'drought' docs not necessarily mean total absence of rain, but only that there1 will bo loss rain than the nvorago.

It will be remerh-i: 'bere.d that Mr. /Wragge founded . his nror; phecies largely upon the bearing; of sun spots on the weather. This is 'what Mr. ?Barrachi has to say on theT subject :— 'The1 spots, on tho face of the sun were a source .of .cpnsiderablo anxiety to astronomera, because it was supposed they wera mani festations, of' solar activity,' with which ??terrestrial phenomena were associated. 7t hadn been suggested that rainfall was one j of the phenomena, but no theory on this subject had been sufficiently advanced to enable it to be .accepted without hesita tion. This was not a matter for ono man to. dilate upon authoritatively.' This ver.y,:: closely resembjes what, in popular parlance is described as 'a knock' for Mr. Wragge. It seems to show that in the opinion of the Government Astron omer at all events sunsnots and ,sunshino have, not much to do with, the rainfall,,, and that therefore the poposite theory savours not a little of what a'! former; Mavor of ' Albiiry Once snmewh«tdrrever-i enfcly characterised as 'Moonshine..''vn{; -r '.# .???:??;.;,:?;??.?;.?,;: .: ?*?:!:; :.;,»'-,[,,?,[ ?*?!'??'?!?' ?:-'-?', An Australian ppety in ;a: poem iwhidl is.;, one, pf the best or the 'kind, ever., published, in the : Commonwealth j deplores' the , '{in*1 happy consequences 'that sometimes', resiilt' from..'; being 'Misunderstood.
