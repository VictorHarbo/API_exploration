G. SILVA, in introducing himself to the public, under the style of J. G. SILVA and CO., begs to tender his thanks for the benefit he has derived from their handsome support to the firm of E. Moses and Son, and he avails himself of this opportunity to announce his intention of con- ducting his business on those principles, so widely known and approved, which have ever characterised the commercial transactions of the distinguished house with which he has had the honor of being connected. Mr. J. G, Silva would, in giving this assurance, at the some time mention that his business will consist of a general import trade, for which he respectfully solicits a share of public pa- tronage. In anticipation of establishing himself in this business, Mr. J. G. Silva did, on his visit to England last year, make arrangements for shipments to him of general merchandise per Mermaid, Earl of Sefton, and other early vessels. The offices of Messrs. J. G. Silva and Co. are, pro tem., at the stores of Messrs. E. Moses and Son. (Signed) J. G. SILVA and CO. Lonsdale-street west, 11th February, 1856. NOTICE - Retiring from Business. - Messrs. E. MOSES and SON, before retir- ing from the Australian import trade, desire to convey their warmest thanks to their nu- merous friends and the public for the very kind and highly flattering patronage which has attended their mercantile career in these colonies, and for the complete success which has crowned their humble efforts. Appreciating the importance of an aug- mented commercial reputation, they estab- lished a wholesale branch in the metropolis of the Southern Hemisphere, and they are truly and deeply sensible of the liberal sup- port which has accompanied their exertions. Their Melbourne establishment will be wound up with all convenient despatch, but they regret extremely that circumstances of a private character should require the discon- tinuance of so lucrative a business. Messrs. E. Moses and Son venture to ex- press the hope that the same favor which has been lavished on them will be extended to Mr. J. G. Silva, to whom this business has been disposed of, and who will establish him- self here under the style of J. G. Silva and Co. ; they likewise beg to solicit for their London house a continuance of the support of importers here, who may depend on all com- mands (especially for every description of Boots, and Shoes, and Clothing) being promptly executed ; having gained consider- able experience during their four years im- mediate connection with the Australian markets, they feel competent to complete all orders with perfect satisfaction to their con- stituents. .

Since the first introduction o; moveable types, their comjiosition, as far as can be I ascertained, has been jirecisely the same as ; that now in general, use. The facilities of ; machinery-tho long numbers of popular jiiiblications, all pointed to the necessity of a more durable material; this Messrs. Besley ¡nul Co., with the assistance of an eminent metallurgist, have succeeded in producing. Ihcy therefore confidently .recommend the adoption of their founts cast in this new metal, as jiosscssing a power of resisting pres- sure (asfar as can be demonstrated by aseries of the most severe tests) ten times greater than any type cast with the ordinary metal, besides the advantage of preserving the sharp- ness of the general impression for a much longer time. . . The prime cost of this metal being consi- derably more than the ordinary type metal, the following arc the jirices at which founts ol'120 lbs. and upwards can be supplied : s. d. s. d. English ... 1 4 Minion ... 2 0 Pica . 1 6 Emerald ... 3 8 Small Pica... 1 8 Nonpareil 3 0 Long Primer 110 Ruby ... 4 2 Bourgeois ... 2 0 Pearl ... 4 9 Brevier ... 2 8 Diamond... 8 0 Messrs.
