DANES FOR AUSTRALIA, AN IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL. Count Sponneck is at present on a visit to Victoria with a view of finding encouragement for agriculturists from Denmark to settle in the State. In the course of an interviey he said the laud available for cultivation in Den mark was very limited, and the system of peasant proprietorship prevailing tended to make it increasingly difficult for young farmers to secure holdings. Tlio l^nnifili Afinis+ar fn-r A rrT«i^iil+n»'/i had had to step in to stop exploitation of the people by American and Cana dian private companies, who, by glow ing promises of tree lands and home steads, coupled with flamboyant mis representations, had inveigled thou sands of Scandinavians across the At lantic. In the majority of instances, having been bled of fees and generally fleeced, they had been left stranded. In Denmark at the present time, es pecially in Jutland, said Count Spon neck, the eyes of would-be emigrants were being turned towards Australia. The material was at hand, and he could guarantee to bring out annually 300 Danish farmers, of whom the State would have reason to be proud. For the first two years they would work as farm laborers, and then, with the capi tal they brought with them plus their savings, they would take up land and work it. Count Sponneck added, that he had laid the proposition before the Chief Immigration Officer, who had promised \\.\J OUUllIlt It bU -Ul. UlUUaiUj XUlillOLCJ for Agriculture. Briefly, it was that he be commissioned to set out for Cop enhagen annually, and spend one month in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden re spectively. Ho proposed to accompany each batch of immigrants and super vise them after their arrival here un til such time as they were' all placed in situations. He did not desire to work as an agent, but as the represen tative of the Victorian Government, furnished with full credentials bearing the impress of the Government. The cost, ne said, would be extremely moderate.
