Troubles of a Dog Have Nearly Ended The troubles of a dog which has spent many months at sea, has been shipwrecked and cast ashore in the South Seas, and has been declared a prohibited im- migrant" have nearly ended. The dog is a German boxer hound, which arrived at Melbourne yesterday from Vanikoro Island, in the Santa Cruz group in the Pacific, by the steamer Durour. The dog was owned by a Danish member of a scientific expedition which journeyed to the South Seas in the schooner -Monsoimen, which was wrecked on Vanikoro Island some months ago. He was given to Mr.' Crawford, the district officer on the island, in return for his kindness to the marooned owner. Mr. Crawford decided to take the dog with him to England when he left the island on furlough, and, making his plans in advance, he sent the dog to Melbourne in the care of Captain Baxter, master of the steamer Durour. When the Durour reached Melbourne quarantine officials would not allow the dog to land and it had to return to the island. Mr. Crawford decided to make another attempt to get the dog to England, with the result that it again arrived on the Durour, which regularly brings kauri logs from Vanikoro to Melbourne. This time permission has been obtained to land the dog at Sydney, where it will remain for two weeks until it can be shipped to England. Captain Baxter said yesterday that he believed that the permit would be altered to allow the dog to be shipped from Melbourne.
