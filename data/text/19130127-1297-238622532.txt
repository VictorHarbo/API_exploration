EXTENDED IMMIGRATION. ' . VICTORIA GOES TO EUROPE. MELBOURNE, Sunday.â€” The Victorian Go vernment contemplates the extension of immi gration operations to European- countries other than Great Britain, and efforts are being mado to induce farm workers m uenmarx ana ocan- dinavla to come out to. this country. It is considered that Scandinavians and Danes would be suited to Victorian conditions, and an asset to tho farming community. The Minister, .with a view -to adopting a now method with regard to the importation of farm laborers, has Issued a circular to farmers throughout the State, soliciting Information as to their labor requirements for tho current year. A number of immigrants who have come from England as farm laborers have been found to be quite in experienced, and unsuitable for work In tho country; and they have drifted back to the towns, and found employmont as- bote rouse- nbouts, kltchenmen, etc. These are a poor ad vertisement for State immigration; and it is felt that some precautionary measures should bo taken to ensure that future arrivals, are competent to undertake tho work for which they, are intended. , If it is possible to secure suitable Britishers, tho department will give them preference, for it doss not want to be charged with haying un patriotic motives. The Danish Government does its best to discourage emigration, and the im migration officers, who will shortly visit that .country, will necessarily have to operate quietly. Another feature of the Government's future Immigration policy is a new arrangement, which -will permit of friends and relatives of country settlors coming to this " country at reduced rates. The department, however, Intends to discourage the importation of persons who pre fer to remain In tho cities rather than go to tho country districts.
