FOREIGN MIGRATION. SOp FACTS AND FIGURES. The Impression is widespread that persons of foreign birth are entering Australia in numbers so large as to menace the preservation of the greponderant British element of our population.- On this subject the Prime Minister's Department in Melbourne reports as follows:— The Present Position. For the three and a half years ended {September, 1921, the average annual ei eess of arrivals in,, over departures from' .Australia, of British peoples was 29,120. During the same-period, the -average an imal excess of arrivals over departures of persons of foreign birth ins 4,610, and average annual increase in the population by excess of births over deaths was 82,000. Assuming that only 20,000 Britons (a de crease of 9,120 on the- above figure) come here each year during the next decade, »nd that 20,000 aliens (an increase oE 15,390 on the figure above given) are ad mitted annually during the same period; also assuming that the natural increase in the population remained stationary, the British population of Australia at the 'end of 10 years woufd represent 96 per cent, of the total — a dilution of the pre sent British preponderance to the extent of only 2 per cent. In all probability, however, the British assisted migrants will (when the new agreement about to be entered into by the British and Common wealth Governments and the Governments pi the six States is in operation) show an increase over the number who arrived during the period above stated. The num ber of unassisted British migrants is un likely to decrease. It is safe to assume that the gain by natural increase, which is generally cumulative, will also be greater in the future. From present in dications, in view of the agreements be tween the Commonwealth and certain foreign Governments to restrict the issue pf passports or the granting of visas, it is likely to be some years before the number pf foreign arrivals reaches 20,000 a year. The Italian Government^ has agreed to limit the granting of passports to persons nominated by persons in Australia, and who possess £40 each. In the case of Greeks, Jngo-SIavs, and Albanians, the . British authorities, at the request of the 'Commonwealth Government, are limiting the granting of visas to passports to 100 a, month' in each case, and visas will not j-e granted to persons unless they are in -drridually in possession of £40. . The Foreign Element. The census of April, 1921, showed per sons in Australia not born here, or in the British Mes or New Zealand, numbered 139,073 (slightly over 2J per. cent). The number owning allegiance to foreign Gov ernments was 48,529 (or .03 per cent). During the last few years, and particu larly since July, 1924 (when the latest Immigration Restriction Act (TT.S-A.) .came into operation) there has been a quicker movement of peoples from south ern Europe to Australia. During the three and a half years ended September last, the excess of arrivals over departures of , foreign-born immigrants numbered 16,148 (equal to 11.6 per cent, of the total foreign-born persons in Australia at the 1921 census). The following table par jticularizes this migration: — Excess of arrivals over Rationality. Departure*. Ifalei. Females. Persons.

' An Interesting Table. The action of the- United States in adopt ing the quota system to restrict the flow *sf immigration to that country has diverted ' immigrants from certain Euro-. 'pean countries to Australia. In the light of- this fact, .the following table of excess of arrivals over departures of persons of various European nationalities, July 1, 1924,. to November 30, 1924 (five months)* is interesting: — Nationalities.

During the three and a half years ended September last, excess arrivals over departures of foreign persons was 16,148 (4,614 a year). The above table shows they are arriving at the rate of over 10,000 a year— a large per centage increase, ? but not a very large actual increase. The following table shows the position in regard to the movement of-Italian and Greek people to Australia, and the increase since previous census in each instance: — —I0**!8 ,for flTB months:— Finns, 230; Greeks. te» 221: Serbs, 107; Albanians (separately S^totmVSl?**' ^?*~»-T1«* *. _ .

If the-rate of their incoming during the five month period is maintained, 6,584 will have: ai rived in the year ending April- next Italian and Greek migrants to Australia averaged 150 yearly during the 30 year prior, to 1901. Their present rate o arrival, 6,854 'yearly, represents only,. 08; of the natural increase in our population According to the 1921 census the distri bution of Italians and Greeks in Australi; was: — Italians — Metropolitan, 345; pro vincial, 10.8; rural, '46.1; migratory, S.6 Greeks— Respectively 57.3, 21.7, 18.7, &nc; 23\. The majority of the people of btUl these nationalities were married, am could read and write the English language United States Act, In May, 1921, the first Immigration Re striction Act was passed by the United States Congress. This introduced th- system which- limited- the quota to 3 pel cent, of the number of nationals of eacl country who were domiciled in the United .^^ates, according to the 1910 Sn sus. This Act operated for a year, ajnd was replaced by the Act which came iuto force on July 1 last. This later Act »e duced the quota to 2 per cent, of the num ber of nationals domiciled in the United States, as determined by the census ot 1890\. The reason for this is significant. The great stream of so-called Nordic im migration flowed to the, United States be fore 1890; the 'new,' or southern Euro pean immigration, came later. The striking figures in the following table show the great reductions effected by the new Act m the quot.j of such countries as Czecho slovakia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Greece, Russia, Roumania, and Jugo-Slavia: — 3 p.c 2 pa Beduc Country.

The Congress committee in reporting on this matter said:— 'The most troublesome administrative difficulty encountered since the enactment of the 3 per cent. law has been the enforcement of the numerical limitation. The actual physical counting of 'human beings arriving by ship and train has been a task of magnitude. Mistakes have been made. Steamships have raced to port in efforts to land passengers within time limits. Delays and disappointments have brought hardships. Distressing ap peals for relief in individual cases have assailed the officers charged with enforce ment of the law. Senators and represen tatives have been besought to aid either in nullifying the' statue or in mitigating it3 force. All these troublesome obstacles are confidently expected to be eliminated in the- event of the enactment of the new BflL The Bill contains provision for en forcement of the numerical limitation, not by counting immigrants upon their arrival, put by counting -immigration certificates' issuable at American consulates overseas. The: plan, briefly, is to issue for each nationality a number of immigration certi ficates'jto.he placed in the- hands of intend ing migrants as they obtain American visas upon their passports. Each certi ficate has a validity of two months to the tinieof taking ship. Therefore, the in tending migrant, having obtained his pass port, his migration certificate, and hi9 visa, is -at liberty to proceed to the United States in the full knowledge that he will not be debarred solely by a quota limi tation. He must, however, undergo fur ther examination at port of entry, and be able to pass under the 1917 Act. It is expected that the number who cannot pass will be greatly reduced by the preliminary investigation. - There should be no arrival of f*xce»-iuota' cases, and there need be no racing of steamships. Australia's Position. It seems to be impracticable for Aus tralia, which has no foreign service, to en force a quota law. Another' significant passage in the report of the United States Congressional Committee is:— 'Decisions by the committee to limit admissions of quota immigrants to 2 per cent, based on census figures of 1890, instead of 3 per cent, on census of 1910, was reached after long and careful consideration of every element. An impelling reason for the change is that it is desired to slow down tne streams of types of immigrants not easily assimilated. Naturalization does not necessarily mean assimilation. The naturalization process cannot work well with the continued arrival in large num bers of the so-called new immigration. The new type crowds in the larger cities; it is exploited; it gams but a slight knowledge of America and American institutions It has grown to be a great undigested mass of alien thought, alien sympathy, and alien, purpose; it is a menace to the social political, and economic life of the counhy it creates alarm and apprehension- if breeds racial hatreds which should not exist in the United States, and which need not exist when the balance shall have been restored.' ^^
