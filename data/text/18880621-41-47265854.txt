We cannot imagine the formation of blood globules without iron, A strong nutritious diet must contain under all circumstances a certain amount of iron corresponding to the quantity which daily becomes worr out of inactive and is excreted by the intestinal canal. It is quite certain \- that if iron be excluded from the food, organic life cannot be rapported. There are diseases, such as many cases of chlorosis, in which the number of corpuscles is diminished by one-fourth and the proportion of iron in the ashes of the blood in the same proportion ; expedience has shown that the symptoms in such cases (great bodily weakness and weariness, pale aspect and deficient heat) may be entirely removed and heSJth restored by small i doses of iron.'

U.S. (for confirmation see New Zealand Gaz'-tU, January 21, 1838; al» New Sonth Wales Gazette, April 17, 1883). The . Doctor has devoted fourteen years to the study of CHRONIC, NERVOUS, AND SPECIAL DISEASES. Four of these were in the leading hospitals of the United States, which enables him tc treat all private troubles with excellent results. All applying to him will receive his honest opinion of their complaints. No experimenting ; no Mercury oied. He will guarantee' a positive core in ever; cat e he undertakes, or forfeit £200. His reason for doing so is this— where there is no organic disease and nothing bnt an Inorganic trouble, or, in other words, a conglomeration of symptoms producing a certain result, there is no reason, why it cannot baV removed with the proper remedies, therefore he guarantees. He wishes it distinctly understood that he does not claim to perform impossibilities or to have miraculous power ; be claims only to be a skilled and successful physician, thoroughly in formed in his speciality— CHRONIC and SPECIAI DISEASES of MEN and WOMEN. People read ing at a distance - an, by explaining their troubles in detail, be treated at home. The course of treatment will not in any way interfe-e with their business.
