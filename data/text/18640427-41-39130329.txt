The Nautilus, during the trip from Belfast, had very bad weather, mote especially on the 22nd, when it blew with such violence, that she was hove to for several hours. Captain McDonald reports ?eelng the brig Sarah when oft' Cape Northumber land. The Thomas Brown arrived from Melbourne on Monday night, and it appears she also had a very boisterous passage, which was somewhat lengthened by being driven to leeward of the Passage, and havine to beat ud against the Kale. Beyond blowing away the mizen-staysau, however, no damage was sustained. The Southern Cross, from Port Louis, is anew schooner, BUgar laden, for orders. She sailed on the same day as the Dispatch, and arrived a couple of hours before her. The Dispatch, from Port Louis, is commanded by Captain James Lowrie, whose courtesy and urbanity were for many years exhibited when re gularly, employed between this port and Mel bourne—first as master of the barque Dread nought, and subsequently in command of the screw steamer Havilah. in which position he won tbe esteem of all who made his acquaintance. The Dispatch left Mauritius on March 15, and thence to St. Paul's light unfavourable winds were experienced ; but afterwards heavy southerly gales, attended by high sea, prevailed, till past the meri dian of the Leuwin. On April 10 the storm was at its climax, and, in a heavy lurch, the lee rail was under water, the cargo shifted, and unfortunately a young Danish seamen, named Louis Galle, fell overboard at a moment when it was utterly im possible to fescue him. From Cape Leuwin had moderate winds, from 8.E. to S.W. ; and, on arrival at the anchorage, made signal for steamer and was towed into harbour. Captain Lowrie reports the departure from Port Louis of the following vessels ; —On March 12, the Amicus, barque, for More ton Bay; on the 13th, the Noinian, barque, for Mel bourne; and brig Wateriily, for Sydney; but the latter put back on the following day from the illness of the roaster. The ship Hotspur, from Sydney to Bombay, had put in for repairs, having been dismasted at sea. The last arrivals from Australia were the Royal Arthur and Metaris, from Adelaide. The vessels loading for the colonies were the Metaris, for Melbourne; the brig Swan, for Geelong; and brig Lily, for Port Phillip Heads, for orders. No hurricanes had Tiaited the island, although several had passed in the immediate vicinity; and as there had been abundant rains, the prospects of a good BUgar crop were favourably anticipated VESSELS IN HARBOUR AGNES, schooner, 82 tons, W.
