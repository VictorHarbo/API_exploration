J£AST TORRENS ELECTION Mr. MURRAY will MEET the ELECTORS at the following places:— GLYNDE, Glynde Hotel, Monday, 19th inst., 7.30 p.m. GLEN OSMOND, Vine Inn, Tuesday, 20th inst., 6.30 p.m. MAGILL, East Torrens Hotel, Tuesday, 20th inst., 8 p.m. STEPNEY, Buck's Head Hotel, Wednesday, 21st, 7.30 p.m. 74zc K. St. BARBE MILLER, Hon. Sec. T° THE ELECTOR* mprpT JL LEGISLATIVE C r* : Gentlemen—I wish sr ^GNCIu. attention to my opin' to direct yonr points:— -<M1% Da the following six Legislative r . whenever an- .JWMS0& Reform.—I think that Assembly ' ■/ Ete&feft; dissolutien of the House of of the T . 6*®es pla'ce, one-third of the members that -^egitSiMiive Council should retire in order t: - y»a teay give your opinion on the ques ' .0£l Which has caused such dissolution. This Would render the Legislative Council more re ■aponsible to you, and prevent any deadlock between the two Houses. Land Laws.—Having been a consistent land teformer ever since the question first arose, I • congratulate the farmers of this colony on their success in breaking up $ie' monopoly which formerly existed in land. I shall be happy to advocate any amendment of the law, shown to; be required, especially the reduction of the price of scrub land to a nominal sum to those willing to clear and cultivate. Mining Laws.—I-advocate a peppercorn rent for ■ unproductive mineral lands, with conditions 'enforcing the employment of labor, in order to prevent monopolies, and a Royalty or percentage on dividends. Taxation and Free Trade.—If it can be shown, as asserted by some, that no further taxation is required I shall be most happy to be convinced, aB nothing but absolute necessity justifies the imposition of taxes; but if further taxation is required it should fall on the wealthy classes, who have hitherto never paid their fair share of the expenses of the Govern ment of this colony. Every one should con tribute according to his means, whether such means are derived from shares, lands, mines, sheep, or any other. description of property. That " large and important class, the men of no property," who have hitherto through • the Custom-House paid more than their fair share of .taxation, should be relieved by the introduc tion of Free Trade, has been done in England, IsniiGRArioN should be carefully conducted, and stopped by telegraph as soon as the first ; symptoms of bad times or scarcity of employ- j ment manifest themselves. j Law Reform.—I am and always have been ! an ardent admirer of the Real Property Act and ■ all other endeavors to simplify and cheapen ; the law of the land and the procedure of the Courts. . I advocate the adaptation of the Local Court procedure to the Supreme Court. I remain, Your obedient servant, 78zcx83c R. C RaKER. O THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen—Not being able to visit the numerous districts in the colony, it is desirable that I should state to you what I am in favor of supporting in case of being returned. I am in favor of opening up the Murray Mouth, and making Victor Harbor suitable for large ship ping ; improvements of Port Adelaide, survey of new roads for stock travelling, a liberal Land Eill, a larger area of acres for the farmers, im migration when necessary, properly selected ; railways where necessary, s liberal amended Mineral Act and royalty, water supply for townships where needed, outer harbor—'give facilities to a private Company for its construc tion, amend the Constitution Act, utilise the Murray Bridge by railway if thought necessary, jetties and lights on our coast, support a force for the defence of the colony, and the erection of batteries; also a Military-road near the Semaphore. The federation of the colonies should not tamper with the Real Property Act; support the sinking of wells in the Far North, to open up the country for pastoral purposes; should support the colonization of the Northern Terri tory with either European or foreign labor; liberal leases to the squatters where land is not suitable for farmers; support an expenditure for all necessary public works; simplify and lessen the costs in the Supreme Court; support to give the power to the ratepayers of any dis trict to decide by their votes the number of houses that may be licensed for the sale of strong drink. In asking for your support, you have s°en my votes in print during 12 years in Parliament, if you approve of them support me, and if returned shall legislate for the best in terests of this colony that I have resided in for 39i years. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, PATRICK BOYCE COGLIN. Brompton Park. 69wa92x69-90z TO THE ELECTORS OF THE COLONY. SIX PLAIN REASONS WHY WE SHOULD EACH GIVE ONE VOTE TO MR. JOHN CROZIER FOR THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. 1\. Because although a New South Wales colonist, he has made South Australia his home, and has thoroughly identified himself in every way with our colony. 2\. Because—no Absentee, he has freely in vested his capital in South Australian trade. 3\. Because he has been a spirited and liberal supporter of mining in South Australia. 4\. Because we are all anxious to secure the Riverina trade, and the pre- eminence of South Australia as an Australian colony mainly de pends upon our getting it. In the River Murray Nature meant we should have it. Mr. Crozier has for many years brought the whole of his New South Wales and Riverina produce to South Australian Ports, and has taken his supplies from us, dealing with South Australia alone. The example of one man like Mr. Crozier is worth the advocacy of a hundred others. No one has done so much as Mr. Crozier to secure to us the trade with Riverina, by showing that it can be best done here. We can only get it by New South Wales and Victorian tradesmen and squatters following his example. 5\. Because . he is a man with a thorough practical knowledge of' what is required to develop the country, a hard-headed Scotchman, who has raised himself to his present honorable position, and whose advice is worth having, for he really understands what he is talking about. Unlike many, when he does not thoroughly understand, he holds his tongue and listens. 6\. Because he has served us well in the past. He was an independent but consistent ^sup porter of the Morgan and Boucaut Government. He yielded his own opinion on subsidiary matters, so as not to endanger or delay the execution of a great policy which the country approved. He is no obstructive. A severe domestic affliction and consequent illness have compelled Mr. Crozier at this time to seek a short change. Ho one can blame o resent his absence ; it was unavoidable, and I trust his canvas will not suffer from this cause. Do not forget him therefore, but give ONE VOTE TO MR. JOHN CROZIER. 72zcsT6c AH ELECTOR. JUST TOBKENS ELECTION. Mr. J. A. HOLDEN, ■will address the Electors at • PAYNEHAH, DUKE OF WELLINGTON Monday Evening, 19th inst. 7.0.

It is agTeeable to the palate, and innocent in its . action, while retaining all its extraordinary proper ties; and as a specific, surpassing all the known ' therapeutic agents of the present -day, for tha speedy and permanent cure of— Nervous Prostration Shortness of Breath liver Complaints ' Trembling of the handa Palpitation of the'Heart and limbs Dizziness Impaired Nutrition Noisea in the Head and Mental and Physical De Ears ' pression Loss of Energy and Ap- Consumption (in its drat petite stages only) Hypochondria Timidity Female Complaints Eruptions of the Skin General Debility Impaired Sijht and Me* Indigestion mory Flatulence Nervous Fancies Incapacity for Study or Impoverished Blood Business Nervous Debility in all ita Sick Headache Stages : Lassitude Premature Decline and all morbid conditions of the system arising from . , whatever cause. The action of the Phosphodyne is twofold—on the one hand increasing the principle . which constitutes nervous energy, and on the other 1 the most powerful blood and "flesh generating agent ; known; therefore, a marvellous medicine for reno vating impaired and broken- down constitutions. It ' quickly improves the functions of assimilation to; such a degree that where for years an emaciated, j" : anxious, cadaverous, and semi-vital condition has - existed, the flesh will rapidly increase in quantity " ; and firmness, and.the whole system,return to a state of robust health. The Phosphodyne acts electrically : upon the organization; for instance, it assists nature to generate that human electricity which renews and rebuilds the osseous, muscular, nervous, membranous, and organic systems.: It operates on the system without exciting care or thought upon the individual as to the process. It movesthe lungs, liver, heart, - kidneys, stomach, and intestines with a harmony, vigor, yet mildness unparalleled in medicine. The Phosphodyne gives back to the human struc ture, in a suitable form, the phosphoric or animating . element of life which has been wasted, and exerts aa : important influence directly on the spinal marrow . ana nervous system, of a nutritive, tonic, and in- i vigorating character,J. maintaining that' buoyant - energy of the brain'Jand muscular system which: renders the mind cheerful, brilliant, and energetic^; entirely overcoming that dull, inactive, and sluggish ; disposition which many persons experience in all. their actions. " 1 The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are fre- 1 quently shown from the first day of its administra tion by a remarkable increase ofcnervoua power, with a feeling of vigor and comfort, to which the patient. has long been unaccustomed. Digestion ^improved; - the appetite increases wonderfully; the bowels become regular; the eyes brighter; the akin clear and healthy; and the hair acquires strength, eh owing the impor tance of the action of the Phosphodyne on the organs of nutrition. Finally, the Phosphodyne maintains a certain de gree of activity in the previously debilitated nervous system; its use enables all debilitated organs to return to their sound state .and perform their natural func tions. Persons- suffering from Nervous Debility, or any of the hundred symptoms which this distressing disease assumes, may rest assured of an effectual ang even speedy cure by the Judicious use of this uost in; valuable remedy.
