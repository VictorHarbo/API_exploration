SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. Work in Parliament has not pro greased as satisfactorily as Ministers have wished, and certainly not so quickly as in the previous two sessions There are several reasons for this state of things The time of the Assembly has been occupied almost solely in the consideration of the Licensing Bill, which admittedly strikes a heavy blow at vested interests, and as a consequence is talked about and cut about considerably This measure alone would almost have been sufficient to account for the delay, but there is another and very potent factor Within the next six months Parliament must expire by effluxion of time, and many members, with the prospect of hard fights in their constituencies, are posing before the country in varying attitudes three or four as zealous champions of aggrieved public servants , some more as vigilant critics of the administration of the Mining department on the old cry of " Enforce the labour covenants,' quite a large number as supporters of measures such as the Eight Hours Bill, which, after all, will make no alteration in existing relations between men of capital and labour and a great many as follower? of such members as Mr "Aoodsnnd Mr A T Clark, when ever those hon gentlemen choose to move resolutions calculated to round up the protectionists With these disturbing elements operating to prevent the progress of public business, the unsatisfactory result is not sure is in view of the elections, a number of candidates are declaring themselves, but it is impossible at present to give any definite lists, so much depends upon the rector as Bill to be introduced by the Government for increasing the number of members of the Assembly An effort was made to induce the Premier to bring down the bill at once, but he declined to have the right of the Government to direct the business of Parliament interfered with When the Licensing Bill is sent to the Council, the Electoral Bill may be looked for The Licensing Bill should go to the Upper House it the end of this week Mr Berry moved the second reading on July 23, it was committed on August 27, but was not reported until October 4 It has been recommitted but should be disposed of rapidly The length of time taken over this bill has not been equalled in this recent years in the Victorian Parliament Various amendments have been made not in the direction of moderation For instance, the Government made scarcely any resistance on the clause to prohibit the employment of barmaids, and it may actually nega fixed at the instance of the Attorney General, after what is designated a compact to secure a compromise had fallen through Another clause limiting each hotel to the bar was amended so that a license might have as many bags as he liked if hore0istoredthom, and the section rendering it unnecessary for the informer in a ch trio of Sunday trading to prove the description of the liquor send, or whether money was paid for the drink was so strongly opposed as an English but Mr Kerferd consented to its omission Several new clauses lm o been agreed to The constitution of the licensing courts has been fixed at a County Court judge and two police magistrates in Um Mel bourne, B Villa at and Sandhurst districts, and three police magistrates in all other districts excepting in compensation cases, when a County Court judge must be a member It has also been provided that imported spirits must be examined on landing that none of manufactured in the color y shall be allowed to go into consumption within six months from the still and that beer, except such as is made from malt and hop s only, shall be examined by a Government officer before being sent out of blew ones Lho clauses now under conside r ition deal TI till the fees to be paid for licences md the basis upon which compensation is to be assessed the ] Federal Council Adopting Bill to bring into operation in Victoria the Enabling Bill passed in the last session of the imperial Parliament has been introduced into the Legislative Assembly by Mr Service, and into the Parliaments of South Australia and Tasmania It has been passed by the Legislative Council of West Australia, and will very soon be introduced into the Parliament of Queensland If passed by three colonies before December 1 it is to come into operation on that date, or as soon afterwards as it is in force in three colonies the members for Victoria are to be appointed by the Governor in Council, they are to hold office during pleasure, and the hold of selection is not muted to members of Parliament, but embraces all classes of colonists Each representative is to be reimbursed his expenses for attending at the Council the question of the right of the Legislative Council to meet t money clauses in a bill has been revived by Dr. Hearn in that Chamber A bill to provide for the storage of explosives was passed through committee with eel tam clau espiintcdin it lies stating the rents to be paid for magazines Colonel Sargood moved, on September 2 ), that the bill be recommitted for the purpose of having those classes omitted so that when the bill went down to the Assembly the pn v flexes of that house we could not be infiuijjCd D Hearn opposed the motion and asked the President to rule whether or not the Council had power to insert the clauses The President took v vi ted to consider the matter and yesterday he suggested that the matter be referred to the Standing Orders Committee At the same time he was inclined to disagree with Dr. Hearn the suggestion w -is adopted On Wednesday, September 23, when a number of members were absent, at the Mayor of Melbourne i annual ball Mr James introduced a bill to legalise the eight hours system by and an eight hours legal days work, an exception being under 111 elsewhere employed, by wntten assessment, Fricker took to work more hills eight hours per day A dotelunii*ition was shown tomah the bill through all its stages, which Mr. Service and some other hon gentlemen were powerless to resist and very quickly the third leading was agreed to, and the bill was ordered to be sent to the Legislative 0 Council On its arriving in that Chamber no member would take it up, and after an awkward pause Colonel Sargood, who represents the Government, moved the first reading ' out of courtesy to the other Chamber ' A bill is to be introduced by the Government into the Legislative Council for the better protection of women and girls It is drawn on the lines of the measure recently passed by the Imperial Pnrlu ment All ITavpci, on Wednesday, September 30 moved a resolution in the Legislative Assembly in favour of the adoption of the Canadian system of public education The Spot 0 for the hours and a half to prove that our system had become ex liar vant, and that through the absence of religious instruction, it was out of harmony with public opinion His com person of the cost of state schools in Victoria and Canada sought to show that we pay 12s per head of population, against 5s 6d in Ontario, Canada, and £4 14s 10d per child in average attendance, against £2 Is 7d Our system, he contends, is inefficient, because 14 66 per cent of children of school age do not attend schools In Canada the religious difficulty has been solved by allowing separate schools to be established when demanded, and the principle of local control has been found to work admirably The hon. gentleman had an attentive though small audience, but there was no time when he concluded for the Minister of Education to be heard in reply. The debate had to be adjourned It has since been pointed out that Mr Harper made no comparison between the cost of living and the rates of salaries in Victoria and Canada, which were essential to his calculations Teachers, it has been shown are paid much less in Canada than persons in similar positions in Victoria would be contented with The revenue returns for the quarter ending September 30 show a decrease of £23,908 as compared with the corresponding quarter of last year, the totals being for 1884, £1,448,725 and for 1885, £1,424,757 The receipts for the 11 months ending September 30 were £G,O73,202, giving a not increase over the previous year of £103,482 None of the decreases for the quarter have any significance, the principal falling off being due to the absence from this account of rents from pastoral runs, TV which, in the corre- sponding' quarter last year, yielded £13,000 under the new Land Act no such rents are now received SOCIAL AND GENERAL Local arrangements in connexion with the ensuing Colonial and Indian Exhibition are progressing favourably I he exhibits of wine promise to be an important feature of the court of the colony Over 7,000 gallons representing 42,000 bottles, have been entered, and, in addition a practically unlimited quantity will be available for sale during the exhibition His Royal Highness the Prince of Vi Wales having expressed his desire that specimens of Australian fish might be set hibited in the aquarium which will be open in connexion with the exhibition, the trustees of the Melbourne Exhibition building have given the matter their consideration with a view of determining if specimens of the rarer varieties might not be sent from the Melbourne Aquarium It has, however, been found that a very great cost would be incurred in sending any thing like an adequate supply of fish and the project has therefore been abandoned It has been decided how ever to forward for exhibition in the Victorian court upwards of 100 water colour drawings of the tissues of the colony, which have been executed to the order of the trustees by a competent artist, and which, it is hoped will be of interest to ichthyologists and others. It is also the intention of the trustees to request the Government to assist them in the production of a descriptive work on Victorian fishes, the illustrations of which will be taken from the plates just mentioned Pro season is Coy has promised his assistance, and Mr I L Miarrard, the secretary to the trustees is already engaged in collecting the materials for the work. The question of intercolonial reciprocity in the matter of tariffs was warmly discussed at a special meeting of the Chamber of Manufactures held on the 28th alt Die president (Mr Frank Stuart) moved the adoption of a resolution submitted by the council to the effect " that reciprocity in colonial productions and manufactures with the neighbouring colonies is desirable and should be agreed to by Victoria and the other colonies at the earliest opportunity Mr W 1 crguBson seconded the motion Mr James Paterson jam manufacturer moved an amendment affirming that the " experiment of reciprocity should first be attempted with the other Australian colonies whose native productions and manufactures are most d13 similar to our own provided that all formity of tariff against other countries on the articles to be exchanged should be a fundamental condition of such streets, and also that population should be reef guised as the equitable basis on which to treat. An animated discussion followed The motion was eventually carried by 19 votes to S A code of neutrons differing in many important respects from those previously issued under the Education Act 1872, has been passed by the Executive Council in the first place the standards of all the classes in the course of free instruction have been considerably raised 1 revision is now made in all classes for general lessons which were previously not compulsoryt-*^ These les sons include elementary teaching upon scientific subjects tuition 111 poetry is extended to all classes and special attention is to be paid to the teaching of history in the higher classes. A number of alterations have been effected in the direction of extending the teaching of geography), grammar and arithmetic, and an effort has been made to render the instruction in arithmetic more practical than hitherto The annual session of the Church of Eng land Assembly for the diocese of Melbourne has been held during the tort night In his opening address the Bishop of Melbourne expressed his approval of the proposal for the erection of a new diocese of Sandhurst, and his hope that when Victoria was divided into three dioceses it would be made an ecclesiastical province The present diocese of Melbourne had grown until it was too far He for one bishop, and the work told upon him more than it did He also advocated the proposal for the establishment of a Church of England Girls High School Referring to the White Cross t men, formed for the promotion of social purity, the bishop, adapting to this colony a saying of Mr Moody regarding England, declared that the greatest danger of Australian v young men was not drunkenness but impurity he briefly eulogised the labours of the Salvation Army in the rescue of the fallen, and mentioned the systematised efforts in the same direction begun by the Church of ng fund in Melbourne. He also dwelt at some length on the desirableness of enlisting as many working men as possible in the ranks of church members and workers, recommending particularly the formation of a Church of England Working Men's Society The bill to subdivide the diocese, subsequently introduced, was discussed at great length, the second reading; being carried by a majority both of the I clergy and laity, and it was then rest ferred to a select committee, which is to sit during the recess and report to a future meeting of the Assembly A bill for the establishment of a Church of England Girls High School in East Melbourne was carried, but not unanimously A resolution was passed protesting against the action reported to have been taken by the Archbishop of [ Canterbury, prohibiting the employment of colonially ordained clergy in his ecclesiastical province 'He is shop stated that he found it difficult to understand such a proceeding on the part of the head of the Church of England, more especially at a time when Imperial federation was one of the questions of the hour A committee was appointed to secure gifts of land for church endowment, and in connexion ivithabill relating to the duties of trustees and vestries, it was decided that, in churches hereafter built the free sittings shall be made similar in construction and design to those from which rents are received 'the Presbyterian Church of Victoria is about to lose another of its ministers. At the morning service at Chalmers Church, last Sunday, the pastor, the Rev. Robert Scott, M A, announced that he intended to tender his resignation to the Presbytery at its meeting in November with the view of returning to Scotland The announcement took the congregation completely by surprise It is understood that the rev gentleman is reason for resigning is his disapproval often expressed, of the spirit manifested by the majority of the Melbourne Presbytery which tends as he believes, to bring the Presbyterian Church into conflict with the non church coing portion of the community, and with the Christian Church at large and that having been led to understand that his pie hence in the presbytery was regarded by the majority as a hindrance to the peace of the church, he feels it his duty to retire Having been desirous of taking a part in the public work of the church, Mr Scott feels keenly the fact that for the last year he has been consistently excluded from every committee. Ever since he objected to the pro duce of the presby to rv regarding the Rev. Charles Strong, some three years ago, he feels that he has been subjected to great annoyance and complaint from many members of that body, and he regards their attitude towards him as on indication that his presence is distasteful to them. The Rev Mr Scott was called to the charge of Chalmers Church some five years ago, and left one of the leading churches in Glasgow in order to accept it The Rev Charles Strong, whose connexion with the Scots Church, Melbourne, was severed by the Melbourne Presbytery), is founding with the assistance of some friends of his old congregation, an " Australian Church It will he on the following basis for the worship of God, in spirit and in truth, the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the promo- lion and practice of the religious life of faith, hope and love the farm of church government to be representative and elective, due regard being had to liberty of conscience and congregational freedom ' Upwards of £5,000 has already been subscribed towards the cost of the proposed building and its site At a recent meeting of the Melbourne Gordon Memorial committee it was resolved to authorise Mr. Hamo 'Thornycroft. A.R.A to prepare a duplicate for Melbourne of his statue of Gordon which is to be placed in Trafalgar square, London. On the 30th alt" Messrs T C M Walker and Co shipped for England by the ss- amer Australasian the first consignment of stud sheep which had been sent there from Australia. It comprised 12 pure Camden me names, direct descendants of the original Camden merino sheep, first imported into Australia about 30 years ago by the late Sir W Macarthur These are the property of Mr V M. Campbell who kept the Hock pure, and it is believed that there are none of the Camden breed now in existence except in a dock In the lost summary it was reported that iron screw steamer Gulf of Carpentaria, belonging to the Greenock Steamship Company, bound from new South Wales to London had been totally wrecked on the 11th ult. of the Anser fal inds Hiss s Struts Captain Thomson, her master, explained that the steamer struck upon a sunken rock not laid down in the Admiralty charts An inquiry has been held by the Steam navigation Heard From the evidence taken it appears that the steamer had almost cleared the channel between the two Anser Islands when she struck, that Captain Thomson and frequently gone through this channel and that, in fact the vessel was on a much are quented course On the recommendation of the board the Government sent the steamer Despatch to explore the locality, and she had no ditncultymlindingthcBunken rock, which lies in the channel between the Anser Islands, in water which is marked on the chart as 14 fathoms, or 4ft. deep the real depth over the reef, which consists of jagged patches, is only 11ft at low w user, but, trusting to the Admiralty charts, the passage has always been considered safe The reef lies with Cleft Island bearing south ii ii I of east (distant seven cables), and the north west point of the South Anser Island bearing east by south half south the same distance 'to mariners this information will be interesting, but for all practical purposes the channel between the Anser Islands will, doubtless tor | the future be closed A buoy was left floating over the spot. The only explanation of the escape of other vessels of equal draught to the Gulf of Carpentaria is that the line of the reef is not very large and that it lies at the point, after passing between the two main Anser Islands, at which the course is altered slightly from the straight line 'the slightest variation in that altera- tion to port or starboard would take a vessel clear of the obstruction, which is surrounded on all sides by deep water It may readily be surmised how narrowly some of the hundreds of vessels which have passed through the channel have missed the late met by the Gulf of Carpentaria more by good luck than good management. The wreck was not found, and is supposed to be at least 20 fathoms deep Mr George Augustus Sala is making a most prosperous tour in New Zealand I was four hours after he arrived from Sydney at Auckland he lectured in the Chor ii hall, which was thronged in every part and resisting all re meats to prolong his stay), he left next day for the south In V> Wellington and Christchurch he lee tured every night to crowded 1 audiences and the impression created by him in the capital was so favorable that the executive com- notice of the New Zealand Industrial Exhibition engage 1 him by wire to return, and give two more lectures in the In age ball of the e hibition which is capable of holding 1 JOO people.

For some weeks the Opposition have been raising and discussing personal questions to such an extent as to lead the Ministry to the conclusion that they were determined to retard the passing of the estimates, and to obstruct the two principal Government measures of the session, viz., the Public Health Bill and the Local Government Bill At 4 0'clock in the morning of October 2, the House rose after rejecting Mr. Gnri nil's motion of censure on Mr Wright, the Minister of Works, for holding office while he was connected with the firm of Wright, Heaton, and lo, who, as public carriers, might be supposed to have large business men letters with the Govern- meat During the day rumours of mi impending dissolution were in circulation, but hon. members, not prepared for the rent), assembled as usual at half-past 1 in the afternoon No Speaker entered the chamber at the appointed time, and for two minutes the Ministerial and Opposition sides of the House sat looking up easily in each other 'Then the members of the Government rose, and gravely bade good bye to their minds on the other side The rumours of the morning were thus seen to be realised and the Opposition members welcomed the coming dissolution with a cheer, ¡ which was answered by the members of the I Ministry as they retired from the chain Ver This unexpected development was the outcome of a Cabinet Council, which was convened during the afternoon, and at which all the members the Ministry . were present. At the close of the meeting the Premier and the Attorney-General proceeded to Government House and had an interview with the Governor It is stated that the Ministerial supporters were ex i tremely anxious for a speedy dissolution, is they regarded their nightly attendance in the House as a useless sacrifice of time in the face of the avowed determination of a section of the Assembly not to proceed with business. the Ministry will be reconstructed before the coming campaign in the constituences the Premier, Sir Alex 'Stuart, and the At- torney General, the Hon W. H Dalley, both retiring from active political life for the benefit of their health Mr Dibbs, the Treasurer, has undertaken the responsi- bility of reconstructing the Ministry The desire of the Ministerial supporters is understood to be that at least four new Ministers should be introduced into the Government, 'The dissolution is expected immediately, and the new Parliament will be called together in six: weeks' time. AomcuXiiuitr The complete change of weather inaugurated during the second week, of September has effected, as anticipated a fortnight ago, a corresponding change in harvest prospects throughout the whole of the colony of Victoria. The rainfall has continued at brief in tervals throughout the rest of the month, and unless rust should occur in the event of the summer prove in, too hurried, there is almost a certainty of the' harvest proving one smally heavy over the greater part of the colony 1 rather floods have occured in many) districts, and some damage has been sustained by crops on low lying land. Some J OOO acres planted with potatoes vv eresubmeved between Koroit and Belfast, and we hear of like immer stores having been sustained in other puts on a smaller scale the amount of benefit will, however, preponderate largely, and to the growing interest the change has been wholly beneficial In New South Wales also a great change has taken place 'the pastoral districts, with some few exceptions, have experienced a line fall, rendering water abundant, and grass also in most districts, it is certain to be so else where in a very short time South Australia has shared the welcome visitation, and the reports from all districts speak of the crops being rendered safe, excepting those which were quite gone before the occurrence of the rain But even those of which nothing was alive above ground are accounted as not quite lost, wherever the roots had retained vitality a crop, although a short one, may be expected the rainfall has also extended into Queensland, but only to the southern portions In these the amount of fall has ranged from lain down to 73 points.

It was stated in the twenty third annual report that the surplus on the vein to mations amounted to 354 3 2, of which £10,137 had been added to the life assurance fund, which now stood at £203,203 The amount of the credit of profit and loss account, including the balance brought forward from last year, was £11,214, which the directors proposed to allocate thus \- Dividend of 10. percent, cash bonus of 6d. per share, addition of 5000 to the reserve fund, and balance of £21,711 carried forward. The report was adopted The low prices at present ruling in the London market for tallow and Australian tinned meats were mentioned as the causes of a debit balance of libel in the balance sheet of the Melbourne Meat preserving Company, at the half-yearly meeting held on Monday At the close of the preceding half year the debit balance was 2,310, and during the last six: months this has swollen to the amount named Through holding back stock, in anticipation of better market. the company have now on their hands 270 tons of tallow and a large supply of preserved meat The uncertainty of the market for the latter article was shown by the fact that from a preference for Gib tins the tastes of the English consumers had changed suddenly to a desire for meat in 2lb tins, and had recently reverted to the former preference. The directors appealed to the shareholders for an expression of opinion as to future operations, and as those present appeared to be adverse to closing the works, the directors were requested to use their own discretion in managing matters. The sixth ordinary general meeting of the Freehold Investment and Banking Company of Australia was held on Monday, Mr M. H Davies, M.L.A., in the chair. The chairman pointed out that the result of the company) s operations was by bly gratifying In addition to paying a dividend of eight per cent., they proposed to carry two sums of £9 383 10s. to the dividend and general reserve funds respectively, this being much more than was required by the articles of the association In addition, there was a balance of £6 041 18sec carried forward to next year the company would have about £11 GOO more reserve than last year, and the total sum so Bet funds was now about £2), 410 The report and balance-sheet were unanimously adopted. rnioEs cmjBEXT The following are the general prices current - AM (Bulk Ham's now Carlisle Company R M Evans Aitken a Cooper and M'Leod Wm Younger and Co Au (Bottled) Porter and Sons Eagle brand Porter's Bull Dog brand _ Bead Bros, s Doe, Head £ a. d " nominal " nominal Oil 0 0 100 0 100 0 100 0 10 s 0 100 0 100 0 100 0 100 0 9 6 0 0 0 21 Hans Tcnuenta Anglo Bavarian Baw s v heel brand Aitcheson s Blood Hall Board Head Win Younger and Co 0 9.0 - Melvina 6 3 6 6 3 Cooper and M'Leod a 0 8 O STOUT (Built) Gulnuews 7 100 S - Vim V hunger and Co 7 0 0 - STOUT (Bottled)- _ Ed round a pig brand 0 10 3 0 10 Portions bulldog 0 100 - dull fine bottled by Burke 0 10 J - load Bros, bulldog 0 10 S Quinn ess a bottled by JL B roster 0 M J " - Hall a Boars.
