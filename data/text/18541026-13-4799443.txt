We learn from the Englishman of the 10th August, that the Velocity, the lsaac Newton, and the Eliza Warwick, from this port, arrived at Calcutta on the 15th of that month. The Emma, another magnificent representative of the White Star Line, anchored in the Bay at about ten o'clock yesterday morning with 330 passengers, all in good health, after a fine passage of 87 days. The Emma was built especially for the passenger trade, and is fitted with every requisite to constitute her equal in accommodation and comfort to the other vessels of this line. She is 1049 tons register, and 2000 tons burden, and is commanded by Captain Samuel Underwood, whose general courtesy, kindness, and efficient seamanship, have been hand somely acknowledged in a testimonial with which the passengers presented him before breaking up, and which will be found in our ad vertising columns. The agents, with their usual determination to allow no advantage to escape them for securing despatch, had already made arrangements, and a " special train'' brought the bulk of the passengers, and safely deposited them in Melbourne by two o'clock. This vessel has the honor of being the first whose passengers have been so discharged, and if the experiment be found to the advantage of the immigrants, this system will be followed in future with all ships of this line. The succeeding ships of this line will be the Sultana (new), Arabian, Golconda, and the new clipper Blue Jacket, all of which are worthy of separate notice as magnificent specimens of naval architecture, and well calculated to main tain the high character of the White Star Line.
