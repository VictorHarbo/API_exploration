PUBLIC NOTlfccS j THE BURDEN OF DEBT. f)NE reason so many folk find the road of life so uncomfortable is the ' fact that they're walking over broken promises. There's nothing so heavy to carry —so weakening- — so nervo'-raoki- ing as Debt. It weakens the mind — it places the victim at . a disadvantage in work and. in play. It compromises manhood and wo:manhood— eats' away character— kills all .. enthusi asm. There may coma times when YOU cannot keep your promises' and ful fil your duty to your own. Such, times, - however, are not of frequent occurrence, and by adopt ing .the right ' methods, the sensible plan— the only plan — ' TO SEEK A TEMPORARY LOAN, from us— you are assured freedom1, from ' the awful ' possibilities of I threatening and. pestilent : creditors I THE TOOWOOMBA LOAN AND!
