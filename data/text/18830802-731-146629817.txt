To the Electors of Mary borough GENTLEMEN,— Early in October of last yearldeclinedavery flattering reqoisition from theelectorsof the WideBay district to stand for that constituency, on account of having pledged myself two years previonsly to become a candidate for your suffrages. In accordance with that promise, I now offer myself as yoor representative, and I do so unbiassed by party feeling; free from all political trammels ; under no obligation to Ministry or Opposition, but simply as an independent member, whose sole aim will be to support whichever party appeare to me to have at heart tbe progress and development of our national interests in general, and, more particularly, 1 hat section of thenew Parliament whose eyes mast be opened to the future importance of Maryborough, and to tbe neces sity of providing for her requirements, hitherto so greatly neglectcd. My opinion on two of tbe crucial questions of the day, namely a The Employment of Black Labor,' and 41 The Transcontinental Railway' is, as regards tbe first, that to enable our sugar planters to com pete successfully with the rest of tbe sugar- producing world, they mnst have equal advantages, therefore let onr sugar El enters (on a large or small scale) have black ibor, for by black labor alone is it that cheap sugar is produced elsewhere. But tbe Kanaka should be strictly confined to that industry, and not allowed in anyway to encroach in the legitimate area of white labor. To construct a Transcontinental Railway U premature : let us get Hoes of railway through the settled districts in the first place, and then we can take the question of tbe advisability of so gigantic an enterprise as a Tiarscontinental Railway into jnaturer consideration. If Tempo fortunate ae to be returned by jon, one of the first matters to which I shall give my earnest attention will he the immediate adoption of measures for the improvement of the water approaches to oar port, be it by the ^Government or by tbe formation of a Harbors rod Rivers Trtist. As you well know, your „ ? and my interests are identical. Neither you, as citizens of Maryborough, nor I, &a; the representative of tbe Queensland Land nnd Coal Company, want to see 6bips leaving 'the White Cliffs to 6eek cargoes in other colonies, when they might be easily enabled to load at our wharves. I pledge mvself to leave oothiDg undone to ensure for Maryborough her equitable portion of the funds voted for the improvement of navigation - The annexation of New Guinea will bave my most earnest support. I am in favor of Tii-eonial Parliaments, and opposed to the payment of members. I am also a believer in a continuous flow of immigration to our shores, totallv irrespective of nationalities ; believing that tbe land, which is tbe element whence, in one form or other, *11 the wealth of society is derived, is so splendidly distributed as to soil and climate, that nearly everything required for the use of 'man can be derived from it in abundance. West we have rich wheat lands, and in tbe North the sugarcane can be cultivated with great commercial success. Underneath the surface we have coal, iron, copper, silver, gold, and other valuable minerals. Our extensive coast is indented by spacious bays and navigable rivers, and it needs but tbe enterprise and intelligence of our people, cherishing th? spirit and putting forth the energy of a colonizing racc, to raise a country, so richly blessed by nature, to a fore most place in the world's progress. $ut tbe work before us can only be faithfully accomplished by the cultivation of tbe homely ? -Wittuee-of industry, caro, and thrift, by the people, and by sound principles of legislation and of economic truth by the Government. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, J, HURLEY. Maryborough, 28th July, 1883. An die Harren Wahler von Maryborough.

B. SHERIDAN. To the Electors of Mary borough. GENTLEMEN, — Parliament haviDg been dissolved, I ag*in offer myself as a Can* didate for the representation of your Elec torate, with the hope that the results of my exertions in your behalf during past years, will bave secured to me a continuance of your confidence. The immediate cause of tbe present dissolo tion of Parliament has been the defeat of the Ministry on tbe second reading of a bill to validate the agreement entered into by them with some English capitalists, for the con* stmction of the Transcontinental Railway. I did not approve of all tbe details of .this agree ment, and had it gone into Committee should bave moved some amendments, which, per* haps, might have made it more acceptable to the nountry, I have, however, al ways believed that railways might be contracted by means of land grants in this colony, and at one time tbe great majority of tbe people thought with me on this subject. In my address to the electors of Wide Bay, issued in June, 1870, I find this paragraph, ' With reference to rail* ways, I am opposed to tbe policy by which districts which receive no benefit from them, are heavily taxed to pay for their maintenance and construction; but if it were profitable to arrange to pay lor their construction ia laud, I would gladly see such works initiated again.' How great a burden some of our railways have been upon tbe ratepayers of the colony, very few are aware, Since 1864, when the first interest became payabie on money expended on the S. and \V. Railway, until June 30tb, 1880, the amount paid out of tbe revenue of the colony to make good the deficiency in the earnings of the line, towards the payment of interest, amounted to £1,672,065. In the 6even years, from let July, 1675, to 30th June, 1882, the loss from the earnings of tbe S, and W. line being insufficient to pay interest on cost of construction, amounted to £777,275. During the 6ame period, the quantity of country lands sold by auetion was 713,271 acres, which as much of it was sold at 10s and 15s per acre, would realize only about tbe third of tbe loss on the S. and W. Railway. It is clear, tberc!ore( that tbe necessity for selling large areas of land by auction to replenish the Treasury has been occasioned by the failure of the railway to pay interest on cost of con* ! 6truction. The Central Railway would pro* bably show a worse result, since for 6ome years after its construction it did not pay its working expenses. It seems to mo that a system by which a large area of land has to be sold by auction every year in blocks of 10,000 acres here, and 20,000 there, picking out tbe eyes of tbe country and leaving the residue nnfft for settle ment, is the very worst that could be devised, for the utilisation of onr lands or the settlement of a population upon them. However, tbe question of the Transcontinen* tal and Warrego land grant Railways has been decided. Ministers have declared that they will not again bring fo'ward those agreements, and it is therefore more to the purpose at tbe preeeDt time to discuss those questions which tbe new Parliament; will bave to deal with than those which are already decided. Per* haps the most important question which will come before the new Parliament will be that of tbe Pastoral Leases in theunsettled districts. Many of these leases will shortly expire, and it is proposed by one party in the country that tbe present lessees shall be granted a renewal without competition and with only someslight increase of lent, 1 could never support'sucb ft policy ; I repard tbe aggregation of these large leaseholds of several millions of acres in one hand us an evil almost as great as if they were freeholds. In fact the cxperienceof all Austra lia teaches us th »t these large leaseholds arc the foundation of large freebclds. 1 also regard it as a scandal that our administration of the Crown lands has been such that in a country which is eminently adapted for pastoral pur poses and is not one qaarter stocked, there should be do opening for men of moderate c »pital to engage in pastoral pursuits. I bold therefore that advantage should be taken of the falling in of the Pastoral Leases to sab* divide tbe runs so as to permit men of moder ate means to become graziers, thereby increas ing tbe population of tbe unsettled difetricts Bnd leading to that improvement pod development in a manner which is not possble whilst they remain in the hands of a few large squtters. As 1 shall have an opportunity of speaking to you personally in a few days, I shall now cooclude this address, in which I have only touched on tho principal sobtects now occupying public attention. When I meet you personally, bow ever, I shall be prepared to answer folly any questions that may be asked me* I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, H. E. Eisg.

I would act independently of both sides of the House on their present lines, if elected. I am in favor of payment of members, but j not of triennial parliaments, without some j alteration in tho method of conducting the business of the House. 1 am opposed to the introduction of Coolies or any Servile Labour, except they are kept absolutely and distinctly to plantation field labour, and are returned at the expiration of 1 their agreement, I am a believer in the theory that we should not alienate our lands, but that tbe Government | should be the only landlord, I consider bona fide resident conditional Purchasers 6bould be i relieved from the necessity of expending ten shillings an acre for improvements ; they should i be free to do what tbey like, . !
