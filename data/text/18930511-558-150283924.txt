IMMIGRATION, or Iutorcolouial Ereo Trade! One, or tlio other, has bocoiuo a necessity of local trade, and as in tlio present depressed state of tho labor market it is useless to tliiuk of increasing tlie ?working population of tlio country, tho only alternative is to lind fresh outlets for our produc tions, within Australian limits. Time was when Victoria was the workshop of this continent, even as England once was of the "World, and under n protective tariff we built up industries which, so long as we could fiud customers, gave us almost unexampled prosperity. But it was only tlioso who were shortsighted .who failed to perceive that our neighbors would soon endeavor to profit by our oxample, and so, one aftor tlio other Victorian industries have been handi cappod by tlio several colonial ports being closed to us, until thoro is not a free trado colony left in the whole group. It may be asked what we should gain by reciprocity treaties now that each colony has learned, to some extent, to provide for its own requirements. If boots and shoes, slops, and other articles, for example, can be made as cheaply in Sydney as in Melbourne is it likely that inter colonial free trade would increaso our trade in such articles with our ?SPECIA L AD VERT!

Tho reply to this is that wo must take, not one or two, but the whole range of articles that are the produce of manual labor, of machinery, and the soil, and it depends entirely on the conditions under which eacli is produced, whether Victoria oi-New South Wales is tho best locale of production. In some respects it would bo found that New South Vales could sell to us to her advantage; in otliors it would pay the elder colony best to lot us supply her. Certainly, her coal deposits give New South Wales a great ndvantago over us wherever coal is tho chief elenicut in the cost of production. Thus, some of our mechanical indus tries might suffer ip. an open com petition. In produce, howover, it is probablo that tlio more fertile lands of this colony would continue to give Us the New South Wales markets, and on better terms than at present. In every branch of industry pertain? jug to both colonies, intercolonial free trade would mean the survival of- the fittest, and production would be regulated to a more profitable end than aj; present. If intercolonial free trade bocnjne general, as it would do, BO iloubty instead of having' a million people to cater for, we should have about four millions, and in process of time we should produco on a larger scale than at present thoso articles which our neighbors could only produce at a disadvantage, aud we should purchase from them such commodities as, through their un profitableness, we had ceased to raise or manufacture. Irrespective, however, of the economic side of the question, reciprocity in trade would bring us nearor to that Federation which would nationalise the Austra lian continont, and reduce the present enormous aggregato cost of governing separate colonies. "Where now there is isolation and constant disintegra tion, tlicro would, in every direction, be amalgamation, and consolidation, and our national credit would at one bound rise from the depth to which it has fallen. The timo is rife for many great changes, if there is sufficient statesmanship in the Government to take advantage of it. At present, however, intercolonial free trade has scarcely got beyond the realm of newspaper discussion. Nothing is known officially in Sydney, it appears, of the announced inten tions of Mr PATTERSON* on the subject, and tho local deliverances of that gentleman in respect to it ma}-, like settling the unemployed on the soil, bo but sound and fury, signifying nothing.
