I feel the honor the more, the requisition coming, as it does, from so largo and influential a number of gentlemen, who are pleased to express their confi dence that I will consistently and honestly represent their opinions. I shall be happy to expound my views on various topics more extensively than 1 can in BO Bhorfc a reply, when I have the pleasure of meeting the electors per sonally, during my canvass; in the meantime, I beg to submit for consideration the following: First.-Reform of the Upper House.-I deBire to see this branch oi the Legislature moro in harmony ?with the general ideas agitating the public mind, not to abolish the Legislative Couueil, it having a power for the good of the Commonwealth, if such power be properly wielded; and, in order to bring thi3 House more in accord with the Btate of public opinion, and , thus advance the country, 1 not only wisb, but faithfully promise, to esert all my powers to reduce the qualification of electors and elected, to divide some of the Provinces, and iucrtase the number of Members. Farming.-Ever sinco my advent to the colonies, I have unceasingly advocated the interests of the culti vator of the Boil, whether to obtain his land cheaply or protect him from oppressive laws; have always advocated the settling the people on the land, as our greatest safeguard to good legislation, the mainstay of the colony, and the strongest conservative element for law and order.

I have the honor to be, gentlemen, Yours most respectfully, GEO. liULFE. Melbourne, 18th July, 1868. SpO QUARTZ MINING COMPANIES and 1 PROSPECTORS.-WHEELER'S PATENT AMALGAMATING MACHINERY may be seen daily in oppratiou at Langlands' Foundry, Melbourne, whore every information can be obtained ; and the inspection of all parties interested in securing the most efficient process of saving gold, either in the oro or in tailinus, is solicited. The machines are in universal uso in the States of California, Nevada, Moniana, &c.; and thoir intro ductiou into Australia muBt be of the greatest im portance to the mining community, as triaiB and tests will undoubtedly prove. They will manipulate quartz ore3 stamped to a certain fineness and all tailings moro eifectually than any other process; and by their uso a large amount of gold now lost by tho processes generally followed in Australia will bo saved. Ores containing pyrites, mundic, and other ba3e metals, can be successfully treated by Wheeler's Patent Pans, thereby rendering it profitable to work mines that have been abandoned on account o£ the supposed poverty of the jield. Tailings may in many cases also be re-worked by this process to great advantage. Testa of ores and tailiugi are made by Wheeler's Patent Pans, and a small battery of stamps at tho works, at Langlands' Fouudry.
