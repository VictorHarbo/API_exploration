SCANDINAVIAN IMMIGRATION SUGGESTED. . i am tne man you want, says Air. Carl Petersen, in writing to the Bremier on tho subject of immigration from Scandinavia for land settlement. His address is eare of the (Danish consulate, Melbourne. He suggests a mission for himself, stating that as a practical agriculturist lie has devoted about two years as lanternist and lecturer to showing Australians how industry, ac cording t'o climate, is carried on in different parts of Europe. Australians find it d fli- cult to believe that so much is done with such small ureas of land. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden people are doing more on five acres than is in some parts, done litre on 100. Ho declares tliat here indus try is hardly understood, and wo must go to Scandinavia to get men for tlie land. They are men of size, energy and temper ance, know the. -value of a speck of land, and are tlie Itind of people to intermix witli Anstrnliuns. He is willing to go and encourage the people of those parts to come here. Since lie was there last he has re ceived letters from people who, if tliey were brought out, would do all sorts of tilings to repay. , "I do not hesitate," he says in conclusion, "in promising as many shiploads as would be wanted." The Pre mier made no comment on tho letter.
