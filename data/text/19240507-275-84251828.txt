Having nominated as an endorsed Na tional Candidate, I respectfully ask the electors to accord their votein my favor thus ? ?' : . ? . ??? ? ? . -\' : ! :- .FRAIIOilN, J. T. .. ...... 1 ; aud'the, other National candidatet in or der of your preference. 1 have been a member oi' the Perth City Council for twenty yearn, and, at the ex traordinary election held on 18th May, 1923, wan returned a» Mayor, and reelect ed at the annual election in November last. 1 have always taken an aotive interest in publio life, as my record showg. I am a strong supporter of the immigration Boheihe, feeling sure that it is the only practical way by whieh we can obtain the necessary population to develop our ' vast resources and keep the State, what we are all anxious for, - A WHITE AUSTRALIA. . The group settlement scheme ii an adr rairabla one, but 1 would urge th« Govern ment to see that all necessary preparations are made for the accommodation' of the migrants before their arrival, thus avoid ing unnecessary delay and expense to the State, as they should- be placed on their holding at the earliest possible time. I hear that there are a number of migrant! kept waiting some weeks for, land to g6 on. This ehould not be. I think more care should be taken in the selection of mi grants. Every effort should be made to bring them from the rural districts of Great Britain; so that when they go oh to a group they will the better understand the work. If this is not done we shall have our towns full of unemployed and eeetions of the groups vacant. I am strongly in favor of the'' reaump tion by the State of suitable lands for ag ricultural purposes, which, at the present time, are lying idle and' undeveloped, and adjacent to our railways, with a view oil cutting up into reasonable areas and sell* ing upon extended terms to those who may be anxious to go on the land. Those in the State should have cm opportunity of pur chasing if they desire. This would increase the revenue of the railways and give the people a nearer market for their goods. NORTH-WEST. If returned I would give strong support to any practical sohetue for the develop raen of our great North-West, We .cannot afford ,to disregard the danger of leaving this great area unpopulated primary and secondary ??. .'industries; We uiuet give every assistance in the development' and extension of our priroary ?industries, because by bo doing our Sec ondai*y Industries will, as a natural eonse quenoe, expand at a proportional rate. We should be able to produce nearly all our. requirements in ou.r owa Statq, and thus- .find employment for a greater number of ? people. ? -.-'., ?;--i- ? ;; 'mning; -'?.?? I am m favor, of liberal, and .extensive support for 'assistance to prospecting, for,' payable minerals, feeling sure that we have unlimited wealth. in the ground which only requires a systematic scheme being adopted to prove its value. , . LOCAL REQUIREMENTS.— WATER SUPPLY. I have at all times supported the apply ing of the metropolitan area with Hills water, and am a strong supporter of the Canning, Hills? scheme. This should have been ? installed ' long before the war, and could have been constructed for half the cost that we will now have to pay. The serious shortage of water would then have been obviated. I anv in favor of the work being pushed on so that, at the' earliest possible moment, the people may be assured of a copious, supply. The use of the bore, water should be discontinued, TRAMWAYS. 'These, should be extended to all suburbs if, after investigations have been made by our experts, the extension h recommended as a payable proposition. GOOD ROADS. I would support a Bill for the proper construction and maintenance of our wain roads. This cannot be put off muoh longer. a§ the increased motor traffic will make it i compulsory. Every effort must be made to j cope with ' the difficulty. Good roads will J bring farmers more in touch with the corn-1 forts of civilisation, give them better faci lities for marketing and railing, and, being cheaper than railways, will bo a leaser bur den ou the taxpayer. Publio utilities, such as water, tram ways, electricity and gas, good main roads, etc., should be ? administered by elective boards appointed by the ratepayers. I would support an Act if brought in for this purpose, but care would have to bo taken to see that the metropolitan area is not penalised, and that a fair price is plac ed on the undertaking. I am opposed to ' . STATE TRADING CONCERNS. Private enterprise could o,nd . would- han dle these industries more economically if they were assured .that the Government were not to be competitors. . From my experience in the Municipal Council I realise the urgent necessity for a New Municipal .Act to supcraede the pre sent obsolete, and in mauy sections uu workabie, Act. . . , , , We also want a . TOWN PLANNING ACT passed. ; Both municipal and town-planning Acts j have been prepared, and promises havo been made that they would be brought be fore Parliament, ? but- without result. If elected I would use every effort to have them tabled. ? REDISTRIBUTION OF SEATS BILL. i I would support and act with this in I view, as it would j-ive more equitable re presentation. For example, Menzies has ono member to represeut 477 electors — Su- biaco ouo member to represent 9,000 elec tors. 1 am also in favor of COMPULSORY ENROLMENT AND VOTING. for both Hbufcea, State and Federal Gov ernmeuts should co-operate, thus making a j huge saving to the taxpayers. ; RETENTION OF THE UPPER HOUSE. ''?.Abundant evidence may be adduced to prove the snpmor stability and practical results secured by haung two Houses, as opposed to a sinde Chamber. Whilst I am not 'prepared to defend a nominee or hereditary Upper House, it is beyond ques tiou that the aober deliberations of a Cham ber elected by practically every house holder in the State havo been uniformly ELECTION NOTICES. beneficial to the people of Western Aus traba. ' Nwer has legislation of a democratic ohancter been defeated by the Legislative Council in defkaico of the wishes of the genoral community. These simple and pa tent facts deserve to be specially stressed at p time liko the present, when regrot tabU -dissensions in tho ranks of those who view with npyn-ehension the encroachments of t^e functions and activities of Govern ment, have helped to power a party pledg ed to extend and intensify such governmen tal interference to the grave detriment of our industrial and oommeroial progress. At «uch a oritieal „' ancture in the affairs of our State it is imperative that your re presentataives in the Legislative Council should pledge themselves to safeguard the general interests of the people by aoting as an flfectivo brake on those socialistic ex periments which payt experience haa ?proveel costly and disastrous.
