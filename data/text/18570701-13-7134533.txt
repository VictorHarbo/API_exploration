ABOLITION OF THE SOUND Diras.-Our readors aro ivwaro that tho Sound Duos havo ooasod, undor troaty, to bo lov lod by Donmark as a source of rovonno sinco Hie 1st of tho prasont month ; and thoy are also aware llial, Inasmuch as tho treaty in quostion is not ratiflol liy all the contracting parties, an arrangement hasboen imterod Into for socurlng tothoDanishGovornmont tho duties it has cousontcd to nbolish until such time as tho ¡ratification shall bo effected, and the stipulations ro- tating lo tho paymont of the rodoniptlon- monoy fully carried out, Tho arrangement in quostion has boon in siccordauco with tho provisions of n Protocol siginl contemporaneously with tho troaty, and has 110311 embodied in a circular from tho Sound Custom Home, nddiossed to tho Consuls of the dlflcront nation »stationed at the Sound mid the Bolts. Tho circular ¡jirovidos' tor throo distinct cases. Tho master of a vessel passing through i, required to furnish his ¡papers to tho Custom House authorities, in order that they may ealcutato tho duos on his vossol ; and ho Bnay oillior havo his papers returned to him at once, xir ho may retain duplicates of thom ; or he may direct lhat they shall bo forwarded to his address, or placa «of destination. The circular also contains tho follow 3ug form of declaration, which it Is imperative on tho FhTpmastors to sign boforo thoy can proceod on tholr voyngo: /'I, thoundortigneilN.N., master of the vossol N.N., ?»f tho burthen of N.N., bolonglng to N.N., undor to- day's date passing tho Sound on her passage fromN.N. lo the Port of N.N., with a cargo consisting of N.N., iereby declare most conscientiously to havo glvon-a tiuoand faithful report over my whole cargo; an-1 lurlber, I bliidmysolf, in the caso that tho troaty signed on tho 11th of March of the present yoar, relating to tho Iibolltlou of tho Sound and Belt Duties, bo not ratified, Iheu to pay without demur to his Danish Majosty'i Bound Custom House tho duos and charges that might legally bo duo thereon, according to tho Iilthorto jicltnow lodged troatios, on this my prcsont voyago.

STicso arrangements, j it will bo rornomborod, aro F .mp]}* provisional, for upon tho ratification of tha üreaty by each of tho contracting Powers thoy ooaso mid determino. No doubt one of tho first questions to whiohjtlie now Pniliamont must address itsolf will lie tho final settlement of tho Sound Duos, and the .vote of £1,125,260, by which it is to bo offbetod. Wo ilo not anticipate that any serious opposition w11! bj tffercd to a measure so long and so Imperatively do ananded by tho iiitercsls of commoroo ; and wo arj truite sure that no proposal to saddle tho shipping äuterest with tho eo»t of buying up tho Sound Duot ?will be seriously ontortaliiodby tho Iiouso of Commons. St is icportei that Prussia has already set an example, Milich but "for tho luto dissolution of tho British Par- liament silo would havo followed, and has tliut token the initlativo in the ratification of the treaty ; liut wo confidently oxpoet that the sumnior will not lavo olospd until this country has purchased In porpo luity tlio right to tho freo nav igation of tho Sound and flic Bells, as well as tho right to transport her mer- chandise at n nominal impost across that ponlnsula willoh separates tho North Sea and the Baise, and over which Denmark still claims a disputod possession. ¿Maritime Register._
