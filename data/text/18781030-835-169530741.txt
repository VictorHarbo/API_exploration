Assembly, and in doing ,'„ I murt «nkot yon or the considerate and kind manner m which donourTWi^V? treated me whilst I had the leniency whioB~-Banr member, and' for- the / my snnrtcomings. ? -tt'— .tjs eitended to - Though I had to resign my ao»n.,; end of the- last Parliament, it was''!1 the : assure yon.not willingly, and I did so with the greatest regret ; bnt I suddenly found it an imperative necessity that I shonld yisrt the old country; and one result of that visit is, that I can now offer my services to you asalH as your representative in Parliament. ?Iu/sending_ my resignation to the hon. the Speaker, I : took especial care, that yonr interests should in no way Buffer. I Bent it in during the recess, leaving ample time for you t-i make choice of another representative and return 'him before the following sowton of Parliament: ;.a ' nr 'memher I shall tarn my .^aT attention to the great ques ? m^a.ilwav extension. That railways are ^cessa ™&e; da^opment of the wealth of this colony, «° one. CAn for a moment oobt .- but the chief points we must take -into consideration with fresh railway works,' are ; the financial position of the colony, and its indebtedness. The railways must be first constructed where they will be of most benefit to the whole colony, and' where it has teen first proved that there will soon he sufficient traffic to -warrant their construction. I -am not. in favour of any gigantic scheme of an overland line to the Gnlf ; what we parti cularly -want, are lines into tho rich portions of the interior, bridging over the bad country between that and the coast. I was opposed to'such lines as the ones from Maryborough to Gympie, and Bundaberg to Mt Perry, as there waa no attempt made- to show there would ever be sufficient traffic to make them pay, and I think they were unnecessary and premature; but there are np doubt partaiot the coast country where railways may pay, and to any of these I should not be opposed. I do not believe in money being wasted on unnecessarily expensive railway stations.- . I was always opposed to the Government, as I considered all their acts tended towards the benefiting of Southern districts, to 'the detriment of the Northern portions of the colony, and if retnrned I should do my best to oust the present Government; but I would not support any new Government until, they had defined their ? policy. At present we' have only a faint outline of what the Opposi- ; tion might do if they came into power, and: there we cannot blame them, for their duty ? -they being in a minority) is to check, bad legislation as far as they can, not having the power to legislate themselves ; and 'I have no doubt if the result of tho elections is. such that they are called on to legislate for the colony, their policy will be one of _ general benefit ? to the whole colony . and 'not the Southern portions only. / / . I am in favonr of a good Financial Separa tion Bill. Territorial Separation at present ?would be premature antl should be onr last resort. We ought, to first try every other means to get - justice. I am in favour^ of settling population on the land, but I think the Legislature in aiming at this has in many, ways retarded it, by making some of tha conditions ' too enormous on persons having only a small capital. This I should like to see remedied. I consider it would have been fairer to the run holders in the settled districts if the enhanced' value of their runs had first been appraised, and the run at the increased rent, had first been offered to the old lessees before being pnt up to auction. The putting up of the runs to auction is to .the advantage of the capitalist, and the varions runs being liable suddenly to change hands, is detri mental to the general welfare of the colony, and of no advantage to those who are desir ous to settle on the lands, as in either case they would be open to selection. ?' ^ - 1 The question of Civil Service reform is one of great importance. No doubt very great alterations and improvements might be made, but it is a large question and one greatly of detail, and I should like to see it left to a good Select Committee. '. ' ' ' ? . I am most decidedly in favour of employing Kanakas on plantations. Withont their labor sugar growing could not i be successfully carried on ia Queensland. By employing them you arer«nabh3d to find work for Euro peans, by. tna£-I' mean work that is only 'really suitable to Europeans, such as plough ing etc 'Tpremploy Kanakas on such.labonr is a false economy, arid a few years will prove this. The employment of' Kanakas on plantations will I think make sugar growing a success in time in Queensland; more mills will be erected and more land will be brought under cultivation, a benefit to all at present iu the colony, and conducive to the welfare of future immigrants. In reference to their employment by those engaged in pastoral pursmts, especially those m the for West, in most cases it has been an absolute necessity, for no other labour conld be obtained, bnt this could' be easily remedied if in different parts of the colony there were proper depots for immigrants, and if the immigrants on landing were forwarded to the different depots and assisted, as they are by private enterprise in America, and not merely landed as happens now at some port along the coast, and then they, strangers to the country are' left to shift for themselves. This has been fre^ 'quontly Urged upon the Government by the Opposition. ' If returned I will as I have'done previously, do* my utmost to advance the welfare of the mining industry. This industry has done more to advance Australia than any other. All industries in. a country like Queensland mnst'be of mutual benefit to each other and. the colony at large. - In reference to Pnblio Works I consider it the duty of the Government tn do their best to develop .the country, and this can only be done by making roads and bridges, and open ing up good means of communication, and this applies more especially to the newly settled portions of the colony. It is most necessary that the banks of tbe river along the frontage should be at once Srotected, aud that' everything should be one that may be conducive to the better navigation of tho Pioneer ri»«r. If returned I should do my utmost that the money for the purpose of protecting the bank of the river frontage, and which baa' already been voted, should be properly spent, and the work commenced at once. I consider it is the' duty of a memlier not only to see that the money is voted, but that it U as soon as 'possible properly applied to the work it is voted for. I consider tho North i. greatly neglected, especially Mackay, in reference to po«^al: arrangements. Toe carriage of the mails is' at present in the hands of one company, and' I think it is. the duty of the Government to' try and see if they oould not got competition. ?' I feel confident that would cure the dis advantages under which wo at present labour. Should you return me I Bhall he much' pleased.; I did my beat when I was last your member to gain your confidence, tnd trust I ?till retain it This time I hope it will be my duty to help to legislate for yonr welfare, and not merely to do my utmost to prevent bad legislation. As your member I will apply all the energy, ability, and experience I may possess to advanos your interests and tho welfare of tho colony, \- P, T.
