When *we make Government Railways, we^the»ta,xpayera-r^borrow the money and pay interest on it, getting the cash to do so from our land revenue, that is, by selling somany hundreds of thousands of acres yearlytoselectors or by auction*.

This is bald for, the trader, the farmer, and the workman, but 1 and the land-grubber, for it is when land is being sold by the Govern ment to raise revenue-by forced sale in fact - thatthey secure their big estates. It was thus the great estates of New South Wales were acquired! and those on the Dariing Downs. The sale bf thofcsajiuliS $f ^res of ls£l#did ^ the Peak Downs by Mr. Perkins for about'a..third of its value is a recent illustration.
