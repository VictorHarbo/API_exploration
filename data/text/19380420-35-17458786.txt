THE NAZIS IN DENMARK. Orders from Berlin. STRICTER MEASURES OF CONTROL. LONDON, April 19. German Nazis living in Denmark, acting under orders from Berlin, have for some time been active in South Jutland, according to the Copenhagen correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph." Under the Versailles Treaty this area of pre-war Germany was restored to Denmark. Leading politicians, he states, are insisting that general measures should be taken against the Nazis in Tiedjebelt district, where 6,240 votes by Germans were recorded at the last election, compared with 19,013 votes by Danes. The Danish Minister for Justice, Dr. Karl Steincke, has appointed a Police Commissioner to inquire into Nazi activities, as a result of the shooting incident in Parliament House last week. This is taken to indicate an in- tention more strictly to control the situation. [While the Danish Parliament was last week debating the new immigration law, to which Danish Nazis are opposed, a young man fired two shots in the Parliament building. It was revealed later that the shots were fired not with the object of harming anyone, but to draw attention to Nazi leaflets which the de- monstrator, Erik Westergaard, showered down on the Chamber. The pamphlets accused Parliament of corruption and misgovernment. Westergaard was arrested.]
