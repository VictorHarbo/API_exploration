Yesterday's sitting of the Legislative Assembly M au devoted to private members' business A good deal of time was taken upon a motion for adjournment, and when the motion had been withdrawn Mr Hawthorne moved for a select committee to inquire into the management of the abattoirs and the advisability of their removal , also as to the probable cost of a branch railway line to Glebe Island An amendment by Mr Macdonald, sinking out the clause referring to the Railway line, it is cur- ried, and the House then ballot ed for the election of the members of the committee The Diocesan TcBtn al in connection with the Church Society was hold yesterday afternoon, the proceedings being followed by a meeting in the rain fall, at 6 Inch Ina Excellency the Governor presided In addressing the audience Lord Hampden spoke at length upon the different positions occupied by the Church of England in the colonies and in Great Britain.

Complaints about the law's delays have lately been somewhat rife in the colony. They have been frequent of recent years in England, where a partial effort, at least, has been made to hasten the conduct of business. They have not been unknown in other parts of the Empire where it has been attempted to make the law more simple and to render the procedure loss tedious. It is not necessary, however, to enter into details or to reiterate grievances that have already been reported, The few remarks passed at the Supreme Court last Saturday, when the Attorney-General inquired " on behalf of the profession " what the order of business for this week would be, are sufficient to prove that a serious block has occurred in the work of the Law Courts in this colony. Mention was made of one case which had been held over since last September, and of another which had been before the Court since November. The Chief Justice averred that there was an appeal against one of his own decisions which had been delayed for several terms. The state of things is admittedly wrong. What every suitor wants, unless he is possessed with the passion for litigation which distinguished Peter Peebles, is a speedy decision upon the merits of his action. According to present appearances he may be compelled to remain a year in Sydney, although his interests may take him elsewhere, before a judgment can be obtained. The Judges and the leading members of the profession, on whose behalf the Attorney-General spoke, must be aware that there are three general conditions in the administration of justice. It should be as accurate as is possible in the circumstances of a trial ; it should be economical, so that everyone who is aggrieved an appeal to it and above all things, it should be immediate in order that the I litigants may be relieved by an authoritative decision, The question then arises as to the manner in which those conditions can be fulfilled the work is increasing, and, especially if appeals pour in from the Land Courts, is bound to increase "What has happened at the end of this term is likely, as far as we can judge from the top is, to happen at the end of every other than 'the Chief Justice lins dis exactly said that " we want a second court sitting in Banco, otherwise we cannot got through the work in the ordinary time " Unfortunately, however it is impossible apparently to constitute two Full Courts with the present staff in order to deal with appeals It may be pointed out that two Judges are sufficient to form a Full Court, and that in this way two Courts might be formed and the arrears of business settled But the objections to the system are too obvious to require any special notice It is a device that could only be adopted in compar actively mum portant cases Then the simple remedy is suggested of appointing more judges And if their appointment is absolutely necessary it is certain that the people will not grudge the expense, for everyone desires some sort of assurance that the business brought before the Law Courts will be settled within a reasonable time But the judicial staff of the colony is already large, and before we in crease it it is essential to ask first of all whether the business might not be expedited under the present system It is equally advisable to put this question before any sweeping changes in the procedure mo proposed which might not in the long run into the effect desired by the public there is no wish in any quarter to impair the efficiency of the administration of justice The complaint is merely one or delay, 'The hon grants have every faith in the judgments of the Courts , they object only to the fre- quent postponement of their cases And the question is, therefore, whether time that is now lost might not be saved There are several points which the legal authorities may be fairly asked to consider, both on botha i of li o profession and of the public Much tune, for instance, would be saved if the evidence were taken down and transcribed by shorthand writers It is rather a puzzle to laymen that the Law Courts shrink from this change in favour of which many arguments might be adduced The report is accurate and counsel can cross examine a recalcitrant or doubtful witness without allowing him a second to piece his story together A total account of the day's proceedings can be made available in the afternoon to the Judge and to the parties who are interested in the case We are concerned principally, however with the saving of time that would be effected With this s> stone the business of the Courts would be conducted 1101 o expeditiously, and it would consequently be possible to make better arrangements for the sitting of the Full Court Then, again it may be advisable to consider whether some measure could not be taken to prevent the bringing of what mo collo equally called " bogus " actions, which was to a certain amount of time and lead to nothing I bore have been complaints in Melbourne on this score It has been said that speculative actions are brought and that what ought to be indisputable actions mo defended by men of straw We are far from saying that a society ought to be given in every instance for the costs The poorest man who has a legitimate grievance must have access to the higher tribunals But is there no possibility of finding out whether an action has any real ments before it is allowed to number the law notices for weeks to the disadvantage of the man whose claim is -past 9 Another point that has been used in discussions on the subject is whether civil cases should not be more frequently heard before a Judge without a jury In this respect the lights and the wishes of the litigants must be kept in view But in many commercial cases the opinion of a Judge is more valuable than that of a jury and the trials would probably be shortened if they were argued solely on the legal merits and all appeals to son unions have struck out There is an old legal precept about time to " bamboozle a jury " While we believe in juries as judges of fact something might be gained if some of the technical and intricate cases that some before the Courts were heard only before a record law j or Again it lies with the Judges themselves to cut short the addresses and the arguments of the counsel that address them in appeal cases Nor is it exactly easy to see from the public point of NOW why three Judges who are agreed on the main points of mi issue should take up time by doll leaving three separate judgments in such cases there should be no necessity for the iteration and reiteration of points, which it is to be presumed, mo grasped imme lately both by the Judges and by the counsel £1010 is sometimes a tendency to differences, which, to say the least of it, is unprofitable and weak Such are some of the points which call for the consideration of the legal authorities The codification of the law, the question of revising the rules of procedure, the reform of the -[official system mo wider questions which belong to the future, and which will require much discussion and more Inborn What we are concerned with is the block in business under a system which ought to be sufficient for the needs of the day And it is surely the duty of the authorities to consider how they may expedite the public business and make its conduct more satisfactory to the public under the system which they are called upon to administer The increasing interest in the English market for Australian product) is to be accounted for as much by the necessities of the case as by the prospect of profit it holds out. The British demand for foodstuffs is increasing year by year instead of diminishing', and while this process is going on something similar is taking place in the United States, which country has been so largely relied onto meet that demand in the past. 'The population figures there are running up so rapidly that the time cannot be far distant when there will be mouths enough to con- sume the locally-grown produce, and thus leave no necessity to som! it abroad for a market. Mr. C. B. VALENTINE, who went home some time ago as Produce Commissioner for this colony and New Zealand, has just been dwelling on this side of the problem in a paper read by him before the Society of Arts in London, in the course of which he takes a most on couraging view of the prospects for Australian trade in the English market. with the increasing demands of the United States population, he thinks that Canada will find a readier market for her produce across the border, thus leaving the British field clearer for the Australian producer. It only remains for us to co-operate intelligently with the advantages we possess and the opening afforded us. We have to learn certain things and avoid others, with a view in the first instance to establishing a good name with the London salesmen and their public, and all the experts seem to be agreed that to do this we must take ourselves seriously I and send only sound and good produce for the acceptance of buyers on the other side of the world. Our mistakes in the past have already taught us this lesson, and the knowledge so acquired makes an excellent starting point for the development of flourishing trade relations It is satisfactory to be able to record that we have been taking ourselves so ously on this subject for some time past Mr VALEN rrvp told his head or on the occasion referred to that what the colonial producer does not know of English trade and the English market is now very little Tim Governments of the various colonies, the newspapers, and business firms and com pantos have been showing a considerable amount of enterprise in collecting and placing at the service of the public the best information available as to the requirements of the British consumer, and the best ways of producing and forward ing Among other facts so made clear we may name the patent necessity for picKed qualities and careful grading Not less important is the freight question, the necessity of regularity in the supply, and for thorough organisation of the trade so that sufficient quantities may be combined with v timely delivery HO as to take full advantage of the best conditions of the market The question of distribution is vital, as all inquiry on the subject has made abundantly apparent What the Special Commissioner from this paper had to say on this point a few months ago will doubtless be fresh in the minds of the reader, and Mr VAIIMIM IS at one with him in tins, that he expressed a strong opinion against what he calls gambling with the produce By this he means that the distribution should not be left to luck or chance, but be made a matter of strict organisation, and he favours the opinion of our Commissioner that consignments should be sent not only to London, but to such vast consuming areas as the iron working districts found Birmingham, the North Staffordshire potteries, the Lancashire cotton towns, and the mining counties in the north and west and south Yorkshire Hero the competition is not so keen, while the consuming populations served from easily avoidable centres are well and regularly paid, with a comparatively high standard of living and are not less numerous than the working population of London These points have already been forcibly brought out in the series of articles referred to, and the suggestions made have not been lost on our exporters Indeed, they may fairly congratulate themselves on having no cady done much to develop the interest of the trade on the lines of the best advantage We have done something for the trade besides achieving a prospect, though some of the other colonies have done better than we have New Zealand has won a name for her products, both by quality and regularity of supply Victoria reap a reward of one million sterling per annum for her efforts in developing her dairy industry South Australia is energetic in pushing the sale of her wines in London Our own ntlf riots in the live cattle trade have not been crowned with successes, and our droughts interfere sadly with our dairying industry Still we have not been i Ho and we have a large field before us the ] English demand for imported butter, for instance, line grown by nearly a million tons per annum in the past six years and of the nearly three million tons imported last year Aus the rinsing Mipphos one ninth, and comes third on the list after Denmark and France Of course Denmark come minds the great bulk of the trade but our butter has been pronounced by J Condon exports equal to Danish, and since the fad DI v System has been in operation it has always commanded a good race One of the speakers at the opening of the 1 Josh Food and lee Company s works at Grafton a few weeks back reminded his hearers that since the improved methods had been in use the export ingrown hourn few tons to 1 1,000 tons a year, at something like £90 a ton Afoanw while it is noticeable as a sign of the Biitishtondoncy to encourage Imperial trade, that Canada, the United States Germany and 1 muco all show a falling off in their butter export to England, while the volume of the Australasian export has increased proportionately more than that of any other country For years ago the Australasian contribution did not amount to a two hundredth part of the British importation, while two years ago it formed one eighth of the whole One great advantage we possess is that with out advantages, as Air Arm mr says for the manufacture of fresh glass butter in winter we might stop into the English market and fill the winter gap theoretical neither Denmark nor any of the other butter producing countries of the northern hemisphere can supply What applies to the trade in dairy products applies also to that in fruits Ino and frozen meat and in some measure to wines We have a splendid field before us, a practically unlimited encouragement to go on The private member was in excellent force in the Assembly last evening. A number of questions of the usual order having been disposed of a case growing out of the complaint of some foreign seamen as to the quality of their biscuits was thought to be of sufficient urgency to war rant amotion for adjournment, and for some time gave the House a comfortable sense that it was as one member said, " performing a duty." This weighty matter being disposed of the House had the opportunity afforded it of performing another duty by philanthropically interest in" itself in the case of a tram conductor, with, having been dismissed from the service in 1890, awoke three years afterwards to the feeling that he had been unjustly treated, and thereupon took action in which last night's proceeding was the outcome of. Then a fine opportunity was afforded for the display of the local patriotism of several hon. members about the question of the removal or the maintenance of the Glebe Island Abattoirs, which enabled the Assembly to got pleasantly through the rest of the evening. Such was the outcome of a night spent in what is ironically called private members'' business. We are often son seriously told that " representative institutions are' on their trial." If the assertion were so arranged as to road that the public patience is put to severe trial by the way in which representative institutions are worked, few would desire to dispute its perfect correctness. If the estimate now given of the loss of life by the crush at the peasants' banquet at Moscow be approximately correct it may be that it represents the greatest sacrifice of life by more accidental conditions upon record. The present enumera- tion is 3600 persons killed outright and 1200 in the hospitals, most of whom are fatally injured. There has, of course, been much larger destruction of human life in fields of battle, and the numbers who have perished from great flood disasters or earthquake convulsions have frequently been much greater. The breaking loose of the Yellow River, the " Sorrow of China," has sometimes swept away the population, of half,e-,province, and the earthquake at Lisbon swallowed I up 10,000 lives. But these are effects of. outbursts of the great forces of nature, not, as in the Moscow case, results of human carelessness and miscalculation. The burning of the crowded Jesuits' Church at Santiago in Chili in 1863, with the loss of over 2000 lives, comes nearer to the present Russian calamity than any other purely human accident we can at present recall, but if the estimate last given be correct the Moscow calamity is considerably in excess of its results. We probably see one of the first fruits of the visit to Europe of Li HUNG CHANG, the Chinese Viceroy, in the despatch to China of Colonel trimmer with 20 German teachers of drill, to reorganise the army of China upon the model, we may presume, of that of Germany. If the new departure is a genuine one and is steadfastly persisted in, it may be the most important stop that has been taken in the Far East for many a day. It has been strongly maintained by military exports that the late war between China and Japan indicated nothing as to the relative fighting powers of the two races, but merely illustrated the difference between administrative and military chaos and corruption on the one side, and discipline and efficiency on the other. It certainly did not prove that, an forman and under even conditions, the Chinaman is inferior to the Japanese. And it left in full force the fact that there are 300 millions on one side as against 35 millions on the other. What Chinamen are capable of under the conditions of discipline and effective leadership was demonstrated in such a way by the " Ever Conquering Army " of General GORDON as to require no further proof. It has happened several times in the history of nations as, for instance, with the Prussians after Jena and with the French after Sedan that a great military overthrow, by utterly destroying a bad and effete system, has become the starting point of a reorganisation which has resulted in the creation of a formed able military Power. Whether this will be the result in China will probably depend largely on the capacity and sound- ness of the Government. At any rate, a first step has been taken which may issue in the addition of a military power of the first magnitude to the nations of the world. Some utility ought to come out of the labours of the committee representing the various municipal councils of the city and the northern suburbs, and sitting to investigate and report upon the proposals to secure communication across the harbour. The matter is not yet in a state sufficiently ripe to justify the Government in taking it up and submitting a scheme to Parliament. What is wanted is some authoritative indication as to the wishes of the metropolitan public interested in the question. There are matters which the Government must at the proper time determine for itself with the concurrence of the Legislature. But there are others, as for example whether a bridge or a tunnel be preferred, and, if a bridge, what kind of traffic it should provide for, upon which it must be helpful to have the views of the city municipal representatives. If the committee does not aim at too much and does its proper work intelligently and impartially it may render the Government and Parliament useful service The TICK PL AGUE AND VIEWS on Ne.wcASTLe The Sydney limit of the present week should prove of special interest to cattle owners and others who are likely to have to deal with the term ble plague which is doing so much destruction amongst the stock of Northern Queensland In addition to special articles from our special commissioner, who is Mailing Northern Queensland and making inquiry into the subject, there are a number of diagrams showing the method adopted for destiny ing the ticks h\ precipitating infected little into pans filled with a suitable solution The Mail also contains some fine panoramic view h of the city of New cattle One gets a view of the II in for Iii v ei with its large fleet of vessels waiting for coal another gives a bird's eye view of the city and there. are two or three incident,!] pictures The meet of the Hampden Cycling, Riding, and Driving Club forms the subject of several sketches by the special artist of the If III, Mr Norman II lady The PORT DARWIN Tfru-nuAPii LINK-Com momentum on the Port Darwin line, which was interrupted on Monday night, was rest 01 ed at 7 30 n m y catering MINISTERIAL VISIT ToDninwoiNE This morning the Premier, the Minister for Works, and the Post-master General, accompanied by Mr. Parnell, AILA, of all pay a visit to the Drummoyne portion of the Ryde electorate They will leave town at li o'clock, starting in a ding from the General Post Olino Advantage will be taken of the v sit by the Premier to look into the question of the removal of the abattoirs NEW Go^ntYMj-NT BILES-In the Legislate of Assembly last night the Minister for Justice gave notice of the following motions for to-day " Hut leave he given to him, in a bill to provide that all fees received by public officers shall be paid and accounted for us money received by them on account of the revenue within the mean- ing of the Audit Act of 1876 and " That this House will, to- morrow, resolve itself into a Com- men too of the Whole to consider the expediency of bringing in a bill to authorise the appointment of stipendiary magistrates and their deputies to have jurisdiction within the police district of Ken engine, and within such districts as the Governor may direct, and within the districts to which the Governor may extend this Act to define the jurisdiction, powers, and duties of the said magistrates and deputies, and to limit the jurisdiction of other justices within those dis nets and for other purposes in connection there with " Titi Cm RAILWAY SCHEME the Minister for Works, Mr. J.
