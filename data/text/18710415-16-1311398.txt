Light Brigade sailed a full ship on April 6 Her cargo, consists of 500 casks tallow and 2700 bales wool, in addition to upwards of 100 cases preserved meats, Ac, c Sionit KuiO -This fine ship is more than half loaded, and is expected to be ready for sea in about three weeks from date A large quantity of cotton-the first picking of the season will be sent to the market by this ship. Star Queen has nearly completed her discharging, and is preparing to receive dead weight for London, following the Storm King on the homeward berth. Freights for London are as follow Clean] wool and cotton, 5d per lb , greasy wool, 'd in full, the ship taking delivery at Ipswich, of low, 50s per ton, and 5 per cent , timber 50s per 40 cubic feet, hides, 40s and 5 per cent per ton of 10 hides, preserved meats, 50s per ton in full, measurement goods, 50s per ton, and 5 per cent, horns, 25s and 5 per cent per 1000 , common bones and hoofs, 25s , and 5 per cent per ton, bone dust 20s per ton The last package of inward cargo on board the Salamander n ns put over the side early on the morning of SOth March-the vessel having completed the discharge of her entire loading, amounting to 1000 tons of dead weight and measurement goods, in less than twelve and a half working days The ship reported at the Custom-house. on Thursday, March 9, and on Monday, the 13th, the hatches were opened The discharge was continued until Friday, the 17th Next day she was towed into the river, but owing to the want of lighters did not dis- charge anything further until Wednesday, the 22nd , since there were no interruptions, except the 26th, which was Sunday the whole of this work, we should mention, has been done by the ship's own crew-, and without the aid of steam power for ho sting Both officers and men deserve credit for the proving titude dis ployed The outward loading is progressing with equal rapidity, and since the 3rd April the following has been put on board -360 bales wool and cotton 156 casks and tierces tallow, 73 logs cedar 30 tons bones and hoofs, 650 hides, 5000 horns, and 15 tons bone dust He further engagements include about 1000 bales wool, 100 tons cotton seed 5000 treenails bo sides some minor parcels of sundries It will be remembered that on the voyage out this ship sprung both the fore and mainmast so badly that it has been found noce sary to supply her with new ones Mr W C Boardman, the shipwright, has undertaken the contract for the new masts, a id now is actively engaged in preparing them. They are to be built of s, clow wood, a native timber much used for ships' spurs for which it is eminently adapted The old format has been unshipped, and the main will be taken out in a day or two From the present rate of progress, there is no doubt that the vessel will be ready for sea during the last week in April The Elizabeth Dougal The fine little vessel has made the fastest passage of the sea son having accomplished the run from Deal to Moreton Bay in 86 days Captain White in forms us that he discharged the pilot off Deal on January 4 1871, and on January 25 crossed the Equator in longitude 28 38 W on February 17th, meridian of Greenwich in 37 50 S , latitude She ran down her sister" in the forty sixth parallel of south latitude On March 21 she rounded the S E Cape, Tasmania, and on the 27th was off Cape Moreton The wind proving baffling she stood out to sea during the night, and at 4 a.m. on the 28th stood in for the land. She was boarded by Pilot Howe at 7 a in and at 3 30 p in the same day anchored Brisbane Roads During the passage light winds prevailed She has since been towed up to the late, and will be berthed alongside Harris' wharf by next springs The Gctenbeeg -The ship Gutenberg left Hamburgh on the 16th December, went down the Elbe and anchored at Cuxhaven, weighed anchor on the 20th and put to bed , had squally weather till the end of December, on the 1st January spoke the English ship Cherwell in latitude 27 53 longitude 22 24, on the 8th spoke the Swedish ship William Ann, and the Iron King, an English vessel, on the 10th passed a Danish brig and a Norwegian barque name unknown on the 11th January crossed the Line, on the 19th spoke the English vessel Cour de Lion from London, bound for Adelaide, passed several other vessels, but did not speak with them, sailed as far south as 46 degrees, arrived off King's Island, Bass' Straits, on the 10th March and anchored in Keppel Bay, under Seaview Hill, on the 24th instant the ship Bailed with 45 adults, married, 120 single men, 19 single females, and 36 children, equal to 202 statute adults There were six deaths on the passage Olof Christoph Chris Bennett, aged 33 , Heinrich Otto Forster, aged nine months, Matilde Friedericke Peterson 2 years, Haven Maria Beck, 38 years and Carl Friedrich Fohansen, 21 years (3 Danes, 1 Hoe steamer, 1 Swede) The deaths in most cases were from chest diseases, the patients having left home for their health The immigrants consist chiefly of farm laborers and domestic servants (though the number of single women is not over 17 There are a few bricklayers, 1 mason, 1 cooper, 1 wheelwright, a few shoemakers, 1 saddler, and one or two tailors They are a fine sturdy lot of people, and appear to have conducted themselves in an unexceptionable manner on board ship, as no complaints have been heard against them, and they speak well of the officers of the ship They speak very highly of the captain especially, whose word appears to have been law - Rockhampton Bulletin, March 28 H M surveying schooner Pearl, Commander T P Bedwell, returned from the last cruise of the season of 1870 71, on March 15 The cruising ground throughout the season, which extends from March to March, has been principally in Hervey's Bay, and along the coast from Sloping Hummock to Rodd a Boy In the period mentioned 190 miles of coast line have been surveyed, including 100 miles from Sloping Hummock, in Hervey's Bay, to Rodd's Bay, plotted on a one inch scale, 50 miles, comprising Rodd's Bay to Seal Rocks, 38 miles in the Burnett River from its mouth to the town ship of Bundaberg, and 2 miles in Pancake Creek, Bush rd Bay The last survey is laid down on a scale of twelve inches to the mile Besides those,., 2150 square miles of soundings have been taken While cruising work with compulsory suspended from bad weather for forty days in the season She started on his last cruise on January 26, and on January 29 rounded Sandy Cape, and reached her station between Sloping Hummock and Port Curtis the work on the coast was completed on February 7, and that day she entered Rodd's Bay The examination of this opening with its branches Rodd Harbor and the Seven mile Creek, and the completion of the survey of Puncuke Creek, occupied the remainder of the trip Roda Harbor affords Einig and sheltered harbourage The Seven-mile Creek is deep enough to afford anchorage for even the largest clubs of vessels for a considerable distance from the entrance which, however, is narrow, and obstructed by a sandbank This shoal is divided into a fork at the eastern end, and is remarkable for its steep abrupt edges 4. passage from Road Bay to Port Curtis was supposed to lay between the mainland and the Seal Rocks but the survey proves that no such channel exists Taking the time of year into consideration, the Pearl had very fair weather through out the cruise She, however, had to contend against a severe S E gale on her passage from Rodd's Bay to Moreton Bay Off the coast a very strong current was felt, which drifted the i easel sixty miles to the south in the teeth of the gale The Star Queen -The Black Ball liner Star Queen, Captain L Evans, anchored in Moreton Bay on March 20, having made a passage of eighty seven days from Liverpool-a run seldom accomplished hitherto She brings 22 passengers who were all landed in excellent health The passengers were under the medical supervision of Dr A R Miller, a gentleman already favorably known here in connection with Queensland Immigra- tion The following report of the paiR Barge has been furnished us by Captain Evans the Star Queen weighed anchor in the Mersey on December 21, 1876, at 4 p.m. and was cast off by the tug at Point Lynam The wind was ben moderate, from S. E. by S. , which enabled her to make good way down St George's Channel, and at 2 30 am on the 22nd she was abreast of Tuskar Light There also had a strong breeze accompanied by a confused sea to the 25th, by which time the ship had got into the Bay of Biscay for about forty eight hours she was becalmed, and made no progress, but labored heavily in a tremendous cross sea which was then running On the 27th December a westerly breeze sprung up, and the ship at once made headway Westerly and south westerly winds prevailed in the North Atlantic, and compelled the ship to make a rather more easterly track than usual. She passed within 100 miles of Madeira, and on the 21st day out crossed the equator in longitude 27 0 W The south east trades were very light, but nevertheless the vessel made good progress, and on February 8, 1871, passed the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope, 48 days out. The casting was run between the 45th and 16th parallels of S latitude, and though the weather was for the most part thick and foggy, she had remarkably smooth water, She rounded Tasmania on March 4, 73 days out, and from there had dirty disagreeable weather constant rains and thunderstorms, with variable winds and calms Moreton Bay was entered in the afternoon of March 20, after a passage of 87 days, all well on board Throughout, the passage has been remarkable for the prevalence of light winds, and, indeed, the topgallant suis were never for led from the time she entered the Bay of Biscay until after she made the eastern coast of Australia. With regard to the passengers, there has not been more than the usual amount of those maladies which appear almost inseparable from a long bon voyage All were landed in good health, and the utmost good feeling appears to have prevailed all through the ship. A numerously signed address has been handed to us In little passengers express their sense of the kindnesses i received by them from all connected with the vessel, including Captain Evans, Dr. Miller, the surgeon-Bupcrintendont, Miss Davidson, the matron, the officers and crew. The feelings are evidently held in common, and Captain Evans has desired us to express his good wishes for the success of his late folio w voyagers
