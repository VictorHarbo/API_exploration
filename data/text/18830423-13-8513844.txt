SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL SUMMARY. Parliament was prorogued on Thursday last by His Excellency the Governor. It is understood that Minsters will take a two months' recess to prepare their measures for the ensuing session. Payment of members was affirmed by the Assembly on April 11 by 13 votes to 28\. The bill was introduced by Mr. Gillies, the Minister of Railways, as a private member, and continues the existing system, under which the members of the Assembly are allowed £300 a year, until the end of the first session of the next Parliament. In the Le0islative Council tho mensuro niot with littlo fa\ our At tho same timo, tho House did not caro to take upon Uso'f the responsibility of terminating the system in faco of the fact that a ma3ority of tho membors of the Assombly wero returned at tho rocont ¡jonoral oloction in suppoit of it Iho belief was gencrilly e\piosaed in the Council that public opinion has bcon considerably niodilicd on tho subject of payment of mombers, and nno liadical niomber \entnred to prophesy that the day was not fui distant whou it would bo abolished iho bill was passed with out i dmaion Important additions to the existing railway lines have been authorised. They were provided for in the Railway Construction Bill of last session, which lapsed with the prorogation. The North- Eastern line is to be duplicated as far as Seymour, and extra lines laid down on the suburban system, to meet heavy traffic requirements. A serious accident nearly happened a few days ago at the South Yarra Junction, where a dangerous cutting exists, and public attention was thus prominently called to the necessity for immediate alterations and improvements.

On the subject of the recent prosperity, he ex pressed the opinion that the community over imported last year. He referred to the leading position in Australasia of Melbourne as a wool entrepot and expressed the belief that our trade ln that staple with the Euro- pean Continent and America waa likely to increase. He avowed sanguine hopes as to the growth of the wine and hop growing industries, and his remarks as to the desir ableness of promoting immigration were specially applauded.

" Melbourno, 10th April, 1S83 ' ANNEXATION OF NEW GUINEA. Intimation was publicly made about a month ago that the Government of Queens land had completed arrangements for taking possession in the name of her Majesty of such portions of New Guinea as are not claimed by the Dutch, pending a reply from the Imperial authorities. Shortly after, Mr Chester, police magistrate at Thursday Island, left for New Guinea to formally take possession of the island, and on the 4th inst the annexation was formally accom plished. The following proclamation was read by Mr Chester -" I, Henry Majoribanks Chester, resident magistrate at Thursday Island, in the colony of Queensland, acting under instructions from the Government of the said colony, do hereby take possession of all that portion of New Guinea, and the islands and isles adjacent thereto, lying between the 141st and 155th meridians of east longitude, in the name and on behalf of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs and successors. In token whereof I have hoisted and saluted the British flag at Port Moresby, Now Guinea, this 4th day of April, in the year of Our Lord, 1883. God Save the Queen." Thirteen Europeans and 200 natives were present while the proclamation was read. The first news of the fulfillment of Mr Chester's mission was received via Cooktown on the 15th inst. The action of the Queens- land Government met with the cordial sup port of the Government of Victoria. Before official communications passed between the two colonies, Mr Grant brought the matter under the attention of the Legislative As sembly. He said he had observed that Sir Thomas M'llwraith, formerly a citizen of Melbourne, had taken possession of New Guinea on behalf of the Queensland Govern ment. This was a proceeding for which the Queensland Premier deserved the thanks of the whole of the Australian colonies. (Hear, hear). The Premier (Mr Service) concurred in the remark of Mr Grant, and his doing so was recoived with cheers. On the following day cable messages received by The Argus from its London correspondent made it seem likely that the Imperial Government would be influenced against the step taken by Queensland. Mr Service forthwith telegraphed to the Governments of New South Wales and South Australia, asking them to join Victoria in instructing their respective agents general to support promptly and earnestly the action of the Queensland Government. He received the following tele gram from Sir Thomas M'llwraith, Premier of Queensland, the same day -" Observe with pleasure that the annexation of New Guinea meets with your approval, but as I fear undue pressure upon Imperial Government to repudiate our action, I will be obliged if you cable your agent general to inform Lord Derby that the people of Victoria heartily approve of it, and urge his lordship's confirmation." In reply to this message Mr Service telegraphed that he had already communicated with the adjoining colonies, and he concluded, "I thank you in the name of the people of Victoria for the action taken." At the same time he cabled to Mr Murray Smith, the agent general for Victoria, us follows - "Promptly and earnestly support Queensland Government in their action in respect to New Guinea." The New South Wales Government have telegraphed to their agent general that they view the annexation of New Guinea with favour.
