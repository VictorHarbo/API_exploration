He keeps the price down, not worth selling in town, And they say they are used very ill. But what cores M'Carroll for all they can say ? Fair prices they call underselling. Poor people would have such high prices to pay, That distress would walk into each d trolling. To live and let live is the motto of Phil ; Man to man should be fair in his dealing; Full measure and weight at a fair paying rate, Then we all got along with good feeling. He is only one man in the whole butcher dan, Why don't they his principles follow? The truth of it now, they do not know how, And they find he is beating them hollow. He can lead all the trade, and then be well paid, No half-and-half measures, no middle; He has but one way to take the fall away, Phil, never can play second fiddle. But the fault is their own, as is easily shown, They should know how to manage their trade. If they will not come down with their prices in town, Why then they must only be made.

Family Pill is a medicine of long- tried efficacy for purifying the blood, so very essential for the foundation of good health, and correcting all disorders of the stomach and bowels. Two or three doses will convince the afflicted of its salutary effects. The stomach will speedily regain its strength ; a healthy action of the liver, bowels, and kidneys, will rapidly take place; and renewed health will be the quick result of taking this medicine, according to the directions accompanying each box. Persons of a full habit, who are subject to headache, giddiness, drowsiness, and singing in the ears, arising from the great flow of blood to the head, should never be without them, as many dangerous symptoms will be entirely carried off by their timely use. For females, these pills are truly excellent, removing all obstructions, the distressing headache so very prevalent with the sex, depression of spirits, dulness of sight, nervous affections, blotches, pimples, and sallowness of the skin, and give healthy, juvenile bloom to the complexion. To mothers they are confidently recommended as the best medicine that can be taken, and for children of all ages they are unequalled. . . "s These pills unite the recommendation of a mild operation with the most successful effect; and for elderly people, or where an occasional aperient is required, nothing out be better adapted. . Her Majesty's Commissioners have authorised the name and address of Thomas Prout, No. 229, Strand London," to be impressed upon the Government stamps affixed to each ton of the genuine medicine.
