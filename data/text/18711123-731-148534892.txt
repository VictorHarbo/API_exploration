CORRESPONDENCE. DEMAND FOR LABORERS. To the Editor of the Chronicle. SlB.â€” The ship ' Royal Dane,' with immi grants, being daily expected in Brisbane, the department in the metropolis would confer a favor on this district by forwarding about 150 oP'them ' to Maryborough. Referring to the supply of labor for agriculture, there is always a feast or a famine. The scarcity of labor, whenever it occurs, tails heavily on the em ployers, and owing to the slow mode of loco , motion, t^e peajjQn. is geqeJfftHy pagt Yfh$n the swagmen begin to swarm ; an.l there is no doubt these rovers themselves have been often disgusted at the difficulty of getting employ ment. Employers of labor, so far as I am aware of the fact, had amply supplied them selves with laborers from among the Danish people who arrived at the beginning of the year, biit as nearly the whole of them ran away from their places as soon as wages began to rise, their employers are now left in the lurch. Leaving the further consideration of the causes and effects of this subject for the pre sent, I beg to say again that there is employ ment for a large number of farm laborers at good wages in the district at present. I may mention as a proof of their scarcity that in many instances the men have struck for higher wages. I request you, sir, to publish my remarks, so that the Minister for Works may be induced to take steps to remedy the evil. I am. yours faithfully, A Planter. November 23rd.
