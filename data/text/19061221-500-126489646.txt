A WORD TO FARMERS. ? In connection . with the immigration movement, advices have been received to: the effect that good opportunities exist from time to time of inducing | agriculturists _ from Northern Europe . to. make their : home in New South Wales: The question has arisen whether it; wouiu be advisable to hold out any offers to this class of farm labourer, in view of the fact that the men would be -unable to speak the language, and might, therefore, on arrival, have diffi culty in securing employment-. Thoro is, no doubt that tho agriculturist of Northern Europe would make an ideal settler of New South Wales, and if the difficulty of his employment could be got over, a considerable advantage would accrue to the State by his settle ment here. German, Danish, or Scan- , dinavian land-holders who would be willing to employ men of their own nationality are, therefore, invited to make the fact known to the Director of the Intelligence Department, Sydney, . Avbpn.' tlie matter of securing immi grants from those countries would be considered.
