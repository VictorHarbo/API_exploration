TO THE EDITOR OF THE ADM.VIDE ADVERTISER. Dear fcir—I tiusfc you will allow me space in your valuable columns to conlralicttha assertions mads by the reporter of .the Adelaide Register in Satur day's issue of that paper. I may state that I have \travelled in all parts of the Known world where other artists had not dared to go.' I pe-formed in Australia, Fiji, Sandwich Islands. .Tava.Siain, India. China, Japan, and all through Great Britain and Europe. For the past eighteen month\ I have been in . London very busy manufacturing the apparatus now used by me, and then this reporter of the Register "l.as the audacity to assert it'is as ancient as Noah's Ark, oIsolds to that effect. • X may state that' my partner. Arthur St. Vincent, and I» during onr visit to the old .country contrived to see every corjurer, and we could not gain one single idea, or see a new trick performed by any one of thfm either in England, France, Germany, Hol land. or Belgium. I therefore stand prepared to challenge the afore-. said reporter, or any person, professional or other . wise, to produce any one of my original illusions for the sum of £1,OCO, which I am ready to stake at any moment. . I may also state that during my travels I have: never received such a false report as the one given by the ri presentaiive of (he Adelaide Register in . Saturday's paper. • Everywhere wherever I have been and performed I have always received that amount of praise. which my entertainment merits, and therefore I can only arrive at one of two conclusions—either the reporter .abovtmeniioned must be trying by some under current (best known to himself! to damn my enter tainment as worthless withont just cause, or other wise every other reporter wherever I have been, Melbourne and Sydney included, axe base perverters of the truth. To prr ve I am competent in my line of profession I cordially invite you. Sir, or any of the public in geneial,to come and witness tuy entertainment for once, and then if you or they arrive at the same' conclusion as the reporter before referred to, I will - for ever cease to be an Illusionist, and turn a true representative of the press. - Trusting yon will excuse my trespassing cn your valuable space, I am, dear Sir, yours respectfully, PROPKSSOK W.
