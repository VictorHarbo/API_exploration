The brigantine Vanquish cleared ont last week for Melbourne, and sailed on Sunday morning; but from a telegram received bv Captain J. W. Smith, it appears she proceeded no further than Cape Jervis, where she got on shore. Immediately on receipt .of the intelligence. Captain Smith arranged to proceed thither with a steamtug in order torender assistance; but it was a matter of conjecture whether she would float off or not, as she had filled with water. The cargo on board at the time of sailing was as follows;—15 tons flour, 250 qrs. wheat, J. W. Smith; 246 bags wheat, J. King; 15 tons wheat, J. Dunn and Son; 5 do. pollard, Magarey and Co.; 91 bags barley, W. Younghusband, Jun., and Co.; 127 bags bones, Pitt. She is commanded by Captain Leddra, who is well known as an experienced coaster, having been for many years engaged in the inter colonial trade. The vessel is insured. The Susanne, from Hamburg, brings 43 pas sengers and the usual description of cargo, par ticulars of which will be given when she enters inwards at the- Custom-House. Daring the passage nothing of importance occurred. The Margaret Dayib arrived from Melbourne on Tuesday evening; having experienced some very heavy weather outside. Having no pilot on board, on nearing the Station a very brilliant light was exhibited, which attracted the attention of the lookout on shore. She is in ballast, and will lead a cargo of colonial produce here. The Claba Novello, from Liverpool, is com manded by Captain Hingston, a gentleman who successfully sailed the Queen of Sheba .when the first furor of the Victorian gold-fields broke out, and caused the exodus of South Australians some years back. His present charge is a fine barque, though from a constant succession of unfavourable weather she has been unable to make any exhibi tion of sailing qualities, from the Crozets to the Leuwin being the only portion of the passage satisfactorily performed. She lefc Liverpool on August 9. and was 43 days to the Line, losing the north-east trade in lafc. 17°. and experiencing southerly breezes to three degrees south of the equator- On arrival at the auchorage, the pilot was under the impression that there would be. sufficient water on the bar next morning, but the easterly wind cut the tide, and after towing past the Lightship, he was compelLd to return to anchor, where it is more than probable the Tessel will remain till next springs. She has on board a large consignment of gunpowder, which will be landed in due course at the North Arm." The Jane Bell.—Captain Osborne is still an invalid from the effects of the late savage assault on him, and in consequence the .brig was detained at the Lightship, but will sail immediately in charge of Captain Stevenson (late of the Exonia.) TJte Preciosa is a smart three-masted schooner, which touched for orders, with a cargo of tea from Foochow. «L'he Southern Cross, with a full cargo of Mauritius sugar, called for orders on Saturday, and her destination being Hobart Town, she received, on hoard supplies of fresh provisions, and Captain Lulliam intended sailing on Sunday evening. By his courtesy wc hare later papers from Port Louis, extracts from which are made elsewhere. He reports having experienced a perfect hurricane on November 1, and when off King George's Sound on the 25th, it blew a violent gale from the east ward. The Lobenzen is a full ship from Puget Sound, timber laden, aiid dnring the pissage she reports a continuation of light variable weather, except on Rearing the Australian shores when a gale or two from the westward was experienced. As she draws 18 feet water, it will be necessary to lighten in Light's Passage before proceeding into harbour, and for the same reason she was a prize worth racing for amongst the pilots, and a better con tested match never could he sailed than ihat between the Mercury and Young St. George on Friday morning. When there is but one pilot cutter cruising; and she has no opposition boat out, it is seldom they proceed out of sight of the Sema phore Jetty, ana on the Lorenzen being signalled on Friday there was only one cutter out. She was abreast, when the Mercury, having picked up an opposition pilot, made a hold start, and so far weathered on the George in a tea-mile race that she only lost the vessel by a few boats' lengths. It is very amusing to witness these exciting matches from the shore, affording as they do many more opportunities for the exhibition of nautical tactics than any regatta at the Port with the additional incentive of a more valuable prize to the winner. The Caixenoeb, from Melbourne, has a loco motive engine on deck, and in consequence of boisterous weather anchored in Antechamber Bay on Thursday night. The Lass of Gawler, from Newcastle, reports leaving in company with the barque Dragon and brig Ellen, uonnd to Adelaide. The schooner Hercules sailed on November 21 and the brig Pose of Aus tralia on the 27th. The Lass experienced light weather throughout the passage, and immediately on arrival proceeded into harbour. The Cynthia made a fine run from Port Lincoln to Port Adelaide in 21 hours. Wreck of the Vanquish.—We are informed that Captain J. W. Smith returned from the wreck of the Vanquish off Cape Jervis on Friday after noon, and repot t£ thai he found her full of water, but that from all he could see of the hull, site ap peared to be pretty free from damage above. The schooner Alexandra was employed and labour from . the shore obtained to remove as much of the cargo as could he got at, and to convey it to Port Ade laide with the stores. The master reports going on shore at midnight, with the weather very thick, and the land not visible. He says rite grounded imperceptibly to him while he was steading on the - house, hhe has since drifted close in to the shore, and now lies perfectly upright. It was the opinion .of Hie Surveyor that site had a large hole in her bottom. Ybbsels Spoken.—By the Oara Novello—On September IT jrn 1st. 7"18' N., long. 25° 23!

The Brig Ensign*.—There is now, alas, too much reason to conclude that the fears some short time since expressed in this paper re specting this vessel were well founded. Eveiy effort has been made by the relatives of Captain Bond to ascertain with certainty, if possible, the fate of the vessel and those who were embarked in her. The following paragraph from the New castle Chronicle of November 12 contains about all that has come to light on the subject"There can scarcely be any doubt as to the certainty of the loss of the vessel, which left here in company with others that were lost on the occasion of the recent disastrous gales. The brig leit Newcastle for Hobart Town with 270 tons coals on the 30th September, and encountered the full force j of the gale which sprung up several hours after her departure. Siuce then no tidings whatever of the vessel could be gleaned until last Sunday evening, when two fisher men arrived here from Hannah Bay, with , the intelligence that two days after the gale a stern boam was picked up with the name J Ensign" painted on it. Some other pieces of wreck were discovered, which led to the belief that the vessel bad met with a similar fate to the others which left iu company with her. Yesterday afternoon the fishermen conveyed up to New castle the quarter-boats of the ill-fated brig; and this to a certain extent confirmed the report of tbe loss. We think now there can be no reasonable doubt as to her total less, together with all hands, as in the event of the vesselliaviug been wrecked and the erew reached the shore something would have been beard of them ere now." The Jfew cas'le Telegraph of the 19tli says:—"The gene rally-prevailing opinion is that the brig has gone down at sea, and this would account for the quarter-boards being? the only recognised vestiges ! cf the wreck that have been found, notwithstanding the diligent search that has been made in various directions alo?.g the coast. The circumstances attending this wreck have left, a profound and melancholy impression on the minas of many in Newcastle, where Captain Bond was not only ex tensively acquainted, but universally esteemed. Faithful and assiduous in the discharge of his duties, having made one of the quickest passages on record between Adelaide and Brisbane, he was anxious, in the interests of his owners, to complete thfe round of his voyage from here to Hobart Town with the same dispatch. He therefore left port on that fatal night, much against the wishes of his relatives and friends, who revert to the sub ject now as if they had a preconsciousness that this which has befallen ° was to be." Apart from the personal regret felt for Captain Bond, he had so recently given proof of his active benevolence in the case of the sufferers of the lifeboat "accident as to raise him in the estimation of all who were cognizant of his exertions in that behalf. Not only did he contribute liberally to this fund, but ; devoted himself to collecting the contributions of others, and from the various vessels in port he obtained upwards of £100 towards this object. Captain Bond was in tbe prime of life, a widower, having married Miss Brunker, of this place, sister of Mr. James Brunker, of East Maitland, and it is not too much to say that he enjoyed the esteem of all who knew him." Captain Bond was also well known to and esteemed by a large circle of friends in tliis colony, who were ever glad of the oppor tunities which his visits to the Port gave of renew ing acquaintance with him. His nearest surviving relatives are also in this colony—his sis sisters, Miss . Bond and Mrs. Thos. Colton, of Maclaren Vale, whose "hope deferred" has reluctantly given place to the sad belief that he who was so lately with them in the fulness of health and manly vigour has met a fate similar to that of an elder brother, who several years ago. during a storm in the Bay i of Biscay, was washed from the deck of the vessel he commanded.
