An apology was received from the president of thii Chamber of Mantufactures (Mr. It. Piel Sallsbury). At tile )head table were seatedt ttil Agent-General, the President of the Cltamber of Comtnlerce the Mayor (Atl dermtult Claude James), tie vice-prest dent (Mr. R.

They were gathered that aftetrnoon to s1pY au revoir to Colonel Snowdel, wtho htIt recently been appointed Agent-General for Tasmania in EnItglunld, began tthe Mayor. All were very glad to hltve tiu, opportunitiy to meet C te Ageott-Generatl and congratulate him on the IapponItt mont. (Aplplause.) It needed few words to introduce Colonel Snlowden to an assclntbige of Lttaucestotn busintte lmen, becaCus L e wa11 e tl klown throughout the ittxttl,. Their tguest was for ueveral years Mayor of Iloblrt and hbad beelt ttsoceia.ted with other otet.ions in t.hl communlry. Colonel SnowdetU was now lteavlntg Tasmania to take up a position which might or might nota he of very great value to the state, accordlng to the wily It was thandled by the man occupy Ittg it. He hatd heard it said that as Australia had a Trade Commissioner and a staff at Austrttlla HI-o11Se a state Agoat. General was not needed. As far as Tasmanita was concerned, he was con vlincod that a diroct representative in the old land was decidedly to their adva.n tage. The Agent-General could find markets for our prloductis, ent on Mr. James. He could introduce to investors the mnineral resources of the atate, and-a very Im tportannt matter, indeed-mlake fsure that the right class of immigrant wats sent out. This responsible aoficer could do quite a numl.er of things to secure the right kind -of settler. Then there was the big question of bringing under the notice of the manufacturers the facilities land advantages that Tasmnanl offered tor the establishment of Industries. The state boasted bountiful water supplies and alnmost uulimited hydro-electrma -power. With these assets Ithe felt conli dent that Tasmania was to become a great Industrial centre, anti the Agent (eneral could hasten this most desir able end. Col. Snowden was going to England not to represent one particular part of the state, but In the interests of the wholo country, proceeded the Mayor. He felt sure that If Col. Snowden could. send an industry to Launceston he would do so; but It a manuflacturer opened up In any other part of the state they would tall reallso that it was for the benefit of tihe state, and that. this being so. Launces ton would benefit. TI? RIIGHT MAN. On behalf of the Chamber of Commerce he would extend to the Ageatt-General a cordial welcome, and wish hhIt bon voy age and every success it his office. (Applause.) Mr. Norman Smith (a pnat-tpresident of the chamber) endorsed the president's re mtarls, and added hhis congratulatlona ulpon Col. Suowden'sa pilpoilnttent. Col. Snowden was tlive to the state's advantages and needs, tidded Mr. Smith. He had been travelling the state to mttakle himself thoroughly convertsant with all parts, and all hoped that Col. Snowdon would b,e instrumental in seeding imore industries to the state. The mineral and woollen Industries ighllt with ad vantage be featured. Another ltatter which tile Clutmber would Iltit their iact;t to investigate in England was tihe stan dard required for the marketing of peas. Some difficulty this year htad been ex perienced In arriving at a standard lc ceptable to the merchants in the old country. On behalf of the Chamber lie would wich himt bon voyage and at successful mission in Engltand, concluded .Mr. Smith. AN IMPIORTANT MISSION. Upon rising to respond, Col. I.Snowden was greeted with applause. Before giv ing a complrehenlsive and interesting ad dress ott the idettr lie had before him on hiS mission, he thantked the gather ing tfor their c~ngrat,ulationtts ad warm gaood wlshco. As business men they could fully applreceato what a great a;dvanLtage it was for himnt to go to England strength entil in the knowledge that lie had the backing of the Launceston Chtumber of Commerce. The manner in which they had recoived him was both heartening and helpful. During last week he had visited vart. ous centres In Tasmnaia, the spealter went op. In eantch platt h was reoelved warmly. Thos Interoested In the state's welfare had putt bnforo him the possi h!liites and Interesting flgures concceru itg their distriats, and had Intimated their wvilllfrgc;s to assist bhim In overry way possiaol. O(e of his duties was to see taitt the state was properly advor tlsed, and the benefits of thist richt coun try plactd before the people of Englanid. It was his inteatlon while Ia London to do this, as far as It weas in his power. With regard to that important mat ter of iummuigration, bo was well aware that wrong information coacerning cou ditions and pirostpects In AustrailI?a had been distributed in Eltgland with a view to persuading pSople to come out hero. That meant disaster. The right type of new settler was essential to ear atony, and the only way to get the cor rece settlers was to supply true tfacts as to what would confront them In this state. Tlsy should be informed at the start, too, that to succeed they would have to work hIard. ADVEItrSiNG TASMANIA. Then therP was the matter of adver tsing Tasmanla, the Agent-General con tlaued. Ie was going to direct propa ganda work throughout all classes of people In England, and not restrict It to those people who could send indus tries to the state, or who were likely to come hera and muke ilomes. He would distrlbute literature in soldiers' and working men's clubs calculated to impress them with the fact that Australian Itro ducts were the best it theo world. (Ap plause.) Australia's meat was not so well Inown In England as that from the Argentine. Australian butter took second plitce to Danish because the name was not known so well: the people In the old country were not told that the Australian product was far and away the best. HIe thought that something could bhe done in this respect. He did not hlnk he could teach the people at Laun ceston anythlng with regard to adver tising, however. The manner In which this city had been boosted had alwvays aroused his admiration. Some time ago a scheme was on foot In thie city to eind a representatlv to i England in order to advertise this city's interests among aI certain type of manufacturer. HI would alvays be willing and happy to assist such an ofitcr if at any future date he .were appointed. It was hisl object to do all In his por :' to boost Tasmania, and he thought that by hisl efforts he could let the people In the old country know something more about this state. A WONDERFUL FUTURE. That Tasmania would one day become the Indusrial centre of the Common wealth he was certain, averred Colonel Snowden. Cheap and plentiful hydro electric power, an Ideal climate, and abundant water supplies were features which gave the state a decided advan tage. In addltlon, Tasmania had the most contented working people In Aus tralia, and thus Industries establlshing here could get more efliciency from theh. workers.
