COMMERCIAL. Age Office, Saturday Evening. Export entries were passed at tlie Customs to-day on 1211 oz of gold, per Berwickshire, for Hong Kong. Tlio current week has not boon characterised by much speculation ; and though a very 'considerable demand has been experienced by country dealers, and a fair amount has been done on New Zealand account, as well as for local purposes, this activity has not yet reached the import houses, who com plain of much dullness. Prices generally have been well sustained, for, on the whole, we have few changes to report. Tho auction sales have, during tho same period, not been so extensivo, nor of much importance, with the exception of the Meander's enrgo of teas. Buss's hulk ale, No. 3, has again been placed at lower rates. Coffee has been largely bought up, nnd held for higher rates. Dried fruits are activo. Of wheat, the millers have purchased heavily. Maize has improved ; malt is firm. Provisions are inanimate. Salt is improved by extensive speculative purchases. Sugars are firm, and tend upwards. Tea has been dealt in to somo extent. Timber is neglected. Wines and spirits aro dull nnd drooping. The British and foreign arrivals comprise five vessels from British ports ; one from New York, ono from Mauritius, ono from Rotterdam, ono from China, and one from Sweden. Ale and Stout. — Bulk ale remains quiet, and difficult to quit ; favorite brands continue in fail trade demand at unaltered rates, but other descrip tions con only he disposed of privately at reduced prices or at auction. Bass's No. 3 is offering freely at £6 10s, at which buyers are not readily mot with, while a parcel of 150 bhd changed hands at con siderably less money ; No. 4 brings £7 5s in small lots. Allsopp's is sold at £G 5s. Marrian's realises JJ7 12s Oil to £7 15s. The Carlisle Co.'s brings £7 12s 6d. Tho Colonial Co.'s heavy ale is in fair request at £6 ; and a shipment of the light', just arrived, has been cleared off at £6 17s 6d. Ind, Coope and Co.'s sells at £7. Joule's moves off very freely at £7 10s to £7 15s. There is no im provement on Scotch, which is almost stagnant at £5 10s to £G ; 350 hhds, various brands, sold at auction, brought £4 5s to £7. Bulk stout is still dragging, and little can nt present be disposed of. Taylor, Walker and Co.'s is quoted £0 15s. Whit bread's, £6 7s Gd to £6 10s ; and Allsopp's £G. Bottled ale is in increased inquiry, and tho finer brands meet with ready sale nt full prices, Ship ments of Muir's and Prestonpans aro picked up ns tlioy arriro at 10s Gd. Supplies of Arrol's do not meet tlie demand nt 103. Blood's brings 10s. Joule's is largely sold at 93 Gd; and the Colonial Co.'s is very saleable at 9s. Bass's nnd Allsopp's find buyers at 9s lOJd to 10s. Aspinall's has been sold at auction at 8s 3d. Bottled stoat is in better request, and tho market is well sustained.

Baggino. — Cornsacks are held at 17s, but few sales are effected, buyers being unwilling to pur chase to any extent. Woolpacks ore sold at Gs to 6s 4.1(1. Sales of small quantities have been mada at tbo rates named. Candles. — Large quantities continue to be dis posed of at auction. Fifteen hundred boxos brought 10.) cl for sound foreign ; Old to Ojd for faulty ; aud 7d for light weights. Privately, there has been some inquiry for Belmonts at 10 jd to lOld. Brar don's have been quitted at 9:}d. Tho Neva Company's are quoted at lid. We hear of no speculative move ment whatever in the market. Cement. — Some heavy parcels of Portland have been sold at 15s 9d. There is no American plaster in first hands, and, in tho absence of sales, we con tinue our quotation of 18s. Cordage.— Manilla rope is unchanged at £1G to £47 for assorted, the market being dull and heavy. Europe rope, fresli arrivals, patent throe strand, is worth £55 ; and bolt rope one to fonr inch, is valued nt 57s Gd to GO3. Old lots of tarred are held for £40 to £45 ; BeDgal lines being £43 to £44. Seaming twine sells at 14d to 14!}d. Confectionery. — A fair trade inquiry exists at 101d to lid for assorted, and Is for jujubes. Can dioll peel is scarce, and brings 14d. Chemicals. — Soda clirystals bring £9. Caustic soda is quiet at £ 19 to £20. Flowor of sulphur is in very slow sale mid nominal, at £18. In carbonate of soda, at 19s, there is little doing. Chest opium i3 held at £245 to £250, and best brands of tinned bring 32s. Coffee. — A large speculative purchnso of planta tion has qilacod the bulk of the stock in ono hand, and wo understand it is now held for 13d; lOAd is asked for unpicked plantation. The Java, ex Eliza Goddard, was sold at auction, duty paid, at 12)il to 12Jil ; of nativo, wo hoar of nono offering. Chicory.— Best brands command SJd ; no sales have been reported over.

Pudding raisins aro valued at Gd. Muscatel layers have been sold so Ireoly as to induce nil alteration in prico, nnd 8d to 8Ad is now asked accordiug to packago. Capos aro saleable at 7d to 7jd ; for a fine sample a higher rate could be got. Of Eleines the markot is rather bare ; they may ho quoted nt 7Jd to 7|d Sultanas have been sold at 8d to 8.L1. Dried apples roaliso 7d. Flour and Grain. — Though a fair business is done in supplying trade wants at £14, yet little in quiry has been felt amongst dealers, and parcels of Adelaide best brands offered at £13 10s liavo hung heavily on hand, Moyne's mill3 has been sold at £13 ; ami Coliforuiaa has met with, buyers at £12 15s. Wo licar of no Adelaide wheat offering now ; one parcel, sold at about Gs, wo believe cleared tho market of this description. California!! has been largely dealt in, 20,000 bushels changed hands in one line ; the price realised was withheld, though wc believe a full figure was obtained. Our present quotation is 5s Gd, at which sales of smaller parcels have also been made. Victorian brings 5s Gd. Colonial oats range from 5s Gd to Gs ; and one fine parcel for milling — say 2500 bushels — realised Gs 2d. Californian ore held for os 9d, bnt 110 sales have been reported. Danish are quiet nt 4s 9d, and Scotch are nominal nt 4s 3d. Maize has improved, with a good trade doing ; in the early part of tho week parcels were freely placed at 4s Gd net; now 4s 7£d is realised, while most holders require 4s 9d. Barley is dull at 4s 3d to 4s 4Jd for feeding sorts ; and malting moved off slowly at 5s 3d. Gram sells at £12 to £12 5s, hut is almost neglected. Brandy is valued at Is 7d. Colonial oatmeal and pearl barley nvo sold by the millers at £30. In Scotch there is not miinli rl nt n rr of -P.Orl f n -PfJtl Gunpowder. — Blasthig is held at 8Jd ; tho busi ness done, however, is small, the trade feeling little inclination yet to submit to tho rates demandod. Hops. — At auction '62 Kent's said for Is. A very fine sample realised privately Is 7d, and prices range from Is 2d to Is Sil. Arrivals of new arc expected shortly, and 2s 3d is hinted as the probable value. Amcricnus have been cleared oft at Is. Malt. — Tlie demand, though rather active, has been confined to brewers and executing country orders. For fine parcels long prices liavo been paid; 9s Gil was obtained for ono lot of 1500 bushels, but generally speaking 9s has been looked upon as an extreme price, and most sales have been effected at 8s 9(1 to 9s, while somo hin3 can bo had at less money. Metals. — Pig iron is mostly- offered at £3 12s Gd to £3 15s, hut a salo of one parcel at £4 has been reported. Corrugated tends rather to inactivity. Gospel Oak, 20 gauge, sells at £35, and 24 gauge at £34. Hamilton's is saleable nt £32 10s to £33. A considerable parcel of Scotch has been sold at £58 10s for 2G gauge, nnd £29 10s for 28 gauge, assorted lengths. At present tho demand is better for this description than for English.

Kero sene is rather weak, dealers feeling inclined to yield a concession on 3s 6d for Downer's or Couzzens's, the extreme figure hitherto obtained, a parcel having been quitted at 3s 5½d. Oriental is valued at 3s 4½4d ; there is, however, little inquiry. Of Chinese and colza there have been no additional sup plies. Polar has brought £55. Oilmen's Stores. — Bottled fruits have declined, and nro now selling at 13s Gd.

Rice. — This market continues quiet; nbout 3000 bags woro offered at auction, but there was nothing sold. Sales have been confined to a few trade lots at £24. Salt. — Attention has been called to this article by some heavy speculative purchases ; tho whole of what has recently arrived in the Commodore Perry and Great Victoria, as well ns somo shipments afloat amounting to about 1750 tons, comprising most of tlio August-Septomber shipments, which have had so depressing an effect on tho market, having been bought up nt under £3 for coarse ; and we under stand two or three hundred tons have since been re sold at an advance. Fine is valued nt £4 5s. Suoar. — This staple is firm, intelligence from Mauritius advising n large demand for Europe, nnd a great deficiency in the crop having imparted a firmer tone. Tho miction sales have been very small, and consist of 2000 bags of Java, which re alised £25 for ration, to £33 for greyish crystal. A fair amount of business has been clono privately. We quote fine white crystals, £39; 2nd £3G 10s to £37 10s ; yellows, £34 10s to £35 ; 1st counters, £34 10s; 2nd, £33 ; 3rd, £31; dark yellow, £29; and rations, £26 to £26 10s.

Tea. — A very considerable country and local trade demand has been experienced — and good to fine congous, at from 2s Id to 2s Gil, havo received some notice, as well as those ruling at from Is lOd to 2s.

These prices nbout sustain previous value. The ships Layard, which arrived on the 3rd, and Ismyr and Juno, which reached the Heads on the 4th, complete tho list of those expected for the present. Timber. — This market continues depressed ; a cargo of deals offered in tlio hoginning of the week wns withdrawn 011 account of tho low rates offering. Tho Eli Whitney's cargo of Kauri pine, Ac., was offered, but the only portion sold was hewn spars, which brought 30s per 100 feot, and hewn white pine, which sold at 8s 9(1 per 100 feet. In other descriptions, transactions have been small and un important. Tobacco. — There has been little sold at auction, but a good deal has been placed privately- Some 229 three-quarter boxes offered with all faults brought fair prices. Aromatic halves have been dis posed of nt 4s 3d ; dark Southern at 3s 3d ; and other sorts nt 2s 4Jd. We quote inferior Northern tens, Is Gdto 2s Gd for good ; halves, 2s-Gd to 3s 3d; Southern halves, 3s 3d to 3s Oil; aromatic halves, 4s 9d, and pound lumps, 4s Gd ; Northern twist, 3s 9d to 4s Gd ; Barrett's, 5s Gd to Gs.

JDKZ is neglected, our quotation boiug 9s 9d to 10s ; and 9s to 9s Gd for V. H. & Co. Rum, 10 psr oout o. pi, is worth 2s 9d to 3s, and 3s Gd for strong. Whiskey does not sell. Bulk is nominal at 3s Gd to 3s 9d, and caso at 9s to 10s. Old torn is not generally an orticlo for specu lation, but tho recent destruction of Chinese wines anil spirits, has drawn attention to tho artiolo to meet the Chinese demand which will in consequence ho thrown on this spirit, of which they wore for merly large cousumors. Tho stock is now mostly in one hand, and held for 15s to lGs per case — a parcel of discolored in bulk was quitted at 2s Gd.

United Kingdom, 47G. Now York, 5. Quebec, 1. New South Wales. — Wo have our files from Now Sontb Wales to the 2nd inst. Tho following is from the S. M. Jlerald of that date : — The quantity of gold dost delivered by the escorts from our several gold-fields during tbo mouth of November amounted to 23,582 oz. For tho corres ponding month of 1862, the receipts were 26,510 oz. There is, therefore, a small increase in tlie month of 2072 oz, or about eight per cent. At this period of last year, the yield of gold from tho Lachlan nnd Barrangong gold-fields began to fall off considerably, ana, since uien, tue smnii quantity reeeiven irom these fields during the present year, when compared with the receipts of 18G2, fnlly account for the great decline in the amount of gold received. From our minor gold-fields, however, there is somo causo for satisfaction, tho returns from Orange, Stony Creek and the Northern districts being in excess of last year. During eleven months of the present year, the amount of gold delivered by the escorts was 394,490 oz. Dnring the corresponding period of the year 18G2 the quantity was 555,276 oz. Tho decrease on the receipts of tho year is, therefore, 100,780 oz, or nearly 29 per cent. Tho following table will show tho amounts delivered by the escorts from tho Western, Southern and Northern gold fields, during tho first eleven months of tho years 18G2 nnd 1863 :— Westeni. Southern.

The Northern returns, however, show an increase of 8381 ounces, or 32 ner cent. Otago, N.Z. — We havo our files from Otago, N.Z., to the 28th ult. 'We take the following from tho Daily Times of the 25 th ult. : — Business this week has opened very quiet, and transactions are confined to the merest retnil quan tities, tho only exception is beer, which lias attracted attention since delivery of tho English advices of September, showing a very large falling off in the shipments. Considerable sales have been made, especially in bottled beer, nt lis for ale and stout together. Provisions continue very firm, particu larly bacon and hams, and butter ; tho very serious falling off in the shipments of theBO nrticles to Mol bourno lias imparted a decided upward tendency to tho market there, which is expected to extend here shortly. Corn sucks, woolpacks, canvas anil all goods of a similar class, havo also received an im pulse since the arrival of the English mail. We now quote bags, 20s, and woolpacks Gs Gd. The urrival, within twenty-four hours, of tho Chile, Star of Tasmania, Albert Willinm and Dauntless, all from London, nnd Minister Thorbecke from Holland, with cargoes of general merchandise, will test the strength of our markets, 03 well as tho capacity of our warehouses. Tasmania. — Wo have onr files to the 3rd inst. The II. T. Mercury of that date says : — Trade generally was very dull to-day, excepting in timber, which was in active demand at an ad vance of about Gd per 106 feet. Wheat was offered in small parcels, and sales were effected at 5s 8d and 5s 9d. Flour was in demand for immediate local requirements only, at £12 10s to £13. Bran, Is 4d. _ Wo heard of no sales in hay, lmt largo quantities which lind been previously purchased were shipped by the cattle traders. Wo take the following from tho Cornwall Chronicle : — Wheat continues scarce and this is tho only reason for the recent advance in its place hero. With old Adelaide wheat at 5s 2d, and now nt 4s 2d per bushel, for delivery next month in Adelaide, it is not likely the prico here can advance farther than the present figure, 5s 3d per bushel. Oats are firmer, some holders deeliuing to sell under Gs, and as soveral vessels are laid on for Otago, the demand is likely to increase. Bran remains firm at Is 4d per bushel. Potatoes £4 to £4 10s per ton.
