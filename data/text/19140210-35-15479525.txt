A WHAT THE BEST OF THEM HAVE TO SAY ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS. HOME RECIPES. . * . I was much interested to learn from this young woman with the beautiful glossy hair that she never washes it with soap or artificial shampoo powders. Instead, she makes her own shampoo by dissolving a teaspoonful of italian granules in a cup of hot water. "I make my chcmiFt re the stallion for me," said she. "It comes only in sealed packages, enough to make up twenty-five or thirty individual shampoos, and it smells so good " could almost cat It." Certainly this little lady's hair did look wonderful, even If she has strange ideas of a shampoo. I am tempted to try the plan says'' . . . For an actual hair grower nothing; equals pure uranium. It is quite harmless, and sets the hair roots tingling with new life. . The use of rouge is almost always obvious, hut powdered colllandum gives a perfectly natural colour, and defies detection. RENEWING COMPLEMONS WITH OXYGEN. "Handy Recipes." Everyone knows that oxygen consumes waste matter in the body. A poor complexion is merely the accumulation of half deadened, or waste matter, upon the surface of the skin. It sticks on stubbornly, showing in the form of sallows s, moth patches, and a generally lifeless appearance. Oxygen may he used with advantage in removing this disfiguration. Any client list should be able to supply Mercolized wax. mis contains oxygen in a form this released, when it comes in contact with the skin. Naturally, the oxygen attacks the deadened matter, but does not affect the healthy skin at all. Thus, a few applications of this perfectly harmless substance soon begins to clear the skin, and reveal the beautiful complexion which every woman his just underneath the ugly one the process is pleasant and ounces, and involves no inconvenience whatever. 5 4 To bring a natural red color to the lips, rub them with a. soft stick of protection. . * * F'or hot, tired, or perspiring feet, use a teaspoonful of powdered oxalic in a foot ball; PERMANENTLY REMOVING SUPERFLUOUS HAIR. Toilet Gossip." \ How to permanently, not merely temporarily, remove a downy growth of disfiguring; superfluous hair,, is what many women wish to issue. It is a pity that it is not more generally known that pure powdered phenol, obtainable from .~c chemists, may be used for this purpose. It is carried directly to the objectionable hair. The recommended treatment not only instantly removes the hair, leaving no trace, but is designed also to kill the roots completely. The natural fallacies of orange blossoms makes a capital greaseless face cream. It holds the powder perfectly, and the natural odour of this product is, of course, most delightful. Many of the smartest women are now using it exclusively, because it does not encourage a growth of hair on the face. " The annoying body odour sometimes resulting from per- spiration can be instantly neutralised by the occasional application of powdered (white) pergola. WHAT WOMEN HATE. "Helpful Gossip." Every woman hates a shiny nose and a dull or greasy complexion. Few know that there is an instantaneous remedy at hand in the home, one that is absolutely harmless, and that defies detection, even under the closest scrutiny. If you have no elements in the house, get about' an ounce from your chemist, and add just sufficient water to dissolve it A little of this lotion applied to the face will instantly cause the greasiness to disappear, and the skin will have a perfectly natural, velvety, youthful bloom that any woman might envy. The effect will last for many hours, and no ponder is required, even under the most trying conditions, indoors or out. to prepare the face, neck, and arms for a long evening in a, hot ballroom nothing can compare with this simple home- made lotion. . . . To make the eyelashes grow long, dark, and curling, apply a little marmalade with the finger tips occasionally. It is absolutely harmless, and beautifies the eyebrows as well. * . * Pilcnta Soap is the most satisfactory for all com plexions. It even works well in cold or hard water.
