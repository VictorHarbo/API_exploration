THURSDAY, NOVEM Ein, 1888. 'The Conference of the Chambers of Commerce was duly opened yesterday when papers of much value to the community were read The hope may be expressed that arrangements have been or will be made to print those documents in volume, form, so that they may remain as a momento of same times and may be available for future reference 'The labour and thought put into many of them deserve a permanent embodiment The to mark is made because there were con foresees in connection with the pro- vious Exhibition, and the valuable papers then prepared were not brought together The press does the work to a certain extent, but it does other work also, and consequently a file of 'Hi Al This is scarcely a pocket volume In his opening address, the president, Air 1! bell), took a general View of the Australian situation His first in marks go to explain to visitors the secret of the great strides made in the last few years by the city and the colony In one respect such a statement is academic and in another it is practical tSn far as the past in concerned, there is only a philosophic interest in the inquiry but to ascertain the right cause of the recent progress is to obtain awards for the future Mr. Hi ii) bUiimiaHM.1*. as follows -" him settle 1 nant of the people upon the lands on easy Ulms great increases our pope ltition, ample room for most of our people I who will work at good wages! the Investment of curious, s in the colony, "On; (feeling of ¡ibseiitteisiii, political "peace, and distended nea in ourselves " which has inspired capital t in t i m upon the part of capitalists in the (old "country,, who now union hostility with " as in furnishing eat it at reasonable "rates to lay bread must sap the " foundations of a successful country " This paragraph may be condensed into " good seasons, an accession of popula- " tion, and an influx of capital, and so stated no one will differ from Mr REID As regards absenteeism, the presidents remarks require to be taken however, with a qualification No doubt comparatively few colonists now go to Great Britain to permanently reside there and no doubt the number will more and more diminish as Australia joins to her own advantages, the institutions, the resources, and the culture of the centres of European civilisa- tion The tour will more and more come into fashion, but the very facilities of travel Mill tend to settle people here That ] Europe is so accessible from Australia is a reason with many for contentment with Australia, and besides this just as it was natural for the British born pioneers to cling to the land of their birth so will it be with the race bred here But, on the other hand, absenteeism, in the sense of owners of property living abroad and drawing rents and profits, has increased of late, and is increasing Our railways and our trams are British owned, and our city is well as our station property largely represents British advances It is always well to bear this fact in mind, because to cultivate a cry against absenteeism may lead logically but unexpectedly to an attack upon the " foreign investments which have done so much of late for Australia The importance of the influx of population is by no means overstated by the president Much of it came from the sister states, and was due to good seasons here being accompanied by bad seasons there, thus inducing a really good class of settlers to try their fortunes in Victoria But we must not desire any long continuance of this state of things Our wish must be prosperity for all the colonies, and an increase of population for them all, to be obtained from outside districts and not by the process of the one state depleting the other. The principal factor in the sum of our progress has however been, as Mr REID indicates, the large introduction of foreign capital, and that is the result, as the president signs of the poll tical peace the absence from strife, and the confidence in the future which this condition engenders The moral is that this community was on the wrong track when by class legislation it endeavoured to make Victoria a fine country for the working man and that it has been on the right path since it has offered security to the capitalist If capital 13 here, the working man is sure of his reward The remarks of the president in favour of reciprocity treaties between the colonies, if free exchange can be obtained in no other way, may be taken as evidence that the mercantile mind is tending to compel causes and arrangements which at one time were deemed to be insuf (street The whole tone of the conference, it may be said, strongly favours a movement for intercolonial free trade the papers and the speeches go, indeed, to show that New South Wales is the one state where the mercantile classes accepting the tariff situation in their own districts would not join in a policy of a uniform sari II as regards the outside world with free interchange through out the Austral continent The paper read by Mr. L PULSI OIID, New South Wales, is a masterly argument for ft co trade 111 its fullest sense, at once readable and weighty, and will demand a notice upon some early occasion to day we need only remark that his statement that the restriction loving colonies are always taking steps to defeat their own policy is amply borne out by our present Victorian experience For instance, the temptation of the London money market is, he says, too much for the protectionist, who forgets that loans come to us in the form of goods Those who doubt the truth of the assertion have only to note how this colony has been importing goods of late years to the amount of £16,000,000 and" 419,000,000 per annum, and sending out produce valued at X11,000,000, and to further observe that each of our loan periods shows the '-area disparity in proportion to the borrowings Mr I'Disiono, though not a uniform tariff man, can still argue for " unrestricted exchange in Australian commodities," but on the other hand, if the delegates from New South Wales are light, and of nine people out of ten in the mother colony would stoutly oppose any systematic taxation of imports from the mother country, 11 uniform tariff is not possible to day W 0 can have no commercial federation, but must be content with resisting proposals to take Australian produce No freetrader would wish to sway New South Wales in the matter, and yet there is the fear that a desire to retaliate upon Victoria may bring' about the adoption of the protective policy in the form which Mr PoIson and all freetraders most dislike 'the 'Tasmanian idea of appointing a joint committee of the various chain bers of commerce and manufactures to frame an Australian tariff is one not to be lost sight of 'the colonies might see whether such a tar ill could or could not be accepted, modified of others, in a spirit of concession the advice given by Mr. be in is that some other colony should be allowed to take the lead in promoting commercial federation, is also shroud and solid 'The speech of the hon. gentleman in describing why the abortive J nHiimmi.ii treaty was not submitted to Parliament is not exactly pleasant lending the less so, because there is so very much in it that cannot be gainsaid It is only too true that our Victorian fiscal policy in relation to the sister states has been savaged by selfish groups who would sacrifice the Imperial finish the 1 Federal House or any other He used to toast their little pig Anti it is also

pit received of the death, of Mr. SIVMIY may be as until postwar day is the first that was published some months (ago but there is nothing to lead us to be here the one any more than the other No authentic news has been since received of the condition or whereabouts of the explorer, and there is therefore nothing upon which to base any fresh opinion as to whether these sinister rumours about him, now twice repeated, are true or false The position is just as dark is before, and such light as is thrown upon it by the gossip of the natives is hardly of character to do much towards elucidating it in any satisfactory manner Speaking without reference to such reports at all, the probabilities would seem to be in favour of the belief that STANLEY has not succumbed He had with him when he dis- appeared from view following composed of 500 well armed men, a force which should have been ample to protect the expedition against any foe that it would be likely to meet and which could hardly, it might be thought, be annihilated without causing a considerable stir among the dwellers in those parts It seems scarcely likely that of such a formidable body all but two should have been massacred or that, if this fate really befell them, the fact should not have been bruited abroad long ere this by unmistakable and convincing testimony On the other hand, the circumstance that nothing definite has been heard of STANLEY since April of last year need not be taken as telling much against his chance of safety Sir SAMUEL BAKER, was on one occasion cut off completely from all communication with the outer world for no less a period than two years and five months, and his death and that of Lady HARD r at the hands of natives was recorded and feelingly commented on by the time Yet everybody knows that the great explorer turned up alive and well at the end of it, and what happened to him then may very well, it is to be hoped, be the case with Mr. St LIsLE now At the same time it cannot be denied that his situation must in any case be one of the greatest difficulty and danger Sn SAMDLL B vkMi his stated it to be his opinion that the "white pasha" IP ported to have

colour as the natives the rumour, he thinks, must refer not to any European, but to some Arab slave trader, who has been making raids in these parts On the other hand, as we announced yesterday, Captain ArA\ Gi 11 the Belgian explorer, who has recently arrived in Europe from Africa, has stated that he had conflicts with the natives near the Bahr el Ghazal in the beginning of the year, and that fireboxes himself to be the person alluded to If SiAvm were to be identified with the " white " pasha," the task of gaming safety for himself and his followers would be a most formidable one, but if this is not the case, it must be admitted that one of the food consolatory hypotheses that have been adopted with regard to him has to be abandoned The situation, moreover is not improved by the fact that it is now well nigh impossible to afford the would be money or of EMIN Jin any assistance A short time ago it was announced that a German expedition for the purpose of restoring communication with the Governor. of the Equatorial Provinces was being organised on a large scale Subsequently it was stated that Prince BISMARCK had decided to abandon the enterprise, and, in deed, had refused to sanction it It is not known yet why the Chancellor adopted such a course though it is possible that the murder of Major BARTTELOT and the death of Mr JAMIESON did a good deal to open the eyes of the promoters to the difficulties of the attempt But there is no doubt that its abandonment, if genuine, will be well received by all who have a regard for British interests in East Africa towards the achievement of the primary object for which it was organised the expedition could not hope to do much It is believed that MIN BOY IS in no need of help, and with regard to Si VNLLY, ii he is to gain safety at all, it will have to be by his own unaided efforts No one knows as yet where to look for him and if this was known it is impossible that help could arrive in time to be of any use On the other hand, it was perfectly well ascertained that the German Limn Boy expedition, as it was called, had other and ulterior objects One of its promoters, indeed, openly ax on all that it was

If the Premier would divide this district he would find in my difficulties dis appeal In any case it was wise of the Hon. Gentleman to agree to meet the metropolitan members in conference to see if another management can be selected than the one which now annoys the representatives of North and East Melbourne. The hon. gentleman would have given way earned no doubt but for the circumstance that the one charge of par- township which has been preferred was made against him by Sir LAUKFNS According to Mr LAUI ENS, the Government have robbed the " liberal consul ' trenches of the northern suburbs in order to create a spick and span new constituency in Jolimont the error is on the surface the northern constituencies have the same number of members as before, though the grouping is different, and though North Melbourne, it must be confessed, is somewhat awkwardly cut up But as to Richmond, the present electorate with 40,000 people is entitled to three members over a voice could be raised against giving Richmond its third member of the old electorate were retained and why then should there be any objection to dividing the district, and giving two members to one part and one to the other 1 his point Mr LVDTFNS did not touch And yet in Richmond is fairly and equitably entitled to an additional member-as much on titled to this increase as Moira, the Wimmera, and Gippsland are to their gains this, the one charge of partisanship heard in the House, absolutely and hopelessly breaks down the approach of the Cup season, with its attendant crowds, makes the subject of overcrowding in trains, which was brought forward in some letters printed recently in our columns, more than ever important at the present time. The Flemington arrangements, it is true, are far superior to those of which one of our conespondontscomplains so bitterly, and, it may be added, so justly But if access to and departure from the Caulfield races are not made as easy as is the case at the Flemington meetings, that is probably because the railway authorities have not taken the same amount of trouble with the former as they have with the latter And this leads to another consideration of a somewhat wider nature The crushes going to and coming from exceptional events like race meetings are to a certain extent inevitable, and may be experienced in any part of the world and under almost any system of railway management But the overcrowding witnessed and suffered by everyday passengers on the Victorian railways is another matter altogether. It is hardly too much to say that, save on exceptional occasions, the carriages of our trains are filled either up to the very limit or even beyond the maximum of their holding capacity No doubt this arises to some extent from scarcity of rolling stock And inasmuch as colonial builders cannot or will not supply the deficiency, and as any attempt to secure plant from outside of the colony would, of course, be met with an outcry from the representatives of the trades, the Railway Commissioners can hardly perhaps be held wholly responsible for the result so far as it is affected thereby But for one thing, at any rate, they are wholly and directly responsible In most c area of over crowding the subordinate officials are either perfectly indifferent to all appeals, or are actually unites to it by themselves thrusting passengers into carriages that are already filled If the porters were taught that it was part of their business to see that the ordinary regulations are not broken but observed, overcrowding might not be altogether prevented, but it would be at least considerably reduced It is believed that the chairman holds rather cynical views with respect to overcrowding, which he regards as bony something which the Victorian public are so accustomed to that, though they may grumble at it, they will yet put up with it Mr Sr-EiaiiT, however, whatever may be his private convictions, is bound to see that our railways are managed as efficiently as possible, and he has done so well already that it is only natural to expect that he will do a little better, and will put a stop to the overcrowding' which is still rather a blot upon his management Two CURIOUS stories reach us from Europe illustrating rather forcibly the well known quon, guts custodian Ypres customers One of the private police officers kept in the palace of the King of ROUMANIA for the protection of his loyal alas too, has recently confessed that for a whole year he had earned about with him a dagger and revolver wherewith to assassinate the King Ills determination, however, invariably failed him when the opportunity for dom, ; so presented itself, and to this case alone Kin,, On vin is owes his escape from the hands of the man whose special duty it was to protect him.

This gave an opportunity to Mr Gaunson to threaten stonewall tactics, but the coldness of an unresponsive audience induced the South Melbourne member to resume his seat and an instant later the electorate was agreed to In the unavoidable absence of his colleagues, Mr Munro could not sustain a prolonged contest with the Government upon its proposal to reduce the representation of Geelong from three to two members For consistency H sake, he demanded a division and was badly beaten by 44 votes to 2 i Rapid progress was made with the remaining schedules of the bill until the Melbourne constituencies came up for discussion Such dissatisfaction was expressed at the proposed divisions that Mr. Gillies consented, should Jolimont be passed I to postpone the consideration of them until he could confer with the local members upon a scheme for the re-arrangement of the boundaries The House accepted this suggestion and thus progress was reported shortly after 10 of clot K the number of electorates assented to during, the silting was 28 leaving 13 districts to be dealt with this afternoon Opportunity was taken yesterday afternoon by members representing the northern and western constituencies of Melbourne, when the proposed Jolimont electorate was submitted to the Legislative Assembly for adop- tion, to raise the whole question of the revision of the boundaries of the metropolitan districts Mr Laurens was first heard Nothing would satisfy him except that Job ment should be expunged from the ] Electoral Districts Alteration Bill and included in East Melbourne Such an alteration would, in his opinion enable Fitzroy to retain a population now improperly placed in East Melbourne It would also permit the boundaries of Carlton and West Melbourne to be so changed as not to interfere with the proper representation of North Melbourne By the arrangement suggested by him four members would be secured to a population of C4 COO people residing north of A Victoria street Mr Laurens bec vine so indignant that he did not hesitate to attribute to the Government of Utah to swamp the Liberal voters in some of the proposed elt climates the defence of the Government proposals was undertaken by the Premier Mr Gillies pointed out that the present Richmond electorate contains 40,000 i copies and is there fore entitled to three members and he contended that the subdivision of the electorate into two constituencies of Richmond and Jolimont could not possibly injure other districts Neither ridicule nor argument would, however, convince Mr. Laurens that he had not a good case. He held to his position, with the co- operation of a strong body of Opposition members Alteradiscussion, extend- ing over several hours, Mr Coppin interposed he urged the Government to confer with the members interested, and Mr Gillies, perceiving that it was fruitless to attempt to per Buide by argument, yielded to the suggestion on the condition that the Jolimont electorate should be passed A consultation was subsequently arranged to take place this evening. The Legislative Assembly yesterday passed 28 electorates contained in the schedules to the Electoral Districts Alteration Bill, and struck out Geelong West, which it merged in Geelong The names of the divisions assented to were- Ballarat West, East Bourke HorouitliH.CIniies,Collingwood, Creswick, Dul housic, Daylesford, Delatite, Donald, Dundas, JUnerald-luIl, Essendon, Ijveljn, liberal, Footscray, Geelong, Grant, Grenville, Harrow, Hejteabur), Jolimont, Kara Kara, Korong, Kyneton, Lowan, Maryborough, Mornington, and Windermere.

The measure, in addition to conceding to lessees the right to vote under the Irrigation Act 1886, prohibits persons who are not members of any trust from taking a greater quantity of water from streams the volume of which may have been augmented by the erection of national works Fear was expressed that such a provision would interfere with the inherent rights of landowners to the waters of rivers adjoining their properties.

Mr. S. M, Jacobi presided, and there were about thirty gentlemen present, including representatives of exhibitors in the Umtali, United States, and Victorian courts. Strong dissatisfaction was expressed at the action of the commissioners, which it was stated, was a confession of weakness and was a breach of agreement with exhibitors who were led to incur considerable expense on the understanding that they would be supplied with the motive power I they required Serious inconvenience would, it was urged, be caused by this arrangement. The entire it would suffer all the 1 exhibition itself would be deprived! for a large part of the day of one of its most attractive features Complaints were made of discourtesy having been shown to exhibitors and it was suggested that it the commissioners would not grant motive power as heretofore the machinery in motion I should be closed altogether.

The services of about CO officers will be dispensed with in December, and during next year 30 more will receive notice. Mr. Blackett, chief engineer, he will be offered the position of inspector of material at London, and in case he declines it, Mr. W. N. Blair will be appointed. Mr George Fisher (Minister of Education) and Mr E Mitchelson (Minister for Public Works) visit Melbourne by the Mararoa. The vessel takes with her the largest number of saloon passengers ever carried by a steamer for Melbourne from this colony, among them a number of volunteers to represent the colony at the Victorian Rifle Association's Centennial matches, and also a number of bowlers inquiries which have been made show that a modification of the sweating system is being carried on in Dunedin, where work is let out to women from some of the clothing factories at prices which make it almost impossible for them to make a living The price paid to some of these women is in some instances actually) lower than in Glasgow. This is not, however, the general rule, us most of the large clothing factories take special precautions against "sweat-' rag," and pay fair wages. In Christ- church matters are unite as bad in a few cases The Government has received a report from Professor Long, the dairy expert, on several questions submitted to him as to the dairying industry) He say she belief so that New Zealand cheese can be delivered in England in a condition to compete with the best produce of the kind sold there, and by avoiding the Danish system the colony) could beat the Danes in the quality of the butter He advocates the appointment of lecturers at a few of the centres, and cantrill training stations, with all the best and prices for scientific and practical dairying A serious difficulty), which seemed likely to precipitate a strike of all the services engage 1 on the boats of the Union Steamship Company, has just been satisfactorily settled, a compromise having been arrived at 'the difficulty was in connection with the Northern Steamship Company at Auckland, whose steamers have been for some time worked by men not belonging to the Federated Seamen's Union It is understood that the difficulty has been affected by these men being withdrawn from these steamers, and their place taken by union men, the union on the other hand undertaking to admit the men so withdrawn into the union. The difficulty which has arisen in connection with the coal mines at Grey) mouth, and which, if not settled, will probably lead to a strike, is still in abeyance views have been exchanged, however, on the points in dispute, and probably an amicable understanding will be arrived at Mr W. J M Larnach, ex-Minister of Mines, was banqueted by the leading citizens of Dunedin on the 20th inst, when general regret was expressed at the early departure of that gentleman for Melbourne, where he has ?Ir-r-irlwl in rennie It is extremely improbable, writes our London correspondent, that the Paris Ex ambition of 1888 will prove the miserable failure that teutons predict. On the con- trary, if peace be preserved, it will almost certainly be an unprecedented success. The only countries in Europe which have held aloof are Germany Denmark, Sweden, 'Turkey and Montenegro The countries officially represented are not numerous, but private enterprise more than compensates for state absent >n The Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands Luxembourg, Spain, and Portugal have supported the private committees with "rains varying from 200 OOOf to TOO GOOD Imcrrca-North, Central, and South-will officially participate, the United States having voted 250 000 for the purpose Japan Siam, Morocco, and other distant states will be represented, but so far as is known V Latona will be the only Antipodean Colony which will attend So far upwards of 100000 square metres have been allotted to the Foreign sections It is expected that Russia and Great Britain will make the finest displays the British exhibitors already find that the 15 000 metres allotted them are insufficient, the Indian section will prove extremely interesting A balance-sheet containing some food for reflection has been issued, writes our London correspondent, by the Rev. Canon Brosnan, the clergyman in charge of the erection of the O'connell Memorial Church in Ireland. The total receipts to date amount to £12,47, America contributing £1,678, and Australia £1,558. extraordinary as it may seem, the whole of Ireland, exclusive of the county Kerry, has subscribed only £003 towards the erection of a national church to perpetuate the memory of Daniel O'Connell Kerry, O'Connell's own country, has contributed £500, and Cabircivecn, the parish in which the church is in course of erection, has given the large donation of £705. England, Scotland, and India, have supplied the balance of 25s. The explanation of these curious figures seems to be that no organised efforts were made in Ireland to obtain subscriptions, whereas clerical delegates were sent to collect in Australia and America. The facility with which money for national objects can be obtained from the Irish abroad has apparently relieved the Irish at home from the slightest necessity for personal exertion Another case in point occurred at a meeting of the National League in Dublin, when it was reported that the receipts for the previous fortnight amounted to £1,813, of which no less than £1,2 came from Australia and New Zealand Some uncertainty having been caused) to the subscribers to the Metropolitan Liedertafel by a recent concert having been wrongly attributed to that society, the hon secretary notifies in another column that the first concert of the present season will be given in the Town-hall on the 20th November, and the second (for gentlemen only on the 17th December in the Athenaeum-hall.
