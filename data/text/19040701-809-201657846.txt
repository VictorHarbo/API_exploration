J£,E A U T Y TREATMENTS. Tho newspapers of nil tho big centres of the world have recently been 'filled with articles on the vari ous kinds of "Beauty Treatments'! that now seem to be so popular in, the attempt to patch up people's complexions. All sorts of appliances aro in use, and those that promote them are loud in their claims nR to tho good they do. But there Is a very much simpler way to . carry on a "beauty .treatment," and that is by making tho health so perfect that •••Na ture will take care of the effect. Tills Is best ob tained by a course of -Scott's Emulsion,, which throws, the impurities out of the blood,' cuts off the in sidious 'approach, of diseases of the throat and lungs,,, and puts people in sound health.- With sound health we can obtain all of tlic . beauty that Nature in tended us to . have. Scott's Emulsion., is cod lfvbr Oil, with hypophosphitcs of. Ihno and-.fibda ' and glycerine, iu such proportions"' anil of such purity as guarantee you iu always. securing thq. effects that are promised. If you need lic-nUli/ "send '-3d. (for postage) to. Scott arid Bonnie Ltd., fS3 Kent-street, Sydney, mention this paper,- and you will receive a sample bottle. All chemists sell Scott's Emulsion. PUBLICATIONS .. EVERY SAT U R D A Y. CONTENTS, 2nd.
