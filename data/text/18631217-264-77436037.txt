The Black Ball cupper ship Fiery Star. 1360 tons register, dropped her anchor in Brisbane Roads at 2 pjra. on Friday last, after a passage oLSi -days bom QneensioWB. She is originally from Ixmdon, at which port she embarked SSI passengers, and sailed from Gravesend on the 11th August. She took her departure from Qneenstown on the 19th of the same month, having taken on board at that place 230 emigrants, all Of whom were nnder the medical super intendence of Dr. 3. J- Luce. She has, in addition to the large number of passengers, 800 tons of general mershandise. The ship is under the command of Captain W. H. Tule, who, we understand, visited this port some 15 years ago in a ship called the Tama. The whole of the immigrants, SSi souls in all. .ware in good health at die timo of the Health Officer's visit, with the excep tion of Bix persons, who were suffering from debility. During the voyage, measles, in fluenza, and other cstarrhal complaints, were common, but considering the crowded state of the vessel, the mortality was not great, only nine deaths, all of which were hose of infants, having taken place. The last occurred on the 26th of October, and resulted from aiarrlieea. There were four births, of which two were males. The emigrants from Qoeenstown were accom panted by the Bev. Father Dunne, B.C.C., and the Bev. Mr. Golding, U.C.C., who performed the services of the Boman Catholic Church for such as belonged to the creed. The Bev. J. Hinton, Baptist Minister, officiated for a portion of the pas sengers, and the surgeon-superintendent, Dr. Luce, read the Anglican services for those belonging to the Episcopalian Church. We may further mention that, notwith standing the great diversity of religious opinion which prevailed, there was no ttn pleasantoess throughout tlio passage from that cause. The following is an analysis of the nation ality of the passengers:— 372 English, 171 Irish, and S3 Scotch. Of the total somber 24S are single men, and 73 single women, the remainder being married couples with their families. The following are the names of tbe saloon passengers: — Her. J. Hinton and Mrs. Hinton, Bev. Father Dunne, and the Rev. Mr. Uolding. B.CC Mr. and Miss Graham, Mr. and Mrs. Linde, Mrs. Tflson and 2 children. Miss .Fanny Tilson, Miss Jane Carter. Messrs. E. Butler, W. Butler, J. G. Higginson, Fitzroy Somerset, W. Bruce, A. Willmott, B. Beaumont E. D. Freeman, W. Coliinson, C. Bartlett, B. C. Parr. Hager (3), and E. A. Come. Daring Friday night sixteen of the crew of the Fiery Star lowered one of the boats hanging from the davits and deserted. It is supposed that several of the passengers, who could not be found when the immigration agent mustered the passengers, have been induced to go with the runaway sailors. The Health Officer visited the ship on Saturday last in the Settler, steamer, which, on her retnrn, brought up » large number of tbe passengers. The remainder were bronght up yesterday in the steamer Queensland, The Fiery Star sailed from London on the 10th, and Queenstown on the 19th of August. Tbe first day's ran front Qtteeastotro, made with a favorable breeze, was 290 miles ; from that to tbe Madeiras, which were sighted on the 23th, the winds were light and vari able. Fell in with the trades a little north of Madeira, which were also very light, and the equator was crossed on the 14th of Septem ber, twenty-five days out from Queenstown. The south-east trades were very unfavour able, which obliged the ship to ran closer to the Brazilian coast than is usually done. She passed the meridian of the Cape on the 8th of October, and reached Tasmania on the 7th of November. From that to More tou Heads, which were reached on tbe 19tb, she experienced a continual succession of calms and head winds. Had the ship met with anything like favorable weather from the Cape, she would easilv have made the passage from pilot to pilot is seventy days. The Fiery Star, which has been lately pur chased by Messrs. James Baines and Co. for the Queensland trade, is 2500 tons burthen, and 1360 tons register. She is a good sailer. During the voyage she never gut twenty- four hours* continu ance of a good, strong, favorable wind ; and on one occasion she ran 331 miles in twenty-two hours. The Fiery Star brings out Sot souk, equal to 502 statute adults, not including the captain, officers, or crew. Of these 30 are in the saloon, 71 in the second cabiu, 42 in the intermediate, and 411 in the steerage. 324 embarked at London, and 230 at Queens town. 327 are English, 174 Irish, and 53 Scotch. There are 49 from Lancashire, and 224 assisted passengers sent oat by Mr. Jordan ; of these 148 are from England, 46 from Ireland, and 30 from Scotland. There are 68 married couples, 218 single men, 73 single women, S married females whose hus bands are not on board, 3 widows, 69 children and 17 infants. There has been some sick ness daring the voyage ; nine deaths have occurred ont of the whole number of passen gers, and these have been entirely amongst infants and very young children. Four births occurred and all the infants are doing well. She spake the following vessels daring tbe voyage: — September 6. ex changed signals with the American ship Uncas, from Liverpool for Bombay, 31 days, oat. September 8. exchanged signals with the American ship Atalanta, from Hull to Monte Video. Ob tbe same day, exchanged signals with the British ship John Banyan, xromlaundmrCixOiaKO, 26 days oat. On tha ISth exchanged signals with the British ship Robert Henderson, from Glasgow for Otago; *nd on October 14 exchanged sig nals with tie Danish barque Salamander, from Cardiff for Ba.ta.vis, 74 days ont. LOSS OF THE HOPE AND SPOBTING LASS AT BBAMPTON SHOAL. Tire following are the particulars :— The American whaling ship Hope, 300 tons Captain Giffard, belonging to New Bedford, sailed from Sydney last July, and the 17th October last got stranded on Brampton Shoal. The weather at the time was fine, and the disaster was owing to an error of nearly 40 miles in tbe position of the shoal as laid down on the chart. The captain anc crew got on shore on an island- near lie scene jtf the disaster, share they remained until the 17rh November; and while on tbe island, at about six miles distant, they ob served a brig on the reef; the crew of which vessel saved themselves in the same manner. The brig was the Sporting Lass, a whaling vessel also. The two crews left the island on the 17th November, in nine boats, three of which arrived in Brisbane on Thursday morning, and, it is presumed, the other six boats have made for Sydney, It being both captains' intention to have gone to that port ?when they left the island. ??
