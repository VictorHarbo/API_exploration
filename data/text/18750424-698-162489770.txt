Tbe barque Jerusalem, Captain Largie, has made an excellent passage from tbe Lizard of 78 days. She brings 292 emigrants, all having arrived in good health. They are divided aa follows : —88 married couples, 60 single women, 91 single men, and 76 children; ana during the run out her original number embarked has been increased by 4. The ship is very cleanly and in good order, and Dr. Black, the surgeon in charge, speaks highly of the quiet orderly conduct of the pas sengers. Of the passage Captain Largie reports as follows :— Lett Plymouth Sound, the forenoon of 22nd January, with a light wind ftomN.W.: in the afternoon, the wind came from 8. W., and after it veered to W.8.W., and blew a strong gale. On 24th, at 4 a m., gale increasing from W.N.W., with heavy squalls ; at noon, blowing with hurricane force, with heavy squalls, accom panied with thunoer, lightning, and hail ; and. a very high sea floated the port lifeboat off the nooks of davit blooks ; the boat went astern with all the gear in her, and was -lost. On Tuesday, the 26th, w»a off Doodmatt'e Point, and landed letters ; on 27th, SaeEed the Lizard— wind, strong breeze from S W. by S. and ?h.W. ; reached odt ot the Channel on 29th; had light variables and calms, which continued till 2nd February; then, got a fresh ' breeze from south, with variaVee, till the 8th— in latitude 41'11 N., longitude 31*26 W.: after, got the wind from north, which veered into N.B. and E N.E. brisk trades, which were carried to the 14th, in latitude 6*21 N., longitude 25-06 W.*, then, had light winds and variables, and crossed the Equator on the 20th, in longitude 28*27 W. ; on 22nd, got a brisk 8.6. trade wind, which was carritd till the S7th, in latitude 19'88 B., longitude 81'Sl W. : - for the next three days, had light variables and calms ; after, had . favourable E., N E., and N, winds and fine weather, and crossed the meridian of Greenwich 12th March, in latitude 42*69 8. ; after, had N.W. winds and variables, and crossed the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope in the evening of the 16th, in latitude 48-07 south. ; after had N.W. winds and fine weather till the 2let, in latitude 42-44 south, longitude 46-11 east ; then had light variables and calms for two days. After had strong north and westerly winds, and crossed the meridian of Cape Leeuwin on 3rd April, in latitude 43' south; had light winds from N.W. and N. lor two days; after had variables, calms, and east winds, and strong. rotatory gales, and signalled off Cape Otway at S p.m. on the 11th ; after had strong gales and heavy squalls in the Straits, hove-to S hours, and passed the Promontoiy at 8 a.m. on the 12 th; after bad light southerly winds, and passed Cape Howe at 4 p.m. on the i8th ; trom thence had strong breeze trom E.N.E., with passing showers, and entered the Heads at 6 a.m. on the 16th. H.M. 8. Bamucouta.— As some statements have been made in reference to the disease on board the above vessel, and her euppoBed previous occupation on the Gold Coast, that are likely to create alarm if allowed to go unchallenged, we have been re Suested to publish the following ' Statements have been made in reference to the Barracouta which are perfectly unfounded, and would have been contradicted earlier had they been seen by persons belonging to that vessel. The following facts oan be vonched for— 1. The Barraeonta was not at any period of her service on the Gold Coast turned into a hospital of any kind, nor had she any but her own sick onboard. 3. No eases of fever were sent to her from any portion of the sea or land forces engaged out there. 8. Not a single case of yellow fever occurred on board her. As the nature of the existing fever is typhoid, and has no trace of the ' deadly African disease ' which has so evidently scared cer tain persons, end as every precaution has been taken by the Government, through the Health Officer, to Isolate the cases at the excellently-arranged Quarantine Station (even though the ship is a man-of-war) until pratique can fairly be given, let us hope that all afraid may be mercifully spared through the present 'unhealthy season,' and 'all the elements ot a pestilence nfe among as, to pay as a friendly visit on board the Barraoonta, and judge for themselves hew little likelihood there is ot the fair oity ot Sydney being* turned into a charnel-house' through having the ship in harbour.' Rsoobd op WnxcKS.— The following is a return of the wrecks on the coast of New Sonth Wales, for the year ending December 81, 1874:— No. ot vessels, 34; amount of tonnage, 3769; lives lost, 31. Nxw Causdokia.— State of the port ot Noumeajon the 80th of Maroh— Ships of war in harbour: The Garonnei the Cher, the 8euetre, (he Bayonnette, Gaiedonienne,andthe Gaselle. Merchant vessels: The Zephyr, the Raplde, the Donald Maclean, the Rest less, the Mary Mildred, the Furet, the Bordeaux, the Mariano, the G. V. Brooke, the Beine Hot-tense, and the Sangalie. The Fiona, a fine-looking steamer, built to the order of the Colonial Sugar Company, bjr Messrs. Humlett and Dunlop, of Glas gow, arrived on 8th instant, having made the passage in 87 days. This vessel is essentially a cargo ship, and measures 488 tons register, with a carrying capacity of 800 tons; her machinery consists of a pair of compound engines, driving twin screws of a combined power of 160, but working up to 730-horse power, which propels the slip 9 knots She is built with a double bottom whioh will contain 380 tons of water for ballast, which is pumped out hy double pumps, connected with two ateam winches in addition to the ordinary ship's pumps. The engines are a fine piece of work, and are fitted with, steam start ing gear. Altogether the Fiona appears admirably adapted for her intended trade. She left Greenock on the 31st January, and touched at Bt, Vincent cm the 10th February, crossing tbe Equator on the 17th February, in longitude 18* W.; passed the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope on the 17th Much. The easting was run down on a parallel of 64* B., heavy gales from the westward prevailing, and from the 80th to the 38th Maroh she waa continually among large quantities Of lee. The 8.W. cape of Tasmania was rounded on 16th instant, the ship having been tfdays githeroyage under sail, The barque Sydney was purchased yesterday, by Captain Ferguson, for the sum of £1500, and will be specially employed in the Solomon Island trade in conjunction with the steamer Ripple, lately purchased by the same gentleman. Tbe Befaibs to the Dallam Towkb, — It will be remembered that the above vessel, on ber voyage from London to New Zealand, was dismasted, and otherwise eo much injared that she put into Hobson'e Bay, and remained there for repairs ; these repairs, if appears, have been condemned at the English Lloyd's, at which the Melbourne Daily Telegraph expresses some surprise, as the work was executed under the personal supervision of the captain and two competent surveyors, and the ship was finally taken off the slip fitted out in the most perfect manner. The whole of the rigging waa included in the work undertaken in Melbourne, the ironwork for which was supplied by the Langlands Foundry Company, and it is the iron mountings of the spars that has re ceived the special condemnation of Lloyd's surveyor. The fallacy of tbe judgment in the case is exemplified by the fact that the plates used for the purpose of casing were ail of the' B. B. H. Bloomfield ' brand, a quality far superior to that used lor ship building purposes, this net cription of iron being exclusively devoted to the manufacture of boilers, from its general toughness. The iron for casing and general rigging at. present used by home builders is, In resllty, of only of mediocre quality, and bears no comparison with that placed in the Dallam Tower by the Mel bourne firm in question, as the old material ot the ships Loch A- d and Cambridgeshire, at present lying in the city, will attest. One of tbe grounds for condemnation advanoed by Lloyd's sur veyor was tne frailty of the angle-iron used ; and (his, again, is fallacious, as special attention was given to this and similar details, whilst the yards were most elaborately mounted, and the cross-beams tieble-rivetted instead of double, as formerly. That the general workmanship of the Melbourne equipment was at least equal to English, is indisputable, lor comparisons were in stituted while the oontraot was in progress, and on its comple tion a certificate expressing every satisfaction at the efficiency of the equipment was signed by the captain and superintending eurveyors. Under the circumstances, the action ot Lloyd's is most unaccountable, and as most serious results are involved, in the interests of the ahip-building trade, some additional light on the matter is required. ? — | NEWCASTLE.

The Avbtbaliah Ointmkmt. — Sore heads in children are cured by ite nee.— Take notioe of the undermentioned letter: — ' Parramatta, 29th December, 1873. — Dear Sir,— I beg to add my testimony to tbe wonderful curative power* of Josephson'e Australian Ointment. ' My youngest daughter had suffered lor a considerable period trom what is com monly called 'sore head,' the scalp being one mass ot prevalent sates, the constant Irritation being very great, and at night, from the position the head wonld be in, caused in creased pain, and frequently the pillow-case was covered with blood from the sores. I tried every remedy known to myself— lotions and ointment— using the latest discovery in medical treatment, carbolic acid, Ac., without any effect. Several of my friends advised me to try the Australian Ointment, at which I laughed, not believing ia its virtues. At last I applied It myself, and am pleased thus publicly to acknowledge that the first appli cation gave almost instant relief; the child had a good night's sleep for the flnt time for many weeke, and in a few days, to my great astonishment, tbe head was cured. You may make use, it yon think proper, of this letter. Yours truly,— Nicholas Waauus Chem^iWrMz, £. Sow.'
