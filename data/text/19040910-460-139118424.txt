TOPICS <Mr~TlfE WEEK. I ! It Was John Bright who branded a small band of members in the House of Commons, : unattached to any party, as living in a cave of Adullun, because he said, "Evety woe that mis .in distress and every one that vu. discontented gathered themselves there." 2Ir. Isaacs, Sir | William l$me, fl«yi others are endeavour ing to follow the Biblical example, and form |a care in. the. Federal Parliament. Mr. | Isaacs wishes to make use of that refuge in order to form alliances that irill be useful to himself. He has sought to induce the Labour par^f to enter into an offensive and defensive on. the basis of a protec tionist rerival, and, although an elaborate agreement hasbeen signed, he has failed, as regards the main part of his object. The Labour mfembeis are quite willing that Mr. Isaacs should bring his email following over to their side and vote with them, but the only concession thqr will make in return is that the Isaacs remnant shall net be op posed by Labota; candidates at the next elec tion. The negotiators for that party will not take the responsibility of reopening the tariff, nor will they bind its members as to how they shall vote in case it be re opened by Mr. Isaacs. All they will do is to support the discreet shelving of the ques tion by the appointment of a Royal commis sion of inquiry, Nprwill the Labour party forego ita attitudeof hostility to granting a bonus to any private individuals for iron manufacture, nor will it commit itself on the question of preferential trade. Mr. Isaacs 'has quite failedtogain any concessions on these, to him, vitaVporats. Yet he humbly .accepts the personal safety the Labour party promises' for. his support; and he and his party have agreed to go with the caucus on the best fcerma they can get. It is a fittingresult of a piece of unabashed self- seeking. The Isaacs remnant has de serted Mr. Deakin professedly on the ground that he favoured a coalition in which 'the. £scaT issue is sunk for a term. They.nawfonn a coalition with the Labour party m which the fiscal issue is only the snbjeetof a thin pretence. It re mains to lie seen wiiether the Labour party can save tW lBaaca ^cave" from the resent ment of the electors.

Much interest is taken throughout Anfc tralia in the development of the policy to exclude coloured labour from the Queens land sugar plantations. The last iutimation is curious and. unexpected. Kanakas are going away, and none are coming in, -hut, the plantations, it is said, may not be ab solutely dependent upon white labour, j Chinese are reported to be> offering them selves for engagement, and their numbers are expected to increase. Whence ate they eoming is the question that naturally suggests itself. It' has been inferred that they may land on the far northern shores of Australia, from the luggers engaged in the pearling and sea-slug trades, but this' idea seems romantic rather than practical. At all events, if there is any such Asiatic' immigration by a back door, it will not be long before it ia discovered by the Cus tom-house .pfiicers, the police, and the watchful Labour party of Queensland, who have adherents on every gtation on the route. The more probable explanation is* that the Chinese population, resident in Australia is finding the men. One would not dub the Chinese a versatile race, but it may bfe said of them that they are emin ently adaptable. As the goldfields died out those Mongolians who came here to work for treasure quickly turned theiriiands to a score of occupations. They have flourished at the laundry, as market-gardeners, as fur niture-makers, as cooks, and at any minor industry to which they have given their attention. But they all seem partial to labour connected with the land, and there is nothing improbable in the idea that con siderable numbers of them may 6eek plan tation irork, if satisfactoiy wages are to be made thereby. That they can stand toil in the brakes is nndoubted, the Chinese coolie being everywhere in demand for the purpose. The total number oE Chinese in the eastern colonics is about 30,000,: pretty evenly distributed. They arc all, or nearly all, at vrork, but if the plantations paid better than present, industries, a ef ficient number could no ' to materially modify 10,000 Kanakas Queensland. think and ,say their red-hot did not immi fcicipafced-is Chinese labo permanent, it ing the sugar obtained 9,000 or in would t tion cy an evefi if j be0ome| Seful in help-] tight place. The convention of delegates to the Far mers' League, held during show wwlikj. 'was a gratifying success. The attendance .was very large, and the spirit 6bown 'was tnSy enthusiastic. The determinatiou of-the con vention to fight the socialistic propaganda was unanimous. It is worthy of note in this connection that the Tradee-liall seems equally determined to push its policy to ail extreme, for it has re-engaged Mr. Tom Mann as lecturer and organiser for another term.. The convention recognised that the gocialisticpolicyfortns the real dividing line in polities' in Australia- to-day. There fore it resolved to oppose that policy by mil means, and in order to do so effectivplyii further resolved, that ail minor* political differences among the members be amik; This means that the league is determined that the fiscal issue ahall not intrude itself to cause division, and give theertemyau advantage. It is an ominous anub to tfaoee mischief-makers who are trying to revive that issue inface of the plain declaration of thaelectorathat therp sbonldbe fiecalpekcc, during , the life of this Parliament at least.

Mr. Beid, it will be- re membered, was not to bettoehedfcy the amiable cksdess gambols of theivb, a»im personated by Mr. Wat^onand his col leagues. They were in oJBcs bo ni^eiance, their speech was honeyed, anil their pro gramme mild as milk. But _ the jwwent Prime Minister argued earnestly $hat. they should not be trusted. The ^awi ed ttoe cub would grow; the trueaimsoftheFede ral Labour Caucus would l» .,twfided in dse tune. So in. "jthg- Common wealth Parliament a combination was effected to secure 'safety.v ;jG%"~'$7est Australia, just the contrary coiirsehiiB-be^n followed. The moderates who wu^jporled Mr. James there could hiTO retained con trol of affairs with theadlHssiMi - of the group of independent member*, sndithe position. Bat a. few pftbe independents succumbed to an odd ^ffijrtg. Moved possibly by memory ot the ljatteu Government's record (the weak deedg^Qf a Minktrjr Ure after it>,they arrived at.tfee conclusion that theJames Administration in office^ amenableto the "aqueeze"applied from thelabom- bencheB,wo^woxkxaiMV mischief than if the I*bourj*arty were m* stalled, and kept strongly under control. So a few anti-socialist-indeed coaa^wrtiye.' -votes transferred Mr. Danish infills MencU to the Ministerial seats, West Aus tralian moderates, like Mr/Pfcfcae and Mr. Harper, fancy that they hayea fetter way with the "cab" than Mr. Beid's way. They are emulating the "younglady ' Riga," who ''smiled as she rode ou a tiger." But it will be remembered ; "* "Coming back from tile rid*,U« plioe was in . ? -aide,' " ? . . ^' ? And the anils on the fact' of tbfc. tipr."

Probably tbe New South Wales Govern ment merely teasdn*. that a . chief justice as lieutenant-governor would prove cheaper,' and would do as well. 4S0 he might in times of political somnolc&ce.; \- But if. men And parties were engaged in a hot and pretty even struggle, as has beeft seen lately in . the federal arena, the vice-regal verdict might not be so silently and contentedly accepted. It was well that Lord Northcote and. no Joeal functionary had to decide on tbe Watson request for dissolution. It.wafl equally well that Sir Herbert Chermside, a fitraftger to Queensland strife,- had to face] the very difficult task of adjudicating, be-f twecn Sir Arthur Rut ledge and Mr. Morgan recently. So it might be said of tbe critical decision Sir George Clarke had to take hejjfr during tbe early days of the Irvine Govern ment. It will be a retrograde step as re gards 6tate rights and state safety if the Carruthers; intention is earned out., This, matter was fully considered at tbe conven-| tion, and state Governors directly .appointed were, insisted upon, the states having too de- 1 sire ,to reduce themselves in dignity to the j position of Canadian jjrovinces. J Science tends to deal more and more with things of . infinitesimal magnitude. Chemistry introduced lis to atoms which seemed, when their existence was first as- ? serted, as an explanation of the constitution of matter, to be inconceivably small. The recently-propounded electric theory of mat ter brings under our notice things compared with which atomsare of gigantic size. These, inconceivably minute bodies are called elec trons, and, according to the theory, there are an immense number of them in an atom, cach one being a centre of negative elec tricity. The distinction between positive and negative Electricity was one of the ear liest discoveries in that branch of know ledge. Each repels its own kind,and at tracts the other. What positive electricity is, Sir Oliver Lodge, who writes on the sub ject in "Harper's" monthly magazine for August, admits that we do not know, though be supposes it to be "a mode of manifesta-. tion, or a differentiated portion of the con-1 tinuous and all-pervading ether." About negative electricity we. know a good deal more. It exists in electrons, concerning which much has been ascertained by the remarkable experiments made at the Caven dish Laboratory, at the University of Cam bridge, by Professor J. J. Thomson, the eminent mathematician and physicist, and his able assistants. Every electron has a definite charge of electricity, and also a de finite and uniform mass, equal to about one-1 eight-hundredth of that of an atom of hydro gen, hitherto the lightest known form of matter. From every kind of matter only one kind of electron can be obtained. Elec tric currents are due to the movements of electrons. We may, therefore, picture to ourselves an atom as consisting of a defi nite mass of positive electricity, uniformly diffused over a sphere BO small that 200,000,000 of tf>em could be packed edge to edge in an inch. Within this sphere are disseminated a number of electrons, or mi nute specks of negative electricity, ail exactly alike, Sying about vigorously, repelling one another, but attracted and Kept in their" orbits by the mass of positive electricity in which they are embedded. There is some vagueness in thisj theory, especially as regards the two kinds of electricity, which will, no doubt, be corrected in time, but tbe theory explains a large number of pheno mena. For instance, radiation, of which light is the besf known variety,.is considered to l>e a ripple, in the ether, caused, by the sudden starting, stopping, or turning a cor ner of an electron. Light is now regarded as being due to the sudden'change of motion, - either in speed ofdirection, of an electron. Radio-active substances, such as radium-and ' uranium.are those the atoms of which, are the most tightly packed with electrons, each atom containing something like 200,000 of them. This relatively, though not positively, crowded state of the atom results every now and then in an electron flying into space. A particle of radium is J constantly throwing off electrons, the enor-1 mous number of jwhicb, and £beir minute-; oess, is -shown by the fact that it can con- J tinue to thrpw them out for a long time! withoutcausinjg any appreciable diminution of its substance.. ,It ;is estimated that the number of atoms breaking Up in any per ceptible portion of radium must be reckoned; in millions, per-second. Many other interest- i ing facts respecting the part played by minute bodies are given in Sir 'QUv&j; Lodge's paper., The tUectric theory oKi|ap>j ter undoubtedly., makes aD epoch in our knowledge of tbe physical constitution ot l the universe, no Igss important than Dal ton'sj atomic theory, pr the "Jaw of the conserva^ 1 tion of enei^y, ; . .
