Minister Denies Force Used To Bring Migrants The Minister for Immigration (Mr. Calwell) in Canberra yester day denied Moscow Radio allcga tions that displaced person refugees had been sent by force from Den mark to Australia. Moscow Radio early yesterday quoted a Tass dispatch from Copen hagen, alleging that displaced per sons were being sent from Den mark to Australia by force. The dispatch said that recently the Danish authorities, together with representatives of the "so-call ed International Refugee Organisa tion" sent to Australia "a group of citizens of the Soviet Union and the new democracies who had been living in Denmark as refugees." "Some of those who had been recruited did not turn up at the place of embarkation and efforts to find them were unsuccessful,' saidt Tass. "This, once again, confirmed the fact that displaced persons were being sent to Australia, not volun tarily, but by force." "DCeniied Access" The dispatch added that while "various shady individuals" had access to refugee camps, Soviet representatives were forbidden to visit Russians in camps, especially while the "so-called Australian Emigration Commission was at work." Mr. Calwell said the story was a concoction. Denmark had given refuge to large numbers of per sons. Being a small country, it was under pressure from Russia to repatriate these people. Denmark reported the matter to the International refugee Organisa tion which asked Australia to take refugees to help Denmark, Aus tralia agreed. A spokesman for the International Refuece Organisation's mission said in Copenhagen yesterday: "We help refugees who have to leave a country and those who want to go themselves but we never compel them"
