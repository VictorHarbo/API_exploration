One was a farmer, the other a Danish manufacturer, in business in the city. The men at Long Bay -are Kiiud Jen sen, 20, Laurets Svensen, 21, and Elland Larsen, 18. They will probably accept one of these offers if the Customs Depart ment allows them to remain in Aus tralia. They will appear at Central Police Court on Thursday on a charge of being prohibited immigrants. Charges against two German seamen of being prohibited immigrants were dismissed by Mr. Sutherland, S.M, at the Central Police Court yesterday. The seamen— Kurt Grahl, 18, and Heinrich Palinke, 34 — were allowed to remain in Australia on probation for three months. It was alleged that Pahnke and Grahl deserted from the German steamer Leuna, and were apprehended at New castle, where they failed to pass a dic tation test. Mr. Herbert Cody, Chief Customs Offi cer, said the Minister for the Interior (Senator Foil), had agreed that the sea men be released on three months' proba tion. They will be given work on a farm. Due to publicity given to the case, two German settlers had offered Pahnke and Grahl work, the secretary of the Ger man Progressive Club (Mr. Matt Hog- girth), said yesterday In an inter view.
