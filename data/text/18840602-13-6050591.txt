Charles Strong for his ministerial certificate and after a long dis- cussion with closed doors they decided that, while willing, to give Mr Strong a certificate consisting of a full narrative of the proceed- ings in his case they considered they were precluded from doing so by the decision of the General Assembly. The presbytery re- solved to transmit the application for a certificate to the next assembly. Regret was expressed that the application for a certificate was not presented to them at an earlier period when arrangements might have been made to have it laid before the recent pro re nata meeting of the assembly. It will be re- membered that in November of last year the assembly declared Mr Strong, to be no longer a member of the church, dissolved the pas- toral tie between him and Scots Church con- gregation and directed the presbytery to declare the charge vacant The following is the text of the petition which is to be presented to Parliament in opposition to the Scots Church Bill - 'To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the Legislative Assenibly of Victoria, in Par- liament assembled.—The petition of the undersigned members and adherents of the Presbyterian Church in the presbytery of ————humbly showeth,——That your peti- tioners have seen with surprise and regret that application is about to be made to Par- liament to pass a bill providing that the congregation of the Scots Church Melbourne, shall be separated and disjoined from the Presbyterian Church of Victoria and shall return and enjoy absolutely free from any claim, control interest, or interference of that church or any person the valuable pro- perty which it now occupies in virtue of its connexion with the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. Believing that such a bill, if passed would be the creation and endowment of a new denomination at the expense, and to the grievous injury, of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, a violation of the prin- eiple laid down in the State Aid Abolition Act an unconstitutional interference with ecclesiastical affairs and a dangerous tam- pering with the rights of property, your petitioners humbly pray your honourable House to reject the said bill and your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. A meeting of the committee for "guarding the privileges of the Wesleyan Church in Victoria" was held on May 22 in the Wes- leyan conference office, to consider a commu- nication received from the special commission of the Presbyterian Assembly re the proposed introduction of a bill into the ensuing, Parlia- ment to alienate the Scots Church property. The following resolution was unanimously passed:—That this meeting expresses its deep sympathy with the Presbyterian Church of Victoria in the present crisis and at the same time views with concern the threatened condition of ecclesiastical property of other Churches by the proposed introduction of a bill into the ensuing Parliament to alienate the Scots Church property ; and therefore re- solves that a petition from the Wesleyan Church in Victoria be presented to Parlia- ment urging rejection of the contemplated bill. The congregation of the Presbyterian Church, Elsternwick gave their pastor, the Rev. J. Hay, a farewell tea on the evening of May 22, and Mr. Hay was heartily wished bon voyage on the eve of his departure for Europe, where he is to spend a 12 months' holiday, after nine years work at Elsternwick. In bidding his friends good-bye, Mr. Hay coun- selled that attempts should be made to, if possible, settle the Scots Church dispute ami- cably and reasonably, adding that ministers from Scotland would teach the same as Mr. Strong and he himself taught-viz Christi- anity as a principle of life. Mr Hay ex- pressed himself as strongly disapproving of the formation of parties in the church and said that to institute inquiries into a minister's teaching upon mere rumour was a kind of inquisition which no church should tolerate.

Messrs Currie and Guise were still engaged in béche de mer fishing at Hula. Mr. Goldie was arranging for a shipment of cattle from Cooktown, which he will run on a tract of country recently leased by him. It is antici- pated that this speculation will be a great success as far as the increase of the stock is concerned, but the question as to the value of such when there is no market must not be overlooked.
