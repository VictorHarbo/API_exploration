THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT. 3ÜR COMSiERCUL TOSITION AKD F0TUIÎE FISCAL rOMOf. In the now ora now dawning upo n us, with tho ad- ditional vigour and progross inspired by solf-govorn mont, this Chamber lins before it a wide and useful Bphoro of acllon, in subjecting to the criticism of its experience those numerous measures that aro likoly to bo proposed respecting tho commorco of this 'country, and of which a commonolng specimen has bust been glvon to us in tho important financial stato pnent of tho public troasuror on tho 4th inst. And ¡this sphere of action the practical knowlodge of the ¡members of this instituto will enablo thom to occupy, without roforenco to factious feeling, or ovon to thoso ¡political parties that may divido the country on ques- tions of general govornmont. I now procoed to notico the financial statement regarding the chief points affecting our commercial well-being. In doing this, I am not so sanguino as to hope that this committee will all agroo in my own views. Some of tho proposi- tions of tho iiilntA»', such as that of a national bank of issue, aro now to our discussions, new at least in that Strong outllno which thoy now assumo as prospectivo realities. Tho groat advantage in our onterlng the {field will be to widen tho area of discussion, and thus, in propositions arousing difforoncos of opinion,"to »volve a publie sentence based on a broad experience, and pronounced with a proportionate authority. SCALB ov FINANCE.-The first subject to which I shall allude, among those givon to us in this elaborato statement, ia the commercial position of this country, as illustrated by tho extent of Its financial accounts. The annual public rovenuo and oxpondlture now oqual thoso of tho lessor Europoan States. Thoy now respec- tively amouut to and will very shortly exceed throo millions storllng. The revenue of this year is now estimated at 2,004,800?., mid the expondituro at 2,870,580?. The estimated rovenuo of 1867 is 3,227,9302., of which tho proportion from enstoms duties alono is no loss than 1,070,0002. Tho proccedB of the gold duty of 2s. Gd. per ounco, included in this amount, is 380,0001., an advance to nearly doublo the original es- timate eighteen months ago. Even in tho pastoral do partmont, receding as it must do beforo tho tldo of other progress, the rato of operations is oxoniplißod in the fact that from tho proceeds of the salo of un- claimed cattle there is estimated for the present yoar an addition to tho rovenuo of 54,0002.,-an amount, as many of our citizens maj still rocolleet, which for »ovcral years, moro than represented tho whole ordi- nary rovenuo of this colony. PnosrKiUTV AND PnooiiKss.-Thoso who givo thoir attention to the state of tho publie finances for the eighteen months preceding 31st December 1855, aro scarcely yet porlinps recovered from the feeling of de- pression as to our public affairs with which thoy wore then affected. The gold discoveries of 1851 had como Uko a rapid flood over tho country, developing lu a rival race all the powers of industry, speculation, and extravagance, and involving alike tho govornmont and the pooplo in an expenditure beyond their means. The resolve of tho Legislature to koop the expenses ot 1865 within tho compass of the year's rovenuo, and all tho financing ingonuitios of tho executlvo, still loft the country In a deficiency. There was a threatened deficiency for that year of botwoon three and four hundred thousand pounds ; there was an actual one of £115,132, besides debts and guarantees of moro than a million and a half, that in these circum- stances hung Uko a millstone on the neck ol the State. Marvellous Is tho chango brought j by the prosont yoar, at whoso torralnation wo aro now > to expect a surplus of 85,2202. Tile amount of the I surplus is unimportant, the real surprise is, that our accounts should so hoon havo righted thomsolvos from their gloomy aspect within the last eighteen months. Tho revonuo estimated a year ago for 1856, ?was 2,788,0002. Eleven months of the year havo al- ready given us the larger sum of 2,702,9002., boaldos nearly a quarter of a million in prospect for tho twelfth month. \ We must all have admired that good tasto of tho S'honourable Treasurer that induced him in this inspir- ing part of his address to disclaim any share in bring- ing about this prosperity. Tho ups and downs of com- mercial colonies do not como at tho call of thoir go .vcrninenta. But thoso visitations may respectively bo met with moro or less oí judgmont. Tho steering ot the Stato ship during seasons of prosperity is not, por ¿¿ns, leas difficult; although it may bo moro inspiring, than 12 the opposite condition of onr fitful commerce. With a trew'ury already overflowing, and ovorywhore surrounded by symptoms of an upward reaction, our Government have boforo them a stimulating prospect of public UBelulness. PUBLIC WORKS. - I glance with pleasure at the ability of the Government now to resume, upon the large scale rendered necessary by our present and prospec- tive resources the public works of the country. The subject of railways, as involving questions of public policy in their construction and management, is not yet fully before the Legislature. We have, however, the proposed expenditure for 1857 on roads and bridges alone of £577,400, being more than the entire expenditure for public works last year (1855 ). A com parative view of the expenditure under this head since the gold discoveries cannot fail to be interesting in 1861 it was £32,000, in 1852, £126,020, in 1853 £1,267,900, in 1854, £1,270,445, besides guaranteed loans of £500,000 and £200,000 to the Corporations respectively of Melbourne and Geelong. In 1855, for reasons already hinted at, the expenditure had dwindled to £538,571 in 1856 it is to be £970,678, and in 1857 it is set down at £1,157,390. Those sums do not include railway and other works carried on by means of terminable loans raised on debentures. Ono , of thooto w orks is connected w 1th tho supply of vvator to Melbourne on willoh the adi anees airo id} mado aro i £000,000, with tho prospect of attainiug £800,000 ' Trom thoso questions of fact I shall now touch upon thoso that im oh o u public polic} { LOANS -Thesoliavo boon effected by the Govoru niont either by diroot liahilit}, nsintho coso of the Molbourno waterworks just alludod to, or coutiu gentl}, a;, in tho coso of loans guaranteed In principal ai d interest to th c Corporations of Molbourno and Geelong lhiss}stom was begun in 1854, and the amount airead} paid, including so\oral suras of Into rest, is 1,002,385!
