COMMERCIAL. WEEKLY EPITOME. Advertiser and Chronicle Offices, Saturday, March 23. uekeral Kcsixess.—Trade continues quiet, and there arc no large transactions to quote in any particular line. The advices received by the English mail are favorable, and the low rates ruliug in London for money, together with the firmness in the Mark Line corn market, have given a better tone to our prospects. Bottled stoat is in l>etter demand.—ln another column we supply several items of news from the Indian and Mauritius markets, additional to those we received by the English maiL In cornsacks there is no alteration to notice in prices, but buyers purchase with caution. The great diminution in the value of the British ex ports to this colony for the month reported by the last wail is also reassuring.

The report now before us says, - In tea a large business has again to be re ported. Congou. -Directly on the departure of the last mail, a fair business was done at a slight advance on previous rates, but, on the arrival of the English mail of 2Gth November, business was once more checked. This inactivity, how ever, not of long duration, several buyers came forward, and a large business was done at steadily advancing prices, the latter purchases showing an advance of fully two taels on last quotations. Settlements aggregate 42,700 chests against arrivals during the same period 1,758 chests. The stock on hand consists principally of Foochow puked teas of inferior quality. Of Souchong, 3,261 chests have changed bands at previous rates. Of Oolong, American buyers have at length cleared the market Settlements for the fortnight, 24,811 half-chests. Prices unchanged.
