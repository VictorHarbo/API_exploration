SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. The Legislative Council suspended its sittings for two days last week in con- sequence of the death, on November 24, of the President, Sir William Mitchell. The Assembly adjourned for one day. A private meeting of the members of the Upper House was held on Thursday last to choose a new President, and Mr. James MacBain was selected by ballot. The other candidates were Dr. Hearn, Mr. Cuthbert, Mr. Lorimer, and Dr. Dobson, Chairman of Committees. Mr. MacBain sat in the Legislative Assembly for 16 years, and since 1880 has been a member of the Council. He had a seat in the O'Loghlen Cabinet, without office, in 1881-3. Two important measures of the session are advancing steadily towards the goal. The Land Bill, after having been a good deal altered by the Council, has again reached the Assembly, by which House the amendments will probably be consi- dered to-day. It was re-committed twice by the Council, which at the final sitting struck out the provision legalising selec- tion by married women. The Railway Bill was read a second time by the Upper House on Friday last, and 18 lines voted in committee. Our Parliamentary report tells how the remaining lines fared yes- terday.
