The eleventh shot fired passed right between the "HongKong" and the boat 20ft or so astern,' so Captain lijlTel afterwards said, but the thirteenth passed light over the trawler, "making a gust of wind, as the captain said, that nearly shifted ex very thing on the bridge, and made me duck nix bend The Express at once put her flag half mast but the effect of the shot had already been observed from the shore and filing for the day discontinued A. searching inquiry into the matter has been made, and the result xxiii in due course be Known The explana- tion, how ex cr xxiii probably be found in the fact that in the hurry of the practice the driver mistook the red flag on the mast of the Express and a spare Hong Kong ' target on her stern for the two local targets which because of the distance, and the battery being a low site" one, were not clearly visible Strangely enough when spoken to about the eleventh shot the Mayor assured the officer commanding that he was "on' the targets IMMIGRATION The concessions granted by the New Zealand day ernment to persons in Great Britain desirous of settling in this colony together with the keen distress at present existing in London and the provinces has resulted in a large number of immigrants arriving in New Zealand By the Ionic several hundred came, and one of the passengers who was interviewed by -a newspaper representative states that but for the condition made by the Government requiring a man to possess at least £50 before he becomes entitled to the concession him dr ends of others at home who could not raise the sum mentioned but who would prove deserving settlers would emigrate It is not at all lil city however, that the condition laid down will be modified in the TO sheet alluded to Though the state of the labour market is not regarded as too sails factor v the Ionic s immigrants seem to have found openings for themselves somewhere I he 1 labour department officials state that they have had fewer applications from them for work than for in those coming by any other ship in fact some who had sent testimonials from home in advance have so far not appeared it the office DtallVDINC PHOCH.MNGS BY MAORIS If in respect to many of their old time habits and customs the Maoris have shown that they are steadily abandoning them there is no doubt that their belief in some of their ancient superstitions still manifests itself at times very strongly Dr Pomare a Ma on himself and Government official who is doing all he can to elevate his countrymen has recently taken the natives to task on account of toliuiigiism in other words their belief that illness in any shape or form is due to spells having been laid upon the person who is sick and that the only method of cure is the performance of such rites and ceremonies and observances as the tonings of priest or wizard may prescribe Sometimes the things advises a fey cr stricken patient to be placed in cold water with the result that he dies Then the toy ei nment prosecutes But often so serious a result does not happen and the Echunga exercises his influence unmolested Here is a description of what happened in one by village as pictured by an c} e w witness noted as a student of the race -
