DANES AND MIGRATION Minister Answers Critic According to statements made in London by Mr. Svend Hansen, Danish journalist, who recently visited Australia, the Australian Government did not appear really interested in migration. His remarks, published in Sat- urday's issue of "The Age," elicited a reply yesterday from the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Calwell), who described Mr. Hansen as a conservative-minded young man representing "some conservative newspapers in Den- mark." Mr. Calwell said Mr. Hansen had apparently expected to be en- tertained at the expense of the Australian taxpayer and given a Cook's tour of the Common- wealth. If every overseas journalist visiting Australia were to receive such treat- ment, increased income taxation would obviously be necessary. However, every courtesy had been shown him. Arrangements had been made for the Department of Information to give him all pos- sible assistance in his quest for information. While in Australia Mr. Hansen had contributed ar- ticles to Danish newspapers lav- ishly praising Mr. Menzies and the Opposition parties, and almost totally ignoring the work of the Australian Government.
