The Havilah has made a lengthy passage con sequent on the heavy gales experienced through out. During the earlier portion she steamed head to wind, but consequently, the stock of coals being reduced to 24 hours' steaming, she was hove to till the weather moderated. Captain Saunders reports passing sufficiently close to the reef which is known to exist S.S.W. of .Cape Willoughby Light house to see the breakers on it, and by fiis com putation it is distant from the Lighthouse about 14 miles. The Elizabeth arrived from Port Augusta on .Wednesday morning, and anchored at the Light ship for orders. The schooner Harriet, with 60 logs cedar, has nut in here for repairs, having during her passage lost her foremast and several sails. She is from Richmond River via Sydney, and Iwund to Ade laide; and so severe were the gales encountered that shelter hail to be sought in Twofold Bay.— Melbourne Herald, August 24.
