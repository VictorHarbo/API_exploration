FOREIGN MIGRATION SOIfE FACTS AND FIGURES., (Issued by Publicity Branch, Prime Minister's Department.). The impression is widespread-that per sons of foreln 'birth are entering Aus tralia In numbers so large as to men ace the preservation of the preponderant British element of our population. THE PRESENT POSITION. For the three years and six months ended September, 1924, the average an nual excess of arrivals In, over depart ures from Australia, of British peoples Was 29,120. During the same period the aterage annual excess of arrivals over departures of persons of foreign birth was 4010. The average annual increase in the population by excess of births over deaths during the same period was 82,000. Assuming that only 20,000 Britishers (a decrease of 9120 on the above figures) came here each year during the next de cade, and that 20,000 aliens (an increase of 15,390 on the figure above given) were admitted annually during the same period -also assuming that the natural increase In the population remained stationary the British population of Australia at the end of 10 years would renresent 96 per cent. of the total-a dilution of the present British preponderaLce to the ex tent of only 2 per cent. In all probability, however, the hum ber of British assisted migrants will when the new agreement about to be en tered Into by the Britiah andd Common wealth Governments and the Govern ments of the six states is Ir operation show .ad increase over the number who arrived during the period above stated. The number of unassisted British mi grants is unlikely to decreae. It is safe to assume that the gain by natural in crease, which is generally cumulative, will also be greater in the future. From present indications, In view of the agree ments entered into between the Common wealth and certain Foreign Governments to restrict the issue of passports or the granting visas, it is liekly to be some years before the number o! foreign ar rivals reach 20,000 per annum. The Italian Government has agreed to limit the' granting of passports to per eons who have been nominated by per sons in Australia and who are in pos session of £40 each. In the case oft Greeks, Jugo-Slavs, and Albanians, the British authorities, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, are limiting the granting of visas to passports to 100 per month in each case, and visas will not be granted to persons unless they are individually in possession of £40. THE FOREIGN ELEMENT. The census of April, 1931, showed that the number of persons in Australia not born here, or in the Brit:sh Isles, or New Zealand, was 139,073, or slightly over 2% per cent. The numbei owing allegi ance to foreign Governments was 14,529, or .08 per cent. During the past few years, and particularly since July, 1924 (when the latest Immigration Restriction Act paised by the United States Con gress came Into operation), there has been a quicker movement of peoples fronu Southern Europe to Australia. During the 3% years ended 30th Sep tember, 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign-born Immigrants numbered 16,148-a - figure representing about 11.6 per cent. of the total foreign born persons who were in Australia when the 1921 census was taken.

The action of the Unlted States of America in adopting the qcota system to restrict the flow of immigration to that country, has had the effect of diveru:ng immigrants from certain European coun tries to Australia. The United States law came into effect on the ]st July, 1921. In the light of this fact the following table, wh!ch is self-explanatory, is in teresting: Excess of arrivals over dopartures ot persons of various Eurolpean nationall tles--Ist July, 1924, to 30tb November, 1924 (five months.)

It has been pointed out that during tle 3% years ended Sdptember, 1924, the ex cess of arrivals over departures of for eign persons was 10,148-at the rate of 4614 per annum. The above table shows they are arriving at the rate of over 10.000 per annum--a large percentage in crease, 'but not a very large actual In crease. The following table shows the posl tion in regard to tihe movement of Ital ian and Greek people to Australia. ITALIANS.

These flgures show that during the 3'A years ended September, 1924- and par ticularly during the five months ended Xodember last-the niigration of Italians and .Grecks has been greater than ati any period during the past 40 years. If the rate of their incoming during the livo nlonths period mentiolned is maint talned, 3124 will have arrived here dur ing the year cndlng April inext.

In IMay, 1921, the first Immigration Restriction Act was passed by the Uni ted States Congress. This act introduc ed the "quota" system. The quota was lmited to 3 per cent. of the number of nationals of each country who were domiciled il tihe U.S.A. according to the census of 1910. This act operated for a year, and was replaced by the act which came into force on July 1, 1924. Thil later act reduced the quota from 3 per cent. to 2 per cent. of the number o: nationlals domiciled in the United State" as determined by the census of 1890. The reason for this is 'signifcaut. The great stream of so-called Nordic Im migration flowed to thie Utaited States before 1890---the "new" or southern European immnigration came later. The figures in the following table are 7 A 1 striking, and show the great reductions to effected by the new act in the quotas of of such countries as Czecho-Slovakia, SIun- in gary, Italy, Poland, Greece, tLussia, the Rtoumania, and Jugo-Slavla. pa: val d Ital im , nq pol vis o 0 .13 Country. 0 a 0a n • ~ ,, ".

The actual, physical counting of human beings arriving by ship and train has been a tasko of magngituole. Mistake:, d have been made. Steamships have raced 0 ti.o port In efforts to land passengers i within time .mlits. Delays and dlsap tb pointments have brought hardshbips. bi Distressing appeals for rellef In In- A dividual cases have assailed the oflicers charged with enforcement of the law. to Senoators and Representatives have bern ol hesought to aid either in nullifying the tl statute or in mitigating its force. st All these troublesome obstacles are confidently expected to be eliminated on dt the event of the enactment of the lnew 3 bill. The bill contains provision for T enforchment of the numetleal limitation W not by counting immigrants upon their t arrival, but by counting "immigration certificates" issuable at American Con- C sulates overseas. The plan, briefly, is to issue iqr each nationality a numboe of Immigratlon certificates to .be placed in the bands of intending immigrants as they obtain American visas upon their passports. Each , certificate has a validity of two months to the time of takins ship. Therefore, the intending immigrant, having obtained his pass port, his immigration certificate, and his visa, is at liberty to proceed to the United States In the full knowledge that be will not be debarred solely by a quota limitation. Hie must, however, undergo further examination at the port ot entry, and be able to pass under tlhe provisions of the 1917 act. It is ex pected that the numbeg of those who cannot pass will be greatly reduced by reason of the preliminary investigation. There should be no arrival of "excess quota" cases, and there need be no rac ing of steamships. If this bill reduces to the minimum the number of arriving aliens that must be turned back it will have accomplished one of its important purposes." It seems to be impracticable for Aus tralia, which has no foreign service, to enforce a quota law. Another significant passage in the re port of the United States Congressional Committee is the following:-"Decision by the committee to limit admissions of 'quota immigrants' to 2 per cent., based on census figures of 1890, instead of 3 per cent. based on the census of 1910, was reached after long and careful con sideration of every element of the entire immigration problem. An impelling reason for the cncnge is that it is deo sired to slow down the streams of the types of Immigrants which -are not easily assimilated. Naturalisation does not necessarily mean assimilation. The lnaturalisation process cannot work well with tile continued arrival in large nulnl bers of the so-called lew immigration. The new type crowds in the larger cities. It is exploited. It gains but a slight knowledge of America and American institutions. It has grosvn to be a great undigested mass of alien thought, alien sympathy, and alien pur pose. It is a menace to the social. political, and economic life of thile corne try. It creates alarm and apprehen Ssion. It breeds racial hatreds which should not exist in the United States, and which need not exist when the bal ance shall have been restored."
