The prestige of these famous Engines is ever increasing, and we are continually receiving orders, many of them being repeat orders, fron, til parts of the Commonwealth and South Sea Islands. These Engines are built for hard work, and the construction i. so simple and the work- ing parts are so easily accessible that the merest novice has no difficulty in obtaining every satis- faction from the running cf the Engines. The fittings on the Marine Patterns are nickel-plated. Mr. SID. ROBINSON, Halifax, N.Q., writes: "My two engines (a pair of 4-h.p.) run lovely. It is a treat to ask tbera to run a couple of hundred miles. They run like clockwork. The more one sees of these engines the more one can appreciate being the owner of a 'Frisco STAN- DARD' ENGINE."
