Capital: Two Millions Sterling, in One Hundred Thousand Shares of £20 each. The First Issue to be limited to Fifty Thousand Shares, upon which £2 por Sharo— £100,000, is to be paid up. The increasing business of the Melbourne Banking Company renders it desirable to ro-organiso the Bank on a broader basis. Tho proprietors havo therefore decided on forming themselvos into a Joint Stock Banking Company, under tho above title, and to ad mit new proprietors on the terms hereinafter named. The now corporation (in regard to the shareholders) will bo on tho same footing as any other Limited Joint Stock Company ; and in view of tho security given to tho public by the proposod la*ge amount of subscribed capita1, the liability of the proprietors will bo limited by the incorporation of the company undertho ' Companies' Statute, 1S64.' TERMS OF TRANSFER OF BUSINESS. ' On tho 31st day of March next the deposits of tho Mclbourno Banking Company will bo transferred, at their curront rates of interest, to tho new corpora tion.' ' On tho same day the advancos, all of which will bo guaranteed to their present maturity by tho Mel bourne Banking Company, will bo taken over and re discounted by the new bank, at an average rate of nine per cent, per annum discount.' An estimated amount of £12,000 discount would thus accrue to tho new corporation at once. The deposits of tho Melbourne Banking Company at the last bnlnnco (1st January) woro £402,703 18i 7d. ' The bank promises, now in course of eroction at tho corner of Quoen and Little Collins streets, will bo convoyed to tho new company at cost value.' The outlay in this property has been judiciously made, and the possession of it will, it is considered, prove a valuable acquisition to tho business. Tho building is oxpocted to bo ready for occupation in July next. It is designed so as to produco a roturn of about five por cent upon the total expenditure, by let ting superior otlicos over tho bank, besides affording oommodious and prominent offices for the business of tho bank, free of rent chargo.

Of tho premiums thus obtained, it is intonded to apply ono half to tho commencement of a reserve fund for the new bank, and tho other half to the Molbourno Banking Company, as a bonU3 for the business transferred.' Of tho abovo 18,125 shares it is also contemplated reserving a portion for tho othor colonies. Tho business of the Melbourne Banking Corpora tion will bo similar in charactor to that which has beon so successfully conducted by tho Molbourno Banking Company from the commencement, but power will bo taken in tho deed of association to oxtend tho business to that of a bank of issue, and also to oxtend tho operations of tho bank elsewhere, as may be found expedient.

GRACE EG E~' R T 0 N (Mrs George Case) and MR GEORGE CASE Havo great pleasure in announcing to their kind Melbourne friands and patrons that after a prolonged and successful tour through South Australia, New South Wales, 'Queensland, and Now Zealand, they have returned to the town of their earliest successes in the colonies, and where thoy were so warmly and enthusiastically welcomed upon their landing from the old country. Tho intorest invariafcly evinced in their bohalf by the inhabitants of this, the leading town of tho colonies, encourages thorn to beliovothat they will not bo intrusivo in presenting a slight re sume of their progress since they last had tho honor of appoaring beforo them, and in adding that tho good opinion of their humble endeavors to please accorded to tha'n in Melbourne has beon endorsed throughout the other colonios. Upon leaving Melbourne in December, 1864, they had tho pleasure of apppariug in all tho available towns throughout Victoria, being received on overy occasion by enthusiastic and crowded audiences. In March of last year they appeared for some week, at the largo Assembly Rooms, Adelaide, being honored on two occasions by tho presenco of his Excellency tho Governor of South Australia and Lady Daly. The room, capable of containing 700 porsons, was nightly crowded, and on tho occasion of Mrs Case's bonefit a great number of persons wero unablo to gain admission. South Australian* Register, 21st March, 1865. — ' Mr and Mrs Case's Entertainment. — White's Room was crowded to excess on Monday evening. 20th March ; in ffict, many persons were ob liged to go away, being unablo to gain ad mittance. Among tho audience, which was a highly fashionable one, were his Excelloncy and Lady Daly, under whose patronage the entertainment, which was for tho benefit of Mrs Caso, was givon. Mrs Case repeated her round of characters in Edmund Yates's 'Latest Intelligence Abroad and at Home' in her usual inimitable manner, and the performances of Mr Case on tho concertina and vklin were loudly applauded.' After visiting a fow towns in South Australia, they made their debut at the School of Arts, Sydney, to the inhabitants of which city they havo reason to bo especially grateful, foi tho gratifying reception thoy received at their hands, having given sixty per formances in Sydney with unabated success. His Excellency Sir John Young, Lady Young and suito were present on two occasions. They appeared upon tho completion of their tour through New South Wales and Queensland, for a second season in Sydney, no less gratifying than the former ono. : From tho Sydney Morning Herald, 7th October, I 1S65 :— ' The densely crowded audience which visited the School of Arts last evening, when Mr and Mrs George Caso gave their fare well entertainment, ' was a fitting testimony of tho high estimation formed of tho pleas ing and clever performances of those talented artists. ®n tendering their adieu, the clover couple received hearty acclamations of applause.' In Brisbane tho following great compliment was paid to Mrs Caso on tho occasion of hor benefit : — Queensland Daily Guardian, 19th August, 1865.— j 'Mrs George Caso's Benefit.— Yesterday evening the members of the Volunteer Firo Brigade got up a | grand demonstration in honor of this lady. Tho | firemen mustered in great force at tho town-hall at 1 seven o'clock, and provided themselves with lighted 1 torches. After all their preparations wera completed, I they formed into procession, and with a volunteer | band playing a lively measure at their head, marcked | down Queen- street to the Royal Hotel. Tho light of | the torches glancing upon the picturesque uniforms 8 of the corps had a very pretty effect. Having halted 1 in front of the Royal Hotel, the corps waited until 1 Mrs Caso had entered hor carriage, whon they set 1 forth again upon Ihcir perambulations. The lady S was escorted by this imposing gardo d'honneur fj through some of the principal streets of the town, g and atlnstsot down attho doorof thothoatroin Eliza- M both-street.' 'The houso was crowded to suffoea- a tion, aud every one present seemed to enjoy the fl amusement purvoyed to tliem.' 'After tho perform- a ances were over the members of the brigade formed H in procession once more, and having sot their torches M flaring, escorted Mr and Mrs Caso back to tho hotol, M whevo they quitted them with three cheers.' W It would occupy too much spaco to record their 9 successes throughout Now Zealand, and they will, m ther3foro, contont themselves by adding that tho jS substantial marks of approval they havo received » during their pleasant labors enabled them to an- m nounco their retirement from tho profession aftor 9 having once more taken a rapid tour through tho co- m lonios, and bidding faro A'cll to their numerous friends ? and patrons. 9 From the Wellixotos Advertiser of 8th Decem- m Toor, 18G5 :— ' The second performance in Wellington H by theso talented artistes came off at the Oddfellows' M Hall on Wednesday evening, in tho presonco of one fl of tho largest and most fashionable audio-ces ever ? assembled in Wellington. His Excellency the Go- ? vernor was present, attende.J by his staff, and wo at also noticed' his Honor Mr Justice Johnston, and ? several of the heads of departments.' 9 Major-General Chute, commander of tho forces in M New Zealand, and to whose ability and onergy tho -H inhabitants of that colouy are indobtod for the sup- 9 pression of tho rebel Maories and termination of the 9 war, attended three of Mr and Mrs Goorgo Caso's ? performances, accompanied by his staff, tho audience |H on each occasion including all tho officers and their S families stationed in tho district. M ?~——^ ^H It is with much pleasure that ? Mr M-dMvsGEO RGB CASE flj Announce that they havo secured the H ROYAL POLYTECHNIC HALL, M For a am Short and strictly limited JM SERIES of PERFORMANCES, M Commencing on jM SATURDAY NEXT, 3rd MARCH. M Duriug their absence from Melbourno they havo 9 lost no opportunity of adding to thoir alroady exten- H sivo ropertoiro, and have incurred considerable ox- H pen se in providing new and ologant costumes. Thoy B are able to announco many fresh illustrations and « sketches, amongst tho most successful of which is ? Grace Egorton's imitation of |M The great English tonor, 9 SIMSREEVES, M Which she will have tho honor to introduce on tho H occasion of hor re- appearance. |fl Otaoo Times, Jan. 31, 1866.--' The imitation of JB Sims Reeves by Mrs Caso is one of tho cleverest -m tilings that lady has done here; his poQuhan- m ties of manner are cleverly hit off. Two of Sm-s |H Reoves's most favorite songs were sun£, -- JJ'T S Pretty Jano,' and ' Come into the Garden, M;iud. m Both wero well sung, and altogether tho -prosonta- S tion' of tho whimsical- tempered, glorious-yoiced am singer is sure to cause a great deal of laughter, and S to give much roal pleasure, especially to those who -S havo heard him at a conceit.' 9 Mr George Caso has not been idle, and will per- ?m form soveral new solos, both on tho violin and con- m certina, written by him since ho lost performed in m Melbourne. ,. 3 Tho arrangements introduced by Mr and Mrs » Goorge Caso at their former season, and which wero m so universally approvod, will bo retained, as also tw m same prices of admission, so available to all oswse:., a ?y*2 . ? |9 Reserved seats, 3s.
