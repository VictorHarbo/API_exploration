OXYGEN IS LIFE Although the modern Materia Medica in eludes many valuable remedies, it is a mat ter of certainty that in all cases where the animal vitality is failing, Phosphorus is decidedly superior to every other remedy at present kuown. It will work effects such as nothing else -itIproduse,-and it- posseBses the ereat advantage of not causing, when its use is relinquished, the slightest reaction or depression. Util thle introuetion of DR. BRIGHT'S Phosphodyne, Phosphorus was but seldom preseribed as a Medicine, owing to the diffi culty in so preparing it that its action could ue kept under perfect control. It had been used in Almond and O.ive Oils, in Sulphuric Eth.r, in rectified Alcohol, in Chloroform, and in several tlherr__subsutses but~how ever valuable it has been found in all the hitherto known methods of its preparation, eertain irregular results have been experi enced, which have led Physicians to neglect itforgeoeral purposes, and to employ it only in extreme cases. But in the form of DrBfgldts--iPlrosphodyne-, ite invalua'obie action on the human system is realized with nt any of those drawbacks which previous °modes of administration have invariab y P ,duced. rCAUTrION.-PHtSPHORUS is some Imes sadl in the firm of Pills audLozenges; it should be g, nerally known that every form where solid particles of Phosphorus are in combination is highly dangerous. It is therefore necessary that the public should be- cauftonedi- again-aithe -use of~ any pe paration of Phosphorus not perfectly sol able in water.

'The il eo Curative Agent, and only Reliabl Renledy for Nervous and Liver (Cooplaints, and all /unctional Derangementls. The remarkable efficacy of Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne is now well known, and is acknowledged by the first medical men in Europe, by whom it is recommended as the most efficacious med!icine hitherto discovered for Weak and Shattered Constitutions, NervousDebility, Aversion or Incapacity for Study, Trembling of the Limbs, Insiges tion, Female Complaints, Flatulence, Liver Complaints, Shortness of Breath, Drowsi ness, Pains in the Head, Pimples, Impover ished Blood, and all diseases forwhich iron mercury, iodide of potass, &c.;, are given in various formns, often to the destruction of the patient's health. The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are frequently shown from the first day of its administration, by a remarkable increase of nervous power, with a feeling of vigour and comfort, entirely overcoming that dull inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience in their actions. DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE is Sold by all Chemists and Medicine Vendors throughout the- Glo'be,?in caasee- at--10s.-6r., orin Family Cases, containing one dozen 10s. 6d. eases, at £5. DiR. BRIGHIT'S PROSPKODYNE IS IATRONISED BY THE AristocracyianiAhe Elite, Extensively used in the ARMY AND NAVY AND Eig~hly eomne BY THE LEADiWG MiEDICAL Practitioners. The high estimation in which Phosphor. us is held, is unquestionably due to its administration in the form of Dr. Bright's Phospholdyne. Its extraordinary success has induced unscrupulous competition and worthless imitations. .THEREFORE, ASK FOR DR.
