Australian dairy s-tudents who have completed a course in Denmark refer with enthusiasm to the methods there, and advoeatc their adoption in Aus tralia. They also urge that" facilities should be granted by Australia for the immi gration of Danish dairy farmers. <A column would be insufficient to de scribe the advance of dairying in Den mark, but it comes as a shock to find that intelligent (Australian 6tudents are advocating the adoption of the Danish system (going so far as to Tecommend facilities for Danish immigration), while our so-called "Settle Soldier on the Land" Government is seriously considering clos ing down the State farm at Turret-field, where highclass calves from ^special milk and butter fat-producing strains are preserved, and where thia policy could be expanded with genuine benefit to the whole community. It is appa rent that it is time the "Mark Time" and "Keep Out Seat" State Government was turned over to the mercies of the electors, whom they have "milked" long enough, and whose epeeious claim thai by attempting nothing and crying "Pro duce, produce, produce," they are doing their duty to the country, its returned soldiers, its war widows and orphans, and its civilians, and are preserving its resources.}
