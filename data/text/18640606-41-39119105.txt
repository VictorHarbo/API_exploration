June 1— Exonia, 156 tons, Stephenson, master, from Great Britain. Cargo-Engine, for Meouta Mines; 150 tons bricks. Miscellaneous. The Exonia hove in sight a little before sun down on the evening of June 1, ami was observed with a pilot-flag flying; but in consequence of darkness coming on rockets and bluehghts were fired off from the shore as signals for her to show lights. She was boanled at 9 p.m. by a pilot, about efcht miles off at anchor; the pilot weighed at day light, and brought her to the wharf. She has made a rather protracted voyage, having been 116 days from Hayfe. in Cornwall. The cargo consists of machinery and bricks for the Moonta and Wal laroo Mines. MELBOURNE SHIPPING. Sailed. June3-SiR Isaac Newton, brigantine, for Willunga. , , ,_„ Same Day— Centaur, brig, for Wulunga. MISCELLANEOUS. The Little Fred, from Gothenburg, having re ceived orders to proceed to Dunedin with her lading of deals, weighed on Sunday morning at an early hour. Tne Alert, with a cargo of coals from New castle, arrived last week, and after mooring in harbour received instructions to sail for Wallaroo without breaking bulk. She was accordingly towed out on Saturday and immediately made sail. The Penola left Melbourne on the night of the 1st, and called at Port Robe on Friday at daylight in order to land a large quantity of cargo, which operation occupied the greater portion of the day. She was ready for sea, however, in the evening, and arrived at the Lightship next morning. During the passage from the Heads to Guichen ] Bay experienced moderate N.W. winds and fine weather, and thence to Kangaroo Island fresh breeres with thick haze. The brig Phillis has been absent from Port Adelaide for some time, during which intervo} extensive repairs have been undergone both in hull and rigging; rendering her a most desirable craft for the trade. She arrived on Saturday, bringing a full cargo of wheat, and will immediately fill up for the neighbouring colonies on its discharge. The Rona put back on Sunday evening, and came to single anchor at the anchorage to await a shift of wind. ?
