INTRODUCTION. Tho past month has been unusually barren of political interest. The further prorogation of Parliament to the 26th Inst. produced a lull In the election campaign, which will not, however, be of long duration. The Government policy, of which as yet there has been no Indica- tion will be unfolded by the Premier at Warrnambool on theo 25th inst, the day fixed for the dissolution of Parliament, and the writs for the now elections are to be issued five days later. All the elections take place on the 11th of May, and Parliament will be called together on the 29th of May. There are at pre sent 223 candidatee in the field, to claim the 80 seats, and there will be some hard fought contests. The revenue returns for the quarter and year ending 31st March respec- tively, were published at the begin- ning of last week. The Customs revenue shows a decrease on the quarter of some £7,000, but an increase on the year of about £20,000. Articles subject to ad valarem duties have contributed some £39 000 more during the past 12 months than they did during the corrosponding period ending 31st March, 1870 The duty on spirits distilled in Victoria amounted to £35,541, reopresenting 111,803 gallons, at 6s. per gallon. There is a decrease in the receipts from sales of Crown lands by auction ; and judging from the " receipts towards the purchase of lands," selection is proceeding rapidly. The railway revmue, owing chiefly to the opening of mw lines, has increased during the past year by over £100,000. On tho whole tto comparison with the figures of last year is not unsatisfactory, the increase on the quarter being £40,373, and on the year £170,803. SOCIAL. The past montl has been a singularly un- eventful one. Tie community has occupied itself a good deal m holiday making, and the weather having leen unusually fine for this season of the year, the Caster festivities were enjoyed in the tlorough marmel which is elia racienatic of Amtralia at holiday timo. The announcement lontained in a London paper that there ia a probability of the Prince of Wales visiting the Australian colonies has naturally excitfd interest but the statement _ not sufficiently authoritative to create any real expectation. No definite action hat- ye t been taken to cirry into effect the resolutions arrived at by the conference recently held at Sydney on the subject of duplicate cable communication One of the principal results arrived at was that arrangements should be made with the EaBtern Extension Telegraph Company for a reduction of the message tariff to Os per word, at a subsidy not exceeding £20 000 par annum, and the Governments of bouth Ans tralia and New South Wales wore em powered to make arrangements accordingly. It will be lemornbered that, subsidiary to the original conference, which bad negatived the proposal for a duplicato line from Singapore to Banjoowongie tbe representatives of Vic tona, New Suuth Wales and South Aus traita met, and resolved to arrange for the construction of this cable by the three colonies principally interested Sir Henry Ayers, Colonial Secretary of South Australia, -hile in Melbourne had several interviews with the Government here, bat he had to leave before a deDnite conclusion was ar lived at» The Ministerial changes in New RsmtH W«1m ho. o oiuw oouroüU U onapttnoion of the negotiations, but it is understood that they have now been re opened The Queens land Government has intimatod its assent to the resolutions agreed to at the conference, winch include the one relating to the re auction of the tariff. The first election of Harbour Trust Com missioners under the Melbourne Harbour Trust Act 1876 took place on March 30 The circumstance that the election had been in advertently fixed for Good Friday in no way interfered with the proceedings The Trust as provided by the act consists of 15 commis sioners The merchants and traders elected as their three representatives on the Trust Messrs C E Bright, Thos Loader and T T Sargood ; and the shipowners elected Messrs H. C. Pigott, Jos. Paterson (the Mayor of Melbourne), and H. R Reid The City Council was empowerrd to elect two com- missioners, but the act provides that each commissioner must be chosen by a majority of the whole council and Councillor Mowbray was the only candidate who coald obtain a sufficient number of votes to secure his election. The Footscray Council, from a similar cause, failed to choose a representa tive on the Trust none of the candidates receiving the requisite number of vote Councillor Morley was elected by the Sand- ridge Council, Councillor Howman by the Williamstown Council and Councillor Phil- lipson (the mayor) by the council of Emerald hill. Three commissioners were appointed by the Governor in Council, viz, Messrs. James Lorimor, James Orkney, and W W Couche The Governor in Council, as pro- vided by the act has made two other appoint- ments, rendered necessary by the failure of the City Council and footscray Council to elect representatives. The members so chosen are Mr. John M'llwraith and Mr. William Mitchell. On the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of March the astronomers of the various Australian colonies were engaged, in compliance with the suggestion of the astronomer royal, in examining the surface of the sun for the EoppoBed intra Mercurial planet Vulcan, the transit of which at about the time men. tioned had been predicted by M Leverrier. The weather was favourable for the observa tiona, which were conducted with the greatest care, but no trace of the expected transit was seen, Mr. Ellery reporta that at the Melbourno Observatory several sun. spots were noticed, but they were easily re. cognisable, and none of thom had any resem* Monee to a planetary body m transit It is promised that greater expedition will be UBed than has hitherto been the case in the construction of tho railway which ia to connect Sydney with Melbourne The late New South Wales Government waa opposed to the extension of the line, bnt the now Ministry has adopted a more enterprising railway policy, Mr. Parkes has announced that the Government will be m a position m three months to accept tenders for the con- struction of the line to Albury, taking thus the only Btep now required for establishing direct railway communication between Sydney and Melbourne The Great Southern line is already opon for traflic as far as Mut. rumburrah a distance of 223 miles from Sjdncy, and it is expected that the extension to Cootamundra, a further distance of 25 miles, will be ready for nae about tho middle of AuguBt. There will then remain the sec tion between Cootamundra and Wagga Waggs, 56 miles, some progress with which has u.ready been made, and the final section from Wagga Wagga to Albury, a distance of 60 or 70 miles. It is now proposed to pro- ceed with the construction of these two sec tiona ninoultaneonely, and the completion of the line therefore ought not to be a very dis- tent event. The railway to Hamilton is bo far advanced in its construction that it will be opened to Dunkeld on the 23rd inst. Dunkeld ia only 20 miles from Hamilton. The appearance of small pox on board nteamero coming to Australia from Indian and Chinese ports is of frequent occurrence. The Torres Straits mail steamer Brisbane having on board Sir Arthur Kennedy, the new Governor of Queensland, was for this reason quarantined at Brisbane, and on similar grounds the Bangalore with the February mails from England and India waa detained at the quarantine station at Port Phillip Heads for more than a week There was no Benous outbreak on board either vessel, and on board the Bangalore thero waa only one mild case, that of the socond engineer of the veasol, who was landed at King George's Sound. A few days after the release of the Bangalore from qua «ntine an alarm was caused in Mel bourne by the report that one of her pas «rogers, who was residing at a restaurant in Bourke street, had been attacked with small* pox. AU anxiety, however, has been ro moved by the announcement on medical authority that the disease ia merely chicken* pox lu a mild form. The ship Linguist, which arrived from Liverpool on the 6th uiBt, was placed in quarantine on account of »paving bad small pox on board, bnt aa the last case occurred on the 29th January and the health ot the passen gora was good, the vessel was released next day. His Excellency tbo Governor haa received a despatch from tho Secretary of State (or the Colonies concerning the admission of colonial harrie tera to the English bar.tranamit ting a copy of a letter from the Inna of Court on this subject Tho letter contained a copy of resolutions arrived at by a joint committee of the four Inna of Court, in which the Inna agree to recognise the claims of the Victorian bar bo far ob to dispense with tho preliminary ezamiDations,andtoreqairoattendancoforBix iiiBtead of 12 terms aa a preliminary to being called to the English bar. It waa mentioned in our last summary that the Hon. E. Langton, one of our moat prominent politicians, had brought an action against the Aye newspaper, for an alleged libel upon him, and that he had recovered £l,0GO damages for tbo imputations npon his character. An application has since been made to the Supremo Court to nonsuit tbe plaintiff, on tho ground that the commenta made upon him woro privileged, as they only referred to him in his public capacity. The Court refused to nonsuit the plaintiff, but the damages bave boon oa technical grounds reduced to £750. The defendant baa given notice of appeal to the Privy Council. Mr. Serjeant Sleigh, a member of tho English bar, has arrived in Melbourne, and haa been admitted to practice at tho Vic- torian bar. A proposal haa been submitted to the senate of the Melbourne University to re* movo tbo institution from ita present position to a more central sito in the city. A resolution to this cffoct waB moved by Pro- fessor Andrew at a full meeting of the senate, on tbo 1Mb inst, but after a prolonged de. bate the proposition waa negatived by 48 to 12\. To meet the demand of Professor Andrew and others for an extension of the advantages of the University to the masses of the popula- tion, the Bishop of Melbourne and Sir Wil Ham Stawell recommended the establishment of clauses for the delivery of popular lectures. The annual commencement of tho University took place on the 8th inst. His Excellency the Governor and Lady Bowen wore present, and thero was a vory large attendance of ladies and gentlemen. The Bishops of Mel boame and Ballarat took ad eiindem degrees as Masters of Arts. The Kev. Canon Goodman and the Kev. W. Followaalao took ad eundem. degrees na MaBtera of Arts ; and the LL.D. degree ad cundem was conferred On Dr. Mor. rison. of the Scotch College. The Hertho, a German war steamer, carry m g l'l guns, arrived on the ¿0th March from Auckland. She remained until the 4>h inst, to enable her to coal, and procure fresh pro- visions und then left for home. H M C fa Viceona haa returned from a survey cruise in Banka' Straits The survey of this place, which waa commonced in Octo ber, 1874, ia now complete, and the last fort- night of the cruise was spent in erecting marks and preparing for tho survey of the remaining iinBurvcyed portion of Basas Strait 'lhe first portion of tho crmae was devoted to the examination of the Vansittart shoals lying to the eastward of I linders and Barren Islands-a vory diflicult piece of work, in consequence of the heavy swell and almost constant break. Iortuoately, a long con tinuunce of westerly weather, unfavourable for general work, was moat favourable for this, and it was quickly finished. The ex animation proved tbe easterly termination of the shoals aa Bbown on the present Ad- miralty cbait to be in ita correct position, and not (us reported by various coasters) to extend one or two milea further to the east- ward No new dangers were discovered but a careful re examination at favourable times of the rocka fermorly discovered proved that there waa lesa water upon moat of them than was loportid. Before leaving Banks Strait a large mark waa built on Hummock Island, and a mee clear day for observations being obtained, this morl, waa observed from the lighthouse at Kent'a Gtoup and the light lionso being already connected with Wilson's Promontory will make) it easy to extend the triangulation of the Victorian geodetic Burvey to Tasmnnia. Tracings of the survey of Banks Strait havo been sent to Lagland mail by mail, and it will not be long there io.o bolo.o a >.«-. ohort fif lionlra Srrreit ia is&uod; from the Hydrographie Oflice An automatic signal buoy has been fixed in the South Channel by the Harbour do pnrtment. Tbia new invention, which haa of late obtan ed great favour on the sea board of the United State? is the result of experimenta made by Mr J M Courtenay of Idlewild, near Cornwall on the-Hudson, New Yorl the patentee of the buoy, who seeks through his agents here-Mesare. Lorimer, Konir-, and Co -to introduce the invention to Australian watera. Measures have been taken by which the value of the buoy aa an agent for warning marinera from uangerous spots moy bo accurately estimated. By the death of Mr Ldword Cohen, M L A , which took place on 1 riday last, Victoria haa lost an old colonist and a good citizen. Mr, Cohen was bom in London in the year 1822 Ho emigrated with his parents to New South WoIob in December, ISAS, boing at that time only 11 years of age In 1842 ho carno to Melbourne and joined Mr. B Francis in the business of an auctioneer. The partnership having boen successfully carried on for a number of yoars, both members of the firm retired from business m 18,>;j Mr. Cohen went to Sydney for a short time, and on his return established himself in business as a general merchant. He next joined Messrs. fa H Cohen (bia brotner) and Alex Fraser in the businesa of auctioneers, and the part nership continued up to the end of 1SG3, when the two Mesaia Cohen retired from the firm Mr Cohen waa elected a member of the Melbourne City Corporation m November, 1PG0, and waa m&yor; of Melbourne for the year 18G2 3 He waa made an alderman in 1SC5 and be continued a member of the Cor- poration with that title up to the day of hia death. In 1SG1 Mr Cohen entered the Legis- lative Assembly aa one of the representatives of East Melbourne. With the exception of a brief interval bo Bat for the same important constituency nntil his decease. Mr. Cohen beld oflico as Commissioner of Caatoma in the Macpherson Ministry from September 1869, to April, 1870 He filled the aame office in the Francis Ministry from Jane, lr73, till the retirement of the chief, and he retained his place in that Administration when it was re organised by Mr. Kerferd nntil tho fall of the Ministry in the middle of 1875 Mr Cohen waa a, fluent speaker, and though he never took a commanding position in political life, he had popular manners which made him much liked by all sections of the community He devoted a large share of hie time to charl table and other public institutions He waa treasurer of the Melbourne Hospital for over 20 years, and held many other positions of honour in the community. Early m the year 1874 Mr Cohen waa attacked by a renal com- plaint, which progressed gradually but surely until it caused his death. The death ia announced of Mr. William Skene of Skene, near Hamilton. The de- ceased gentleman for many years represented the Westom Province in the Legislative Council, but retired last year by efUnxion of time, fair Charles Sladen succeeding to the vacant Beat Ono or two suicides are amongst the inci- dents of the month. Mr. David Spankie a well connected gentleman, who has resided in Melbourne for 22 years, waa found dead in his bedroom at the Criterion Hotel with his throat cub Ho was in bad circumstances, and his position canBed severe mental de pression, under the influence of which ne destroyed himself. Aahocking suicide haa taken piare on the railway line botween Rich- mond and Hawthorn. A labourer named David Gladstone deliberately placed hia nock on the rail ob a train approached, and his head was Bevered from bia body. Mining accidents ore happily of less fre- quent occurrence than formerly, owing, pro- bably, to the precautions insisted on by the act recently passed by the Legislature. A sad cBBnally, however, occurred a week ago at Stawell in the No. 1 aharft of the Plea- sant Creek Cross Reef Company. A miner named Georgo CroBS and another man were making preparations foi timbering, when a piece of the mullock about two tona weight foil, nearly covoring Cross, and severing one of his lees almost completely frnm his body, besides breaking tho other. He waa taken to the hospital, where he died from his in j'uries. At a coroner's inquest a verdict of accidental death was returned. Early on the morning of Wednesday last an elderly man named William Paine was found lying in Little Lonadale-sbreet, Mel. bourne, in an insensible condition. Hia skull was fractured, and he died in the hos- pital in the course of the day, without ever having recovered consciousness. From the nature of his injuries the deceased ia be- lieved to have been murdered, and three young men, named Anthony M'Hale, Bernard Delany, and John Cox, are in custody, charged' with being concerned in the crime. A fourth young man is implicated, but he hoa not yet been arrested, A rather extensive fire took place at Clunes on Friday last Moloney'a drapery establish- ment and tailor's shop, and the shop of Smitb, pointer and builder, were completely destroyed, and the promises of Moasrs, Boss, boot and shoe Btoro, and Harris, eoedsma i were gutted. The damage to property is estimated at £6,000. lhe ship Serapuj, which arrived on the ita inst from London, had a Stormy voyage, and loBt two of her lads. Tho accidenta occurred on March 17, in lat. 45deg S , and Ion 791eg E , where one of tho apprentices R Bryson who was loosing the skysaii, waa pitched an deck by the breaking of tho mamtopmast head This mishap waa caußod by the ship giving a sharp and heavy lurch Death was instantaneous. At the Dame time ii. Koon a boy who waa on the royal yard, was pteci pitated into tho Boa and drowned. POLITICAL Parliament haa been prorogued from April 3 to April 20 The dissolution will take place on April 25, and the Premier, Sir James M Culloch, will address his constituent it Warrnambool on the same day The » for the now elections will bo issued > n the 30th April The day of nomination haa been fixed for May D the polling day for May 11> and the roturn of the writs for Moy 13 Under tbe now act all elections rauBt be held on the same day and the utmost time that can elopae between the dissolution of Parliament and the election of the new Assembly ia tiree weekB Parliament will be called to cether on May ??) 1 he Ministry have not yet given an indi cation of the policy they purpose placing be fore the country Candidates in addressing their constituents have been obliged to fall back on a review of the proceedings of last session, and to confine thomaelvea to ex pression of their own views, moro or lesa vague in character, on the political ques tiona of the day such as protection and freo trade revision of taxation, the pro* posed land tax, and constitutional re- form The number of candidates is con tinually on the increase A list prepared by Ile Argus shows that there are at present ¿U candidates of whom 55 arc classified aa Ministerialist» 103 Opposition, 31 Inde- pendent, and 31 c ubtfui. There aro besides ¿¿ probable candidates. Of course, a largo nnmber of these will be weeded out before the nomination day For some districts returning one member only thoro are not lesa than half a dozen candidates proteasing toe same views. Curing tbe month many candidates have add reased the electors, but very few of the speeches have been of more than local interest. Dr Heorn, who bad announced himself as a candidate for St, Kilda, has withdrawn m order to avoid splitting the free trade vote in that constituency, and MeBBrs Murray Smith and G D Carter have been chOBen by the Tree trade League aa the free trade representatives. Dr Hearn has eince been invited to contest Fitzroy m the free trade interest He has been promised cordial support, and a requisition has been prepared, to which about 1000 names have been appended. His chances of success are considered favourable, Mr Cohn Campbell baa complied with a requisition asking him to allow himself to be nominated for Brighton. Sir C Gavan Duffy, in again addressing the electors at Sale, animadverted strongly upon the policy of " stonewalling ' adopted by Mr Berry, Ho denied that there was any party in the country favourable to atone* walling, and proceeded to remark, " I verily believe the issue involved is the issue of success or failure for the public cause. The Opposition effected nothing last aesBion because of the diBguslfelt at the disorder and mockery in Parliament, and the Liberal party will fail next session if it become responsible for their offences ' Mr B O Logblen, who recently resigned tbe position of Crown prosecutor and came forward as a candidate for North Melbourne, bus addressed the electors. He declared himself in favour of protection, a progressive land tax rofoitn of the Upper House, and annual Parliaments bat the chief point in which lie exhibited a ' liberality beyond all other liberal candidates, was in his proposal to try the experiment o£ "granting leases of land to lona fide Bettlers, and aiding them by lociiiB from the public funds because there was no gund m putting a man on lana wit no capital to go on with ' Ihe Minister of Landa (Mr Gillies) in a speech delivered by Lum at a banquet given to Mr S Fraser, M L A, at Murchison, de fended the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees (rom the gross imputations case upon them by Mr Graham Berry, who had charged them with being corrupt, and the Government with having corrupted them Mr Gillies remarked that a charge of such a grave kind, coming from a gentleman occu PS m g the responsible position of leader of the Opposition, was a matter seriously demand ing the consideration of the electors through out the colony. If it had been made in the heat of debate some excuse for it could per haps be urged, bnt on the contrary, it was made in a carefully weighed and studied speech which Mr Berry had made to his constituents. It might also be remembered Mr Berry waa referring at the time to events which bad happened not during lost Besaion, but m tho sesaion before lost During the whole of last aeeBion he had not uttered a Bingle syllable about this alleged corrup. tion, and perhaps they could hardly credit the statement, but it was neverthe- less a fact that Mr. Berry waa invited to dine with the very same Speakor eix weeks before Parliament was prorogued and ac cepted the invitation He waa absolutely the gueBt of the Speaker enjoying his hospitality, a short time before he denounced him to a Geelong audience as being a corrupt Speaker. He considered it to be a most deplorable cir- cumstance that a gentleman occupying Mr Berry s position should make such a charge, or place himself in such a dishonourable position He thought a greater exhibition of meanness had never been made by any honourable man lu this colony The fact that the other leading members of the Oppo- sition who had since addressed their con- stituents bad not alluded to the matter, and disavowed any sympathy with a charge which they knew in their hearts to bo absolutely without foundation, and grossly untrue, was far from creditable to them. It was their duty to stand forward and defend tbe honour of the leader of the House of which they were all members. Mr Casey, M L A, speaking at Echuca on the 11th mat, took advantage of the oppor- tunity to propose u scheme for establishing more satisfactory relations between the colo mea Federation or the establishment of a customs union were regarded by bim as impoBBibilitieB, at loast for the present, and he suggcBted the adoption of a system of ' intercolonial reciprocity," under which articles of the growth and manufacture or produce of each colony would be reciprocally received amongst them alL Ho expressed the hope that the ¿ay was not far distant when legislative effect would be given to these views The members of the late Ministry have continued their " stamping " career through the country. Mr Berry has delivered in- numerable speeches on the Bins of the M Culloch Government and the virtues of "Stonewall" Opposition. Speaking at North Melbourne on the 13th inst. ho claimed that he and his colleagues had elevated politics in this country out of the gutter, and had placed them on a pinnacle. The protective tariff he claimed as the only victory the people had yet won in this colony against monopoly. But for protection the present population would be 60 000 less than it was, and yet the men who had done this-for no gain of their own, but morely to socare the comfort and Srosperity of the bnlk of the people-were enounced aa if they were either idiots or roguea, who endeavoured to trade on the ignorance of the people and inflict upon them on injury and a wrong.

Last Summary took home an account of the defeat of Lilly white's professional team by a Combined Eleven of the cricketers of Victoria and New South Wales. Since then tho re- turn match has been played, and the English- men have recovered their lost laurels. Be- tween the two contesta the professionals visited several inland towna. In the match with twenty-two of Sandhurst, begun on the 10th of March, the scores woro-Sandhurst, 138 and 117 ; All-England Eleven, 98 and C7 with fonr wickets down. The next place visited was Ballarat There the Eleven met eighteen. The scores were-All-England, 159 ; Ballarat, 67 and 73, with four wickets to fail. Then the Eleven went: to Ararat. They got 204, ol which 88 wera credited to Shaw, and the twenty-two only scored 38, and 21, with eight wickets down. In no case, it will bo noticed, waa tho match played on*. The return match with the Combined Eleven was commenced on the Melbourne ground on March 31, and it lasted four days. This time Victoria was represented by five players, viz., Blackham, Hodges, Kelly, Kendall, and Midwinter, and New South Wales by six, viz., Bannerman, D. Gregory, Thompson, Garrett, Murdoch, and Spofforth. The principal change in the Combined Eleven was the substitution of Spofforth (sometimes a successful bowler) for E. Gregory. Murdoch of Sydney played instead of Horan, of Melbourne, and Kelly was chosen in place of BB Cooper. The Australians had first innings. The patch [sic] was in fine order, but the ground somewhat dead from the effects of rain which fell the day before. They got the comparatively small score of 122 runs. Most of the wickets were taken by the fast bowlers Hill and Ulyett. Very good batting was shown by Thompson, Kelly, and Midwinter, the last of whom headed the list with 31, but Bannerman, the player who made 165 (not out) in the first match, was bowled when he had only obtained 10. A poor commencement was made by the English Eleven, for Jupp was bowled by Kendall— a left-handed performer with medium pace and great break—for 0, and Shaw was stumped for 1. The rest of the Eleven succeeded much better on the second day of the play—Easter Monday. By that time the sun had brought the turf into as lively a state as batsmen could wish. The fifth wicket fell for 88, or less than the first five Australians obtained, but the bowling was then pretty nearly crippled. Too much preference was shown by the captain of the Australian team for his comrade, Spofforth, who was not in form, and only helped to set the batsmen. The seventh wicket fell for 196 and the eighth for 255. The last two men gave very little trouble, and the innings closed for 261. Most of the scoring was done by Greenwood (49), Ulyett (52), Emmett (48), and Hill (49), and all showed masterly cricket. Greenwood's score was obtained when the bowlers were fresh, and to his vigorous performance may be attributed the success of those who followed him. The Australian Eleven were at the wickets for four hours and a half on the third day, and an hour on the fourth. A decided improvement was shown by them. The first two men, Gregory and Thompson, stayed in together until they made 88 runs, and they obliged Lillywhite to try five bowlers. Bannerman followed Gregory, and in about 20 minutes scored 30 runs. He drove three successive balls from Hill to the on, along the ground, for 4 each, and hit Lillywhite over the heads of the spectators for 5. There was every promise of as brilliant a performance from him as that which made the first match memorable, but Lillywhite put on the fast bowler (Ulyett), who unfortunately split Bannerman’s finger on the former occasion, and the dangerous batsman was at once got rid of. Ever since the accident in question Bannerman has shown timidity when brought face to face with Ulyett. Though his finger was healed, evidently his nerves were still unbraced. The third wicket fell for 135. The score still ascended, though not so steadily as it had done in the early part of the day. Some splendid batting was shown by Kelly. The innings ultimately closed for 259 runs or but 2 less than the Englishmen got in their first effort. Six bowlers were tried. Lillywhite and Southerton took most of the wickets. Shaw though he bowled with great steadiness throughout the match, did not obtain a single wicket. This was partly ill-luck for one or two catches were missed. Fewer runs were scored off him than off any other bowler, viz. 57 runs off 296 balls, and 16 overs out of 74 were maidens. The English eleven had 121 to make to win, and they were not considered to have a very difficult task before them, but when three wickets—Jupp's, Selby's, and Charlwood's— fell for 9 runs, the prospect suddenly changed. Just at the proper time, however, a useful stand was made by Greenwood and Ulyett. The former retired at 54, and was succeeded by Emmett. The score was then raised to 76, when Emmett gave place to Hill. By Ulyett and Hill the number was brought up to 112, and then Hill won the game with the nominal assistance of Shaw. Really excellent cricket was shown by Ulyett. Runs were got by him with such rapidity that the fieldsmen became careless and dispirited. The bowlers were not judiciously handled by the captain, who, in his anxiety to prevent runs changed them every few overs, and the chance which the Australians had of victory in the beginning completely slipped out of their grasp. The English eleven won by four wickets. The results brought out by the match may be summed up thus. As batsmen, the Australians, in spite of crampedness of style in some of them, were quite as good as the visitors. They did not utilise opportunities for run stealing so successfully as the Englishmen, but in the second match they showed ready inclination to profit by the examples set them in the first. As regarded bowlers, they lacked the services of the best two men in the colonies, one of whom, on account of the manner of his refusal to play in the first match, was not asked to be one of the eleven in the second, and the other, Mr Evans, of New South Wales had good reasons why he could not come to Melbourne. The colonial eleven had less effective bowlers than the Englishmen, but if Shaw had been left out there would not have been much to choose between the two sides. The loss of the match was chiefly due to bad fielding. The colonial players have a great deal to learn, not only in stopping the ball, but in at once picking it up and throwing it in with accurate aim. Some of our men fielded excellently, viz., Kelly (at point) Midwinter, Garrett, and Murdoch, and Blackham, as wicketkeeper, could not be surpassed even by Pooley. The Englishmen were practically without a wicketkeeper, for neither Jupp nor Selby stood up to the stumps when Ulyett bowled, and the latter did not even attempt to take Hill. Pooley got out of the scrape he fell into in New Zealand, but has not yet rejoined his com- rades. Subjoined is the score - AUSTRALIA.

By the last mail, i id Suez, the occurrence of heavy rams waa reported from tho northern anti north western parts ol Now South Wales, from Queensland, and from a great portion of South Australia This colony, Victoria, had also boen partially visited by heavy falls, and it was assumed that the drought from which the country had bo long been Buffering had virtually come to an end. In certain specially favoured dis- tricts there boa boen ram enough to facilitate ploughing, and give a fine start to the graas, but in many parta of Vic- toria, as well as over our northern borders, the moisture baa evaporated, and tho prospect for winter grazing ia de cidedly bad. Even upon and to the south of the Dividing Rango thors is very littlo young graBS and no old. Tbo weather continues Bteadily and unseasonably warm, tho ther- mometer ranging up to SOdeg during the day, the nights, however, are dewy, cool, and agreeable. By this time of year heavy rams should have fallen, and cold weather should occasionally have been experienced, but no such indications have been given of the lapse of time, The gradual shortening of the days alone notifies that the height of sumtuor has past Unless a change occuis at an early date, little grass will be likely to grow until spring, as the ground will have cooled down, and bent as well as moisture is required to force vegetation Ploughing has been pushed forward freely in all the earlier dis tri et b, those in which wheat is the principal crop and owing to prices having ranged rather high during the last few monthB a large breadth of land will be placed nnder that crop. The hop crop is turning out moderately good in quantity in Victoria, and aa the weather has been uno the quality is good. In Tasmania, owing to the drought, the quantity is about one fifth less than last year, when the yield was perhaps a little over average. The weather having suited the RrapeB, 1877 will bo placed in the hat of famona vintages, the quantity will be some- what short, but from all parts of Victoria and from Riverina we have encollent reports of the quality. The arrangements for tin trial shipment of frozen meat from Sydney are nearly completed. According to a Sydney contemporary "all is proceeding well with Mr Mori's grand project, and it is thought that on tbe 1st proz, or at the latest a fort night past that date, 200 to 250 tons of meat will be on board the Northam ready for shipment to England. The machinery is all ready, and the workmen on board the ship are bu«ily employed preparing the mata hold for its reception. Slaughtering has commenced at Lithgow, and the Dixon afreet works will soon have a large quintity of beef stored ready for shipment " GOLD AND THE GOLD TIELDS There is very little ol importance to record in connexion with the mining industry dur- ing the past month A good deal of Interest was attracted some weeks ago to the Stawell quartz mines, many of which havo been Bunk to great depths. The Prince Patrick Com- pany there struck a payable reef at 1100ft, deep, which gave fair promises of belog ex- ceedingly valuable, and several good crush inga were obtained from tho reef, which is likely to be both profitable and of a per- manent character, bat the returns from it bave not been equal to what some persons evidently expected, the shares having fallen during the last week or two from £710a each to about £ö The finding of the stone at such a great depth, coupled with the fact that an- other Stawell company-the Extended Cross Reet Company-had also obtained a much richer stone at a similar depth, and that a new reef was supposed to have been dis- covered in the West Germania Companys claim at Stawell, improved the local proporty generally, but in the absence of fresh an- nouncements of new discoveries in the dis- trict during the last month the value of mining shares has fallen, and business in the market is described as dull There aro, however, many large dalma on Stawoll yielding good returns, and others that are constantly worked in the expecta. tion of reaching some of the reefs supposed to exist in the ground, and it ia most probable that we may shortly hear of new stone being found in some of them equal to that discovered in the Prince Patrick or Extended Cross Reef claim At Sand- hurst-our principal quartz reefing diBtnct mining affairs are in a rather low state, owing principally, to the circumstance that no new finds of moment have boon rocordod in the district for some months past, while the returns from the known aunforous mines are understood to bo declining in a rather serious manner. The official return of gold in the district for tho last month waa 15 717oz 2dwt. lOgr, ngaibst 28 051oz. for the corresponding month of 1S7C which muat be regarded aa a very heavy falling off if the returns could be relied on as correct They are, however, only estimates formed by the mining surveyors from such intelligence as they are ablo to obtain from the banks who buy gold and companies who obtain it, and aa they cannot get information from all compamos their returns can only bo taken for what thoynre worth The difference indeed between the montha of March in this yoar and last is so great oa to lead at once to the belief that a mistake or some serious omissions must have been made in the returns for the last month Some of the large claims in the Ballarat and Creswick districts aro reported to have very good prospects amongst which may be mentioned the Black Horse United and the Egerton quart/ compamos at Egerton, the De Murska and Kingston park alluvial companies at Kingston, and the old Band of Hope and Albion Consols alluvial company at Ballarat Quartz mining is Batu to be making rapid progress in the Elaine and Mount Doran districts, where the reefs, although small aa a rule, aro generally rich. The Talbot Leadet states that "a man named Henry Boll, whilst sinking noor the Briseis Company's ground, Amherst, and close to Gozo s fence turned up a nugget at a depth of 23ft which turned the scales at Eilb, or more properly speaLing, 71b troy 1 here were several other nuggets of a nmaller Bi?e-one weighing lloz and another 3Jo7 Tbis information, but for the reticonce of Bell, would have boon made known throo weeks sgo, about which time the nugget was found " The reports of the mining surveyors and registrara for the quarter ending 31st Decem- ber, 1870, havo been íssuod by tho Aiming department. The yield of gold for the qunrte-r ia estimated from information ob* tamed from gold buyers and others by the mining surveyors and mining registrars aa follows -From alluvium!» 79,274oz.17dwt, frrm quartz reefs, lll3C5oz. 8dw&; total, 228 ClOoz odwt.

Buring the past month the weather haa been exceptionally fine for this season ol the year. April, strictly speaking, is the second month of the Victorian autumn, but up to the present time we bave been enjoying fine Bummer weather. The early momiuga and Evenings after sundown have been, however, Jbeautifully cool and pleasant. The rainfall of February and March sufficed to give a Bpiirig to vegetation, the consequence being that feed ia plentiful throughout the colony. Since the commencement of the year raia has füllen to the extent of G SSin., ns com pored with 0 49m. in 1876, and 8 20in. in 1875. THE VOLUNTEERS ENCAMPMENT AND fefJAM FIGOT. Tor the first time in four years the weather lias been fine enough at Easter to alio iv of the volunteers being placed under canvas land the opportunity was takou advantage of Joy the authorities The land on the banks of Jackson's Creek at Sunbury waa kindly placed at the disposal of the commandant by Mr. W. J. Clarke and the offer waa at once accepted, aa no better ground for a camp or lor manoeuvring a force can bo found in the colony, and it has the additional advantago of being easily accessible by railway, the dis- tance being only 20 miles from Melbourne _he volunteers entored heartily into the project, and out of tue i 000 men constituting the force 2 500 at once engaged to attend tho camp. The local Defence Force, under the command of Captain Stubbs, proceeded to the Bite on the 2Lst of March, in order to make the necessary preparations, such as pitching tents and generally laying out the camp. They had aleo to construct three bridgea acrosa the creek, and m this they were assisted by a few members of the Volunteer Engineers The main biidge waa a suspension one, having a span of 70ft. It was auBtamed by four ¿ha. wiro ropes on either Bide each one having a breaking -tram of 12_ tons, so that it wonld carry a (battery of artillery or a column of infantry Higher up the creek it was arranged to throw across two more bridges, one being a Spar bridge, and the othor a tresaol bridge, tout neither of them half the size of the one first named The bridges were con. Btructed solely by the Volunteer Engineers. Tho men were aleo employed laying down a field telegraph, so that the camp waa placed in direct communication with Melbourne, which proved of great ser- vice during the matimveB The command of the whole force was held by Colonel W. A. D. Anderson, and the men were divided into four brigades, under the command of the following oilicers -Cavalry and Field Artillery Brigade, Lieut, Colonel Lemar elland , 1st Infantry Brigade, Lieut Colonel Hutton, 2nd Infantry Brigade, Lieut Colonel Bull ; 3rd Infantry Brigade, Lieut Colonel Mair. The weather was exceptionally fine throughout the encampment, and the mon appeared to enjoy themselves immensely, not Withstanding that they had four days' hard work, and it was a matter of great regret to all when the camp was broken up on Easter Monday, The average attendance through, out was about 2 575 men and 27 gunB, and taken as a whole, the Sunbury Camp of 1S77 may be considered the most successful yot lield since the inauguration of the Volunteer Bervice in Victoria The first three days ia camp were devoted to steady brigade drill, which proved moat useful to the various corps, aa the one great defect ia the volan teer system is the few opportunities that the men have of drilling in masses Easter Monday, wsb of course, made the abotv day lor the public, and the programme consisted of a sham fight and a march past It was Brrat ged that the latter should take place on the high plateau in the rear of the camp and .consequently it was decided that tbo defend ing force should be compollod to abandon the camp, and relire beforo the advance of the enemy. Colonel Anderson took command of the defending force, only keeping with him Colonel Hutton's brigade, the East Melbourne Jbattery of artillery (0-pounder Armstrong's), und the eavsliy, with their two guns. Tbo remainder of the force formed the attacking party under Lieutenant-Colonel Redo, and consisted of two brigades of infantry and two field batteries of artillery (12-ponnder Arm- strong's and 3 pounder Whitworth's). As Boon aa Colonel Rede got bia men about half s milo clear of the camp he drew tbem up in line of quarter columns, with the battery of 12 pounder guns on his right and the 3-poundeiB on his left, wbile he sent out videttea to feel the ground in front. It should have been said that the line was baited in a valley, and when the scouts re- turned from the creBt of the ridge they reported that thero was cavalry on the plain, Btrongly supported by infantry. Colonel Rede having his men well covered by a thick wool on hie left front, at once threw oat his skir- mishers, sending the grey battalion well to the left, where a squadron of cavalry had been Been, Ab the skirmishers advanced and touched the cavalry outposts the latter fell back on their supports, covered by the Uro from two howitzers attached to them. Lieutenant-Colonel Lemoichand, however, Sent two et Wa 12 pound« gong to t¡_9 front, and their fire soon silenced their opponents, and co-npelled them to fall back on their supports As Boon as tho retrograde movement waa noticed, Lieu tenant Colonel Lemarchand Bent the re mainder of his 12 pounder battery to tho front nt the double, nith the Naval Re servo in support, while tbo akirmishers wero supported by Lieutenant Colonel Mutt's brigade Aa they advanced the defending force fell back gradually Lieutenant Colonel Bull extending bia grey battalion to tbo left, eloBely supported by the St Kilda Artillery with their 3 pounder guns and aa thoy gained good cover on the left they Boon com pelled the cavalry to fall back on their centro The ground hero waa very stony and as it waa up hill it tried the wmd of the men Aa Boon as the creBt of tho hill was pained, tho enemy waB Been to be in stronB force and the two 40 pounder guns which had been placed on the top of Chutea Bluff, opened fired on the 0 pounder guns stationed on Canterbury Spur, while the 12 pounder guns wero advanced on the right, and opened a cross fire which Boon compelled the defenderá to again fall back, especially ae Lieutenant Colonel Mair a dm viB'on " doubled up m the centre, and com menced volley firing which waa opparently mo't destructivo A heavy fire waa kept up for Borne little time until Lieutenant Colonel Lemarchand had time to bring his other battery into action on the left, which soon caused the defenders vo retreat The red tillea, however, made a Bomewhat ob- stinate stand in a wood on the left of the defence line, and the Naval Reserve waa brought up nt the double, and oponed fire Lieutem.nl Colonel Mair a brigade pushed forward m tbe centre, and Boon forced the enemy eut of their position, and made thom retreat towards the creek Another stund tyoa made bchiud a log fence the advancing force being fired upon by the Last Melbourne 0 poundtrs whieh had by this time gained tbe crest of tbe ridge, and so covered the re- treat of their men The cross fire waa Btill kept up from the advancing batteneB, and the defending force was at last compelled to fall back behind tbo creek, and as the evening advanced the engineers fired their mmeB, and were supposed to have de alroy ed the budges in their rear so as to prevent the further advance of the enemy. The action waa then over, and the whole of the men were then taken up the hill side m columna of companies Hia Excel lency the Governor and party having taken up their position at the saluting base, the whole of the force on the ground waa marched past The steadineaa with which the ma- jority of the corps marched was a matter of general comment, and since the termination of the camp His Lxcellency the Governor baa issued a very flattering Reneral order complimenting the men for tho manner in which they performed their manouvres It waB a matter of congratulation to all that the camp of 1877 was not marred by a single accident RÂ.CING A most successful single day meeting was held at Belfast on March 22.

The out door sports of the month have not been important. The match against the All England Eleven haa stopped most of the club cricket, and taken almost all interest out of the little that was left. The M C C finished last Saturday a match with eighteen of St Kilda, for the challenge cup. They de feated the suburban players in one innings, with 20 runs to spare. Cricket may be ex pected to give way in a few weeks time to football, for the days have now become too short, the afternoon light too dull, and the weather too cool for the former pastime Great improvements m all departments of the game may be looked for next season, as the reeult of the visit of the All England Eleven, The teachableness of the colonial ¡do j ers is remarkable A foot race was run on tbo 5th met, on the Melbourno Cricket ground, between Selby, of the All England Lleven, and Hipe, a colo mai lunner, who has met with Bome success at inland sports The distance was 100 yards and the Blakes £50 a side, in addition to a trophy. Hipo was in better trim than his opponent, and won by two yards Time, 10H A second contest between the men waa spoken of, but it fell through.

Mr. Parkes, after experiencing some diffi- culties, succeeded in forming a Ministry, the members of which were sworn in on the'22nd March. The new Government is as follows : -Mr. Parkes, Colonial Secretary and Pre- mier ; Mr. Piddington, Treasurer ; Mr. Win- deyer, Attorney-General ; Mr. Hoskins, Minister of Works; Mr. Driver, Miniater of Landa ; Mr, T. B. Suttor, Minister of Justice; Mr. Samuel, Postmaater-General; Mr. Lloyd,' Minister of Mines. Strong oppooition waa threatened to. the re-election of the new Ministère, but the agitation Bought to ha got up met with no public BUDDort nnd all th» members of the Government were re-elected by their constituents without any serious op- position. Mr. Parkes, in the course of hia speech to the electors of Eaat Sydney, stated that the Government intended to appropriate a large portion of the land revenue towartta immigration; that they would be able to accept tendera for the railway to Albury in three months, and( thus establish rail- way communication with Melbourne, which would be ? moat beneficial to lo both colonies, The Ministry intended to introduce a measure respecting municipal lovernnient, including an increased endow- ment and increased potrera of taxation to iho Sydney corporation. The Government would also introduce a bill to deal with the question of education, the nature of which, however, was not disclosed. It is oleo stated that the Government in- tend, Bhortly after the assembling of Parlia- ment, to oak the necessary authority to complete the Great Western lino beyond Oronge. The Sydney Exhibition was opened on the 10th ¡nar. at noon, by His Excellency tho Governor, without much ceremony. The weather waa fine. The membera of the Government and corporation and principal citizena wero preBenr, The attendance of the public was large, about 15,000 persons vieiting the exhibition during tho day. The exhibition is o great success. The American nnd Canadian courts aro particularly ad- mired, nnd present a most interesting spec- tacle. Victoria not having a soparate court, appeared to havo Bent no contributions, but in various parta of the building Victorian manufacturéis were represented. There is a largo show of wines, principally from Bendigo, ond ol machinery from Melbourne. The Queensland court ia very tastefully ar- ranged, and attracta apodal notice, aa also do ttie cereals, farm produce, and wool from Tasmania. A fine collection of minerals is Bbown by the department of Minea, and by Queensland and Taamania. The fine arts are only moderately reprëaented. Textile fabrics and colonial manufactnrea are very good, and the horticultural and agricultural exhibits ore ottroctive. The wool section ia not considered ob good ob at the last exhibi- tion, but ToBmanio, New Zealand, and Ade- laide show prominently. The funeral of tbe late Archbishop Folding took place on the l!)th ult" and the cortège waa the largest ever Been in Sydney. Toe public offices were closed out of reepect to the memory of the deceoBsd. The hearse was followed by Archbishop Vaughan and other Roman Catbolio clergy, the Governor's car- riage, the Chief Justice and other judges, tbe President of the Council, the Speaker of the Aeaembly and other members of the Legisla- ture, the foreign cousuIb and others. The procession extended for three milos, and along the route to the Fotersham Cemetery crowds assembled. The population of the colony on the 31st December wob 030,000. The receipts from the consolidated revenue for the quarter show a net increase of £406,134 on tbe corresponding poriodof last year, principally derived from the Bale of land. Sergeant Foley and Conatablo Townsend, of Narandera, bave been tried at Yass for the manslaughter of the Rev. William Healey, at the Belmore Inn, Deepwater, on the G'.h August. The circumetaucoa under which the prisoners were charged were peculiar. They were in pursuit cf a criminal, and finding Father Healey in a bedroom at the Belmore Inn, mistook him for their man. They called upon him to buirender, which ha rotUBod to do, and thinking that tbo ollicera-who wore in plain clothes-were buBtirangers he fired upon them. They returned tbe fire, and Father Healey waB killed. The jury acquitted the prisoners. Some horriblo events have occurred during the month. A dreadfal murder waa dis- covered near Wogga Wagga on March 16, the dead body of a man being found in the river with the skull completely Bmaahed in. The suspected murderer, haa sines been arrested. Aman named Newman haa been convicted and sentenced to death for the violation and murder of a respectable young girl named Macgregor, near Dubbo. The prisoner after- wards confessed hia guilt. Mr. James Osborne, of Illawarra, and formerly a mem- ber of the Assembly, committed suicide at the Union Club recently, by blowing hia brains out A man named Allen attempted to murder Mb wife and children at Uiana with a tomahawk, and afterwards cut bit own throat Tho Australian Blondin hos.succeeded in Hie daring feat of crossing the Middle Har- bour, Sydney. The dip of tho rope ¡waa very . great, but the feat ot walking across was suc- cessfully -¡Ci'oicpliBhed. He also sat dowu and lecünedon therope. QUEENSLAND. V The official landing ot the now Governor ol Queensland, Sir Arthur Kennedy, at Bris, bane, took place on tho 11th ¡nat., with groa¡ ceremony. Some delay occurred owing to the health officer's reluctance to grant pratique to the Kale, which had conveyod tho Go- vernor and party from the stearaBhip Bris- bane, by which ho had como from Hong Kong. The liiisbano had had a case of smallpox on board. The health officer boarded the Btearaer Kate, and proceeded to make a personal examination of all on' board. The ladiea objected to this proceeding, and Hia Excellency Sir Arthur Kennedy Btrougly Bnpported their objections, and refused to allow an examination to be made. Dr. Challinor reported by telegram to Brisbane that he could not rocommend pra- tique to the Kate, as he had been preventod dom making what he considered a necessary inspection. A Cabinet meeting was at once held, and a medical board appointed, which, after inquiry, granted pratique. The recep. tion ana procession on tbe landing of the Governor wero the grandest ever seen in Brisbane. 1 In consequence of the delay in the assump- tion of office by Sir Arthur Kennedy, it is probable that Parliament will not meet for the despatch of bueinesB until May 8. Considerable alarm is felt in the northern portion of the colony at the increase of Chinise immigration. The warden at May. town goldfield has telegraphed to the Go- vernment, urging it to take immediate Bteps to check the increasing Chinese immi. gration, as a spell of dry weather would throw hundreds out of employment. The cumber of Chinese on the Palmer diggings at the end of December waa 11,000, whioh number baa Bince been increased by 3,000, wbile there are only 1,500 Europeans. The steamer Galley of Lorne, which has reached Cooktown, baa 050 Chinese on board. The revenue for the quarter shows an in- ciense of £30,000 as compared with the receipts for the corresponding quarter of last year. Foure and Tellerman, cacaped Commnists from New Caledonia, have been sentenced at Gjropie to l8 months' imprisonment for larceny. SOUTH AUSTRALIA. The new Governor of South Australia, Sir W. W. Cairns, arrived at Adelaide on the 24th March, and was sworn in in the Town-hall on the same day. There was a large atten- dance. The corporation presented an address of welcome, and in reply His Excellency said that he should take the deepest intereat in everything connected with the colony. The revenue for the laat quarter amounted to £8G9,893. There is an increase in the CustomB, but a falling off in the Railways. The lana sales are improving. The population of the colony haa increased by 15,000 during the post year, and now stands at 225,077. The wheat statistics of the colony have been published. The total area reaped is 871,057 acres, being 211,892 acres leas than were sown. The total yield amounts to 5,S57,5C9 buehels, being 5 buahela 251b. on tbe area sown, or 0. bushelB 431b. on the area reaped. The highest average is 12 bushels 421b., and the lowest average 2 buBhels 121b. The valuable steam dredge Willunga, which was sunk in Adelaide harbour by the steamer Victorian, baa been successfully flouted. The dredge Bteamod into port with its own engines, which are in good order. The Legislative Council elections have re- sulted in the return of MessrB. Morgan, Crozier, Baker, English, Ingleby, and Hughes. On January 21 Mesara. A. nilla and J. Edney lett Echuca fur a trip down the Murray to Milang, South Australia, which they accomplished in an open boat lift. Gin. in length. This ia the first time that bo long a voyage has been undertaken in this river in Buch a small craft. TASMANIA. The revenue of the colony for last year amounted to £322,284. There was a con- siderable increase in the Customs receipts at Launceston, but a decrease at Hobart Town. The inland revenue shows an increase, but I the land revenue a decrease. It is rumoured that Ministers will be met by a want of confidence motion immediately after the opening of Parliament. The City of Foo-chow, from Sydney, bound to Calcutta, was wrecked on the N.E. of Klirders Island, in Bass's Straits, on 17th March. The crew were taken off the island on Good Friday, and landed safely at Laun- ceston. An inquiry which has been held into tho ocouvro-oo attributoo tbo lunn of lüo veBsel to a strong cunent not mentioned iii the directoiies. The barque Gloucester has arrived at Dun- edin full of Chinese passengers. Turee deaths occurred on the voyage from small pox, and four cases are now on board the vesBol, which is in strict quarantine. NEW ZEALAND. A writ issued by the Court of Queen's Bencb, and received ia the colony by the Californian mail, haa been served by Mesara. Brogden on the Hon. Mr. Ormond for damages arising out of breach of emigration agreement of 1872. The writ namoa all mem- bers of the Fox-Vogel Government of that year whoae namea appear on the records of the day, as Hone, W. Fox, W. Gisborne, Julius Vogel, C.M.G.; D. M'Lean, C.M.G ; J. D. Ormond, W. Reeves, J. Hall, and H. T. Miller. The writ also, for some reason, includes the names of MessrB. Sewell, Dillon Bell, and Waterhouse, but for what cause does not appear. It is rumoured at Dunedin that Sir George Bowen goes to India, and Lord Normanby to Victoria or Sydney. Dr, Pollen, the Native Minister, has had a long and friendly interview with Rewi, the great Uga-timaniopoto chief, and confidential adviser of the King. Nothing very definite waa arrived at, however, but another interview is to take place shortly. It is evident that the Kingites are desirous of establishing friendly relations with the whites, and that Dr. Pollen ia determined to carry out that firm bnt conciliatory policy which Sir Donald M'Lean initiated. Rewi alluded to the re- turn of the Waikato confiscated Ianda, the object dearest to the minds of tho Kingites, but Dr. Pollen emphatically repeated the statements so often made by hie predecessor mc ince tbatthia waa utterly impossible, but that the Government would be prepared to deal liberally with such of the Waikatos as might chooBe to return and settle on such reBervoB as might be found unalienated and available. At the annual meeting of the Chamber of Commorco at Wellington, Mr. G. Hunter, M.Q.R. (chairman), delivered an address, which contained much valuable statistical information. With regard to population, ho said that on the 31st December, 1875, the total population was 375.85G, made up of 213,204 males and 1G2.5G2 femalos. The Blue-book for 1870 when published would show that the population will be over 400,000, showing an increase of some- thing like 25,000. The births for 1875 were 14,438, and in 187G 10,108, while the deaths for these two years were 5,712 and 4,1)04 respectively. Consequently thera wai a large natural increase, as thero were 1,730 more births nnd 808 fewer deaths in 1S70 than in the previous year. In 1875 the im. ports were valued at £8,029,172, while in 1S7G the value was Bet down at £G,901.8S9. Con. Bequently there was a decrease of £1,121.283 in the value of the imports ; but this might to some extent bo accounted for by the fact that the Government had been during the laat 12 months importing a much smaller quantity of railway material and plant than for the preceding years. In 1875 the eiports were £5 828G27; 1870, £5.020 3:¡3, a decrease of £202,294. In 1875, how over, there waB among the exports ono line of 200,000 sovereigns, and thero wero 3G 055 z. of gold less exported last year than in the previous year, the value of this being £139,211. These two items make a consider- able difference. The exact figures or the gold eiport ore on follow :-1875, ,'ij5,322oz , valued at £1 407,770 ; 1870, 318.3G7oz., wlued at £1,2GS,559 ; showing a reduction of 3G,935oz , of the value of £139,211. The exportation of wool in 1875 waa 54,401,5401b., valued at £3,308,155, while that of last year waa 5!i,8D3,4541b, valued at £3,395,810 Thus the increase in the weight was 4,094.27Glb., and the reduction in value £2 339. Ho could not explain the anomaly which thus appeared in the return. A most horrible murder han been com- mitted at Ugatuawahia, in tho Waikato, the victim being a white man and the murderer a Maori The event, however, has no poli- tical significance, and actually took place in the lock up The white man, one of the class known ob Pakeha-Maoris, and a regular loafer, had been committed for vagrancy, and his cell was shared by a Maori named Te Patna, under sentence for petty larceny. The two fell out, and the Maori murdered his fellow-prisoner. The murderer has been committed for trial. The Government Printing-office has just pi in ti d a duty stamp, which represents £2,134, being the probate duty paid on the will of the late Sir Donald M'Lean, the pro perty devised being estimated at £106,700. The tunnel through the Rimutaka rango has at length been pierced. This remove- ' li *i last great natural obstacle to the completion of the Wellmgton- Mnsterton Une, which will open qua ol vu) most ferlils a,ni extensiva instor.il and agricultuial districts in the North Island. FIJI. The following news has beon received from Fiji relative to the escaped prisoners of the Kai Colo tribe. The 'finns Bays : " The remainder of the eBcaped Kai Colo prisoners, with the exception of two, havo been returned to custody, and the fact that this bas been cflected by the intervention of their friends and townspeople in the moun- tains ia very satisfactory evidence of the thorough Bubjugation of these rebels. We are in possession, from an authentic source, of a detailed account of the escape of these men, the particulars of which are as follow : Some 30 of these prisoners were employed at Tarravaa, in the construction of a road from the interior, under the custody of a corporal of the Royal Engineers, and a guard of 15 native constabulary. Their place of con* finement et night was a bure, rudely constructed by foreign labour, and which contained four unprotected openiugB or doorways. On the night of the 1st of January they were confined in their quarters with a native sentry on duty, when an alarm was raised that the whole of thom had eBcaped through the temporary stockade sur- rounding their prison. The guard was im- mediately turned out nnd Bent in pursuit. In the morning tbe constable returned, bring- ing back one prisoner, and reported hnviug shot six of the lunaways during the pursuit. A party of Engineers, accompanied hy one civilian, then Btaited along their track, towards the mountains, and having found the bodies of those Blain bad them interred, but no trace of the remainder waa discovered. Au inquiry was held subsequently before Mr. Friend, S M, and an officer of the Royal Engineers, the result of which has not been made public Nu blame, however, appears to altach to the corporal in charge, It being evi- dent that the accommodation provided for the incarceration and custody of the pri- soners ut night waa totally inadequate for the purpose. Tbe project to escape must have bten suddenly formed, aa the men had bulli rto been working well, and in ap- parent contentment, and nearly a mile of the road bad been completed during the previous four months. As an instance of the absurdity of the prevalent idea that the subserviency of the lower class of FijianB to their hereditary chiefs is now on the wane, the following in- stance which lately occurred on Vanua Leva may be quoted :-A youthful native having a duty imposed on him which he considered both itksome and repugnant, immediately sought an escape from bia compulsory labour by a deliberate attempt at self destruction. Happily, his suicidal effort did not succeed, but that death Bhould be considered prefer- able to the risk of encountering the dis- pleasure of a chief showed how deeply rooted the idea of serfdom still remains in the native mind. HURRICANE AT THE LACEPEDE ISLANDS, WESTERN AUSTRALIA. On the lGth February last, a hurricane occurred at the Lacepede Islands, Western Australia, which occasioned the wreck of six vieseis and the loaa of six lives. At the time the gale commenced, there were 10 vessels lying at anchor, some loaded, others partly Bo or m ballast. Three of thom-the barque Star of Jamaica, the brig Emily, and the barque Amur-slipped thoir cables and put out to Boa, the mantera of these vessels fearing lest they would part their anchors at low water and got aground, which would undoubtedly have Iod to the sacrifice of many liveB, as the water rises and falls 20(t, Toe storm ,gavo timely warning of its approach. An opportunity was therefore afiorded to the masters of the vessels to do as tho Amur and others did, proceed out to sea and ride out the storm, rather than remain in an open, unpro* tectfd roadstead, The wind eotntnenccd. blowing from the westward, hauled to the eaBt, then to the north east, and back to the north-west, from which quarter it blew the heaviest and occasioned the moot mischief. The barque Cingalese, of Dundee, waa the fiist to slip her cable and to run ashore on the weBtern island ; then followed the Aboyne, of London, laden with 400 tone of guano. Being heavily laden, she did not get bo near the beach aB the other vessels, and immediately after she struck she went to pieces so quickly that it waa impossible to save those who required help. The gptain's wife, Mrs. Swan, and their two children, at the time were in the cabin. Tbe ship's car- penter and the two apprentice boys are also among the lost, So terrific waa the sea, that the effect upon the Aboyne, on her first milking Hoe loose oural ana Douiaers, pro. bubly by the compressed air in the hold being acted upon by the concussion, was to th lu st up her decks, and to cause the guano to rise np fat above her mastheads, and 20 minutes after she had Btrutk not a vestige of ber waa to be seen. Although only 200 yards from one island to the other, it was impossible for the people on shore, or the survivors of tha wrecks, to render any assistance, the boats being broken up or driven out to sea, The other vessels which went ashore at the Lace- pede iBlands, and are totally loBt, are the Albert Victor, of Melbourne, 384 tona ; Helen Malcolm, of Melbourne, 311 tons ; Mary Smitb, of Hartlepool, 150 tone ; the Isabellas, of Newcaatle.'N.S.W,, 2G8 tons; at Beagle Bay, the Bessie, of Rye, 228 tons, is also reported a total wreck. There were 70 men on the ¡Bland belonging to the wrecked veBsels ; these were at the latest advices cn route to Fremantle by the barque Prince Arthur, which weathered tbe gale.

Bangalow, Captiia G. N Hector, with the mails from Europo, India, and China, reached Port Phillip Heads on Saturday, tho 31st ult, when abo waa ordered into quarantine, tho mails, after due fumiga- tion, being forwarded next day to town. The Torrea Straits mail steamer Brisbane arrived at Brisbane on the 2Gth alt., but hav. inrr to go into quarantine, has not been allowed to come forward. The San Francisco mail steamer City of Sydney, owing to having been detained at New Zealand, did not reach Sydnoy with the American mails until Sunday, tbo 8th inst. The Generaal Pel, the Netherlands-India Steam Navigation Company's steamer, the first of those appointed to run under coutraat between Java and the colonies, arrived here on the 30th March. STATE OP TnADE. In the business of the month now aloaed we havo little of special interest to refor'to, the chief feature having been the dalnes» which hac pervaded the market throughout, and which baa given rise to very considerable dissatisfaction. There ia no doubt, however, that much of the want of animation for whioh the preaent month has been characterised has been owing to the Easter holidays, which, occurring in the middle of the mill month, broke in upon the botter part of two weeks, and interfered sadly with business operations since we Iaat wrote, however much thoy appear to have boen enjoyed by pleaBuro Bcekers of all descriptions. In the country districts tbo effect of the late drought is still felt, if that conclusion can fairly bo arrived at in consequence of the want of life and energy which pervades all business ope rations in that direction. Orders have orno forward very slowly; and generally of a trilling character, being aa a rule restricted to actual wants, and though an occa- sional glimpse ia to be had of what the country trudo ought to be, by a sudden but temporary change from dulnesa to ac- tivity, it rarely is allowed to last sufficiently long to raise a feeling of surprise at its equally sudden disappearance, so much is the town'trade dependent on the prosperity of the country districts. It cannot, therefore, be a matter of surprise when we state that transactions during the past month have, aa a rule, been of the moat trifling character; speculation baa been dormant, and buys» generally have appeared as if afraid to pass barely bejond actual requiremen-s. Consi- derable anxiety is stitt exhibited by many of the pastoral tenants owing to the want of sufficient rain to enable them to get through the winter months without being subjected to additional loss, for though, as we were wait- ing last month, we -were in a position to re- port having been blessed with torrents of rain in many parts of the interior, yet this downpour has been bo very partial, it ia now found that there are many important dis- tricts which have had so little aa to make it problematic whether any benefit whatever has been conferred by what has boon re- ceived. Under theso circumstances, there- fore, the desire generally expressed for more rain need not be wondered at, for when the squatting interest is made to suffer, the effect of that misfortune is moro or leas felt throughout the colony in every branch of trade. The healthiness and buoyancy of trade otherwise ia, however, indicated by the fact that not a single insolvency of the slightest importance, either in town or countiy, hau been declared since our last, Money is easy for purposes of trade. Con- fidence is fully supported, and if business transactions are circumscribed, it cannot for a moment be said that that is owing to any wish or attempts on the part of our banking and monetary institutes to limit operations in any way. For some months the markets were kept alive by a considerable excitement in sugar, cornsacks, and kerosene oil, That baa all died away long ago, but the present interval has been marked by the reaction which never fails to succeed a period of over, activity. From this depression kerosene, owing to the new season having just com- menced, was about to emerge. A movemont was initiated in consequence of telegrams being received about 7th April advising that .the market in New York was rising og un, the fail having only been temporary ; about 15,000 cases were taken up to arrive and on the spot, and the quo- tation to trado buyers was about to be raised, when the trade were treated to a Budden surprise by tbe wholly unexpected arrival of the Island City, from Now York, with an entire cargo of this oil, amounting to 14,464 casts. The fact of this vesaol being on the way waa kept bo secret that at first the announcement of her arrival could not be believed, but it was subsequently learnt that sbo hod cleared from New York, for Java, on the 28th of December. This arrival has created some uneasiness, aa many are ready to assert that others are coming forwatd in the same sacro-. manner; that, however, can scarcely be poBaible. The market baa suffered al road, by this visitation, but with more to follow there is no Baying what might happen, As it is, however, with our preaent stock reduced to 33,823 casca in bond to com- mence the season, no great harm could be done, aa the demand now commencing mast be met, the trade being compelled to pur- chase freely for current requirements, having hitherto allowed their stock to ran very low. The wool season being now over, the Balea reported daring the past month have been so unimportant as scarcely to require notice. Dating the past month the Harbour Trust Commiaaion was daly and legally conatitnted. The gentleman intended to form the commission were elected on Friday, the 30th ult,, as appointed by the Harbour Trust Aot, and the first meeting of commissioners forming the board took placa on Wednesday, the 11th iuBt, at which Mr. James Lorimer (Mesera. Lorimer, Rome, and Co.) was appointed chairman. In onr nsual reference to the more im- portant transactions of the month, we on the present occasion meet with very considerable difficulty, in consequence of the entire want of spirit whioh has pervaded trade oper- ation?, and the total absence of any- thing of interest to which prominence can be given. Balk ales and bottled beers have been neglected ; nor have Dandee gooda been in any way noticed, though a transac- tion in gunnies to the extent of 100 balea was reported. Candlea have bad little attention. In cement, we report a considerable advance in Portland, lu fish, wo note a decline in salmon and preserved heninga. In bread Btoffa we report quite a reaction. Wheat, after falling to Us., rose again, and aa we wtite ia saleable at Gi. 9d. Flour in like manner declined, touching £13 10a., but, recovering again, ia now quoted at £14 5s. In feeding grains, oats have been marked by a slight fall, but ara likely to go down still lower when New Zaalaud supplies como forward. Transactions fn hops have been marked by the quittance in one line of 700 balea, being the balance of Shoobridge's ontire crop. Several other small crops have likewise hoon got rid of. In malt we reported the disposal of two linea, amounting to 14,000 bushels, in addition to the ordinary trade demand. Metals have been marked by considerable sales of pig iron, corrugated iron, &c;, In oils we note a movement in kerosene, which led to the disposal of 15,COO cases, when the sudden arrival of the Inland City stopped further operations. Rice has bjen enlivened by the appearance of the Jamoi Ser- vice, Crested Wave, and E. M. Young, with 27,000 bags of Putna. In sugars bust, ness has been quiet. The salea of the Vic- torian Company aggregate 1,000 tons, but in other descriptions littlo has been done. Tea?, though presenting a heavy tono, have boen moderately dealt in, Tobaccoos have bden largely sold, both to arrive and on the spot. In timber, llooring has realised improved rates. Brandies havo been exceedingly de- pressed, and Hennesey's baa b;cn sold as low as 8a. 9d, in quantity. By tho arrival of the mail Btoamor Bangalore on 1st April we are placed in possession of dates from London to lGth February. Our dates from Calcutta reach to 2Sth February, from Colombo to 0th March, from Batavia to 21 h Fobruary, from Singapore to lat March, from Raogoon to 10th February, from Bangkok to 8th Feb- ruary, and from Saieon to 28.h February; frum Hong Kong to 2S;h February, and from Foo-chow to 23rd February.

The export demand has llkowiso been of no gre it account, but notwithstanding, the stocks in bond continue to show a, considerable decrease, a circum- stance which can only be accounted for by the reduced tcale on which shipments from England aro now being made.

Coffee -As we have not ret boen favoured with »ny arrivals of tho new crop, und stocka on hand luro 'hitherto provod sufficiently ampio for all require- ments, nothing of tho slightest interest has beon allowed to transpire. Dealers holding all tho stock have kent tho market pretty 'tell In tholr own hands, and preferring to limit their «alts to morely supplying actual wanta rather than qui«, larso parcels at the con- cession which would be required In such cases, opera tiens havo necessarily been of very littlo account Indeed.

Flour and Crain.-As the last mail was leaving considerable attention waa being dirocted towards the markot for brcadstuffs In consequence of its anomalous poBition, that whilo in no former period had wo evor received Buch quantities by rall from the country districts, rot on no former occasion had the price of wheat and Hour been driven so high as at tho opening cf the present Benson. As tho mail lett a daolino on wheat of 7d. per bushel hnd occurred, and the prlco further dropping to CB , supplies fell off, as may bo :|udgod from tbo tact that while 78.472 bags wheat and 11,179 baga flour wero received in tho four weeks ending 10th March, only 18,003 bags wheat and 0,014 bags flour were delivered In tho four weeks ending 7th April.
