A Danish Settlement. Victoria's Minister of Lands (Mr. Oman) has given his official blessing to the pro- posal that the New Settlers League of Aus- tralia should open a small colony for Dan- ish immigrants in Gippsland. The area is in the neighbourhood of Childers, and is hilly. Mr. J. Lyng, who is leaving Mel- bourne for Denmark, to persuade twenty or more families to migrate to Australia, doubts if more than 50 per cent of the land can be ploughed. He says that it is overrun with rabbits, bracken fern and blackberry bushes. However, it is antici- pated that the new arrivals should be able to carry on dairy farming.
