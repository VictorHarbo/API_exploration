It is announced that the sale of the Chilian war ships has fallen through, as the Argentine declined to corres pondingly reduce its navy. ; [One of the clauses, of the Treaty between Chili and Argentina, which was signed August 12, 1902, and which is Binding for 10 years, is to the effect that both parties ^should renounce the war vessels they had in course of con struction, and .relinquish any fresh artqnlalUgnB. The clause also provides that both Governments should reduce their respective fleets, " to which-end they will continue to treat until they arrive at an agreement which will effect a prudent equilibrium between the said fleets." In the event of any dispute, King Edward was appointed arbitrator^ The Right Hon. H. H. Asquith states that though he does not believe in re taliation, under certain circumstances it is not necessarily antagonistic to freetrade. But retaliation, he adds, is a practice which would be more injur ious to Britain than to the other States concerned. The Hon. H. H. Asquith,. speaking at a Liberal meeting at Newburgh, North-West Fife, said it was useless tti assemble an "Imperial Conference mere ly to haggle out something in the nat ure of a preferential tariff. The only excuse for summoning such a Confer* ence would be the ability to submit a definite proposal, yet the proposal to Impose duties-on food and raw mater ial, was the oply one available. The removal of tjje monstrous artificial restrictions on tl^'lBhportftfciea^f^B^^ adian cattle, and^ike improvements, would do a great j deal more good than all the loud, ambitious talk about Con (erences and Itifrerial preferences. Referring*^ the present Ecclesias jy^ribflMtauty in Scotland, he strongly advised arbitration. A movement has been initiated in Ixindon in favor of a concerted immi gration scheme, and to encourage cot ton growing. It is suggested that the Ci lonies interested, especially Aus tralia, Should grant land and assist passages, and it Is hoped that the Home Government will also pay a part, c therwise-the promoters must co-oper ate with the colonies alone. Several shipping companies and other firms have, promised to heartily assist^ and the Hon. A. Lyttleton re cently expressed his sympathy with the movement. These well devised plans have been supported all round, and the movement is calculated to greatly benefit Northern Australia. BRISBANE, October 12. Mr. Morgan, interviewed in refer ence' to the above cable, said it ap . peared to him that the movement was probably to find employment for the. large number of workless men in cer tain targe cities in England. On the other hand, if it were realty an indus trial movement, with the financial backing and practical support neces sary to command success, Queensland had plenty of available land in the North which she could sell cheaply, or even give away, under certain condi tions, to bona fide and desirable set tlers. He did not see much prospect of success if the suggestion was merely a benevolent one to help the unem ployed, for the unemployed of thfe large cities in England were not people he would look to po make a success of cot ton growing in a tropical country. LONDON, October 10. India regards the proposed Imperial Conference with indifference, the In-, dian Press and Government consider ing thit any alteration of the present fiscal system is undesirable in India's interests.

A Russian cruiser stopped the Brit ish steamer Cariebrook la the JJay of Biscay, but allowed ber to proceed after a short delay. Help has been sent from Singapore to the 2260 Chinese coolies who Were landed at Serai from the stranded steamer Swanley.

The "Times" says +hat although Lord Milner's resignation has not been accepted, it is known he d/asir^B to be relieved, as he Is needing rest.
