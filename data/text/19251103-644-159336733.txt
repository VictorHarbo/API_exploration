Best Value in Motor History GHEVROIiET Eclipses all previous models. The en gine is a very powerful four cylinder valve in head motor with detachable head, which can be detached in ten min utes, and carried to a bench for the benefit of regrinding the valves, this is far easier than reaching over the mudguard to grind valves on side valve engines. There is also a water pump fitted to circulate the water and thus keep the motor cool, there is also an oil pump fitted to circulate the oil. The clutch fitted -on the New Chev. is the single dry disc type, which re quires no oil whatsoever. The beauty of this clutch is that the single plate is so light that immediately you press the clutch pedal in you can draw your gear lever in first, second or top gear, without any noise, whatsoever. There is absolutely no grating, even with a no vice, as this light disc will immediately stop as soon as a gear is started to enter. With this type of clutch you can also drop into second gear on the New Chev. while travelling at a speed of 25 miles an hour. The new differ ential is known as the banjo type. With this type you can fit an axle without removing the differential housing. There is an inspection plate at the back which can be removed and the crownwheel and pinion assembly ad justed without any trouble. The springing on the new Chevrolet is the semi-eliptic type, which is the ? best springing in the world for a motor car. Compare this with any other car sel ling at the Chev. price. I am willing to forfeit £5 to any owner of a 1925 Chevrolet in my ter ritory who breaks a spring in the' first 12 months. I have made arrangements with Mr. J. Grahame, of Gloucester, to give six months free service on all cars sold after this date. Six months dinkum service from a mechanio is better than twelve months real service from an ar^iteur. Try the new Chevrolet be lt i. buying any other car or go to any Consulting Engineer for advice. And i don't be misled by blow-hard agents. STANDARD £208 DE LUXE £215. SPECIAL £245.

By a special process known to D. Mitchell & Co. Ltd., Sydney, an extract of pure coffee is now available in bottles ready for use, and so good are ? the coffees used, and so perfect the process, that you will notice the aroma of freshly roasted good coffee beans when it is made. It is known as ' Mitchell's Blue Ribbon Coffee Essence.' Most good grocers sell ..and recommend it. W torcictBB *!jje%Dk t wd | v/cr Seasons, j — — ? ? ? .,^^4 NOW FOR EXTRA EASY , CASH!
