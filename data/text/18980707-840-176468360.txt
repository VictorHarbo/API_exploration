B.; What tommy-nonsenso; don't you know that the WICKHAM LANDS aro to ho SOLD WITHOUT RESERVE p. . ; a' A. ; Nominally so, I suppose. 33\. ; .-No-; you are wrong again,. THE SALE IS A GENUINE ONE, and 116 ncrcH of Splendid Land aro to bo SOLD WITHOUT RESERVE by order of tho SUPREME COURT. ' . " \ A.; Itthuti8.su, I think I will como with you, but I havo heard that somo of tho land is very flat P B..- Quite truo ; but the Auctioneers, Isles, Love, & Co., havo cut up tho flat parts into LARGE BLOCKS, up to. 11 acres each, and , have promised LARGE OPTIONS with the . other parts. , A.; .Is there any good building land? — B.; Rather; there ib about GO ACRES -of SPLENDID SITES, with grand red soil like the Olaylicld land, and all of the land is above flood, excoDting the river frontages. A.: Well, thaVs nothing ; they aro floodod everywhere. Supposing I wore to buy. an acre or two, what price would I havo to give for it? B. ; Goodness only knows ; land in tlio adjoining Estate, the Wiokham Park, sold m tho Boom ut an avorage of £80 per' allot ment; in Lancaster Gardens at an average of £90 per allotmeut ; and in Sutherland Park at an average of £105 per allotment.

The.Manager of the Company states that thoy. will bp running within six months. A;; When does the "Sale start? '/ B. ; At 2. o'clock sharp ; sb;youhad bottor.. get a free railway ticket from the Auctioneers and catch, the 1.15 SPECIAL TRAIN; or else get a SALE" CAB or SPECIAL -OMNI BUS from the Auction Mart; and then vou can get A COMFORTABLE LtJNCHEdN ON THE GROUND. ,v A. : But there is oho difficulty, old man ; THE TERMS ARE CASH, and I may no! have Buffioicut of tho needful at my command. B.; That contingehcy has been foreseen by the auctioneers, and they have made arrange- ments with one of the oldest and moat popular building sooioties to flhunce for any purchaser who caniind half oush. This building society will udvauco tho. other half of the purchase money; on easy terms, und without expense to the purchaser. They will also give assist ance to build if required. - 'a . y A.; Well, so loug, old man ; oonsider if sot tied. I have been paying rent quite long' enough.
