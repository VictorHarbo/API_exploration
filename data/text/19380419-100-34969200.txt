NAZIS IN DENMARI Shots in. Parliament OFFENDERS ARRESTED Copenhagen April 14. Two shots were fired from the visitors' gallery to-day while Par liament was debating the new im migration law, to which the Danish Nazis are opposed. Erik Wester. gaard, a young Nazi was arrested. It was believed at frst that an at tempt had been made on the life of the Minister for Justice, M. K. K. Steincke, but it appears from later inquiries that the shots were fired, not with the object of harming anyone but to draw attention to Nazi leaflets which Westergaard showered down on members. The leaflets accuse Parliament of cor ruption and misgovernment. Wester'aard was sitting in the gallery with a number of others be lieved to be Nazis. All were arrest ed. No one was injured by the shots.
