The gross amount of the freight and passenger list is, we understand, very heavy, amounting to about £8000. The Arabian will sail at about the same time as the Antelope steamer, and will have an opportunity of testing the powers of great circle sailing against steam.— Argus, December 16.

We shajd now soon know what reliance is to be placed upon toe statements which led to this expedition, and -whether the public may-expect a second Ballaarfit at Macquarie Harbour. Whether they .are successful or not, the volunteers deserve the public approbation for thefr spirit in being the first,. 1 to adventure in the path.— S. T. Moreury.
