Tho chairman'saukthe increase in -the number Of' foreigners* during the first sis months of T914.' was extraordinary, especially ' in respect to Bulgarians' and italians. ' ?'. ' ' *. "J., .

English descent left. According' to Mr. Barnett's' books foreigners bad not been discharged. . ' ;. ., ! Mr. Edwards suggested that the » chairman .. was . assuming something I-which was. not borne out by tho ¡figures given;, he was.-taking Mr.- Barnett's evidence before.that pf tho. mino man- agers, -who stated "that;.they. mado: no distinctions , between: - men, - provided theirwork ; was satisfactory. ,-. ,.. The chairman 'stated - amt' he hqd not said men -of English, descent were : dis-, missed, but ho md say that nil. the foreigners were taken on;-..there, had been a great influx; of foreigners .'to Broken Hill,, and he could not shut his eyes, to tho fact. . ,.->?-. Mr. Edwards stated that it had. been suggested that the Junction North minc employed a lot of- foreigners; he pro^ posed, ..therefore, that Mr. Palmer should go - into tue bos again. to giro evidence that there had been no. .in- crease in the number of foreigners em- ployed in that uduc. Tho chairman: That is just tho kind of evidence wo want. - . A message was scat to Mr. Barnett to attend UIB commission, arid the tak- ing of évidence was -then proceeded with. a: ? : ;;, .:, .. . Andrew Fairweather continued giving evidence. The only foreigners .on'..the South mine - were employed as ,'ore? truckers, oro fillers, and ' luullôckçrj ; they hntV very, few foreigners on thu miuo ; the management very rigidly ad- hered to a rule that foreigners, must have a good understanding of English, sufficient to ensure that thoHiselve»i'or other men were not endangered' /-by their presence. . . ; To Mr. Kerr: They: lind never en ga ired 'foreigners through agencies iii Adelaide. '; . À ; To Mr. Edwards:, They preferred;to employ mea of British blood,'and they "always.gave them the preference'.over foreigners; nt such times as the. pres- ent it waa the foreigners who had to &o;: _ '. _.'?/ '- . . On the matter of night shift witness stated that it was not possible, oven with the present state of tim ore 're- serven, "ta dispense with the. hight;shift saul absorb thé inen'- in " tho ' day and afternoon shifts; it was possible to get as much from a face 50ft.. wide as from a face 100ft. wide; that was tho actual' experience ot "tl». South mine; safetv alone made it'necessary to work .'with only one party .to the face in the major- ity of stopes; mast of th? reserves were in tho bocks,: tho roofs of the present working places. . '. To tho chairman : Ho did not think il. ?wns possible to increase tho .number af 'men iii' the parties;..tho-men-had á great objection to parties larger than 12 in number ; even if the men " con- sented; it would be 'against ;their own interests ; it would-- cause congestion at tho fajce, and congestion meant re- duced output. .. ?. . . ¡ - To Mr.- Edwards r lt was very difficult to get evidence to take proceedings; under the'Mines Protection Act, against tho men responsible for accidents un- derground ; four eases had to be' left i alone because the. evidence could not bo obtained; ia the oue caso that got' to thu courts a conviction was secured ; the total number of men on the books was 1332 ; ? there were parties' of 12 miners and 14-truckers; four miners would work on each shift: in parties i of nine; miners three would work oa j each shift. . . I Sketches and photographs were sub" mitted of the Holman hoist, and ulso of ;a hoist designed at. the South miné, which the witness stated was superior to a'Holman hoist, but was smaller than a winch ; an intelligent mon could learn to work the buist ii uah an hour; such hoists were used both un- derground and on the surface. To Mr. Kerr : He did not think that it tended to any greater safety on the mines for the drivers of hoists and winches to be certificated ; a motor car or motor cycle was. n much more intri- cate piece.of machinery to handle;.the miners were sometimes away, and than tho driver.was ¡die, unless other work wus found fur hun to do ; generally ho ?was incompetent to perform any other. ¿iud ot work on the mine, while if ho was seut home ho ofteu pulled out; it meant that, they had to oithur put up with the ' man's' incompetency or losa his services, or keep him unemployed. Witness explained the bonus system in operation in counectiou with soma of tho.work; tho wage was 10/0 a day, and-anything over the schedule amount of work.which1-the men performed was paid for as bonus; the -men averaged about ; 18/0 a day ; only picked -men were engaged in th'is way, and he did not think tho system could bo generally adopted.- «. - In reply to Mr. Kerr, witness stated, that if he had any suggestions to make to increase the safety of the working conditions; such suggestions would al- ready appear on the report books of the South'r mine, where everything that 1 could bo done was done to ensure sale ?working "conditions; he believed that I the men could take much greater care I individually ; that would be the very ! best means of ensuring greater safety.' ,W.
