VOYAGTC OF THE JUMNA CIR,— The paragraph in The Courier ° Mail recalling the maiden voyage of H.M.S. Jumna in 1886 brought back happy memories to me, but I would like to correct a slight Inac curacy. The vessel took exactly two months, not six weeks on the voyage, I was a passenger and remember that that were English, Scottish, Irish, Ger man, and Danish immigrants, who formed themselves into small colonies on board. I was only a girl at the time, and by a coincidence the vessel I travelled from Cork was named Juno. I then boarded the Jumna at Grave send for Australia, — I am, sir, &c;, (Mrs.) ELLEN SHEEHY.
