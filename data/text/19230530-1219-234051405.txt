W. T. MISSINGHAM. 1 : \ J Mr. W; ; T; . Missinghamy M.L.A., said : | when discussions ensued on- large ques-<! j tions/ they-. might consider " the advis-;j j ability of having a card system; dealing, with every, motion put on .the agenda- paper, which the secretary, could enter, up. ; He was -:tliere 'that day because he - was a primary- producer, and felt; quite at homerinrsueli aifr organisation. He came to? learn something " he did i not know-; before; He found- -that" no body'i of - men were as critical - as -farmers, and lie was glad of the opportunity : of: meeting, them, as / for six or-:- -eight? months- soon he w;ould be working over-? time:-. (Laughter.) He assured them the members for the -' district - were anxioms-to help-them,- and solicited their opinions on. every- question which affect ed them. If they had not behind them sueh a Union as theirs their heads would burst endeavoring to seek in?, formation j but they came .to them - in/ order to obtain . their, opinions on mat ters-affecting the " district, 'Totherwise: ithgy . would never be hble to catch np.v He assua-ed them .he would be -present at tlie next annual re-uniou. (Applause.) TICKS. - Letters' were received 'from C. J. Sanderson, chairman of-rthe JTick Board "of Control, Lismore, -forwarding the re sults of the resolutions of- the - Richmond and Tweed District Councils laid be fore the Tick Board of Control at a meeting held at Lismore. Relative to the Buckendoon-Swan Bay request that stock being " removed across the Rich mond River from jfarm to farm of Bame owner . be exempt from dipping fees, the reply was .that each case woiuild be dealt /with by the Board on its merits. Stockowners should, there fore, on. returning cattle to their farms on the north" side of the. river on which fees had' previously "been paid, " apply n vnrmi /I n-P ouoli fnAo . ivi -ui ivuuu. wi. ouui i:cuo< - the' motio'n from the Efctriek Sbrahcli' that spraying - of- cowsand? springing, heifers . was ' considered "-'effective,' and -that it be" mader optional, for owners to either, dip.-or- spray, and; that two treat ments1 only be recommended, the reply was that as .it was the. declared policy- of the Tick- Board to dip stock-where possible in place of spraying,- the sug gestion could not be entertained. . The Krarara-Duroby Creek (Tweed) branch asked that all travelling and straying stoek in 'the "Tweed area be dipped. The reply to that communication- was that as the Tick Board had neither staff nor authority in the Tweed area to carry out the treatment of "straying stock, .that part of the branch's sug gestion could not . be. carried out, ;but they womild endeavor- to meet sthe .wishes of stock owners as far as pos-. sible with reference to- .travelling itock." FLYING FOXES. « ;;From ;the .Department; of Agriculture -(Mr. E. S. Clayton), 'asking if tliey couldftbe:.? informed. /where a 'Camp1 of flying foxes existed. — - - ; ?. The- district -secretary- stated-' that he. had endeavored -t.o -find.-eiit.- full -nn.rrip.n.. lara, -and v also -Advertised "the' -/matter, without any result. ' . , , / v; Mr. . Lane; complained that the "ori ginal motion came . from the: Lismore branch, and one speaker: said-he could point/ out ' a camp "where ' thousands of foxes congregated/" : vNow the "Depart-; ment wanted -to assist no - information could be given. It showed" the idiocy- of such motions. r ; Oue delegate said if- the Government wanted a camp he could-show them the evidence o£?ohe. . = -> ; THREE /DANISH .IMMIGRANTS; \- From . M;- P.. -Dunlop, - stating > that three.vyoung Danish- immigrants, reoom- mended to the Department of Agricul ture by: the /Danish Consul, had just ar. rivedi in .-Sydney. -- They were- experi-'- enced dairy farmers, and proposed to settle, in- this country ; but before doing so. would like to obtain -a position -on- a good . farm where they could become acquainted with Australian conditions - One was 32- years of age, the" son -of/ a farmer ; another was 27,also the son-, of. av farmer and the other 30 years of ' age, son of a farmer. .. - . RABBITS. . Tlie Casiho branch :of the Graziers ' . Association: of New. South Wales asked- the i further consideration of a- North Coast - corner rabbit board. The crmi- mittee -considered, said the writer, that the 'rabbit invasion would in the near future be a. very serious menace to the Northern Rivers districts, and that' the worii of checking the invasion was suffi- ;ci(Jft ; to warrant the formation of a; -board for that purpose alone.' SPRAYING VERSUS /DIPPING. - Mr. -Sargent referred to the spraying, of cattle,- and said Mr. Sanderson should- notunsist on-farmers having their cattle dipped, if spraying would meet the case; -.and --the speaker eontended it - would. They should- point out to the chairman that-'spraying was quite as effective as dipping. He- moved, "That we again approach the Tick Board of Control .relative to- having milking cows and heifers --sprayed instead of dipping, the same to be optional to the owners." They could treat them at home as well as putting them through the vile con coction which was used. After discussion, it was decided that the deputation to interview the Board consist of the president and Messrs;- MacCartie and Sargent. PRESS PROPAGANDA. ".-Mr.vNardi (Nimbin) moved, "That we are of the opinion that the only- way- -jtou stop i-press propaganda which has so persistently : set out to kill: our butter /'stabilisation- proposals is to try and: have . 'the findings of the stabilisa tion? committee; legalised.'? The mover saidothey 'did not want a Royal Com mission- appointed, as they were aware to-day -the .'country was suffering from over-legislation. - What had been done for >other. industries should also be done for them- to enable them to carry on. :Was,there..,any- industry, asked the mover, that employed father, mother," sons and- daughters to -go to the yards seven, days- in the -week and 365 "clays in-'every y ear. -? ? It: was . inequitable that the costs of- production; should :be grant ed to one indrastry and not to another. They . : were; bound to ? pay the basic wage: to an employee whether he earned it or not. The conditions to-day were serious indeed. - . ; > Mr.- J. T. Ronan seconded the motion; which, was spoken to by Messrs. - Ken nedy, iSargent and Ball, and carried. BUTTER.

The mover" said he woiild .guarantee 2/- . would not. produce' "a lb. of butter, kind, they" were not asking toq much of ;the consumer to pay "what it cost. Queensland stabilised their but; ter at 224/- pef cwt. for /loeal- consump tion ; ;then they Vexported'butter into New South \Vales and -sold, it; under our stabilisation price.- - They, should have some uniformity. If there was no sta bilised price - between -the / States '-it would be impossible to keepv.the specu lator out. He. purchased ? the -surplus and brought Jt in ..to .the' bgst -market; If there was_ n® . co-operation - Among themselves they, .allowed.- the'; speculator" to come - in , and do . as he liked ; with their produce. Thatrcondition of things should come toran end.- - . , M'r. , Nardi seconded? the / motion. : The president- -said.:. it? was no'ra'se' of talking about the matter being a 'State .one.- T. Unless -it was a' Federal one nothing could .-be done.. -It had reached a stage up to 14 days ago that 95 per cent, of tthe. factories in Victoria; had , signified their assent to the stabilisa tion scheme. - Everything- was "being" done to bring > dissentients into line; The /executive at itsMarch meeting ap pointed a committee, consisting of Messi's. Gordon, B»rtlett 'Grant, Watts," Rodgers, and the general president, to co-ordinate with the stabilisation com mittee and make further and deter mined effort, on behalf of the produ cers, to bring to fruition all, or any of; - the objectives . aimed at last ' year, be fore October next. Ninety J>per cent-; of the.- producers believed in a control of the indrastry. ? 2; Mr. ' Lowe, moved, as an' amendment, "That all works after the-; word pro ducer be eliminated from the -motion. ?/-' = Mt.

Mr. Frith said lots of farmers -wanted pigs Nsold. through the yards, but ac cepted 20/1 per head less. Mil '"Doll uoirl if. «f<ie n- ott » : Aim . ouiu iu nag a euw j would never solve. They, would never- get the farmers to take their -pigs to the right place. - :: /- >?Mr. McLean contended men should -be - compelled to brand - pigs and "take their, chances. He. bought five head- of pigs through the . Lismore yards and four of them- were diseased. ' -?-After Messrs.

He was! op posed to signing any bond. ; .Mr.- Tavlor failed to see anv, good in the motion; Any true union man shoulcl. / supply the factory. It was no rase, a man coming there and - preaching ; one? thing. and practising another. He. never disputed weight. They did -not .want; any Government interference.? No man; was a true unionist .who did not sup ply his. own factory. ? Mr. Clark said they had the inter; f erence of the law already in the. 'Dis eased Meat Act, and -many of- thgju were evading -the law in not /.branding : their pigs. 'The Government -was 'spend ing thousands of pounds in -putting-/ down -consraanption, and yet diseased pigs were allowed to be put ; on the Sydney market. -'-/' ?. Mr. Kennedy, said he would? refrain from voting either; way. . No Act - of Parliament should be - brought in com? pelling . people to do anything. \ - Mr. Lowe said branding? was /not.-; going to stop consumption.
