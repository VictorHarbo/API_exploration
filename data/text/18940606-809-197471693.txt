The DEAN of WESTMINSTER'S Verger writes.-" I wns advised to try tho Balsam of Aniseed; 1 did, and have found very great relief. It Is most comforting in allaying irritation and giving strength to tho voice." LIONEL BROLIGII, Esq., the eminent actor, writes: — " I think it an invaluable medicine for members of my Erofessiou. and have always recommended it to my rothcr and sister artists." « Chateau de Montahor, Aveyron, France. The DUO DE MONTAHOR writes:— "From the first dose I felt great relief, tho bad symptoms grew feebler, the irritation of the throat was calming down, and 1 re covered the sleep which had nearly left mo." The unpleasant sensation of tickling in the throat, which deprives so many of rest during the night by tho incessant coughing it causes, is quickly removed by a dose of Powell's Balsam of Aniseed. WARNING.— When Purchasing Powell's Balsam of Aniseed you uro earnestly requested to see that tho "Lion, Net and Mousa" Trado Mark is on the bottle wrapper, and be not persuaded to tnko imitations.
