The Utopia is from London and Plymouth with Government immigrants, and has made a very good passage of 91 days. She took in cargo in London and sailed on October 18, from which time six days elapsed before anchoring in Ply mouth Soundl. Having rcceived her emigrants on board, she sailed on November 6, and crossed the Equator on Decembcr 1, in long. 29* W. On De cember 30 rounded Cape of Good Hope, and passed between the islands or St. Paul's and Amsterdam on January 11 While in sight of St. Paul's the vessel was becalmed for 12 hours, during which time a large school of whales played round the vessel, blowing in all directions ; indeed Captain Stewart asserts that during his long sea service he had never an opportunity of seeing so many monsters of the deep at one time. On February 7 passed Cape Borda Lighthouse at 3 p.m., and hoisted ensign and number in expectation of a reply, but no attention was paid to the signal. On arrival she was boarded by the pilot, who came to anchor outside, and it is doubtful whether or not she will proceed into harbowur during these springs, as she is drawing over 18 feet aft; but it is pro bable some trimming may reduce her to 17. in which case she will moor in harbour during the week. In the meantime, Dr. Duncan having visited the ship, the immigrants are free to land. Caotain Knirston. of the Wilhelmina reports the barque Keliecoi2U miles astern in the Gult. Vessel Expected— The brig Venus. Lesanteur, master, bound from Gottenbiny to Port Adelaide, was in collision on October l'J with a ship or barque about seven miles to the westward of Lluiik'enL'Ss, and carried away her bowsprit, ?lamaguig Ikjws, &c.; She In ouch t up in the Downs, and afterwards drove athwart hawse of the Anemone of Nantes. It is therefore rather a doubtful matter when she will arrive.
