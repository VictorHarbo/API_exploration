WE'LL RECRUIT ANOTHER 100' 'Although they have not all arrived yet, the first arrivals have proved such good workmen and good citizens that it has been decided to recruit another 100.' The Claybrick Manufacturers' Association has lodged a block nomination with the Department of Immigration for the 100 tradesmen. Under the nomination scheme, an employer guarantees the Department of Immigration that the migrant will have a job on arrival. Under the latest Western Australian project, building companies sponsoring the tradesmen will provide partly-furnished flats for the new arrivals until they obtain their own homes. Several of the Scandinavian tradesmen who migrated under the first scheme have moved into their own brick homes at the seaside resort of Rockingham, about 30 miles south of Perth. One of them, Sven Johanssen, 38, from Farsta, Stockholm, has decided that, after six months in Australia, it will be his permanent home. 'I left all my furniture stored in Sweden in case I did not like it here, but I shall never go back', he said. Sven and his wife, Siv. already have a genuine 'Aussie' in the family—a daughter born on December 14—to join their three boys born in Sweden. Danish building industry tradesman Ole Boye Jensen (left), 25, from Fakse, Sjaelland, pauses in his work of building a new house at Rockingham, Western Australia, to share a joke with Mr John Spire, of the Western Australian, Claybrick ManufacturersAssociation. Ole and his attractive wife, Else, are living in a new home on a big residential project being developed at Rockingham. Ole and Else have been in Australia for six months. Other recent arrivals from Sweden, Roland Akberg, 29, and his wife, Marianne, formerly of Malmo, have also found that the climate and the local friendliness are to their liking. 'Building techniques in Australia are a little different from those in Scandinavia, but you soon get used to the new methods,* said Roland.
