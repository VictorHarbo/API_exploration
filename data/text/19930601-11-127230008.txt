EC ministers get tough Illegal immigration targeted COPENHAGEN: European Community ministers meeting in Denmark today will seek to coordi nate policy on combating illegal im migration within the 12-nation bloc, officials said. The meeting comes at a time when EC countries, notably Germa ny where 150,000 refugees have en tered the country since the begin ning of the year, are swamped by hundreds of thousands of requests for asylum from East European countries. Last week, German legislators voted to tighten Europe's most lib eral asylum laws, ignoring angry demonstrations by thousands of protesters who argued that Germa ny had a moral obligation to let in political refugees to atone for its Nazi past. A Danish interior ministry offi cial said the ministers responsible for immigration would concentrate on coordinating immigration policy following the removal of internal border controls "There is a political wish to have a coordinated approach to these questions," he said, declining to comment on the proposals to be discussed for tackling illegal immi gration. The two-day informal session, which adopts recommendations for the member states, combines meet ings of the so called TREVI group of European justice ministers, which deals with intergovernmen tal police cooperation among mem ber states, and of ministers in charge of immigration. The ministers will discuss com mon standards for dealing with people from former Yugoslavia, a progress report on the ratification of the Dublin convention on the right of asylum and a common visa policy. The justice ministers are ex pected to sign an agreement on set ting up the so-called European Drugs Unit, allowing police to ex change information on drugs crime, according to Danish media reports. Stricter immigration controls and moves to expel illegal immi grants was last discussed at an in formal session in Nyborg, Den mark, at the beginning of May. In France, the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches as well as civil rights groups have criticised the new conservative government's efforts to clamp down on immigra tion. An EC diplomat said last week Francc had been putting pressure on other EC states to get an agree ment on checking marriages with third country nationals and the re unions of families to make sure they were not used as a convenient means of obtaining the right to live and work in thp Pnmmunitv \- Router
