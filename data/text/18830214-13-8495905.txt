The present gathering was intended to show the esteem in which Mr MacBam was held by the members, and their desire to recognise the services he had rondered in helping to place the club on its existing footing of prosperity, lhe company numbered nearly 100 Mr Robert Landale, one of tbo new vice presidents, occupied the chair, in the absence of Sir Willium J Clarke, the in- coming president, who waa in Tasmania Mr Macliain b health was drunk with warm cordiality, and the hopo waa expressed on all hands that he would enjoy bia trip to the ola country.

'lins particular difference appeared to be very generally illustrated by all the other teBts made. With the Woods brako the times occupied in stopping and tho distances run after application wero sacrificed to smoothness of motion and the prevention of jerks to passengers In tho Westinghouse trials BmoothnesB and easy retardation were sacrificed to the timeB occupied nnd the dis tanceB run m stoppmR The Westint,b.ouso brake, however, can he applied gradual!), and is so applied in ordinär} uso, on tho other band, the Woods brake muBt bo oithor full on or not on at all If the ques tion were to be decided, the board state, m accordance with the value of the resnltB obtained from the tríala, the Westing- house brake would unquestionably deaerve their recommcndntion, but as engineers of locomotive departments other and more im portant considerations presented thomsolvea to their consideration-auch, for instance, as durability of parts, cost of maintenance, and safely of action The board approached thiB section of the inquiry with "very consider- able reserve, because it must be remembered our actual expenenco with these brakes is very limited, A mueh longer experience would have been necessary to enable ub to pronounce, with fullest confidence, a definite opinion of them , but, ne a substituto for n longer experience of their actual working, wo have the mechanism of the two brakes to guide us in judging na to how each of the abovenamod important features will be in- fluenced ' Having said this the board go on to Btate that looking nt the question as regardB the simplicity of design Btabihty of parts, and structural differences of tho brakes, they are unanimously of opinion that the Woods brake ib, of the two, tho moro suitable for tho Victorian railways, and thoy consider that its action and its reliability miRht be further improved by very Blight modifications in its design and materials, without in any way reducing its sim- plicity Tbe Education Commission has continued its sittings, and has been obtaining a good deal of evidence from those ac- quainted from practical o\perionce with the working of the act Three meetings have been held, and several witnesses examined Mr Robb Cox, an inspector, stated that though formerly opposed to it he waa now in favour of pa}ment by resulta An- other witnesB, Mr. R Philp, condemned the unnecessary multiplication of schools, on which the local boards of advice havo expressed Btrong opinion ProfesBor Elking- ton, now a professor at the Melbourne University, gave evidence, baaed on the ex- perience he gained as an inspector of schools for 10 yeaiB, five of which wore passed undor the jurisdiction of the late Board of Educa tion, and live under tho existing Education department, ile considers that the schools havo become "officialised" under the new system, and is strongly of opinion that they ahould be placed under the supervision of the local municipal bodies, and a local rato levied for their support. Decentralisation, ho be lioveB, would do away with the Catholic difliculty, which was only kopt alivo for political purposes. The discontinuance of tho periodical conferences of inspectors ho characterised as a national misfortune, which had led to a stagnation of school work, The general committee appointed to super- vise the distribution of the funds contributed for the relief of the eufTorers by tho Creswick mining disaster has mot and considered a scheme fixing the amounts to be awarded to the various families and individuals Sub Bciiptioiie, Kc , in the bank, in the hands of the central committee, and known to be eommp m, were announced to the amount of Hbout £18,000, but the puj menta and scale of allowance« recommended b¡ a sub-committee would require, it was reported, a fund of i2r\C00 'J he pa} ments und allowances re- commended bv it« report were agreed to, with certain modifications, and the sub committee waa asked to sit again and report on the machiner} for administering the fund.

Ministers of the Crown were always responsible-not so members of n board lie concluded by calling on the electors to seriously consider their responsi bihtieB, and to say whether or not they were lo give in their adhesion to the new order of things initiated by the present Government -vi/, peace, progreBB, and prosperity. A motion that Sir Bryan O Loghlon waa a fit and proper person to represent the con- stituency waa carried by a majority, but moat of thoBe present refrained from voting Mit BERRY AT G1 ULONG, Mr Graham Berry, who is seeking re eloc tion at Geelong, addressed the electors there on the ov ening of the Oth inst 1 he meeting waB held m the Mechauica Institute which wns crowded. Mr Berry commenced by a reference to the work which waa done during the liret 10 months of tho 30 montliB of the existence of the late Assemblj lu til it 10 months of his Government 31 billa were passed into law, including the Reform of Council Bill, which . in itself was more thuu sufficient work for one session of Parliament Ula Govern- ment was followed by the present Go- vernment which declared that it would put burning questions aside, forgetting that it waa the preceding Government that had put them aBide by settling the reform queation Comparing the performances of the preaent Government with thoac of their predecessors, he alluded lirst to the Chinese Immigration Lill t bat bill was really the work of the preceding Government the Water Conser- vation Act, the only good bill the Govern- ment had passed, had now to be amended in the direction urged by tbe Opposition As regarded the 1 our Million Loan Bill, the Op- position had urged that it waa not wise to float it before redeeming the other do bentures which were filling due, but the Aaeembly authorised the loan, and the Opposition next adviaed that it should be lloated quickly and at a period which would not interfère with the redemption loan to bo lloated this year That waa aound advice, whether the first or the aecoud portion had been taken, but the liberale were then a defeated party, defeated by not very com menduble means, and it waB tho fashion to try and discredit them as much as possible thelaBt session of Parliament had sot eight montliB, and had only passed one bill worthy of mention-that was the bill to redeem the loan falling duo next,October, the bill aa originally introduced was badly drawn and ridiculously drafted, and tbo t reasurer, achieving a victory over himself, had it re- modelled and divided into three t ho reasona which Sir Boan O Loghlon had given to tho Governor, asking him to dissolve the As fembly, would much more properly have justified His excellency in adviBing Govern- ment to resign in favour of moro capable men Government complained of having been obstructed, but there had never been a Government that was helped bo much to get on with the buBineaa of the country t he fact wob that the Government had not wished to do any business their Railway Bill was a political mensure intended to corrupt the country nnd keep the Government in power. Lven if it was a good bill all the discussion on it had been wasted through the dissolution the Government had beon st)led ft " Government by commission Their 1 ducation Commission had been in eMstenco over n year, and had not made the slightest advance townrda the elucidation of the fcupposed grievances which had led to its nppomtmeut the commission was waBting time, and running the country into expeiiBe until a new I'arluimeut waa elected for three years, and then if there wnB notan alnioBt unanimous defence of the act when the elections were over, it would bo seen what the commission would do then there was the tariff Commission, which had beon sit ting ii long while It might have reported monihe ngo On both thtBO questions it was the Government of the day that ought to be responsible, and they had no right to throw the responsibility on tommiPBiona Referring to^hoAnon float ing of tho loan, he agreed j^&afe; Premier that wo ought to get par 'qJBPÇl" Bald it wan ridiculous to Jjigo thtttTtfle loan had not been lloated eari¡rtsfle°aU9e the Treasurer could- ilot got the »Beiiturea ready Going through the heads of the policy which the Liberal caucus had resolved on as their policy, Mr. Berrj said that the first duty would be to defend the Education Act against all and every QBsailant Ee would add, as his own opinion, the neceBBity of superseding the Education Commission, Then the protec- tive polio of the country must be maintained m its integrity, and the rest of the land of tbe colon) should be reserved until a lull inquiry had been made into the best mode of amending the Land Acts There Bhould be a thorough civil service reform, which could beellected on the lines recommended b) the commission which sut in lbeiD. In conclusion, he advocated economy in the public eipeuditure In answer to questions, Mr. Berry ex- pressed himself favourable to embodying in a mail subBidy a condition that tho steaniera should have accommodation for a certain number of paseengerB at a very low faro. A motion aflirinin^ confidence in Mr. Berry waa earned almost unanimously. MR SERVICE 1r~CASTREMAINE. Mr. Service, who has returned from his visit to the old country, has again entered the political arena, and is a candidate for the seat relinquished by Mr. Pearson at Castlemaine Ile addreseed the electors on Wediiesdaj, the 7th insl., in the local Theatre Ro)al, and great interest was manifested in his utterance After dealing with the reasons given for the dissolution of Parliament, Mr Serv ice pointed out that the Premier had submitted no special issue to the country He was consequent!) obliged to give his views on the political situation general)). In referring to the pass- ing of the Reform Bill, ho aptl) described the measure aB a bouse which had been planned b) the constitutionalists and built b) the liberals, and with which, happily, both aides were pleased. There was some foundation for the statement of tho Premier that old 1 urty lines bad been erased. Part) linos m these colonies, where all were liberals, always faded Peace and moderation wero noiv the order of the da). Constitutionalism was recognised, and so liberals could shako hands all round, and turn their attention to the pressing affuirs of tho state. Respecting the loan, he thought it had been very badi) managed indeed IiiBtead of rutting the loan on tho London market at lhe enrheat possible moment, it was allowed to bang over, although the markot was in a moBt favourable condition. When the neighbouring coloniee floated their last loans the market waa exceedingly eajy, and the financial authorities in London pressed upon the Government the necessity of bringing our loBn forward, but Sir Bryan O Loghlen refused to tako that advice, and a delay had occurred which was a great, incomprehensible, and unpardonable error. Sir Bryan was bIbo adviaed and urged to provide for the inscription of the deben- tures, and for the purchasing of them by instalments. ThiB counsel he also stubbornly refused to accept for a long time, and then only yielded after his bungling had brought down the value of our securi lies " I do not blame him, ' Mr, Service (ontinued, "for fixing the minimum at 100, if he had done it at the right time, mid been in a position to put his thumba m his waistcoat, and say, ' Gentlemen of the London market, there are the bonds of our colon) for £100 Give mo £100 for them if )ou please' 'No, we wont' 'All right, l.cntleinen, I can wait until jon are prepared to do it ' |1 hat is the position I would like to see him taking up if possible But be has done all in his power to mako it impossible bv bringing ub face to face with tina loan, which the people in London knowgas well as wo do is a matter of absoluto noces Ht), unless wo mean to repudiate our liabilities (Applause ) It is said that before fixing the minimum, the ImnkB, which wero working with agents whoso interests aro bound up with the colon), Btrongly advised the Premier to reduce the minimum if he vvauted tho loan iloated, and I think it is one of the worst features in connexion with the loan that tbo Premier refused to take that advice, the icsult being the fiasco that we all know of I have no doubt that under ordinary circum- stances these bonds would havo fetched £100, and I would not be Burpnoed to seo thom fetch £100 ) et If they do the colony will get well out of a sad Bcrape, and I hope it will be n Vvaminri tr> nil fill-mo 'l»oaoi»rowi not, le> norrow new money m the face of a bill that is falling duo (Hear, hear )" Under such circumstances, however, ho (Mr. Service) could not have much confidence m leaving 'Ireasury matters to bo dealt with by Sir Bryan O Loghlen (ApplauBe ) Mr Sorvice referred specially to the moderation which political parties in the colony were now showing to each other, and claimed that though he was a constitutionalist he was also a liberal in the true meaning of the term He said :—"The party lines which two or three years ago divided this country, and engendered a very bitter and protracted struggle, were those known as constitutional lines and liberal line, that is to say, consti tutionalism and liberalism were apparently pitched against each other in regular battle array, and for years the whole country was kept in a turmoil, pretty evenly balanced between these parties, over the question of the Reform Bill. I have not changed one political opinion that I held then, and many of you will have a very distinct remembrance of the views that I held on the great leading subjects which were then before the country, and which have not even yet been disposed of. We are all supposed to know that liberalism is disposed to a steady and regular progress towards the elevation of that portion of tho community which is what we now call on a lower level than some of the other portions of the population—it means that we should adopt every means to promote the social elevation of the people, that we should free them from every trammel that has been created by legislation or human endeavour, and that we should, in point of fact, endea- vour to bring about that universal feeling and condition of fraternity which has been dreamed of by all philanthropists in every age. Well, liberalism in that sense is a prin- ciple to which no one has been more firmly attached than myself. What is constitu- tionalism? It does not mean a particular programme or a particular policy—it means the mode or method of carrying out a liberal policy. A man may be a liberal and also be a constitutionalist, he may be conservative and be a constitutionalist, because, while liberalism,here at all events, views ideas from a certain standpoint, and conservativism does the same from another,constitutionalism sim- ply means a determination that in any efforts either to maintain things as they are, or to change for the better, we must guide our- selves in constitutional channels (Applause ) I believe in and respect the liberals of England. Mr. Gladstone-(cheers)—I am glad to hear those cheers at that name. Mr. Gladstone, I say, is one of the greatest men— he is, in fact, the greatest man—England has. (Applause ) I write myself down a liberal of the Gladstone stamp I have sometimes been described as a constitutionalist, and have always accepted that designation. Sometimes I have been described as a conservative, and I have always repudiated tho designation. There is really no conservative party in this colony. (Hear, hear ) Constitutionalists will have a programme in tho future, as they had a programme on the Council reform question, but the word itself does not mean any parti- cular programme. Liberals might have been constitutionalists as well as us at the time of which I speak, and nothing has pleased me so much since I came back as to notice that peace and mode- ration are in the mouth of every man. ' The most vigorous part of Mr Service's speech was, however, that in which he dealt with the question of political patronage. This, he said, was one of the matters which the new Parlia- ment might to deal with promptly. It was like a Upas tree which had taken root in the colony, spreading ita deadly branches over the whole country, and if it was not uprooted we would become as notorious for our cor- ruption as the United States. (Applause ) Ministers fenced in the departments of the state as the landed proprietors in the old times at home did with the people's com- mons. Taking possession of a department as the principal proprietor the Minister erected a log fence, and then said, " You must be quiet now. If your cow wants a little grazing send her in " (Cheers and laughter ) It was intolerable that men when hoisted to power should immediately ap- propriate the public property by using the patronage of the departments to advance their own personal interests. (Applause ) With re- spect, to the Education Act, it had to be maintained in its integrity, and as to the Catholic claims for a separate grant, his answer to them was—"We don't take your money to teach our religion, we decline to give our money to teach yours ' The greatest danger to be feared in connection with tho act was maladministration. Water works should be carried out by the local bodies, but in in any specially heavy works they should be assisted by the Government. Amongst the other topics upon which ho touched was that of the reorganisation of the local forces and of intercolonial federation. He urged as a matter of necessity that an officer of stand- ing and experience was required from home to educate our volunteers in the art of war- fare , and as to federation, he submitted that Canada had set an example which Australia should follow. In conclusion, he counselled tho electors to return a Parlia ment of men who would be workers rather than talkers. A vote of confidence in Mr. Service was earned by an overwhelming majority.

from those north eastern districts of Victoria which lie not too far from the dividing range It haj pens rather unfortunntel} that in tbe cooler districts wheat is not now so generally grown na it waa a few )eara ago Oats and barle) have taken its place in the farm rota tion, partly because the) yield larger crops, and partly on account of there being less local competition in these cereals than in wheat It is said of the north eastern wheat growers that the early settlers arc m a position to hold and wait lora good market, and that this accounts for the absence of the rush of wheat which waa so noticeable at this time last year This is probabl) a correct state meut, for whilst it ia certain that the harvest in that district has been unusually good, it is evident that few are disposed to sell

NEW SOUTH WALES, lhe Treasurer (Mr. Dibbs) delivered his financial statement in the Legislativo As scmbly on the 7th met. He estimated the revenue for 1883 at £G,8I9,200, and the ex- penditure at £G,182fiß4, leaving an estimated eurpluB for the year of £330,(j 15, which, added to the surpluB at the beginning of the year, amounted to £2,182 871 Of this amount, however, the Government proposed to utilise £1,017,300 for services of a special character, leaving an estimated surplus at the close of 1883 of £1,133,571. The policy of the Government on the land question, however, would involve de- creases from auction sales of ¿317,000, improved purchases, ¿bO 000, selections after auction, £379 000, depositB on con- ditional purchases, 121,000, and from conditional purchases, ¿1,000. The income thiiB abandoned was not in any way a loss. It might cause some temporary incon- venience, small, however, in comparison with the permanent embarrassment which was being perpetuated by the rapid alienation of the land He oleo mentioned tha the Government proposed to expend £M)0 000 for tramways, ¿no.000 for immigra tion, and to contribute 1 jj in the £ on the municipal rates as endowment to local bodies.
