HOW CANADA ENCOURAGES IMMIGRATION. We have several times lately re ferred to the bolder scheme ofdmmi- gration initiated by Mr. 'Kidston in his Ro.ckliampton programme, per fected by him when fa London, and of which we urc now Weginriing to feci the benefit. Great as appear the strides made by Australia in gener al. anil Queensland in narticular in 'this direction in recent years,, they arc but as the tottoring., steps of childhood, compared with Canada fa the same connection, and ft is worth while considering Canada's methods if .inly to sec if we' cannot gather flints for improvement, The Canadian . Chief .Superintendent of Emigration in .London is Mr Obed Smith, who took up his present po sition last year from Winncpeg, the great immigration receiving depot ill Canada, the gentleman - iwhose place Mr. Smith took in London im mediately filling his vacant place id Winncpeg. Mr. Smith.is British . born, but has uchieved success in Canada as a -farmer,, he call therefore spealr| with authority from , the points ' of >' view of the emigrant, the imfai grant, I the selector, the well-to-do farmer/ the receiving officer of imfai grants, and the recruiter ot emi grants. Naturally— it ii a. sine qua non fa his position— he fa overflow ing with' zeal and information. Can ada's name is a household worth ' throughout the length and breadth "bf the United Kingdom. In addition to the London head office, there are 10 other Canadian Government offi cers employing pcrmantnt staffs . in the. United Kingdom, and the whole of Great Britain is divided into dis tricts, and each group of districts is controlled by one of these 10 offi cers. Nothing could be more syste matic. Then there is an army of agents who receive £1 ner head for all emigrants, to my nothing of those picked up .iv the Govi'i'ainiut direct, or wno iroveanto i.diq. voluntarily. Canada does pot assist to pav the pussages of her prospective settlors. Emigrants pay their own fare- about Xi I— but the. Government does not bother particularly whether the nuw arrivals have money or not. Work is not guaranteed, but the men fcre kept at Winnepeg until they get it. As many as 2000 immigrants are sometimes living under Government roofs at the one time. The Gi-vtiu- ment has 20 or more halls, and at a time of pressure, supplements them with tents: There is no red tape about Canada's methods. Seven . days is supposed to Ue the maximum free accommodation at the expense of the Government, but this rule is clastic, and special circumstances . modify 'or extend it. Departures from established rule are made to meet cases of 'necessity and therein lies the success of the. Canadian me thods right through. It ts recognised that no two emigrants are alike and; no rigid rule by which all must be treated alike is enforced. "We try to size a man up, says Mr. himin, "and treat him, not according to hide-bound Government routine, but according to his own pemtur :er- sonulity." To sum the whole system np, a broad, "statesmanlike scheme hns been planned, and brainy re sourceful men have been put fn charge of it. Money has been spent Ifreely, but only in certain definite di rections, and every £1 spent has been £1 profitably invested. Now far the results. For the nine months ended March 3', I90<, >9 fewer than 90,008 persons entered Canada and their callings cam- priced — ' Agriculturists 18,191 General laborers ......... 26,807 Mechanics 24,414 Clerks 6,686 Miners ...'. 21878 Female servants y...

An enormous amount of propogfauda work is done, the country, is flooded" with Canadian literature all tending to the one centre. In the nine months- mentined above 2,957,207 pamphlets and booklets were dis tributed, and this output contained tne louowtng:— Gaelic pamphlet, 10,000 copies ; the Canadian West, 100,000 i the Story of Western Canada Crop, 300 000 ; Farm and Ranch Review) 5000 Canadian Year Book, 5000 : Prince Edward Island pamphlet 30,000 ; Immigration Act, 40,000 ; Canada in a Nutshell, 100,000 ; Home-build ing ill Canada 1 15,000 ; Classes Wanted in Canada, 50,000 ; Land Regulations, 50,000 ; Canada Wants Domestic Servants, 50,000 i A Travcrs lc .Canada, 20,000; Eastern!

Copies of various Canadian news papers distributed in the same per-, i'od totalled 218,000. Bearing all the above facts in mind is it any wonder that whereas Australia's name is but Ettic heard in Great Britain; that oi Canada rings throughout tihe length and breadth of the land. Surely w could add a little to the spurt of energy' at present livening .up our Immigration methods, and, taking a-few lessons from Canada, could make the name Australia, just as Much a household word in Great Britain as is the name Canada to day.
