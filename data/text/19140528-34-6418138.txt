IF you are in need of a tonic-as most people are at times nothing will do you so much good as a course of Sanatogen. Whether you are only a little run down, or anaemic, or weakened by illness, or suffering from some definite disorder of nerves, digestion or nutrition there is no doubt that a course of Sanatogen will be of real and lasting benefit " to you. ( Start that course to-day. You won't have to wait long to feel the good of it. Never mind if you are a little sceptical now. Only give Sanatogen a fair trial, and you will soon be convinced, enthusiastic " Sceptical as I was," writes Sir William Bull, M.P., " I am bound to say that Sanatogen performs what it promises to do ; it has a wonderfully restorative effect." " It is only fair to say," writes Sir Alexander Cross, Bart., "that I have been surprised at the results of Sanatogen. They have been just what was predicted-a material increase in vigour and physical fitness." Such statements typical of thousands of others cannot fail to impress even a prejudiced reader. For they were sent voluntarily by shrewd men of the world men of high character and position-not at all the sort of people to be carried away by facile enthusiasms, or to be deceived by illusory sensations of benefit Will you do as they did ' Will you, in fairness to your own health, give Sanatogen a thorough trial ? Send to your Chemist to day for a supply (from 2/6d. per thousand remember, this is not a speculation" but a sound " investment," yielding you as guaranteed dividends a wonderfully restorative effect and a material increase in vigour and physical fitness!" And there is no risk, mind-Sanatogen cannot hurt you in any way, and cannot fail to do you good. Take the first step now-there's no time like the present ! For Men Mr. ARNOLD BENNETT, the leading Novelist and playwright (Author of "The Old Wives'' Tale," "Milestones," etc.), writes: "The tonic effect of Sanatogen on me is simply wonderful." THE BISHOP OF SOUTHAMPTON writes : " It gives me pleasure to bear my testimony to the value of Sanatogen as an invigorating tonic and restorative. It is undoubtedly beneficial." i For Women - A LADY MUIR writes: "Since taking Sanat. v 2 eggs I am really better-a brighter, stronger tone altogether." t Mrs. KENSINGTON, wife of Mr. justice Kensington, Lahore, India, writes: "I and Mr Ken si ing on have tried Sanatogen, and have both found in a wonderful receiver and tonic It is also the best cure for digestive troubles that I have come across." P i ii For Children PUBLIC HEALTH," one of the prominent medical papers, contains an article by a we 1 known doctor, who "-says "I determined to try Sanatogen on a child suffering from really pitiable, debility The change in her condition at the end of a fortnight was truly wonderful Appetite was Improved, diarrhoea had stopped, the cheeks , were rosy, and her weight had increased by 1-lb. losses." * hostesses FREE BOOKLET. < Post this coupon tt will bring you a Free Booklet entitled "How to Live Healthily."

SO Park St., South Melbourne, Vic "My face and neck began to have a blotchy look and about two days after small erup- tions began to form about my neck. A little time after my face was affected in the same way, accompanied by terrible itch- ing. I was kept awake at night with the Irritation and for days I could not wear a collar. After trying about half a dozen other ointments and medicines which did not do me the slightest good, I was advised to give Cuticura Ointment and Cuticura Soap a triaL I decided to try it, and after the first treatment with the Cuticura Oint- ment and Cuticura Soap I felt relieved and in two weeks all traces of the eruptions were gone, and ever since having used the Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment I have never been troubled with the com- plaint." (Signed) W. Laidlaw, July 1912. In the care of baby's skin and hair, Cuticura Soap is the mother's favorite. Not only is it unrivaled in purity and refresh- ' Ing fragrance, but assisted by Cuticura Ointment its gentle emollient properties are Usually sufficient to allay minor irritations, remove redness, roughness and chafing, soothe sensitive conditions, and promote skin and hair health generally. They are also most valuable in the treatment of eczema, rashes and other itching, burning infantile eruptions. Cuticura Soap wears to a water, often outlasting several cakes of ordinary soap and making its use most economical. Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment are sold everywhere.
