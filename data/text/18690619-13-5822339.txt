Sho left Warrnambool on Friday after- noon with a cargo of live stock and produeo, and entered Fort Phillip Hoads about half-past flva o'clock j esterday morning. Sho hod calm olear wca tlior up tho bay until passing Cooko's Point, when It came away thick, and in a very tow minutes the steamer was in thomldfltof a denso fog, and while going at full speed sho grounded in shoal water. Had she struck on the roof which juts out from Battery Point to tho lightship the consequences would have boen disas- trous ; as it is, sho very fortunatoly took the ground just where the mud-punts deposit the sludge and silt dredged from tho Yarra, anti the bottom, w hore sho imbedded herself, Is as soft as could bo deslrod. Im- mediately on its being found that she was on shore a boat was despatched for assistance, and Messrs. Norton, Graham, and Co.'s steam tug Resolute went rff to the spot The Government steamer George Rcnnio aleo went to the Edina, but their efforts to got her off were fruitless, and as the tide, which during the week has boon very low, waa rapidly ebbing, thoy had to dosist. The next resource which presented itself was to lighten her by removing tho cargo and ballast, but up to a late hour in the afternoon no lighter had been taken alongside. A por- tion ot tho cargo, however, had been put on board the stcamtug Hcrculos, and this to some extent eared her. On the tido making la t night tho Resolute again went to tho Edina, and got her safely afloat, and afterwards towod her up to tbo Queen's wharf, whore sho was borthed at half past eight o'clook, The Edina, it is satisfactory to state, has not sustained any damage. On loaming what bad octurrcd, Captain Doran, of the Hvrbour department, and Captain Walters, of the Government tteamer Pharos, togethor with Mr. Tide-surveyor Rose, of tho Customs, promptly put off in their re- spective boats, to render assistance in caso of emer- gency. The passengers were landod in tho morning by tho steamer Resolute. Tub smart clipper ship Cour do Lion, which re cently arrived in port from London, after a very goe i passage, has completed tho disohargo of her inward cargo. The conslgnoes are highly satisfied with th0 condition in which it has been landod, nota paokag" showing speck or stain from soa-water or any otlier cause. The T.S.N. Company's s.a. Southorn Cross, Captain E. Lucas, arrived in the bay about nine o'eloek yostor day morning, from Hobart Tonn. She left at four p m. on tho 16th inst, and had light variable winds and caima during the passage. There was a thick fog ia the bay on her arrival, and not coming across tho Immigration officer's boat, Captain Lucas, approhon slvo of missing tho tide, and having a very large perishable cargo on board, ventured up the river without waiting fur tbo necessary clearance. The G.L.S.N. Company's p s. Murray arrivod from Port Albert at noon yesterday. Captain Patrick re- ports leaving there at five p.m. ; called at Wilson's Promontoiy ; left there at nine p.m. ; entered Port Phillip Heads at eight a m., and arrived at tho Q,neon's Wharf at noon. Passed several vessels bound to tho westward. Tho Murray had very fino weather during the passage, and light winds from the weat. On this trip she Ima brought up a very fine lot of pigs from some placo near Sale. Tim s.B. Blackbird, Captain H. P. Sawoll, loft tho Australian whart yesterday for Sydney and Newcastle N.8.W. The T.S.N. Company's b.b. Tasmania, Captain W. H. .Saunders, left the Queon's wharf yesterday tor Launceston, with passengers and cargo. The Norwegian barque, Alma, from the Billie, having lindert hor cargo of timbor, was towod down the ri\ cr yestorday to an anchorago In the bay. The Blackwall liuor Roxburgh Castle, otter com- pleting the discharge of her inward cargo, and taking in ballast, will clear out for Hong Kong, for which port she will sail on an early date.
