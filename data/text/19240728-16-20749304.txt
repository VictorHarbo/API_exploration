STARTING from a small and in- auspicious settlement of a handful of men and women on the banks of the broad Brisbane River, Queensland-one of the " jewels of the Empire"--to-day is steadilv climb- ing towards the million mark. The latest population figures show that the State at December 31, 1923, had a population of 811,168. Brisbane's popu- lation while figures are not complete, is estimated at 235 000. In 1839 persons resident on the banks of the Brisbane numbered barely 280; in 1856 the popula- tion numbeied little more than 4000. In 1846 the total population of North Brisbane was 299 males and 184 females. The figures for South Brisbane were 207 males and 137 females. December 13, 1848 saw the first shipload of immi- grants from England arrive at what was to be their new home They came in the sailing ship Artemísia, and were fol- lowed by lmmigiants who made the voyage in the ships Fortitude (from which Fortitude Valley obtained its name), Chasely, and Lima. Large num- bers of immigrants also arrived in 1832 in the Maria Soames, Argyle, Meridiau,, and Rajahgopaul, while in the following year, the Parsee, America, and Agricola carried new settlers for QueensIand. In 1846 the total population in Brisbane and on the Darling Downs was fewer than 5000\. 10 years later the populition of Brisbane itself was fewer than 4000. The gradual growth of primary industries was reflected in the immigration returns from year to year, Wool and meat were the staple activities of the colonists of the '60's. In I860 the wool exported repre- sented a value of £444,188 and the meat expoits were valued at £5356. Timber valued at £2442 also was exported, the total exports in that year amounting to £523 177. Sugar did not come into its own until 1870, but when the industry was commenced on a definite scale its pro- gress was meteoric. For example in 1869 there was no export of sugar; in 1870 £41 vvorth was expoited; in 1871, the figures jumped to £16,338; and in 1872 these figures were more than doubled, The great strides made by the sugar industry gave an additional impetus to immigration and by this time came the vanguard of the great influx of Danish, German, and Norwegian colonist, who made most desirable settlers. The large majority of these settlers engaged in the sugar industry, many of then carving out homes for themselves in the rich virgin lands of North Queenslaud. Gold also played a big part in settling Queens- land, and Mount Morgan, Charters Towers. Gympie, and other towns were soon supporting large populations. Al- though temporary relapses were suffered in most cases, particularly that of Gympie, the establishment of the primary indus- tries ensured the continued prosperity of the centres of settlement. Brisbane in 1880, had reached an important stage in its development; it had exceeded the 300,000 mark, and the town was growing correspondingly. Ipswich, of course, was its great competitor during this period. From 1880 onward the State steadily grew in population and importance. The difficulties to be overcome were many, but the resolute spirit of the pioneers of Queensland's development was more than half the battle. The following table, showing the growth of the State's popu- lation, as well as that of its capital city, and the number of immigrants, should prove of interest: Population. 1856 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 1867 1868 1869 1870 1871 1872 1S73 1874 1875 1876 1880 1881 1882 1883 P 4,395 6,051 12,551 15,020 - 31,109 28,056 34,367 45,077 61,640 74,036 87,801 96,201 99,849 107.427 109,897 115,567 125,146 133,553 146,690 163,517 181.288 187.100 203,084 210,510 217,851 215,054 226,968 248,255 287.475 1,815 9,805 13,689 17,009 22,855 6,632 917 13,382 6,701 7,997 9.238 10,335 15,141 20,951 24,809 21,831 22,596 16,139 13.828 13,396 16,223 27,000 40,330 ßltlSBANE IN 1851.

AUSTRALIAN history shows that adventurous men are not long in following in the wake of ex- plorers. First there is the faint bush track made by a few intrepid pioneers; then a better beaten pathway caused by the tramplings of live stock and afterwards a poor roadway, until in- creased population brings about further improvement. Queensland in 1851 had not emerged from the bullock-dray stage of conveyance, and few places in the "back" country appealed on the map. Those old residents of the State who in their youth made long journeys over those rough roads, almost indistinguishable in parts from the surrounding bush, will never forget the severe joltings they re- ceived. Patrick Leslie, who formed the first station, Toolburra, on the Darling Downs in June 1840, made use of bul- locks, and when he travelled 6000 sheep from New South Wales to the station it is known that two bullock teams and drays were included in his equipment although he only had one team of horses. Four years later when 30 stations had been established on the Downs, pack bul- locks were to be seen wending thier way through Cunninghams Gap with supplies from Brisbane for the squatters. Horses too, were indispensable lo the early settlers and played an important part in enabling bold spirits to strike out fur- ther and further westwards over rich un- dulating country and fertile plains. When those men returned with stories of the wonderful fertility of hundreds of miles of others moved westwards. De- spite this, however settlement was a very slow process because of the primi- tive means of communication with Bris- bane. in 1869 the Government made the West popular by means of liberal land legisla- tion but it vvas found that it took firom six tto nine months for wool, conveved primipally by bullock waggons, to reach the coast from the West. many of the teams in those olden days passed along the banks of the"Moonie River to be near water for many miles on the long journey towards the Downs railway. Cobb and Co's coaches played a prominent part in the conveyance of passengers between Ipswich and Brisbane at that period of the State's history, and there were two noted diiveis amongst those employed by the firm. One Known as "Whistling Tom" usually commenced to whistle when he left Ipswich and kept it up almost continually until the coach arrived at Brisbane. The journey occupied about three hours, there being three changes of horses, and each coach as a rule carried from 30 to 35 passengers. River steamers were also popular amongst persons who travelled between Brisbane and Ipswich. In the "50"s of last cen- tury eight steamers were plying between the two towns and old residents will have pleasant memoiies of trips made by them. These steamers were the Experi- ment, Raven, Hawk, Swallow, Balarat, Samson, Breadalbane, and Brisbane. Amongst the steamers prominenly en- gaged in the Brisbane-Ipswich trade from about 1860 till 1876 were the Ipswich, Bris- bane (Captain G. West), Emu, Kate (Captain J Coleman), Settler (Captain E. Mellor), Platypus, and Nowra. There were a number of smaller craft in addi- tion to these vessels. The Kate, because of her association with the Government, was the best known. She was built in England and sailed to Queensland as a three masted steamer. She was taken over by the government for service in the Bay, and was sunk in 1890 in a col- ision with the Berwah, near the Pile Light. The Experiment belonged to Mr. J. C. Pearce, of Helidon station. The saloon passage by her cost only 6/-, and iii l lu ihm fnp was 2/- less. The Ipswich was a double ended steamer with a paddle wheel. The old Settler is per- haps the best remembered of all the river steamers. She was a stern wheeler, with her engines well forward, and was built in South Australia. She did useful ser- vice for many years proir to the 1903 flood. Her remains are said to be lying in the Bulimba reach of the river. The Louisa (John Burke, L.t.d.) is probably the oldest boat in the river trade. Originaly in- tended to carry wood from Ipswich to Brisbane, she was built by Smellie and Co. in 1872. She was owned by Mr. J. Honey man, and passed to Mr. John Burke, sen, and has been engaged in Logan River trade ever since. MISS MARY GRIFFITH Arrived ship Nile 1854 MRS. HENRY J.
