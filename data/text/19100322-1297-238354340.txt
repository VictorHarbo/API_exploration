COTJNX MORNEU IN UEPIjY.I TO HIE EDITOR. . Sir.— Having read . your leader, of . to-uay on- 'titled "Disparaging Australia," I hope you will Allow me soaco for a few 'remarks. . I protest against your statement that I should be tho reason for the Kingdom having warned her people against emigration to Australia. I find this suuemetu. u»vw"» against tho Danish consuls In Australia, who certainly .are men enough to bo ,abl®i Yfthout my help, to tell their Governments, the truth. X protest against your otatoment that all my acUons in tho Immigration queBUon are based oa my desire to keep our people: at hrmna. I have. In your own paper, had an opportunity of stating how, even if Sweden was overcrowded, I Should, with full conviction, warn my people against emigration to AiiBtralla under the pre sent-conditions. 1 I protest against ,-your crltlquo of my recent report! I havo stated before several times that no one In Australia has read this report, which Is supposed to disparage Australia, and that tho Consul for Sweden has newer written such a report, but Buch a little statement does not nnvMit a leading Australian paper from still continuing to criticise tho same. — Yours, etc., March 2L MQRNmt.
