provisions of the bill, but indi catcd that the Government .»ill not object to amendment« in comnnttoo Tor the most part, the Opposition contend that there is no necessity for altering the presont law, which provides fully for the improvement of our licensing system, and for the reduction of the number of hotels AU that is required, thoy say, is that the act should be rigidly admmis tered Ontlieothorhand.thedemaudfor a change is supported by references to the failure of the present act, which cannot bo a success until licensing courts aie differently constituted and stricter super vision provided for An extraordinary phoso of the question is tho largo number of petitions presented to tho House in favour of the bill, with amendments On ono day 103 wore submitted, and alto gother tho number considerably exceeds .00 About 90 per cent are from Wes lej an Mothodisc congregations, approving of the measure, objecting to compensa tion, and demanding a fuller measure of local option

He speaks in favourable terms of the country, and com- pares the climate to that of North Queens- land. The coast land is rich, cedar is abun- dant, and the country is suitable for agricult- tural and pastoral purposes. The natives are good agriculturists and glow sugar cane, bananas, and yams. He found no trace of minerils, and does not believe that they exist unless in the interior, which he did not explore. A large river was discovered and named the Empress Augusta. He thinks that a prosperous colony may be founded. Mr John Douglas has telegraphed to the Colonial Secretary of Queensland some par- ticulars concerning the Australasian Geo- graphical Society's expedition to New Guinea, which he left alll well at the third depot 3O miles up the Fly River, on the morning of the 23rd ult. He says: - "They were in good health and spirits, and I am happy to know they have made a good start, with every prospect of securing satisfactorj results. Having seen the lower portion ot the Fly River and the im- mense body of water it rolls into the Papuan Gulf, I cannot doubt that it is the great high way to the interior of New Guinea. At the point where the river bifurcates a little above Soomioot, it is seven miles wide. Captain Everill's intention, when we left, was to fol- low the first important branch of the Fly coming in from the eastward and from thence to strike north and eastward for the high lamds in the interior. It would have been most hazardous to attempt, in order to enter the Aird River, to cross the Papuan Gulf at this time of the year. The Bonito party are a fine set of follows, and were working well together when we left them.

Oliver seconded, nn amendment to the effect that tile entire questioti of nfiuiagcnient be left m the hnnds of the directors Mr. Vail ex- plained that the motion was neither in- tended to influence the directors nor to cast any reflection upon them. The motion was put without the amendment, and rejected. Tile lifteentli ha!f-)enrly meeting of the Trustees, Executors, and Agency Company was held on the 4th inst ; the chairman of directors, Mr. D. C. M'Arthur, presiding. The report and balance-sheet were presented, and the chairman, in moving their adop- tion, congratulated tliô shareholders upon the satisfactory condition of the company. He said it had had a good dont of opposition to encounter, but the public were now beginning to fully realise its advantages and appreciate it. The amount available for distribution was "7,141 12s. Gd., out of which the directors proposed to poy a dividend for the halt )ear ending 80th June, 1885, at the rata ot 10 per cent, which would absorb £'2,000 ; to pa) a bonus ntthe rate of 5 per ceut-, which would appropriate £1,000, and to carry the balance, £4,144 12a lid., for- ward, lie observed that the directors might, if they had chosen, have recommended a larger div ldend, but they considered it a wiser course to put by a good sum, aa the business was liable to fluctuations, and might not be so prosperous during tho current balf >ear. Tho report nnd balance sheet were then adopted The thirty-fifth general half-yearly mooting of the National Insurance Company of Aus- tralasia was held on the 7tb inst, under the presidency of Mr. Thoa. Moubray. The report stated that the operations of the company during the past half-) ear showed but a small profit on the fire and guarantee business; but this, supplemented by interest on capital and pust savings, enabled the directors to recommend a divi- dend of 4 per cent for the past half-j ear and 3d. per share bonus The rate of premium continued far too low to give an adequate return on the business of lire lnsurance. Slr. G. D. Carter seconded the adoption of the report, which was carried. The twenty-third ordinary general meeting of the shareholders in the Australian De- posit and Mortgage Bank Limited was held on the 7th inst. Mr J. Bultour, M.L.C., pre- sided. The half ) early report stated that tho business of the bank liad continued to expand during the half-, ear, and had resulted in con- siderably augmented prohts. The directors recommended the transfer ot £3,000 from the profit and loss account to the reserve fund, which, with the sum of £2,000 similarly carried ro that fund last February, would make a total of £5,000 added to the reservo fundinl2moiithsoutol the ordinary profits o£ the bank, and would bring up the reserve fund to £25,000. The amount at the credit of profit and loss account, after providing for bad and doubtful debts, was £T0,2bI 9s Od., which the dnectora proposed to appropriate m the following manner .-Div »lend at the rate o£ 8 per cent per uunura, £4,S00 ; transfer to re- serve fund (additional valuation of bank's property), £5,000 ¡ transfer to reserve fund from ordinary profits, £3,000 ; balance carried forward to next hull-year, £3,404 9s 9d The chairman, in mov ing the adoption of the re- port and balance sheet, congratulated the shareholders on the satisfactory position of the bank. The motion w as seconded by Cap- tain Hughes, und unanimously agreed to. A meeting of shareholders of the Union Mortgage and Agency Company of Australia Limited was held on the 7th mst. The secretary read the report oi the directors and the balance sheet for the first nine months ot the companys existence ending June 30. The profit and loss account showed a balance of £30.9-5 Cs. Hil., which the directors recommended should be appro printed as follows, vi? , dividend for the nine months at rate of 10 per cent per annum, £10,773 0a. 7d.; bonus of 2 per cent, £2,151 12s. Id.; transfer to reserve fund account, £15,000, preliminary expenses to be wntteu oil, £1,40153. Od.; balance carried forward, £T,C03 8s 9d. The welcome break-up ot the drought, although not universal, hail yet been so extensive as to introduce avery marked improvement ; and the directors bad great satisfaction m stating that the con- stituents of the company had boen, with very few exceptions, most fortunate m onjoj mj; the advantage of the rainfalls during the lust six or seven months. Indeed, in mun) cases it was reported that a rrloro promising seii-oii had nevièr been experienced, and that the per- centages of increase during the présent lamb- ing, as well as the prospect of an excellent clip, were m the highest degree sutisfactoi). The directors had to report the purchase ot a valuable block of land at the corner of William and Little Collins streets for tho purpose ot erecting thereon suitable offices, and plans were in course of preparation. Besides tim 40,000 shares taken by Messrs James Turner and Son, 80,000 had been already allotted at a premium of 10s., which would increase the reserve lund up to £30,000, and it was intended b) the directors to dispose of 10,000 to 20,000 more shares, should they consider such n course likely to conduce to the company's advantage. With the view of further developing the companys busi- ness, and placing it m n more favourable position for the issue ot its debenture and other purposes, it was contemplated to transfer the domicilo ot the company to 3-ngland. Preliminary Bteps had already been taken with this object It this waa carried out, the existing Arrangements would be maintained for the conduct of the business without interruption, but the head oflico would be in London, anil the board there would be charged with the general adminis- tration of the compnnj's allairs, while tho colonial board in Melbourne would continue (heir practical supervision in Australia. Tor the purpose of carrying out this change of domicile, it would be necessary to have a. share issue m Kngland to such an extent BB might be lound requisite. But before any definite arrangements were completed in this direction, the approval of tho share- holders would be asked. -ho following or- toe general prices current: A-v (Bulk)- ü s. d. _.d, Bass's nuil.7 0 0 _. - Carlisle Company .. ..700- - M'Eivan'sncvv .. _ 7 0 0 _. -.
