Sir,— I have tho honour to -acquaint your Excoilenoy that at U. 15 a, in. on the 12th iustant, while on her passage from New Zealand to the Fiji?, Pylatanrt Island insight, bosring N. 23 E. (true) 37 mUes/IIcr Majtsby's ship under ray command, passed within 850 yards of a reef not luid down in any chart iu our posses sion. .. - 2\. It is about a quarter of a mile in length, from east to west; thore docs not nppear to he more than ono or two fathoms of water on the wcsterL end, at the extremity of -which breakers wero vi&itdc.; It lite in lot. 22 0 oo 15" 8., long. 170 27?- 5.07 W., - and1 being Bituated directly in tho track of voxels bound from Now Zealand to the Windward Islands of tho Fiji group, is very daugorous to the navigation of these seas. 3\. 1 have, further to acquaint you that after dark on tho evening of the 12th iu t<nt, whilst steering N.W. under reduced sail, the loadsman in tho foro chains reported boundings in seven fathoms, followed by two oasts iu six and a half f&tiioms; and six fathoms respectively. Tho 6bip was immediately brought to tho windaad tacked, but uo souudings having af: or wards been ob tained, either with the hnnd lead or the deep soa line, with sixty-three fathoms out, she was brought to her former course. This baok, if it exists, Is eitunted in lat. 21 0 43' S., long. 176 42' W. 4\. On my arrival at Ovalau, I was informed by H.1LM, Consul for the Fijia, that tho natives of the Tonga Islands, who maintain much iutcr- courdo with the Fiji group by means of their largo canoes, aro aware of the existence of many (heals between Tongatsbu end the Ono Islands, b it aro unable to define their position. The only bmk of whiv'b any reliable information could bo prooured was one of soma extent", having twenty- two fathoms water on it, which was discovered in August, 1800, by throo American whalers, cruising in company, and which, by the moan of their observation, lies in 22 43' S., lone. 176 11' W I have, etc., (Signed) f.

' The steamship Royal Shepherd left LaunccB- ton at 2.15 p-m. ou the 29th, aud arrived in Hobson's Bay at 5 p.m. yostsrday. Strong N.W. winds attondod with heavy equnlls, thunder, and lightning, wero experienced throughout the passage The ftbips Sweepstakoi, Golden West, RoFalio, and a ba'rqao were loading at Manilla when tho Ary ScltifFer left ; the Golden West and Rosalie for Sydnoy, and the others for thi port. Tub Ligiitning.— 1 This celebrated Black Ball clipper left Liverpool on tho 12th of Jane. She had light winds to the equator, thereby ctuslog such- delay that tho equator was not crossed until the thirty third day out. This has, howover, boon made up for by her rapid run thenco. She arrived iu Hobson's Bay atone o'clook a.m. veatorday, She brings out close on four hundred passengers, uud the only cas inlty that < ccurred on board was that nf a seaman named David Davis who, on the 30th July, in lat. 49.05 S., ond long. .11.50 - W., fell from tho royal yard overboard, and was drowned. T »e barquo Anne Mplhuish encountered s'vero gates from S. to S.S.W. off C.ipo Howe, during whioh she was hove to for tbirty-six hours. One of the Biackwall ship?, the name of whioh could not bo distinguished, was signalised by tho Atalanta on tlto 17th July, in 4 0 S. and 23 W. The Atalnntn ba9 made an excellent passage of seventy-eight days out, of which she wos, owing to contrary winds encountered in the Channel, thirty-six days to the equator. She brings out 370 Government immigrants, who aro classified as follows: — 26 married couples, 278 single women, 3 men, and 28 children. Thore lmvo been no deaths, aud two births. The cleanliness of the ship reflect! lie highest croriit rn Captain Spratley and Dr. Wilhiins, under whoso supervi sion tho pnsseogeif have como out, and to this may be attributed the excellent health that has prevailed throughout the passage.
