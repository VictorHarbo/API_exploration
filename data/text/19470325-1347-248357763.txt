CALWELL HAS 'HO WISH TO TRAVEL' MELBOURNE, Monday. — A Danish woman journalist said today that Mr. Calwell had told her he had never been abroad and had no wish to go. Mr. Calwell is Minister for Im migration and Information. The journalist, Miss Esther Skouboe, arrived recently to write articles and a book about Australia. She said that when she interviewed Mr. Calwell in Canberra, he had very willingly - and clearly answered all her questions. Miss Skouboe said: "Mr. Calwell's statement that he had . never been abroad and had no desire to go, seemed very strange. "I think it must be awfully diffi cult to be a Minister for Immigration if you have not been abroad. "Mr. Calwell told me Australians liked Scandinavians, but having been here two months, and having talked with Mr. Calwell, I can't help wonder ing how much you like them." Miss Skouboe said she was surprised when a Member of Parliament told her that it was "not necessary" for Austra lia to get intellectual migrants from Europe yet. She added: "But I was not so much surprised when I recollected what I had already observed — a fairly general Australian diffidence towards any mani festation of culture." Miss Skouboe said that Australians welcomed migrants coldly because they ; seemed to think foreigners would get things they wanted exclusively for themselves. "It is to be hoped that the hostility will disappear before it is too late, and ' before large bodies of Scandinavians r and other Europeans decide they no ' longer want to come here."
