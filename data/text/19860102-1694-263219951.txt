‘Brain drain’ at Technion By YA’ACOV FRIEDLER Jerusalem Post Reporter HAIFA. - Israel s computer ruture is moving to the U.S. with a massive brain drain from the Technion’s computer sciences faculty, whose staff are accepting more lucrative posts in American universities and industry. The dean of the faculty, Prof. Azaria Paz, noted in a memorandum to the Universities Grants Commit tee that, during the past two years, 10 senior faculty members had' left for highly paid, senior positions in the U.S. They included an American immigrant who decided to return home after two years at the Techn ion, “because we are unable to pay the minimum needed for decent liv ing.” Another was an Israeli who had studied in the U.S., returned here and then left again. All the emigres had doctorates in computer sciences, Paz told The Jerusalem Post. Half the present faculty of 28 have asked for a year’s leave of absence to •work in the U.S. Their requests have been turned down. Paz stressed that those who left were all of top rank and now hold Rates of exchange December 18,1985 IS U.S. dollar 1483.4 British sterling 2129.4 .

But when no senior faculty member can live on his wages, the situation is intolerable and augurs very badly for our computer and artificial intelligence future, because these experts teach the new genera tion of engineers and scientists,” he said. A senior lecturer was making $500 to $600 net a month, after years of service, “which they are too ashamed even to talk about with colleagues outside,” Paz said. The teacher-student ratio in the computer faculty has reached an “intolerable” level of 1:40 as against 1:10 in the advanced countries, Paz stated. Even with this high ratio, only 100 of the 500 candidates for undergraduate study could be admit ted this year, for lack of lecturers. At least half of the 400 turned away were good enough for admittance. The long-term solution, he said, was to create “awareness that first rate academic staff must be given a decent wage.” But until the country could afford to pay such salaries, he proposed attracting bright young teachers, by offering a large incentive grant, in the $20,000 range to enable them to establish themselves. After three years the grant would be written off. For senior staff, already estab lished, he proposed additional fund ing, of about one-third their present salary, to enable them to carry out research and encourage them to stay on.
