'SCOTTISH' LINE OF SAILING SHIPS CIR,— May I be permitted to supple ment the information given in the 'Answers' column of your issue of April 21 relative to some of the sail ing ships of the 'Scottish' line, so well known in the Queensland trade half a century ago. The barque Scottish Knight, about which inquiry is made by a corre spondent, made several voyages to Queensland between 1876 and 1895, and brought many hundreds of immi grants to this State. Her last out ward trip was concluded early in 1895, when she landed a cargo of salt from Sharpness (Bristol Channel) at Rock hampton. She was wrecked on the Cornish coast on February 11, 1896, .when bound from Tocopilla to Leith with a freight of nitrate of soda. You are quite correct in stating that the Scottish Bard, belonging to the same line, was stranded on the Great Barrier Reef on January 19, 1879. Fortunately for this particular vessel, she was floated off with comparatively little injury. She had sailed from Rockhampton on January 18, bound for London, and three days later she was towed back into Rockhampton, leaking slightly. The Scottish Bard was engaged In the trade between London and Australian ports for an other 14 years, and in 1895 was sold to foreigners. Under the Danish flag, her name having been changed to Thor, she sailed the seas for several years before her career ended. The vessels comprising the 'Scot- tish' line fleet, seven in number, were all specially built for the Queensland immigrant trade, the owners being Mcllwraith, McEacharn, and Co., a London firm having extensive inter ests in this State. They were en gaged chiefly in carrying immigrants from British ports to Queensland ports north of Brisbane. — I am, sir, &c.; Red Hill. A. G. DAVIES. (Other Letters Page 18.)
