WATCH BELOW. A Danish vessel, the Clara Jeb sen, entered the port of Singapore and reported to the immigration authorities that she had 667 pas sengers on board, but a count re vealed that the total was actually 804\. A local journal explains the discrepancy, by stating that '137 stowaways had managed to secrete themselves on board.' We rather like the word 'secrete.' The Clara Jebsen is under 2,000 tons gross, and allowing for 804 pas sengers at the B.O.T. allocation of 36 sq. ft. per passenger and with only 6 ft. headroom between decks, 173,664 cub. ft. out of the ship's 197,400 cub. ft. is accounted for, leaving less than 24,000 cub. ft. for engines, boilers and other working spaces. We would not, like Hamlet, aver that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Such a judgment seems more ap plicable to the conditions under which, apparently, the carriage of deck passengers in the China coast ing trade is conducted.
