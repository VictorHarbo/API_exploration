THE BOLSHEVIK MENACE. The Allied Missions at Budapest, ex cept the French, have been released. The latter are held as hostages. The United States is drafting a new immigration law providing for the re gistration of all aliens now in the Uni- ted States or applying for admission hereafter, making the stay of im migrants probationary on good be haviour. Aliens must show cause why they should be granted admission. News has reached French officials that a large number of Bolshevik agents, well supplied with old Rus sian money, have arrived in Scandi navia, particularly in Norway. Two mystery ships flying the Swedish and Danish flags have been detained at Boulogne. The French military received a wireless message from Stockholm, stating that several Bolshevik agents were aboard. No body was allowed to land. The French are officially satisfied that Germany seems to be in political support of Russia, also in the economic field, there to replace what she had lost in the outside world. M . Pichon states that the total strength of the Allied forces on the Archangel and Siberian fronts is 307,000.
