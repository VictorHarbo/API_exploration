(Signed) WILLIAM CAEY, ? ; ? Mayor. 3PATRIOTIC LEAGUE OF NEW SOUTH WALES. ADDRESS. TO THE ELECTORS OF NEW SOUTH WALES. GENTLEMEN,— Seeing that in the name of Federation reckless sacri fices, uncalled for, irrevocable, and clearly ruinous to this colony, are being urged upon you with a strange fervor, and since it is most important that you should not now commit the colony to these wild schemes by electing delegates who propose them, we have been, nominated as Candidates by the Patriotic League of New South Wales tc give you the opportunity by voting for us of expressing your desire for caution and your disapproval of the sacrifice for the sake 'of sentiment of the solid prosperity of our people. The Federation we could favor must leave to the people of this colony the sole control of their railways, and assets of every kind, and of the debts and future powers of borrowing; also of their fiscal policy, and of their right tp tax themselves. No outside authority should have power to take possession of our Custom Houses or to tav us. For the funds needed by the Federal authorities to carry out the limited duties entrusted tp. them they should have the right to make a levy on a just 'basis upon the several colonies, - for which levy the colonies should then be legally liable. There is no necessity for a Governor-General, and the members of the Federal body should be few in number and unpaid, or should receive a salary much below the proposed £500 a year. We would limit the Federal control to a) Defence, C2) Quarantine, (3) Lighthouses, -4) Patents, (5) Assimi lation of Laws, (6) Control of immigration, (7) Posts. I and Telegraphs. If found desirable, other subjects j could be added later, and we believe that thus the co ! operation of Queensland and Western Australia might without difficulty be secured, and the foundation be laid for a Federation 'which hereafter would embrace the ?whole of the Colonies of the Australian .group. We urge you to speak strongly at this critical moment by voting for us, who are public advocates of prudence, and for such other candidates to the number of five as in your judgment approach most closely to our views.
