Reared in a country in which hay and oats aro always accessible at moderato rates, ho becomes accus- tomed to think that thoy constitute tho only proper food for horses. And ho adhores to thom under variations for cost as compared with other nu- tritious substances, that rondor that kind of food rldloulously oxtravagant. Thus within tho last year or two, wo havo soon oaten hiy, containing llttlo nutriment, selling at forty pounds per ton, whllo flour vory nutritious in comparison has sold at flvo and twenty. Oats havo sold at fifteen shillings por bushol of fort y pounds, whllo whoat of sixty pounds to tho bushel was soiling at about sovon and Bixponco. Tho substitution of raw wheat for oats is objection able, because tlioro is Bomothlng about tho uncooked flour of whoat that has a tondonoy to clog tho Intes- tines of the horso ; and honco dangor arises, and oven fatal results frequently onsuo. Tho Bound economy of supplying food to animals in ncookod state is recig nir-ed by tho best writers upon such subjects ; and in many countries of Europo tho horso Is fod upon bread as at onco tho cheapest, tho most wholosomo, and tho most nourishing food that can bo el rou to him. Ample rosoarch and expotimont havo demon- strated that a proporly-proparod HORSE-BREAD, of which wheat is tho staple Ingrodlont, is in all respects a highly aavantagoous food for horsos,.bolng at onco safo and nutritious, bolng in most s tat 09" of tho marko very economical, and dining tho prcsont stato BO coo nomlcarris to reduoo the prico of horso-foed by nearly one-half. Tho HORSE-BREAD COMPANY suppllos HORSE BREAD.lnlfive-pound loaves, ono loaf to a feed, at tho prlco (till furthor notice) of one shilling per loaf. Fed wl' h throo or four loaves (according to work) por day, and a sufflcloncy of ohoppod straw, or othor cheaD and filling Bubstanco howevor Innutrittous, .that a horso will cat, ho « 111 bo found to maintain a spirit and condition such as cannot bo glvon to him at much less than doublo tho ccst spout on other kinds of feed. Almost all horses tako roadlly to hàrso-broad, and In a short timo quickly profcr it to any other food. Tho instinct of a horso soon tolls him what ho roally wants, and ono that at flrat rofusos chopped straw or suoh food, whon fed upon Horso Brcad for a short time, prosontly understands his own case, nnd,boing provided with ampio nutrirnont In tho broad, readily dovours, to fill up with, what ho would reject under tho uneconomical systom of feodlng hitherto provalont. I In giving Borso-Brond to a horso to which It Is a novolty, it should bo brokon up rather small at first, and perhaps strowod oyor a little bran. Tho horso will soon understand tho food, and therefore llttlo trouble In this matter need bo taken.
