' '' Hake up your mind to-day that you are going- to. give your skin a xeal chance to get well. ? ..Never mind what- caused it — you've probably been like a lot of other people convinced* that the only thing to use was an ointment or salve (some of them ar* very good) but in the majority of cases these' sticky salves simply clog the pores and the condition, primarily remains the same. f ; Go to any other good chemist to-day nnd get an original bottle of Moone's Emerald Oil. 3?he very '? first application : will give you relief; and a few short treatments will thoroughly convince you that by sticking faithfully to it for a short while your skin troubles will be a thing of the past. Don't expect a single bott-Ie to do it all at once, but one bottle we know will show you beyond all question that you have at. last discovered the one and only sure way to restore your skin to perfect health. ? ' Remember that Moone's Emerald Oil is a-clean, powerful penetrating, antisep tic oil that does - not stain or leave_ a greasy residue, 'and tliat * roust giv^ complete satisfaction or your money cheerfully refunded.-— ('Ad\«t.).

Nowadays' it's only necessary to ask the chemist for two drachms of Frozol ice, costing bui a few pence, to end every hard or soft corn, on your feet.' Just a few applications of this' new ether discovery made directly on to a sen sitive, pain-throbbing corn,. should banish all soreness, quickly and . 'shortly; the complete corn. 'lock, stock and barrel,' shrivels up and may be lifted off with the finger nail. ' . This modern method of liberating the feet from corn pests was conceived by a prominent pharmaceutical chemi6t. who asserts that whilst Frozol-Ice is gummy, it dries at once and simply withers up the corn without in the least irritating or in flaming the surrounding healthy flesh. Don't let mother die of lockjaw or blood-poisoning from razoring her corns or callousesi. but clip this article and make her get some Frozol-Ice at your chemist's. — (Advt).

The next time you feel unstrung, ex citable, depressed, or 'have a nervous headache, nervous stomach; or* cannot sleep, take two tablets of genuine Bayer Aspirin any time, preferably about an. hour after meals, or at bedtime..

Fourthly, the VALUE placed by us on all Used Motor Vehicles coming to us for sale is'determined by the general condition of the car; the make and model, based on our long .experience -of. the market's demand. We will only accept Cars for sale where the owneis are prepared to sell at a price that we can CONSCIEN'TIOUSLY ask.of:a Buyer, and one which is equitable to both Vendor and .Purchaser. We will not offer you Used Cars above' their true market value, because we cannot afford to endanger the GOOD- REPUTATION we have already made in Western Australia.
