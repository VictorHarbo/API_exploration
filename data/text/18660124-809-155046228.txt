To tho ELECTORS of CASTLEMAINE. Gentlemen, — At tho urgent request of a large number of tho electors of Castlomaine, I offer myself as a candidate for your Buffragos. I maintain that tho Legislative Assembly, as re presenting the mass of tho people, ought to possess tho entire control of tho country's nuances, and am prepared to support tho Tariff passed by tho late Assembly, although I believe several unimportant items may require to bo modified hereafter. I am in favor of a libnral administration of tho Land Act, 1865, belioving that tbo settlement of a yooman class on the lands will bo conducive to tho permanent prosperity and happiness of the country. I am in favor of tho total abolition of tho export duty on gold, as I consider it to bo a tax on tho labor of tho minor, who, in toiling, very often for a maintenance, has to undergo risks and privations unequalled by my other class of the community. With tho view to a reform of the constitution of tho Legislative Council, I am propared to support any measure, having for its object tho extension of tlio franchise, by reducing tho qualification of both olettors and members, so that that branch of tho Ijcgislature may becomo a fairer representation of tho intolligonco and wealth of tho country than as at present constituted. With regard to tho questions of Protection and Froo Trade, I would decidedly tax such articles as wo aro in a position te produce or manufacture hnre for revenue purposes ; whilst 1 would admit those arti cles of every day consumption, such as sugar and tea, duty free. I beliovo that a moderato amount of protection to industrial ontorprisos would very soon placo us in the position of being exportors instead of importers ; and tho means thereby afforded for constant employment to the laborer would do more for tho country than any system of freo or assisted immigration. I shall ondoavor, so far as tho short time at my disposal before tho day of election will permit, to seo you personally and explain my views moro fully ; and if you do mo the honor of electing mo as ono of your representatives, my best endeavors will bo used to promote the interests of Castlemaino, in an industrial as well as a political point of view. I have tho honor to bo, Faithfully yours, W. G. BAILLIE.

TO tho ELECTORS of EAST MELBOURNE Gentlemen, — Having been soliciteel by a large section of tho electors of East Melbourne to oiler myself as a candidate for its representation in Par liamont, and feeling, as I do, that tho prosont im portant political situation of the country affords mo an opportunity of giving offoct to?convictions which I havo held for many yoars on tho subject of en couraging loeal industries and manufactures, I readily placo my services at tho disposal of tho doctors of tho district. Fourteen years' experience as a manufacturer in Melbourne has producod on my mind tho conviction that only with such a tariff as will afford encourage ment to local manufactures can tho mechanical skill of our operative classes be developed, provision luado for tho proper training and future enjoyment of our youth, native industries established, and the material interests of tho colony permanently so cured. I shall, thoreforo, earnestly support tho fiscal changes contemplated by tho prosent Adminis tration. Tho conduct of tho Ministry in tho dofonco of tho privileges of tho Assembly against tho encroach ments of tho Council has my warmest approval ; and I would, if oloctod, offer them my strenuous advocacy and support in their determination to presorvo to the people, through their representa tives, tho timo-honored right to control the taxa tion of tho country, which is in fact tho only true safeguard of the rights and liborties of tho poople. Without a thorough reform of the Uppor Houso, I foel convinced there can novor bo that accord and good feeling botween tho two Chambers of Legislature, which it is necessary should exist, in order to secure practical and pro groEsivo legislation and a full representation of all interests of tho community in both chambers. I shall thoreforo support tho proposition for reducing tho present oxtravagant qualification for both mem bers and doctors, and also the giving tho Governor power to dissolvo tho Council when any bill shall havo twice passed tho Assembly and been twice rejected by tho Upper Houso. I havo tho honor to remain, Gontlemen, Your obedient servant, 48_06 ? WILLIAM WILLIAMS. milE EAST MELEOURNE ELECTION. MR WILLIAMS AND THE EIGHT HOURS' QUESTION.

Wo heartily trust that tho operatives and other doctors of East Mel boumo will join in placing Mr Williams, on Monday icxt, in such a position on tho poll as will givo him vn opportunity of advancing the manufacturing in terests of tho country.

Gentlemen, — For the third time, I offer myself for ?e-o'.oction as one of your representatives in tho 1 Commons' of Victoria. Tho prosout political feud has Arisen out of an in lisposition on tho part of tho Manchester class of mportors and middlemen's refusal to pay a very ;mall share of taxation. Thoso traders make this :ountry their homo but for a few years, after which hoy tako their departuro for other climes, and vith overflowing pockets, and with coarso jibes ind sarcastic sneers on thoir tongues at iolonial society, they libel our institutions and lofamo our social condition. Thoy also, through ;hoir organiseel subsidies, havo made a cat s iaw of the Council Chamber. They have, by tho :ame means, won tho favor of a portion of tho press ; inel havo immortalised themselves by repeatedly in iulting our most gracious Queen, in tho person of -ur impartial and independent Governor. The aim of this class is to fix tho burthen of tho taxation on other shoulders than their own, to elis :ourago all manufactures, to subvert tho Land Act ; md above all, and worse than all, to rob ,112 of the iiiffrago. Ayo, to rob us of the oternal, uualienable )irth right of all froo men. Think of that, you bank ilerk, you shop assistant, you artisan. You iro to bo disfranchised, together with him vho follows tho plough or wields tho pick — is witness Wilberforco Stephen at Brighton, and dun-ay Smith at Williamstown, tho nominees of his precious cliquo, on the question of tho manhood iull'rage. And remember, my countrymen, wo havo growing up amongst us that detestable class ' shoneon,' who will strivo to got the upper hand, vhich, please God, thoy never will, so long as wo lavo the power of veting, and voting by ballot. On offering myself for ro-eloction last time, I did io independent of all classos ; but when tho time ar ?ived for disoussing the question of protection, I ound the Government were honest in their profes ions. I found that, not only in their valuable Land \\.ct, but in tho revision of tho tariff, they studied ho welfaro of the people. Then it was I supported hem with my heart and soul, and shall continuo to lo so until tho solo and ontiro right of raising nnd pending the rovenuo of this country bo conceded, vithout equivocation or reservation, to tho poople's epresentativos in tho Assembly Chamber. Whon a prudent time shall havo arrived, I will lun for another instalment of protection ; and as soon is possible I hope to have tho pleasure of assisting o shape the Council Chamber, so that it shall bo eally a representative institution. Should 1 bo lonoroel again by j'our re-electing me, I promise to -ring you back that honor unsullied, as I have lithorto done ; and I trust I shall never be found imongst tho rai:ks of a small-minded cliquo of ob tructionists, but that I may ever be in tho van, there tho welfare of the country demands. In conclusion, I beg of you to wipe out of your eyes ho dust which tricksters are using whon they quoto ?ou tho ' Constitution.' For centuries, jurists and )olitioal economists of tho highest order of intellect lavo disagreed, and will continuo to disagree, as to ho construction of a santonco or the philosophy of inancial economy. And if I am not presuming, 1 i-ould say it is for you to do that necessary and ommon sonso act, of helping to build up for all lasses of our populatien employment suitable to heir varied physical developments. 1 am, faithfully yours, 43 03 ?
