SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. Ministers have held several Cabinet sittings during the fortnight for the purpose of considering measures to be submitted to Parliament next session. The text of the agreement between the Government and the associated banks for floating the £2,000,000 redemption loan appears in another column. The banks receive the same commission for floating and redeeming the loan and paying the coupons as under the agreement for the £4,000,000 loan, i.e., Ha. per cent, for floating, 2a. Gd. por cent, for re- deeming, and 103. for paying tho in- terest. A now clauao is insertad, under which the loan may be taken out of tho hands of the banks at any time and en- trusted to soino other agency, upon tho Govornmont paying an additional com- mission of 5s. por cent, on the vvholo amount. Another now provision, which is made an addendum to tho agreement, facilitates tbe payment in London of the molloy, tho banks to purchase drafts on dumand of the Government on London, and to isauo their drafts on London for a Uko sum at tho same toiior. Exchange is not to bo charged uu theso drafts. Tho arraugomont will nominally bring tho money to Melbourne, us required by the Audit Act, but ¡is it will all be required in London, tho transaction will not bo moro than a book-entry.

Western Australia will bo included ; New Zealand and' Queensland are at present averBO to join- ing in the scheme. Were it not that separate services aro maintained betwoeu Europe and Australia by separate i Ionios, tho conference would have had no, difficulty in deciding unanimously in favour of entering the union Now South Willes and Now Zoalaud c.irry on tho San Francisco Eorvico, Queonslmid the Torres Straits and Singapore service, and Victoria tho P. and 0. service, niiî Colombo, Suez, and Brindis!.

Frnm advices received by tb» secretary of the Victorian Commission in connexion with the International Exhibuiou to be held at Calcutta, it appears that the whole of the Australasian colonies, with the exception of Western Australia, will participate in the affair. The Government of New Zealand haa placed a sum of money on the estirantes for the due representation of the products mid manufactures of that colony, and the exhibits will be conveyed to Calcutta in tbo veasel to be engaged by the other colonial. The Tas tvm.tlim nnvnmment hu» voted £1.500. and loft the entire arrangement in the hunda of Mr T C Just, who will air, as the sole commissioner fat that colony A Borapwbut Biaillttr course will, it ib uoderBtood, be adopted by South Australia but Viutonu, New South Waka, bud Queensland ate to bo represented by commiBsion& A volaminouB report from the commis Biouers for Victoria at the bordeaux Kxhibi tiou to Bia Lxcellencj tbe Governor hau been published It shows that % letona occupies the bighedt placo awong all tbo other pitrtiu patini; countries in the analysis of the number of awards ua compared wah the number of exhibits, and indicates the advantages in other respects gained by this colony by the display The Tariff Commission hag finished taku g evidence, and will shortly prepuro its report, winch, it is understood, will he ready for submission to Parliament when unextmeets At the last sittings, a lárice quautity of evi- dence waa given on the duties on (¡rain, mus- tard, oatmeal, Le Most of tbo millers and gram dealers ox&miued; advocated the abolition 01 the dutieB on cereals They Btuted that tho duty on whoat is superfluous, ob the local production has outstripped the home consumption Ab to oats, not only is the Victorian grain inferior to that from New Zealand, both for feeding ourpoaee und for oatmeal, but the Victorian farmers are totally unable to meet the demand, so far us quan- tity is concerned Tho oats duty is having the effect of transferring trade from Mel bourno to Sjdney Millers would be williup; to seo the oatmeal dutv abolished if the duty on oats waa removed altio Jividenco was ?iven by representatives of the cabmen in iivonr of the abolition of the duty on mai«se '1 hey made one rather important point, which was, that however hi|,h mm.:» rises, they cauuot raino the fares, which are fixed by bye lane.

Mr, Coppin, \t.L, A., who originated in the columns of The Argus, under the signature of " Moderation," the present movement to improve the back slums of Melbourne, has taken another practical step towards a much needed reform, by the purchase of an acre of land running through from Lonsdale-straet to Little Bourke-street, on which are a large number of wretched tenements occupied by the dregs of society. Mr. Coppin is having plans prepared for the erection of 40 working men's dwellings, after the models of the "Peabody Improved Industrial Dwellings " for the working classes in London. A detached model lodginghouse will also be erected, in which 300 beds will be made up at 6d. for each lodger, with the use of kitchen, fire, and cooking utensils, lavatory, reading, and smoking-room, ka. A largo meeting hall will be connected with this establishment The ro»t. of land and buildings is estimated at £23,000 Tenders will bo invited imme- diately upon the completion' of the working plans, and a limited liability company will be formed to carry out the undertaking.

TUE LA.BOUK MARKET. There ia nothing of consequence to record aa having occurred m the labour market Bince tho date of our last summary. The various trades' unions which have been agitating during the last few weeks for the adoption of the eight hours system have been fairly suc- cessful, the last two unions to demand this concession from the employers having been the tinsmiths, japanners and ironworkers, and the journeymen confectioners The former body have been fairly met by the employers, but at present no definite decision has been arrived at. Tho journeymen confec- tioners numerically are u small body of men, and as one lirm, representing three fac- tories, commanda more thau half of the total number emplojed, the men in tina trade were placed at u serious disadvantage, as it was pretty i,ouerally known that the (inn alluded to would oppose the proposed re duction from nine and teu hourB to eight hours psr duy without any reduction in the present rate of wages, At n meeting, which was attended by about 100 journeymen, last week, it was decided that a lortnight's notice should be given to the musters, that unless the e ght-houra aystem waa adopted the men woulä go out ou strike. Considering tbo time of sour, work in all brandies of trade ia ni a nourishing condition lu the boot aud clothing factories lhere- ia a fair amount of genuine business being done, and till the beat and steady huuds find constant employment Amongst the engineering shops, iron founders, aud boileraiukcra work IB not bo plentilul as it has been, but still it is Bulli clent to maintain the rate of wages paid during the press ot the season Tbo building trade Is considerably easier in large contracts A good few small joUb are in hand, and wages remain unaltered, although the supply of labour is lu excess of the demund 'Ibis is particularly the case with the clues of man known us genetul labourers '1 he coach builders aro all fairly busy, and at times skilled artisanB ure lu demand, but generally speaking the supply just now is equal to requirements Tho domestic servaut question, however, still rótulos the premier position, with regard to tho demand being far in ex- cess of the supplj. F«.mule cooks, cooles.and laundresses, und married couples are badly wanted, and not much more than 10 percent of tho orders received can be exeuuted Owing to several of the summer hotels having dis missed a number of their hands, tbo summer trude being over, girls us generally useful are a little more plentilul thau they have been for months past, but the supply even now ia scareel} equal to the ordinary dully de- mand.
