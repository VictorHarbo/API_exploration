Motor Cars An orfiaordijvfirr record for economy has just been brought under my notice. Mr. E. J. Herbert, of the Port Wakefield district, claims to have run of 15 h.p. Star car 16,971 miles at a total cost of £80 15/ equivalent to the amazingly low figure of land, a mile. The first set of tires lasted 15.032 miles, which is about a world's record. The petrol consumed was 788 gallons, and works out at 214 miles to a gallon. The repair bill during the three and a half years the car was used did not amount to a sovereign. Mr. Herbert has signified his willingness to allow any bona-fide engineer to inspect his books to prove these figures. He has always taken great care of the automobile, and the shed in which it is kept is quite dark. When the vehicle was left for any length of time it was jacked up in order to take all weight off the tires. The owner is a steady driver, and seldom exceeds 20 miles an hour, which will account for the long life of the car. An independent motorist who has seen Mr. Herbert's books states that he will wager £100 that the figures, incredible as they may seem, are correct. KKP . . . Extract from the daily press. 23-4-13.

In the Newcastle (N.S.W.) Sports Meeting, 8th March last, the 20 hp. " Douglas" won the 5 Mile Handicap BY NEARLY A QUARTER MILE. This win is remarkable in that the " Douglas" conceded 100 and 135 yards start to two 5-6 h.p. machines, 200 yards to three 3. h.p. machines, 340 and 400 yards to other machines of greater or equal sue. In the 483 Mile Easter Reliability Trial, from Sydney via Queanbeyan and Nowra back to Sydney, which includes many severe mountain climbs the " Douglas" covered the whole distance WITHOUT LOSING A SINGLE MARK and was THE ONLY MACHINE TO FINISH AHEAD OF TIME. Whereas many higher nominal powered machines stuck fast in sand, failed on steep gradients, and suffered from rain and frame troubles, the little " Douglases" HELPED THEM OUT of their difficulties, and were as good at the finish as at the start."
