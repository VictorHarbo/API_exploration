'A1 'communication reached tho ' Minis ter for Customs (Sir Robert Best) from the Portuguese authorities at Lorenzo Marques, pointing out that many Aus tralian sailors arc in tile habit oi shipping by -vessels, under the Norwegian flag, going to the colony, .in ignoranco of the local immigration restriction law. Tho law prohibits the disembarkation of any person not possessing £20, as a guarantee that lie will not ' become a charge on the public funds. Sailors landing without a guarantee may have to be shipped off, or have to continue the voyage at merely nominal rates of pay, -in order to get away from tho conn- try. Sir Robert Best has asked Nor wegian consuls to allow men "shipping from Australia to Portuguese South 'Africa, to he made acquainted with the nature of the law through the cap tains of their ships. !HAN0 CAUGHT IN MACHINE.

Accused Found Guilty, A' large number ol people of both' sexes esowded into the Criminal Court . on 23rd February (says the Adelaide ."Register") to hear the trial of Hanry Bachmann on a charge of having murdered Edmund Day Davis, by shooting him with, a re volver, at drienelg, on 24th January. The accused, a young man of respectable appearance, pleaded not guilty, and was \- defended by Messrs. J. ,R. Anderson and J. L. Gordon. From- tho evidence for the prosecution, -the accused and a young ladv were sitting under a bush near the Patawalonga Creek, when they were alarmed bv the appearance of the do- ceased, \ylio came near them sovcnal times. Eventually Bachmann fired a re volver at him twice, the second shot taking effect in the man's abdomen, from the effects of w.hlch he died two days later. Mr. Anderson elicited some in formation about the practice of- foxing indulged in by some people, and at tempted to show that this was tlio ob ject of Davis's tactics, but, obtained no 1 convincing evidence. Dctoctiive Mitchell j stated that the business ot foxing was I common in Adelaide and other places, and that evil minded men watched young 'couples for the purpose of. blackmailing them, tinder threats of exposure. The accused, made a statement from tlic dock, in which lie asserted that the de ceased was rushing about . him, . armed with a big stick, with which lie threat ened .to bash his head in. He fired the revolver, which was aimed between Davis and his companion, Noy, but he had no intention of injuring either of the men. -Mr. Anderson made an effective and eloquent! speech in defence of tho perfect right to defend himself from accused, , and urged -that the latter had a nerfect right to defend himself from attack by frightening his assailants. ' "When counsel concluded, he was loudly applauded by the spectators in court but the noise was o'fficiallv suppressed, not, however, before it had shown nlainlv that Bachmann had manv. sympathisers pretent. Mr. Justice Homhurg having summed up. the jury, after half an hour's retirement, found a. verdict ol guilty , under nro vocation, of the reckless use ol . firearms, which practically amounted to manslaughter, and' on account of the vouth of . the nrisoncr, strongly recom- i mended hilto fo mercy.

Tho -American money trust-, lieadod hv Mr. J. P. Morgan, which was dovclopod when that eminent financier bought tho majority ot the - stock of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, Still enthrals the American imagination. It is important, however, to empliasiso the fact, which almost every newspaper here ignores and obscures, that in a- legal senm this money combination is not n money trust at all, because there is no definite organisation, no elected directors, mid no list nf stock holders. It 'is a community of finonclnl interests, a chain of financial control. Which now is centralised in the hands oi a very lew men, acting in concert with Mr. Morgan as commander-in-chief. It would be impossible to give -tho total of the direct and indirect capital now cen tralised in the money trust. .Vomc cclcssal figures have already been published, and there are others. To begin with, the banking firm of Morgan and. Co. hns deposits of many millions, which its - directors can utilise to advantage in financial operations. Tlic assets of the three insurance companies ar« invested largely in tho bonds of railroad and industrial companies, and aggregate considerably moro than £206,000.600. The directly controlled banks nave de posits and surplus accounts running into hundreds of millions, They influence -the operation of a great number of smaller institutions. Tho vast accumulations oi wealth in the Standard Oil coffers are chiefly directed by ' Mr. William Rocke feller, one of the representative ' members of the money trust in the gteat game ol finance. The vast sum of money thus accumu lated 'in actually in the possession of the money trust, and the tremendous power of tho few men in control lies in the fact that tliov ( are able to sway, t0 influence, and to 'direct the use of it at opportuni ties or critical times. With its command over such an enor mous amount of ready money, and with directing, influence over a largo number ol its allies' money, the trust is able tq wield a financial power sufficient to make or' break the national prosperity or the national credit, and even vitally to affect the national Government. One of our best authorities thus sums up tho powers of the trust. It could, he says "Call £40,660,666 of loans overnight, and ruin anv adversary. Reduce credits to such a degfeo as to cause extreme money stringency, and great commercial distress. "Tie up the cash holdings of the New York banks by demanding tho certificating of cheques for enormous amounts. "Deplete the bank reserves in 'New York by causing shipments of cash tp any part of tlic country. "Make flic, money rate of Interest almost what it cliosc, from 2-pcr cent to 100 per ecpt. on call loans. "Cripple the financial operations ct the Government toy refusing to purchaso any toond issue. .'.'Dictate, the financial operations of the great railway systems and expanding in dustrial corporations. "Dictate— and does actually dictate— the terms and exactions- of every .company promotion that is important enough to too financed bv Wall street." And withal it is generally admitted that tho new trust has had a good, steadying influence on the financial world, and that, with its tremendous powers prudently ex ercised, tho work would probably, ho beneficent. FORCIBLE FEEDING.; Mr. Gladstone Tries It on Himself. I-Iow Mr. Herbert Gladstone experi mented on himself in order to test tho sensations of a suffragette being fed by forco was revealed toy Mr. Winston Churchill in a speeoh at Dundee. Mr. Churchill was ashed whether, if he be- camo Home Secretary, "he would put a stop to tho inhuman method of -feeding suffragettes." Mr. Churchill said lie had felt great regret that these methods had had to be . adopted. (Cries of "Shame.") No, 1)0 did not think it was a shame.. If thev were going to take up the Posi tion that any prisoner in any prison, no matter what his crime, might obtain re lease or commit suicide, they reduced, the whole punitive system of the coun try' to an absurdity. "I am .informed," Mr. Churchill added, "that the system of feeding through the nostrils is not a brutal one. Mr. Gladstone took the best possible means of ascertaining this. He had it tried on himself. He had adminis tered in this way an entire meal of egg and -milk, and so little inconvenience did he feel that he could talk- perfectly well during the whole time -of the oper ation." ROOT PRUNING FRUIT TREES. It not infrequently happens that cer tain varieties of fruit trees are found to he very slow in coming into hear ing. This is particularly noticeable with certain kinds of apples when grown on the free stock (seedling apple), and tho same remark applies to most pears on the -free stock, also to stone fruits. When growing for market this is a seri ous matter, as all the expenses 'of cul tivation' have to be met, -if the future well being of the trees is a considera tion, whether any "returns aro forth coming or not, and as there is a de mand for these varieties, 'it is useless to suggest that growers should avoid planting them. In a large number of districts the pro duction - of fruit can be hastened, by planting trees on dwarfing stocks, hut in some cases this procedure cannot be considered a commercial success ; on really rich soils .these stocks are to be recommended, 'but even, then vigor ous growing varieties do "not always come. quickly into bearing when left to themselves." When the roots arc coarse, and strike deeply into the soil and subsoil, the shoots produced aro also coarse and gross, and fail to mature sufficiently to develop blossom buds, with a conse quent failure to .produce fruit. Fruit, trees to bear freely must have a good fibrous root sjstcm, and these roots must bo near the surface. Trees growing in thi-s way will eventu- all bear fruit, and . that heavily, pro vided that ' they aro sufficiently tar apart to allow of free extension, and that the growths made . by them are not too severely cut back. Thinning the branches > to about 18 inches apart, and removing , tho unripened points, is all the pruning that should lie given to trees growing with excessive vigour. This will hasten . the production of fruit considerably, but shoots grown under such conditions are vcrv susceptible to attacks of canker in i apples and pears, and gum in stone fruits ; they are also likely to he pulled out of place, perhaps broken, when laden with fruit, being too thin . ...and : ,wcak to carry tho crop properly. Gr'ow- ers should aim at the production of sturdy, well matured shoots only- if i quick returns are required, and when trees of even tho most vigorous varieties make more than 26 inches to 24 inches of \- growth in a season, it is n sure indi cation that they aro developing some ; deep growing coarse roots. Fruit trees, i therefore, which are producing wood at the expense of fruit, should be pruned i sbmo time in autumn. Treos root pruned i at that time quickly become re-established, i and frequently make several inches ol , new growth before the ground becomes too cold. If left much later, new growth does not commence till spring; \- while, if operations are begun much earlier the shoots shrivel. Lifting and , replanting should be the method adopted , with trees three or four years old ; if i longer established, root pruning will bo most advisable. ; In the case of pears and plums grown as bushes, pyramids, or trained trees, .it almost- always pays to lift about the second or third year after planting. This ! usually causes them to develop fruit buds, freely the .following summer, with i' out giving an undue check. At this tinv) i the roots will lie moderately plentiful .- and fibrous, and will therefore .quickly make 'a Ircsh stfitet is the soil MODERN JERUSALEM. ' Impression of an American .. Journalist. Tlic distinguishing features ol Jeru salem to-day, writes an American journa list, arc dirt, disease, and poverty. It is perhaps the dirtiest city in the world, and if it docs not rank first In disease and povorty, it is becauso other cities take more effectual measurcq to hide these j twin disgraces.' Tho pavements of Jeru- ralcm which toe re trodden bv Jesus and , His d'icinlos lio hurled beneath 36 cot ol ac- cumulated filth and debris of 19 centuries, I One of tile few clean arid sweot places - within the walled rtty of Jortisalem to day is the Roman Catholic Church built over the Ecec Homo arch, which still stands over the judgment scat upon 'which sat Pontdus Pilate when he said : "I find no fault in " this man." After a day's journey through the dark and slimy streets ol the holy citv it is indeed a relief to enter this church. One Is received by a sister of the order of Zion, one who used to tcaoh in a convent in St. Joseph, in the St-qte of Missouri, and who in particularly cordial in greet ing Americans. Everything, in the church and its neighbouring convent is immacu late, and for the first time one gets a breath of air uncontaiuinated by Jeru salem's dirt. The good sister shows one down a flight of stairs into the chayel of the Ecca Homo arch. Jpst behind the arch is a section of the paved street of the Via Dolorosa along which Ohrist carried the burden of His cross towards Calvary. Tho stones of the pavement are cut in corrugations to prevent slinning on the sharp incline, and on ono side of tlio roadway, cut in the paving stones, is a hop-scotch diagram upon which the Roman soldiers amused themselves with the same, game which American children play on tlic ashnhalt streets ot our modern cities. This is ono of the few bits of the actual Jorusalcm of tho day of Jesus now to ho scon in its oricinil form. One cannot help hut he glad that this particular portion of the ancient c'ty, of David was found .and preserved by good Catholics who believe in keeping things clean. RELICS OF THE TEMPLE. At the same .time depressing and ' fas cinating, one of the principal sights of Jerusalem is the waiting place of the Jews, Here remain a few of the found ation stonc3 of tho platform upon which stood the temple of So-iomon. They aro the only remaining relics of tlio temple, and as such are most holy to the Jews No I being permitted to enter the temple area, now a sacred place of Maliornetan- tism, tlio Jews come to these stones to wcop and mourn- for the departed glory of Israel. The majority of the inhabit ants of modern Jerusalom are Jews: Some of them . are descendants of that remnant which- escaped destruction at the hands of the Romans, who were not in cluded in the dispersion, and who havo lived always in Judea. Their number has been greatlv aug mented at various times, and "is even now receiving manv accessions from the Jewish 'colonies in all. parts of the world. Many Jews come, to Jerusalem to die and the city is crowded with the old and in.irm- of- that faith, who have come back to tho city of their fathers to await the end. ' . native Jew of Jerusalom is dis tinguished by his long cloak or gabar dine and his fur-trimmed turban. The Jew from eastern Eurone is distinguished by the absence of tho turba-n; and bv the two curly locks of hair, one falline m from off' each ear. -A few of the native Jews arc well to do, and . their gabardines arc gorgeous garments ot purple satin, but the vast majority arc the victims of abject and hopeless poverty. The rich and poor, the orien tal and the occidental, all Jews of orthodox faith, come together at this waiime place. There is rare.',, a time when there is not h-al. a dozen men of tercel there to mourn for their denarted nativity. On Fridav evening, the heein- ning of the Sabbath day. t,fie naraow street is crowded to suffocation. One of the chief rabbis intones the nrayer : Because of the palace which "is de- sorto.d, we sit, alone atid ween. Because ol tile temple, which is destroyed, we sit alone and weep. We beseech Thee to have mercy on Zion. and gather together the children of Jerusalem. Make speed make speed. - O Deliverer of Zion ; speak after the heart of Jerusalem " N0 „-ne 1 ,to„be Drofour""v affected bv the pathos of these prayers. HORR0&E; SIGHTS. -But at the same time one's eyes and nose and ears are offended by the horrible sights, the noisome odours, and the raucous voices all about him. Two Catholic priests from Buffalo, NY. stood by the wailing wall with bared u tsllenA pray®r tor miserable beings them. A horribly misshapen and disease- ridden hag begged them for alms. One of the good fathers felt in his pocket for a coin, and, unfortunately, brought up a silver piece worth 25 -cents. This was such a great amount of wealth that the old hag screamed with delight when she felt it in. her hand. But her joy was short lived, for a huge, strong man struck her in the face with his fist, tore the com from her hand, and, kicking her bleeding head, fled away. The horror- stricken priests were besieged, and literally jammed against tho wall by a horde of repulsive beggars. Fighting for breath, one of the Americans struck tnc shoulder of a one-armed boy, only to find that there was a perfectly good arm on the other side, concealod. under the liov's jacket. The two priests were happy 'to escape without bodily injury. It is very difficult to remember that one is in a holy place under such circumstances. THE' PREVALENCE OF LEPERS. One goes out of the city along tho road to tho Garden of Get-hsemane. On both sides , lie serried ranks of loathsome lepers, who implore aid and mercy from the coming pilgrim, and who scream vile curses at the backs of those who pass them by. In the days When Jesus of Nazareth walked this "way tho strict sanitary regulations of the Mosaic law were in effect, and thie lepers were segregated. But civilisation in Jerusa lem to-day is not nearly so advanced as it Was 1906 years ago, and there is not the slightest attempt to enforce even the simplest sanitary precautions. There is no more heartrending walk in the world than that from . the gates of Jerusalem to the garden wherein our Lord made the supreme sacrifice. "Nevertheless not my .will, hut Thine he done." Now the pil grim reaches the .gates of Gcthsemanc with a feeling or infinite relief, for with in all is clean' and beautiful, and the ancient ghosts of olive trees, which probably stood here on the night of the agony of Jesus, are" carefully tended by t-he Franciscan friars. If the regeneration of. the Turkish em pire, under the new constitution, means anything, at all, it should . moan a re formed municipal administration in Jeru salem. Here .pxists to-day - tho ruins of the most wonderful svstcm of water works . ever devised by man, . here is the centre of the religious .interest of the civilised world, and there is what could be made a beautiful citv. ' |New water- Works, a sanitary sewer' system, and , an adequate : polico -force would make a Jerusalem indeed. CLEANEST SECTION OF j CITY, Perhaps the cleanest, section ot' the city, within the walls, is the American quarter built around the Church of St. James, but even this is pervaded , by . a stench so disgusting that an Anicrioan can hardly 'walk through its streets. Less 'than one-tenth of the population ol Jerusalem is Mahometan, and it stands as the shame of Christendom and Juda ism that the Moslems of Jerusalem qro the cleanest class of people in the city, It is also true that . tho Moslems are tlio most peaceful and lawabiding. The only violence connected with tho Young Turk revolution in Jerusalem was tho series of assassinations' resulting from a quarrel between two factions of the Greek Ortho dox church. Jerusalem, outsido of the walls, Is . modern and comparatively clean. It is made up of convents and ljosnices hous ing tlio holy orders' of several' churches, ot Protestant colonics and schools, of business houses and hotels, '.ft has no-' A ' — — " V ' .' " V" " " ' ' 1 thing 'in ooinmon with thd Jerusalem within -the wails. -Outside; tho streets are broad and well paved, and carriages, are much used. Inside, tho htreots nro so narrow, so stcop, antY so often cut up bv stops that the use of any sort of wheeled vehicle is impossible. There ' is outside tlio wall, an American colonv populated- principally hv the devotees of A religious sect founded lq Illinois, which offers hospitality to ' American pilgrims, of any faith. The colony is engaged In the manufacture of souvenirs, which iai'e sold in great quantities, and at good profits to. tourists from the United States. But it is not ir. bits ol Roman pave ment, nor yet in modern souvenir shops that Jorusalcm has its 'greatest hold upon the interest;- the imagination, ' and the reverence of the pilgrim. The very centre of hollncsk in 'the I-Ioly City is in the sepulchre of Jesus. WEALTH IN MANCHURIA,. Enormous Natural Resources, To describo fully the natural- resources of Manchuria would be a task of con siderable magnitude, for the Area is big and tho resources varied. , The mountains and hills of tjio : oast and south-east, are rich with minerals. Coal abounds in many places, and 43 mines 'are now in operation i|i Feng- tien province. What the output of coal might he under proper, management no one can say. declares the American " Review of Reviews," for native mining is most crudo, and rich veins are merely scratched. Silver, lead, gold, platinum, asbestos, antimony, and iron mines nave Leen located in great number, and are await ing the touch of development to swell the business of tho country. In ail probability -gold supplies for a new monetary scheme in China could he taken from the mines of Manchuria, thus making practical the possibility ol China's release from the present, evils of a fluctuating silver currency. About the headwaters of the . Sungari and Yalu Rivers arc magnificent virgin forests of pine, walnut, and ash. Somo lumbering is carried on by the Chinese, but the methods are so crude anil waste ful, and the cost of getting lumber out so high,- that timbers and dimension stuff oannot compete with Oregon pine in i the large markets. Tho mineral and forest wealth of Man churia, however, is insignificant compared to the almost boundless wealth of tlio soil. Thousands of square miles of deep, brown, loamy soil exist, the fields stretch ing away to the horizon, or to the nack- gr0und of a rugged mountain, dotted here and there with the mud houses of j the farmer, and creating in the mind as nothing else can the impression of vast wealth. From this wonderful .fertile soil the' native farmer takes bountiful crops. He sows his seeds, and the fertile, loamy soils give up their products almost unaided by the skill or mechanical genius of man. About the centres of fife the fields. arc small, and the farmer grows garden truck and potatoes, but in the interior- tho universal cr0ps are kaoliang (sorghum), soy beans, ami millet. The kaoliang and millet are the staple foods ot tlio people, just as rice is the staple food of Japan and south China, and the soy beans are the money croii of the country— cooking- and lighting oil being expressed from the seeds, and the residue toeing shipped to Japan to fer tilise the rice fields. The -bean cake ship ments .' from Newchwang, Dalny, and Antung in 190S amounted to 515,198 tons ; beans, 239,298 tons ; bean oil 1,930 tons; having a total value o'f 15,0.16,649 dollars (.United States gold;. In the hilly region of South-eastern Manchuria Indian corn is the staple crop nnd staple food of the people. Peaches apricots, pears, and crab apples grow wild in I'lio hills, and only a few Chinese are engaged In fruit culture, although the demand for fruit is great, and carlnafc of oranges and pears are shipped in from Japan and south China. In Kirin province, in the north, con siderable tobacco is grown, and, con sidering the native methods oi growing \- and curing, the -quality is excellent. The growing of" silk cocoons on the native oaks, that covet the hills of south-eastern Manchuria, is an agricul tural industry of considerable size, tho trees being cut back ovcry few years in order to furnish new growth for the silkworms. The cocoons are shipped to Chefoo, in1 China, and, Japan, where the spinning and weaving of pongee silks are done. . - OCEAN BEACH EXCURSIONS.— The steamer Beaver makes a trip to South Passage to-morrow, leaving th Tug Company's wharf at 9.30 a.m. Pas sengers have two hours ashore on main ocean beach, Full particulars are adver tised.
