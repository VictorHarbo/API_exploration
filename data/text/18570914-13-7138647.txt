COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. Argus Office, Saturday Evening. The export entries, passed at the Customs to-day, have been confined to shipments for England, by way of Suez, in the Emeu, the total being 8,196 ounces. There has been very little doing in the Melbourne gold market, nearly the whole of the dealings, at first hand, being now transacted at the gold- fields. Prices are quoted at s £36s. 6d. to 36s. 9d. per ounce- for Castlemaine and Sandhurst; £3 17s. to £8 17s. 6d. for Mount Korong; £3 17s. 6d. to £3 18s. 3d. for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Creek, and Avoca; £8 17s. 6d. to £5 19s. 9d. for the Ovens and £3 18s. 9d to £3 19s. 9d. for Ballaarat. The value of Ararat gold differs materially: some parcels obtain 37 18s. per ounce on the spot, while for others not more than 31. 16s. 6d. is given. The escort returns have lately presented as may be observed by a glance at the table some remarkable changes. Those of the present week contain the first great escort from Ararat, amounting to 17,370 ounces, and they show the influence this gold-field has exerted on the quantities received, during the last six weeks, from Ballaarat. The recent increase in the escorts from that gold-field has not been altogether from its own immediate resources, but has owed a great deal to the productive- ness of those of the new field. The returns for Sandhurst are still much below the average. The escorts from those fields to which an asterisk is prefixed are despatched fortnightly, the remainder weekly. ozs. its, Castlemaine. 5,087 10 Sandhurst . 8,840 10 Ballaarat 18,41 10 Avoca . 871 0 * Fiery Creek. 402 0 Amherst. 1,608 0 Blackwood . 230 0 Maryborough . 2,040 0 Ararat 1787 10 i9,28 Q Previous escorts of the year 1,597,627 15 Total .1,647,455 15 On all the old fields activity is again the order of the day. Many of those who had been unsuccessful at Ararat have made their way back to the old spots, where they know a certainty awaits them. At Maryborough and Dunolly this is especially the case and many localities which have been merely shep- herded" since the movement towards the west commenced will now again be worked in earnest. At the Alma a new lead has been struck, and, as there is plenty of steam-power now at work, it is expected that it will be workable. There is nothing new to report from Ballaarat, Creswick's Creek, and the adjacent districts. At Bendigo large numbers are employed in the prosecution of quartz mining, and great results are anticipated the powerful machines now ready for operation in this neighborhood, offering facilities for realisa- tions hitherto unknown. The Whipstick is again a busy scene, the late rains having supplied a great want on this field. Tarrengower has produced the usual quantity of nuggetty gold. At Fryer's Creek, the Emu and Herons are yielding playing quantities, and a new reef off Poverty Gully has caused some excitement from its reported richness. A new gully has also been opened in this district, off Spring Gully. At Campbell's Creek the sluicing parties are doing well. The week has passed off without a single clearance having been effected at the Custom] of a vessel conveying gold. Entries for several large parcels for transmission to England by the Emeu have been passed. It is expected this vessel will take about 50,000 ounces. The shipments for the year up to the present date have amounted to 1,805,229 ounces, or 75 tons 4 cwt. 1 qr. 10 lbs. 9 ozs., the value of which, at £4 per ounce, amounts to £7,220,916. The only shipment of specie this week has been one of £9,000, in British sovereigns, to the Mauritius. The money market has been quiet this week, but without any easier tendency. The bunker charge 7 per cent, for discounting bills having under 95 days currency, and 8 per cent, minimum for those having over 95 days to run. For renewals, and for overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent, is charged. For mortgage on good city property, with a large margin, capital is offering at from 8 to 10 per cent., according to the amount required and the situation of the security. There are rumors that an alteration is to be made in the rates of exchange immediately after the despatch of the mail steamer. The banks now issue drafts at 60 days' sight at 2 per cent, premium. For amounts under £50 they issue at 2½ percent premium, having 80 days to run. Bills against gold are purchased at 1 per cent, premium. Freight on gold, by direct steamers or sailing vessels, 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London ; in- surances, 11 per cent. By the overland route 5 per cent, that is 7d. per ounce as nearly as possible ; insurance, 12 per cent. The share market has exhibited a slight reaction this week, the fall in prices having brought forward buyers. Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway shares have been done at 786 cash, but 80 is now asked. Colonial Insurance are offering at 17s. 6d., but buyers will not advance beyond £1 15s, 6d. There have been sales of Colonial Bank at £4 17s. 6d. Bank of Victoria shares have changed hands at £40, but these shares having touched the lowest point are now advancing. In Melbourne Gas and Coke Company's shares there have not been any transactions. The net addition to our population by the seaboard during the year, up to the evening of Friday, has been 81,436 souls.

Argus Omeo, Saturday Evening. During the past week the import market for European goods has continued inactive ; hopes were enter- gained that the repeated advances bones of overstocks of almost every description of goods would have induced shippers to lesson amount of ventures; Such, however, not proving to be the case, speculators have undeterred from buying, notwithstanding the extreme lowness of price of many articles, and transactions have been confined to purchases for immediate consumption. The country dealers have also bought very sparingly, having found, from experience, the J IOFSCS sustained from being largely stocked with goods depending for sale on a constantly shifting population. Holders of most descriptions of goods are, however, firm, and as the spring always produces increased by since, an improved trade is shortly looked for, though with no prospect of any general advance in prices. Liquors. Spirits continue to be of nominal price. i Genuine brandies are firmly held ; but although the I week a heavy, the greater portion of It malaria of I inferior kinds, which, being offered at very low prices, ' prevents, in a great measure, the sale of legitimate sorts, as well as tends to depress their value. Sale of Clozcau's have been effected to-day at 345. for dark, and 30s. for sale, per dozen. Gin has been in easier I demand, and has declined in value. London old tom, of best brands, is not worth more than 5s. 3d. Runs are steady at quotations. Whiskey continues I utterly neglected, and prices are wholly nominal. I Geneva, of best brands, is in slight request, and sales have been made at 21s. per case. 3 Flour, Grain, c-The flour market continues without animation ; transactions are confined chiefly to parcels of moderate amount for present use and although the late advices from San Francisco intimate no prospect of probable shipment from that quarter ; yet, as our supplies are quite equal to requirements until harvest, there is not much field for speculation In Ulla article, although, as the supplies are light on the diggings and in the country towns, and present holders very firm, an advance rather than decline in prices may be reckoned on. Best brands (Adelaide) are selling at 232 10s. to 212. ; Van Diemen's Land, 242. to 212. ; first quality Chilian and Californian, 212. to 222. per ton ; Haxall and Gallego, 22 10s. to 22 15s. per barrel!. Small sales of the latter have been made at 22 12s. 6d. Provisions continue unimproved In value; prime hams and bacon are of moderate sale, at prices not exceeding 11d. to 1s. ; best description of English cheese, In sound condition, move off in small parcels at from 10d. to 1s. lb. ; American, unsaleable. Moss pork and beef are very dull of solo, and prices nominal. Sales of now butter have been made at Is. 6d. per lb. beyond which buyers seem indisposed to advance,, there is a good demand for the country, but even for picked parcels of old butter, 1s. per lb., cannot be procured. Fish of all kinds is dull of sale at nominal prices. Candles, although In brisk demand, show no improvement in value No. 1 Belmonte (Price's) are not worth more than 1s. 2½d. to is. 2d. per lb; a parcel of equal proportions of Hale's and Price's, has bee a placed during the week at 4s. 2d. , Groceries, 10. Sugars have continued in steady advance, and are firmly held for higher prices and as advices from all parts announce increasing value of this article, further improved rates must be expected ; i refined sugars are in more inquiry, and sales of English to arrive have been made at 9d. per lb, , Teas are very firmly held, holders showing but little inclination to soil oven-at present rates and in the absence of further supplies, the article in on upward, tendency. . ? .. -. ? . as.- <. is a [ Coffee continues of steady sale, without change in value, of which there seems little probability at any I I late for the present. a ,' Rice is still dull of sale.

In dried apples there has been some spoons- I lion and as In consequence of of the failure of the I apple crop In America, none can be shipped prior to October, holders are very firm. Tobacco The extensive demand for this article, both for consumption and shipping, added to the out station of arrivals to any extent, has at length improve 1 the aspect of the market, and prices are looking up ; O. R. S. and Co.'s brand has been sold at 15d., an I sheepwash (for which there is inquiry) has brought 10d. Holders are very firm, and improved rates author past d. Timber The demand for building materials continues good, and prices are well supported. The stocks of deals having become much reduced, and the demand 1 continuing steady, has caused an advance in prices, bales have been brisk, and an entire cargo of 0 x 3 disposed of at Old. per foot. Hardware and Ironmongery continue in fair request. Stocks are however well supplied, and there Una change in value of most of the articles of those de terre irons.

Load is dull ; solos of assorted shoot milled have been made at £31 per ton. Tin plates have come to hand more freely, and have consequently declined in value to about 20 to 25 per cent, on invoice. Pitch and tar continue almost unsaleable, and price ? perfectly nominal. Paints, oils, etc" are in light demand, and until the close of the rainy season no improvement on present prices is possible, Boiled linseed oil is inquired for, but without change in value.

BENmao, 11th September. Mr. Bannerman reports of our gold market The price of gold-dust may be quoted at 76s , but the market is so unsettled that no po, ative quotation can be given. Business has been, quiet throughout the week, though considerable of in petition exists in the market. There is at present a falling off in the production or alluvial gold, though jority of puddle! B finding the ground worked out and poor. It is certain that in a limited time the hitherto rich gullies in the district must be cleared of wash! dirt, payable by ordinary horsc-niachlnos and ills, unless a liberal allowance of ground Is secured Mines who are inclined to place machinery upon old women?!, the quantity or gold produced from this source must gradually become less. We understand that there is a marked decrease in the quantity of quartz crushed du i ing the past few weeks, which we believe arises from entirely accidental circumstances. No quotations can. be given for amalgamated gold, the price being ruled by the quality of the sample.
