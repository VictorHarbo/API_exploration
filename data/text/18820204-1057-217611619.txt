On that day you will bo naked to say if you approve of the actions of M'LEISH, GARGET & Co. They, in the most undcr-liand way, bought over the heads of tho Midrilo Ridgo People tho threc acres of laud obtained for them by their Parliamentary representatives ns n WATER RESERVE FOR THEIR CATTLE, for £1G0, Not content with this DISREPUTABLE TRANSACTION, tboy then gavo £1000, without the consent of tho ratepayers, for 27 acres more in tho same locality, making in nil £1100— for which tho water rate payers will havo to pay an annual intorest of £'JC, in addition to the present crushing rates. On this land thcro ia not a drop of water. It is as dry as RUTHVEN STREET. Thoy borrowed £2500 without tho consent of tho ratepayers, and in violation of the Local Government Act to bring tho water from tho dry land purchased for £11 GO. There is not n shilling of it left. They gavo £1160 for the laud, a largo sum for the water pipes which arc now lying in heaps at tho railway gates, and tho balance was spent on the well near Shuttle- wood's bridge— not a shilling of tho £2500 iB left. If you rctnrn M'Leish you will havo another big loan. The water rnto is equal to X'lVJE NIIILXIAGN in the Pound. Yoto for M'Leish, and you will have it litis year H10V13IV SlKJULUf in tho Pound. Ratepayers look at your EMPTY IIOUSES —see how people nro going beyond the REACH OF THE WATER RATE. Look at tho Central Ward. During the last six months not a singlo thing has been done to tbc streets, not a shilling spent on street improvements. RATEPAYERS I Who wanted to impose n lighting rnto of XIEIllC l»12XC12 in the Pound on every ratepayer In tho Municipality to pny for the street lamps?

RATEPAYERS I Remember tho words of Alderman Campbell — " That M'Leisb was hardly a day in the Council beforo ho naked him (Alderman Campbell) to striko a blow at Ruthvcn-strcet, by assisting him (M'Leish) lo got a road formed leading from the bridge at llusscll-strcct to coino out at Hcrrics- street nb tho baek of bis (M'Leish's) pro perty."

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,— Referring to my candidature for the North Ward I should liico to say a few words in reply to Mr. French's nddrcss, late tho wo are in hearing from him. Personalities I would havo refrained from had he not begun them. It is easy for Mr. Fronch to find fault with my action at tbc Council meetings. It is an easy matter for any man to pick holes. I ask Mr. French can ho, or docs he, indicate any counter scheme for ameliorating the heavy . water rates ? If Mr. French will come forward with a better or more scientific iilnu than mine, by all means let him do 60, but I protest against a man representing my ward, whose only idea is to find fault, without a shadow of a plan in place of the one projwscd by me. I ask Mr. Frcpoh to let us know something about himself or what ho proposes. Mcantimo, asking your fair consideration of my claims upon your suffrages, and also yourwotcs on Tuesday next at the Assembly Rooms, Margaret-street, » Yours respectfully, GEO. W.

There aro no fully paid up-Slmrcs in tho Company, THE Company is projected for tbo pur- poso of acquiring nud furthcr.dovolop- ing tho cxtousivo and well established Brow ing, Malting, ami Wiuo mid Spirit lUwincftsoa, at present carried ou at tho Downs Brewery, Toowoomba, and at tho City Brewery, Mary Street, Brisbane. The con cern is a very profitable one, ami it lms been the intention of Mr. Perkins to visit Europe with a view of increasing tho productive l>owcroftho plant ; but hinnctivc connection with the Government of Queensland during the past three years lias necessarily limited the attention ho has been able to devote to his private business, henco the reasons for (onuiug tho business into n Company. Tho freehold Properly in Brisbane consists of a block of land, 2 roods, 1(5 perches, run ning from Mary Street to Margaret Street, on which is erected the City Bukweuy, a first- class building, with Offices, Sheds, and Stables; also, two Dwelling-houses, facing Margaret Street. The Freehold Property in Toowoomba con sists of 1 j acres of land, iu the centre of tho Town, on which is erected the Downs Brewery, Malt House, Cask Sheds, Cooper- ngc, Stables, Ac., nil complete and in working order ; nlso Dwelling-house and Brewer's Cottage, Tho Combined Plants of Toowootnlxi nud Brisbane arc complete, niul of very recent purchase, ami arc equal to a production of six hundred (6(H)) hluls. of Beer weekly — working only by day— nud with a comparatively small outlay tire eapiblo of oxtension. The Water at Toowoomba Is inexhaustible, nud possesses all the excellent properties of tho Treat water for Browing purjioses. The I'rojicrtic.s, Flnnt, ami Goodwill linvo been valued by Richnrd Clailoy, Esq., O.K. nnd Architect, Arthur Martin, Esq., Auc tioneer ami Valuator, and Win, J. Mnuce, Esq., Public Accountant, at £81,-110, which will be tho purchase money, leaving a balance of £43,500 to carry on andoxtend tho business. With the unexpended capital of the Com- nanjr it is proposed to erect an Extensive Distillery, nnd to effect considerable improve- mcntsin the Malting Establishment, by intro ducing appliances for working on tlio Pneu matic principle. This will -enable tho Malt ing business to be carried ou during tho whole year, instcml of limiting tbo alterations to the four winter months ns heretofore. The purchase of Public Houses lias not been cultivated. The operations of the ConqKiny am bo largely Increased by paying attention to this class of business. The present Proprietors arc so well satisfied with the class of customers thoy havo been trading with that the Company will not be asked to take over any Jiook debts. Unlike a Company floated for tho imr))oso of establishing a new industry, or of <fcvclo|>- ing the resources of a mine, the Shareholders in Perkins a Co. Limited will acquire nt once a payable aud increasing business in full working order, with well ascertained profits. Hie Proprietors guarantee a dividend of 10 percent, per annum for three years, during which time they will not part with any of their shares on which 20s. is pud, and nlso pledge their shares with the Company for tho fulfilment of their engagement. Tho fitock in hand for Brewing purposes may be taken nt uctt cost price ; nlso tho Klock nnd Fixtures in the Wine and Spirit Blorc. Considerable Shipments arc afloat of Malt, Ho|«, Wines, niul Spirits, which it will lie optional for the ComjNiny to tnkc at nctt cost. Either Mr. Perkins or Mr. Naumijuro will net ah Managing Director for three years, or such lesser period aa may be mutually agreed ujion with the Directory. Iu tho event of the capital not being sub scribed, all de>OMls will lie returned in full. The only chnrgc on the Company will Us the usual excuses for printing, advertising, nud Commission.
