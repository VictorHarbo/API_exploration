S UM MA RY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL.-. The Government has at last secured the adoption of their proposals for the alteration of the tariff, the Legislative Assembly having by large majorities on every division consented to the changes mentioned in the budget The debate on the budget is therefore at an end It would not have lasted many days had not a strong effort been made to have a higher duty than 20 percent imposed on un polled woollen piece goods in the interests of the local millowners 'The party inthe Assembly which made this endeavour were numerically small, but rather ambitious They first wanted a fixed duty of Is 6d per lb , a bath was. not at all possiblofiomaGoi ornament point of MOW and seeing that this proposal could not succeed, their demands gradually diminished until an appeal for 25 per cent. ad valorem was made. The Ministry remained firm, and then came a request of 22, per cent, and although at one time it appeared as if this would be granted, the Cabinet would not vary its original proposal A monster deputation of woollen mill operatives, male and female came from Ballarat and Geelong, and asked the Chief Secretary to do something more for their industry than was then intended, but that hon. gentleman told them that, for the present at any rate, the duty could not be increased beyond 20 per cent without inflicting gue) orangery upon the clothing manicure turers who employed thousands of hands, and who would lose their oxpoittiadoif the duty were made 25 per cent If it could be shown at any future time that the mills resumed further protection which could be given without injury to any other trade the Government would be glad to reconsider the question. The deputation was received on Tuesday, August 10, and on that day the Legis lative Assembly proceeded to the final consideration of the proposal to increase the duty born 15 to 20 percent An it tempt to stonewall business was made by the Opposition, more for the purpose of harassing the Gol common than with the hope of effecting any good for the woollen mills, but the Ministerial supporters mustered in strong force, and. completely overshadowed the obstructionists After sitting until 4 o'clock on Wednesday morning, a division was taken, and an amendment by Mr Munro to the effect that the Government proposal was unsatisfactory was again. ed by 40 i votes to 23 Had all the members of the Chamber voted the numbers would have been 57 to 27, which is a fair indication of the strength of the parties in the Chamber In consideration of the long night spent in their interests the Got em ment did not ask the House to sit again that week On re assembling last Tues day the other tariff items in the budget were agreed to Satisfactory progress has been made with the Irrigation Bill, which is to be the great effort of the session. The debate on the second reading was sus ended for a month, to enable the budget to be disposed of, but on Wednesday last it was resumed, and quickly terminated The second leading was agreed to without dissent, and several clauses have since been passed, including one which declares that all water in streams, lagoons, and lakes shall be doomed to be the property of the Crown, unless proof to the contrary is sustained in the law courts Considerable objection was raised to section on the ground that it would confiscation riparian lights, but the Government declared that unless it were agreed to, a satisfactory system of irrigation could not possibly be obtained 'the Legislative Assembly will be asked to devote special attention to this bill, so that it may be disposed of as soon as possible and sent to the Legislative Council, but at the best it would appear that it cannot pass through committee in less than a month.

The weather in the colony of Victoria has been more or less showery for some time past, and as reported in our three last fortnightly summaries, most of the wheat, which had been lying Tingermnroted had come through in very fair order A little re sowing had been done, and oningtothe hard condition of the soil, the area ploughed was smaller than in the previous season in most of the dry districts. Then the crops that only recently came through would, of course, have no time to tiller, and thus they will be likely to stand less thickly on the ground than usual. Such were the conditions up to the 17th inst. on which date a thorough change occurred in the character of the weather Rain began to full thickly and steadily over the colony generally, and continued without intermission for from 30 to 48 hours in different districts This has been the finest fall of rain that has occurred for many months in the ve heat growing areas of the northern parts of Victoria A heavy flood came down the Campaspe, and a stiff rise took place in the Warra j floods have occurred in many of the creeks and rivers, but no serious damage to farms has been recorded In some of the rather level districts the floods have been extensive, in one instance thousands of acres are reported to have been under water, the rainfall there was the best for 15 years The general and thorough character of the change is vouched for by reports of similar character horn South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland from South Au-, truths we have intelligence of the continuance of the heavy rains, between 2in and Jin having fallen in -48 hours in the region of the Flinders Range. The latest reports from New South Wales show that the occurrence of rainfall in Victoria has been accompanied by a continuance of the wet weather that has for some months prevailed over most of that part of Australia A late telegram states that heavy rains had fallen all over the ee long during! the preced- ing day, an inch and a half having been registered in some places the country being thoroughly soaked Advice has been received of heavy rains on the upper rivers which the rising very fast and should add total flood waters come down with, the present high level of the rivers the whole country will be flooded The river is 15 miles wide above Bourke. Reports b) telegram from Queensland show that weather of a precisely similar character to the foregoing was prevailing over most of that colony particularly in the central and western districts The rams have also extended to the south LABOUR.

It is added that a boat manned by natives of the Solomon Islands, was captured by the Santo islanders, and that many of the former were massacred The Rev J G Paton, who has spent 30 years of his life in missionary work in the New Hebrides has written an interesting letter, in reply to inquiries by the Premier of Victoria with respect to those islands I here was virtually no French settlement in the New Hebrides, Mr Paton says, until military stations were established on Leave and Math colo British men and money have given the islands all the civilisation they possess 'Hnrty seven years ago all the natives were cannibals , now about 9,000 profess Chris vanity, and 20,000 more are so much civilised as to have given up the grosser heathen practices Life and property are reasonably safe, except on one or two islands. The New Hebridean are opposed to French, but desire British annexation or protection. The Presbyterian churches have expended £170 000 in the islands, and the missions are carried on at it cost of 7000 per annum British subjects claim 5000 acres of land in the New Hebrides All tropical products grow there to perfection, the soil being extremely fertile.

LIMITED report : Wool The usual clearing-up sales, preparatory to the commencement of the new season, have been held during the past month, and although the selections were indifferent, as was to be expected, competition WAS very animated, and a slight advance c Late rates was established. Thlflimprovcnient,howevc is only noticeable In merinos and fine crossbreds the coarser grades, in sympathy with the home wools, being without quotable change. In all about 200 bales were sold. Our telegraphic advices from London speak hopes fully on! the future of the market. Since the close of last sales a large private business has been done at an advance on closing rates of about 10 per cent, for merino and 5 per cent, for fine crossbred descriptions. Altogether about 7,000 bales have been taken up, which number represents the quantity withdrawn during the series, and we may reasonably conclude that, as the prevailing demand is of a progressive nature, prices next sales will, in all probability, show a still further Improvement. Coarse long wools, unfortunately, do not participate to much extent in the rise in values, which, owing to the caprice of fashion, is con t ned to the wire-haired varieties of the time, the demand for quality being the chief feature of the recent auctions We have pleasure in reporting a thorough change in the weather since the issue of our last summary. During the month daily reports of heavy rains had a reached us from various parts of thocotitlncnt, and at the time of writing the north-western district of this colony, which had previously experienced only light falls, is now receiving a bountiful supply of moisture. in many parts of Queensland and New South Wales large tracts of country are under water, tanks and dams are plentifully supplied, and the long di EOS trous drought may safely be held to hav«completely broke up. Exchange on London is a per cent, discount for drafts at OU day s' sight, and J per cent extra for each SO days additional. Freights to London per sailing vessel are 3d. for greasy and gd. for washed. Ino rates per steamer via Suez Canal are 7d. and 8d. for greasy and w asked respectively. t Ina following vessels have left with wool on board during the month ;-? Bales.

At the bales held on the 18th in st., ory 234 bales were submitted, and '3000 bales sold. The offerings consisted almost entirely of oddments, still competition was brisk, and prices compare favourably with late rates.

Moama 1515s. 184s 666 Mr 23s s Including bonus MONTHLY SHIPPING AND FREIGHT' REPORT Messrs S De Beer and Co report -Since issue of our last circular, general freighting matters have times without any marked improvement. The export of wool has already commenced, as will be noticed by the increased shipment during the period under review , but such has been principally wools from the Upper Murray, shearing- in the Victorian districts having been delayed by the late rains, which, however, have materially benefited though cultural districts. The arrival of wools to market for shipment has tended to firm the rates by both steamers and sailing ships on the home load i mr berth, and the present quotations we take as an index of rates for the approaching season, though as in past years, the bulk of the clip will be monopolised by the regular lines of steamers. It is as yet too early to though the export of surplus will depend entirely on the value in home markets. from South Australia accounts are very encouraging as to expected out- turn, and if hopes are realised our neighbours will have a heavy surplus available for export, which will give employment to a goodly number r of sailing vessels and tend to improve rates. The clearance for London during the past four weeks are um braced in the following four steamers and one sailing ship, registering 12 OOJ tons, with 8,661 bales of wool, hAS.
