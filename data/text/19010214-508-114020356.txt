Gentlemen, — The duty devolves upon the Citizens of New South /Tales of electing six representatives to the Federal Senate. In offering myself as a Candidate I do so with the nil appreciation of the. great responsibilities attached' o the position, and have arranged to give the time lecessary for the fulfilment of its duties. It being mpossible to canvass the whole Colony, I propose to risit the principal towns and explain more fully my rtews. I am in favor of a freetrade policy, and believe that L moderate tariff will realise all the financial re luirements and best further the prosperity and the lappiness of the people. The fiscal decision given at his Election is fraught with momentous consequences o the Commonwealth, as the obstacles in the way of he removal of a' Protective Tblicy (when once it h%s -een assured) would be .very great, as instanced by the ixperience of Vietorlav '— ? ' '? ?'?~*ft- - - - I approve of a Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Bill that will be equitable to all parties. I would exclude all undesirable immigrants. I am In favor of a Federal State Bank. . The question as to the site for the Capital should he promptly dealt with. I would advocate the inclusion of the Pacific Islands irithin the Commonwealth as early as possible. I ?would encourage the Volunteer with Naval Reserve rather than the purely Military, and believe that in ill matters relating to defence, the Commonwealth should be placed in as independent a position as pos sible. I am pleased that New South Wales has established Did Age Pension, and would approve of its extension as a Federal measure when we can afford to paj Eor it. The present Constitution should have practical in terpretation before, enlarging its sphere, care being taken that the financial burdens upon the people in its initiation should be made as 'light as possible. Representing large business and manufacturing in terests, you can rely upon my safeguarding the wel fare of New South Wales, whilst fully recognising that the advancement, prosperity, and faappln-^s 'oJ the four millions of Australians in the new Coml%pn wealth is the primary object. Trusting to receive your support, I am, yours faithfully, ? , ? JOHN P. GRAY. 3E' EDEBAL ELECTIONS ...THE SENATVc MR.
