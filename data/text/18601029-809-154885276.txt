Immigration. — The number ofpersons arrived in the colony during the week by way of sea board are 783, speeded as follows : — United , Kingdom, ;'i55 , Australian colonies, 172 ; Mau- \ rimis, 'i ; Jiamnurg, oz. The mercantile transactions of the past week present few features which cull for prominent remark. Tho unsettled weather and the de parture of the mail in the earlier portion of the week, and the races in tho latter part, have combined to give a tlutness to the market. It may, however, ho said that there is a fair seasonable trade for immediate . requirements doing with an entire absence of anything like speculation. The largo stocks of nearly every merchantable commodity held preclude a pos sibility of advanced prices, and merchants are content to eflcet sales at the low rates at present ruling Tho flour market is firm, and the stocks of all description of breudstuffs are light, and were it not for the anticipated arrivals from California and other part? of North America, there would undoubtedly be a considerable riso in price. As it is the uncertainty as to tho number of cargoes afloat for the Australian colonies acts as a check to speculation. According to advices it appears that about 13,000 barrels of flour arc on the way from New York to this port, besides which some six or eight vessels are expected to arrive from California aud Chili. These, however, j would have bat little influence in the market. With the exception of wheat, the imports of breadstuffs aud graiu havo fallen off during the quarter ending 30th September, as compared with tho corresponding three months of last year to a very great extent. Tho quantities lor the two periods stands as follows : — 1859\. 1800. Bran ... 151,521 babld. ... 100,367 bs'jla. Barley ... 40,703 ? 0,103 „ Beam and l'caa 3,330 „ ... 72 ,, Muizo ... 149,993 „ ... 158,919 „ Malt ... 75,931 „ ... 02,013 „ Outs ... 556,199 „ ... 193,770 „ | Wtcat ... 44,515 „ ... 183,219 „ J'lour ... 0,865 tons ... 3,403 tons Gram ... 1,182 „ Oatmeal ... 221 „ ... 104 „ Potatoes ... 2,535 „ ... 2,301 „ Tho accounts from the agricultural districts point confidently to a good and early harvest. It is fortrinate that such is tho case, as during the winter and spring months the bulk of the' grain exported from America will find its way' to British ports. The best brands of flour may now bu quoted at from £19 to £19 10s. per toil ; wheat, 8s. 3d. per bushel ; oats (colonial), 4s. 2d. to 43. 3d. ; Scotch and Danish, 3s. 8d. to 3s. 9d. In ales and porters there has been con siderably more demand. Tho price of ales in bnlk lias advanced fully 10s. per hogshead, but it cannot be said that there is any improvement nn,., v ?\t„ ?- j„ i now held for £8 per hogshead, and buyers are X-lentiful at £7 10s. The stocks of spirits have been considerably increased by the arrival on Thursday of tho Union from London, and tho Cosmopolite ? from Amsterdam, — the former vessel bringing heavy shipments of bottled ales aud porter, branily. and rum; by both large parcels of, geneva havo conic to hand, sufficient to relieve the existing scarcity for red case. In provisions there is no improve ment to report. There have been within the last ten days considerable additions to our al ready un wieldly stocks of butter, and so low lias the price, become that above 2000 firkins Were purchased on speculation and rc-sliipped to England by tho Great. Britain. This has had a tendency to make the market for new butter firmer, and prices havo advanced slightly ; but it' is not anticipated that the im provement will continue. Tlus stocks to haud nro even now sufficiently large to last a great portion of tho summer season, and in the face of the hot weather there wil I undoubtedly bo a very general desire manifested to get quit of stocks at any price above that which they would fetch if re-shipped. The samo remarks' will apply in a ntoro limited sense to cheese, the stocks of which arc far beyond what will bo required for months ty coine, and which, its a matter of course, arc deteriorating in value. Except prime sorts of- Cheshire, Chuddar,- Wilts, which arc worth from 9.t-1. to ll'.d., cheese is a drug in the market, and the bulk of tho sales made are through xlio medium ol the auction mart. A portion of the overstock of hams and bacon has silso been finding its way into the market in a more' or less damaged condition by auction, tuid consequently tho sale of both by way of ordiuary transactions has suffered very considerably. ' In consequcueo of the few arrivals from 'the Mauritius, prices for sugars have advanced, and it is reported that there is a good steady trade demand at an advanco of about 30s. on previous rates for medium sorts. In teas and coffees tlicro are no changes, the market is not largely supplied, there is -a good demand, and rates aro firm, ltice is in fair demand at from £1G to £17 per ton. In soft goods, and boots und shoes, busi ness has been limited, owing iu some degree to tho continued wet and chilly, weather. The stocks of the latter class of goods are so largo as to forbid any hope of improvement on present rates, and drapery warehousemen have shown their anxiety to do business by their having broken through the agreement recently made by tho trade, limitiug the credit given to four months, by the abolition of the system of dating forward. 'They have now, however, reverted to their old terms. The stocks of metals are large, and beyond present requirements The stocks of galvanised and corrugated iron arc in excess of the demand, as also bar nnd rolled iron. There has been but little improve ment in timber, aud where advances have becti sought tho trade has been immediately checked. In tho Stock and Share market a fair busi ness was doing in the beginning of tho week, but a3 in the case of mercantile transactions generally it fell off towards the end. The ar rangement arrived at by the brokers came into operation at thfl commencement of the week. A change is now established, and the daily quota tions are given under the authority of all the brokers. This practice, if adhered to, will un doubtedly be a satisfactory one. In bank share* there has been a good deal of inquiry, and some show of transactions. The half-yearly meeting of the. Colonial Bonk, ou Tuesday, passed off satis-faeforily. A sum of £10,000 wna written oif to cover bad and doubtful debts, including the defalcations of Mr. Fiaxmati at Custle m iinr. A dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum was declared, and tho shares tire now inquired for ex iliv: at £0 to £G 5s.' Pending fie iiajf-y early meeting no improvement can be e vpeeted iu tiie shares of the Rational Bank. We lave heard of sales during the .week at £2 12s. Od.j and £2 14s. is' the limit quoted. .Mslboarnc aud Hobsoiv.s Bay aud Suburban Railway, shares are inquired for ; the near ap proach of the opening of the latter line to niWitirmnl of confidence ' in the undertaking. The business dous in sniniiiu' shares has not been marked by any ex citement. 'Several new companies 'have' been placed on the stock and share list, aud tlicnum b.T of dividend-paying companies, twelve in mmbcr, bear fair proportion to the whole, 'fae sales have.' however, 'been limited to a few favored companies. M'Nairs arc quoted at £4 ISs. to £5; Jolmson's £1 10s. to £1 lis. 6d. ; Specimen Gully, £4; 'Myers Flat, j£l ; Sandy Creek. 32s. 0d.*: Albions. 32s. Od. ; Nelson's, 29s. to 30s.

Money for commercial purposes is scarce, but there is plenty of capital seeking investment at from 8 to 10 per cent. It has been suggested that the Government would-be acting wisely at this juncture if a portion of. the debentures^ re aui-M.'Uiur saiu iifF* luiuna. nciu jjv»- imuituiuiu the market.' There is little doubt but that they would soon be taken up. 'fhc escort for.' the week brought down 43,499 ox. of gold against 42,583 oz. 10 dwt. for the corresponding week of last year.
