SHEEP AT THE SMITHFIELD SHOW. From Our Special Corespondent.) Bradford, December 17, 1909. All colonial pastoralists, ar,s interested in the doings Of their Englist. cousins, and what the Royal is to the b-eeding stocks of Great Britain, so the Smithfield is the embodiment of fat sheep and cattle of the United. Kingdom. Last week the 111th ex hibit took place at the Agricultural Hall, Islington, London, and another successful show was seen. It is surprising what at traction fat stock has for tie Average Cock ney, and they flock in thousands to see sights of which they have no practical know ledge as to how the results are obtained. The weather was seasonable, and that dread-.' ed monster-a London fog-was conspicuous by its absence. This always makes a ma terial difference in the attendance, and the results in their entirety cannot but satisfy everybody. The entries-this year compared very favourably with those of past shows 293 head of cattle having been enrered, 146 pens of sheep, and 141 pens of pigs. In the carcase competition there was a falling off is the number of cattle, hut sheep showed an increase. What, perhaps, struck one the most was the big decrease in the long wool classes, and in such breeds as the Lin coin and Leicester, there is room for larger exhibits. Two or three fresh classes in sheep have been made, and the inclusion of a class for WEnoors and Dorset Down lambs, and the subdivision of the English cross bred classes for the short wool and long wool crosses, although they did not bring a larger number of entries, still general satis faction was expressed at tpe alteration. f .)I LincomLa This breed of sheep may be called the first in importance, and perhaps they have done more to revolutionise the frozen mut ton tiade than any other sire. The entry of this bleed, as already said, was smaller than usual, but it lacked none of its old- time merit, either from the breeder's or butcher's point of view. Messrs. S. E. Dean and r s again led with a pen of three fat wether lambs under 12 months old, the sheep being good and full of character. STheir weight was 5cwt. 3qr. 11b. Mr. H. 5 Dudding took second honours; these being good in flesh and touch. The wethers were a remarkably good lot here. The Biby Grove flock provided the winners for a pen of three fat wether sheep,.all the animals being specially good, well grown and plump, SS. E. Dean and Sons being second and third. The second pen weighed 8cwt. 3qr. 261b., just lib. less than the first. In the Cup contest the latter were successful. and for the seventh time took home the Breed Cup, which certainly is a remarkable series of successes. Ldicesters and Border Leicester. iThe usual enibitors were well to the front, and the entry though small, was of excellent merit. The winning lambs, owned by Mr. E. F. Jordan, of Driffield, Yorks, showed up well. They won the Breed Cup, i but in this they were perhaps fortunate. 1 This noted breeder of Ikicesters has always i cut a very prominent figuro at the Smith 4 field Show, and we believe he has won the d cup so many times as to constitute a world's i record. The same owner took great honours w1 ith a well fleshed pen, Mrs. S. Perry Her rick was second with a choice and even a pen which scaled 4cwt. 3qr., against the S4cwt. qr. 81b. of the winnert, and her p second entry secured the reserved number. il The winning pen of, wethers belong to Mr. il E. F. Jordan, which, by reason of their it outstanding merit and weight, 8cwt., would it have been an ideal cup winning pen, but the judges decided.in favour of the lambs, a ii decision fthat took from Mr. Jordan a good a chance of high hbonours. The same exhibi l tor was second with another fine pen of well-bred sheep, two quarters lighter. Kent or Romney Marsh. This is a breed of sheep which has come well to the fiont during the past few years, and, is as popular as ever. Evidently Kent breeders are more particular about rearing good breeding stock than going in ý- for fattening sheep. The display made by this breed was hardly up to general ex s- pectations. The number of entries was the o smallest for several years back. In the lamb classes the first and second pens were shown 1- by J. E. Quested, but the second prize pen is spoken of by some authorities as being Is better, being more uniform m flesh and r.. lame. Both were good -weight. 5cwt. and 5cwt. 151b. respectively. Mr. W. M. Caza let's flock was again well represented here, at and the third and reserved number pen were both from it. The former was a bun. dredweight lighter than the second pen. In the wether class only two pens were shown. A wide, fine quality peit with capital back and loin won first honours, and also breed w cup .for Mr. J. E. Quested, a well-merited honour, Messrs. W. Horne and Sons taking the second with a well-flesed pen of excel lent qualsty. The Down Breeds. Sonthdowns. as usual were well to the front, and admirably rppresented. The lamb class for general merit has seldom been excelled. There were many pens worthy to,,head good classes, and the work of the judges. required great care. Mr. C. Adeane's pen was selected for'first prie, and welldeserved the honour. Under hand a width andrdepth of flesh is disclosed un equalled by fany.of the pens in the class. Their wegh , was 81b. over 4cwt. Next came another grand pen, like the winners, from Cambridgeshire, owned by Mr. A. C. Hall. This pen were very good in touch with particularly good legs and well-filled twists. The contest for the second place was very close, for in the third position .-ame another notably good pen from a:. C. Adeane's. flock, which were difficult to displace. Here, as in the winners, we found a grand touch and good flesh. Fourth hon. ours went to Mr. F. H. Jennings for lambs that under hand were good, but the depth of flesh was slighter than in the preces3ag pens. Mr. A. C. Hall's second pen were given a fifth prize, and the reserve came from H.M. the King's flock. Three other pens were h.c., one froin Mr. D. H. i, McCalmont's,,.hich was the heaviest in the class, 'another from Mr. F. H. Jenning's flock, and the third from Mrs. Moatefiore's flock, The wether class, also on the ground of its number of entries and merit, had an extra prizse given it. At the head of this class H.M. the King's pens were placed, winning first and second honors. The first could not be gainsaid, for it was a specially good one, with grand flesh and touch. The second pen' as closely , by one of Mr. D. Mc?lmonts, These wethers were full of.' esh and good in quality, with excellint legs and loins, and, like the lambs from cthe came flock, tpped the weights with 6cwt.; 1) Sir J. Werher's pen .were forth, and'they were well deserving of it for their flslh was firm to the hand and development".good. Mr. W. M. Casaet's pen were another of high merit, -which came well tbo hand, at did also the h.c. pen irom the same flock. Mrs. Montefiore was also given the same distinction for her pen, and the second entry from Sir J. Wern her's flock and that from the Duke of Richmond were commended. The contest for the breed cup was full of interest, but when the two leading pens were pitted against each other the greater depth and wealth of the flesh of the lambs from Mr. Adeane's fleck made them the winners, leaving the r.n. to the King's pen of wether. IShropshirsa. This breed of well-known sheep continues to be as popular as ever, but all the same there is sill room for complaint regarding She lack of competition in the classes. for only three breeders took the trouble to fill the pens. The Stretton Farming Co. won in the lamb class with a specially good entry of excellent type and flesh. They were also r.n. for the breed cup. Sir R. P. Cooper came in second and third with two very. well-grown pens of lambs, and in' the wether class he secured first and second honours, taking the breed cup with firstnamed pen, with two excellent entries of pecially good flesh and character. Mr. F. Bibby's 't'o loti were third and r.n. Hampshire Downs. ,The entry in the lamb class, although not so largo as we have seen it, was a satis factory one, and the competition was good right through. From the first it was evi dent that Mr. James Flower was to be near the top fo- his leading pen came out well, and it was not long' before it was fixed at the head of the class. Then came a struggle for second place, which was final ly allotted to Mr. D. Nicoll's grandly-flesh ed though not. well-matured lambs. Scaling 6cwt. 161b., they were practically *nwt. heav ier than the first. An even and uniform pen, Mr. J. Flower's second entry was third. Mr. S. J. Blackwell's pen of well- grown lambs, which were well in the running, took, the r.n., followed by Mr. A. Bear's pen as h.c. A pen from Mr. H. J. Hulse's. flock had a similar distinction, the three other entries, two fromn Mr. Chillingworth's and one from Mr. S. J. Blackwell's flocks, were c. The wether class had only three entries, the leading pen being the best of all lots of the breed seen here for several years, owned by Mr. J. Flower. It won the breed cup from his fine pen of lambs, and sub sequently took higher hononrs. They turn ed the beswmin at Scwt. i81b. The Chilmark Birmingham winners were second, and the executors of the late Sir George Judd's pen, with good substance, 8cwt. 1qr. 61b., and quality,' came third. T Steady Market. There is mnot a great deal of change to ndte this week in connection with the local market, business continuing sound and healthy, although there is now the usual slowing down in view of the approaching season of stocktaking. There continues to be done sufficient business to test'prises, and although several impostrs have been taking a fr- action less for the delivery of sunermo tops next spring, yet there is nothing to be alarmed at. All through the season intporting topmakers have pursued a policy or selliug as they have picked up wool in the colonies, and users have been willing I to purchase at a market price. There is to-day nots a gret deal' of difference be tween spot prices and those for next year delivery, but all the same there is still in the minds of many ar opinion that for the time being high-water mark has been touch ed. There is a big weight of material to come forward, and by next February and March the tug-of-war will have begna. The lowering of the bank rate is a very welcome feature, for the price of wool, coupled with dear freights and exchange, all determines a higher cost of thE top. A good super 60's combing cannot be called any more than 2s. 2d,; in fact. some 64's of a good standard make have been recently sold at that figure. Consumntion is as great as ever, and taking thbigs as a whole. there is nothinguto grumble at. The fact is, although there is a big consumption, there is a fair quantity of tops offering for im mediate delivery, but they have cost fully what can be made, and in many cases even more. Crossbreds do not show a great deal of change, but everything is solid and firm. Coarse descriptions do not manifest that degree of activity that is seen in medirm and fine qualities, although there is a fairly Sbig consumn tion: .There continues to be a very good inquiry for 46's, both on home and export account, and fleece wool of this quality is exceedingly scarce.. There is no selling forward in crossbreds at less money, and the dearness of wool both in New Zea land and Buenos Ayres is a great surprise. Spinners are very well employed, machinery is being fully run, and all alike have suffi ciont work in hand to last them for some time to come, although new business has * slowcd down considerably. Mohair is quiet, but firm, notwithstanding one or two seem r determined to "bear" prices.
