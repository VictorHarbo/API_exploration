She had strong easterly winds through the Straits, strong X.W. ?wether to Cape Howe, and southerly thence to Jcrvis Bay. On the 6th June Mr. Akhurst, one of the saloon passengers, died of general debility. This gentleman was well known in the literary world, especially in the neighbouring colony of Victoria. The ship Wallace Town, Captain Shand, passed through the Downs on 1st Mav, when the pilot left the vessel. Cleared the channel on the 6th' with the -wind S.E. to S.W., from thence had strong gales from that quarter to 24th May. The N.E. trades proved verv light, crossed the Equator on the 18th June in iongtitudc '27- W., when the S.E. trades -were picked up, and -were fresh to 20- S. ; then variable to the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope, which was passed on 14th July in latitude 39- S ; from ? thence she ran her casting down on a mean parallel of lot. 39- S.

The Wallace Town has on board a large quon titjr of powder;- and also a 'valuable coaching stallion, which has arrived in verv fine condition. '' ; . The ship Smvrna came into port on the 19lh, after an excellent passage from Plymouth, bringunj**'' immiBrante, of -whom there arc* large uumW of children. Unfortunately the voyage has been attended with much sickness, several of the iwsscmiers hav ing suffered, and from twenty to thirty arc now down with gastro enteretts, scarlet fever, and contagious ophthalmia. There have been nine deaths (children) and four births on the passage, and, consequently, tbc ship hat been placed in strict quarantine. The ship Atssayc,from Liverpool, arrived in port at 2 a.m. on 19th. She left Liverpool on the 6th May, and hadmoderate Nh. trades. The equator was crossed on 16th June in longitude 2» W., from which date to the let July she had a. continuance of calms, followed by northerly winds. She made her easting on a mean parallel of latitude 45-' 6., and passed south of Tasmania, making the .passage from Tuscar in 101 days. The vessel brings a large cargo of iron, beer, salt, &c;, and is very deep. The German corvette Ariadne arrived in port on the 19th instant, from a crnifc on the Wert Coast of South America and the iriands fn the Southern Pacific ; her lart port being Apia. She left WilhchnFhaYcn on 15th October, 1S77, to join the German Squad ron appointed to enforce an indemnify from the Government at Nicaragua. Her consorts being the corvettes Elizabeth and Augusta.

She in last from Apia, whence she sailed on 25th July, and very bad weather she lias encountered. The Ariadne is a smart- looking vessel, with a Him bow and composite built ; her armament consists of 8 guns of the latest pattern, and she carries a complement of nine officers and 250 seamen. She will remain here some three weeks to refit, having suffered damage to her spars, and from hence the will proceed to Fiji and the various ports in New Zealand, working her way home by the way of Cape norn. The following ars the name* 'of her officers :— 'Commander, Captain Von Werner; 1st Lieutenant, Sebelcs; lieutenants, Gesseler, Von Esenbesk, Burich, Uarnung, Gookc: Sub-lJeutenantf, Von Fulors, Copmann, Krieg. The German barque Papa is from Cape Town, where she landed a number of immigrants, and has come on to this port in ballast, having sailed on oth July. She reports very violent gales daring the greater portion of her passage cast, principally from the west ?ward ; but on reaching longitude 115- K. the wind came in from the N. li.. forcing her round Tasmania on the 8th instant in a heavy rotary gale. The sjdendid steamship LiiHtani;i arrived on the 21st instant from Plymouth, via Adelaide and Melbourne, making the passage from the latter port in 45 hours. She left Hobson's Bay at 3.15 p.m. on the 19th, and cleared Port Phillip Heads at 7.5 p.m. ; passed Wilson's Promontory at 3 a.m. on the 20th, and Gabo Island at 7 p.m. same date, and was safely moored alongside Campbell's Wharf at 4 p.m. on the 21st. She has had moderate weather throughout. The Melbourne Daily Telegraph thus describes her passage from Plymouth : — The steamship Lusitania arrived in Hobson's Bay on Saturday afternoon, having made a very good passage from Kngland, though not perhaps such a suc cessful one, in point of time, as on her first visit. This vessel was the pioneer one dispatched by tbc Orient line, and succeeded on that occasion in doing the journey in forty days six a-half hours, allow ing for the difference of mean time. The vessel is still under the command of Captain Hewison. He vcporte having left London on the 27tb June, and Plymouth at 4 p.m. on the 1st July. The Cape was reached on the afternoon of the 22nd July ; but 6uch a severe gale was blowing that no safe anchorage could be obtained, and a start for Simon's Bay was at once made, where the vessel was safely moored for five days, during which time very heavy weather was experienced. The Government at that port kindly lent every pussiblc assistance in coaling the ship, and had 1100 tons put on board with lighters. A start was again made on the 27th July, when heavy Buas were experienced to the equator, and entirely adverse weather all through to Adelaide. The average distance daily was about 230 miles, but had more favourable weather been inct'witli, the Lusitania could have steamed about 330 miles per any, which was about the run during her last voyage to this port. Adelaide was made on the Hth, and after discharging cargo and the South Australian passengers had embarked, she left the port on the following day at forty-live minutes past 8 p.m., and arrived as above. 'There is' nothing1 particular to re port of the voyage. One of the passengers, named Mre. Whitman, lost an infant, aged four months, ou the 19th of July, through severe inflammation ; and during one of the heavy gales one of the crew lost the sight of his right eye through the ship lurching and throwing him on to a binnacle pin. On a later occasion another of the crew broke his leg through falling against the mooring-chain and cable. Both seamen arc progressing favourably under the attention of Dr. W. K. D. Flamstead, who has succeeded Mr. Hayward. Tin: San FitAxasco Mail.— The P. T&. Co.'s s.s. City of Sydney arrived at San rY-uncisco on the 14th instant, being one day in advance of contract time. Cizco (s.).— The Pilot Board of A'lctoiia met on 9th and 10th instant to take evidence concerning the stranding of this vessel on 17th December in the South Channel, Port Phillip Bay, when going out, and while in charge oi Pilot Rich. The inquiry had been delayed in consequence of neither the captain nor officers of the Cuzco having visited Melbourne until Captain Conlan arrived in the Aconcagua (s.). The Board, after hearing: his evidence, decided ' that the pilot was not justified in taking the Cu/.eo (s.J, of 3800 tons, drawing 24 feet fi inches, through the South Channel, between No. 11 buoy and the pile light, on the evening of the 18th December, 1877, at a high rate of speed, with the tide as it then was— viz., low water, or early first quarter flood— the chart show ing only 25 feet. The Board therefore find that the grounding of the Cuzco was occasioned by Pilot Rich's negligence, and suspend his license as a pilot for two calendar months from this date.' — Australasian Shipping Xctcs, August 17.
