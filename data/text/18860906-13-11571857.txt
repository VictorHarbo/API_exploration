STJM M A KY VOR EUROPE. . POLITICAL-. Tho periodical elections for ilio Legis- lativo Council aro half over-that ia to say, for moro than a- moiety ot the constituencies tho rotiring mombors have tioon ro-oleoted without opposition. The gentlemen upon whom thnt honour was conferred were-Mr. C. J. Ham, Mel- bourne Province ; Mr. Thornloy, Wes tom ; Mr. Ormond, South-Western ; Mr. Melville, Southern ; Mr. Coutts, North Western ; Mr. Storry, Northern ; and "Mr. Brown, North-Eastorn. Mr. Simon Fraser and Mr. A, D. Michio woro nominated for South Yarra Provinco for tho seat vacated by Mr. Graham, but Mr. Michie withdrew, and Mr. Fraser was thereupon returned. Tho elec- tions for tho other provinces nro to tjiko placo on Thursday noxt, tho candi- dates boing Mr. .Meares and Mr. W. II. Roberts, for North Yarra ; Mr. Buchanan, Mr. R. R.' Woolcott, and Mr. N. Levi, for South-Eastern ; Mr. T. D. Wanliss and Mr. Gore, for Wellington ; Mr. Wettenhall and Mr. Thomas Dowling, for Nelson; Mr. Pearson and Mr. 0. Sargeant, for Gipps Land; and Mr. Stanbridge and Mr. J. H. K. Buscombo, for North Central. For all these consti- tuencies, oxcopt Wellington, the first namod candidato is tho retiring momber. Comparatively little interost is boing talton in tho oloctions outside tho constituencies immediately interested, and no largo issues aro involved in any but North Yarra, where Mr. Meares, constitution- alist, is opposed by a radical. This province comprises Collingwood, Fitzroy, Hotham, Williamstown,and Footscray, all of which return ladical representatives to tho Legislative Assouibly, and Mr. Meares will havo a stiong light to keop his seat. Tho Legislative Assombly has settled down in earnest to tho consideration of tho Irrication Bill in committeo, and, whilo great progress lias not boon made, it is satisfactory to notico that lion, mem- bers nro applying thomsolvos to their work witli an ovidont dosiro to mako tho measure a good ono. The roal dilliculties havo appeared at tho outset, and have had to boovorcoine. In tho first place, tho committeo hadtotacklo thcqucstioiioftho confiscation of riparian rights, which arose partially on clause 4. In that sec- tion it is provided that »U the waters of tho colony shall bo deomed to bo the pro- perty of tho Crown until tho contrary is proved, and, although it was passed, tho Government had' to promise to recommit it if any important alteration woro made in part xiii.. which deals solely and .vv holly with thequostion of riparian rights. Strong feeling wa3 shown by many of the constitutionalists, who support tho Go vcmnumt against tho idea that the ovrnor of water should bo required to prove his title, instead of tho Crown boing required to provo that ho lind no title, but it was submitted for tho Government that un- less some such provision as this woro in- serted any one porson might provent irri- gation works being constructed in a dis- trict by setting up n fictitious claim to part of the wator necessary, for those works, Tho debato was interesting, although 'it was but a foic shndovving of tho struggle whi6h is to Ink o placo on this question when part xiii. is readied. Another bnlk took placo at cUuso 10, which providod that tho Government under certain circimi blanccs might make froo grants to water trusts. This was very warmly opposed by a largo section of tho Houso, on the ground that it would bo impolitic in tho highest degieo to appropriate for suclt a purpose nionoy raised by loan upon which tho whole colony had to pay interest. The Government did not re- gard the principio as vital to tho bil!, but urged that it should bo adopted as nu open method of oncouraging trusts to undertake largo irrigation sellemos, and was far preferable to roinitting interest, which might havo to bo done, and which, if dono, would bo an insidious way uf securing "free grants" from tho slato. Tho point was argued at length, and whon tho committee divided the Government woro beaten by :i."i votes to 28, and tho "freo grant" principio was eliminated. Good progies3 was ellon mado with tho measure, and thero is every indication that within a few weeks it will bo passed through com- mittee. Mr. Bent, leader of tho Opposi- tion, mado au attempt to move an amend- ment, limiting tlie oxpondituro under tho bill to £1,000,000, but his friends quickly saw that ho lind taken a most imprudent stop, and induced him to withdraw. The question of scheduling tho national vvoiks to bo undertaken at tho Bolo oxponso of tho state waa raisod, but the Government resisted nny alteration in that direction. They pointed out that until each trust mado its own arrangements national works could not bo specified, and this view commondod itself tu tho good judg- ment of tho committeo. A good deal of privato members' busi- ness was disposed of in the Legislativo Assombly on Wednesday, August 25, when sovoral bills woro passed. For the most part they dealt with old subjects, and, consequently, progress was swift. Two of tho bills in quostion wore for tho amalgamation of tho legal professions, and tho legalisation of trades unions, which havo in previous sessions hoon thrown out by tho Legislativo Coun- cil ; another was for tlio enfran- chisement of tho police, which tho Chief Secretary opposed in vain ; and a fourth, vvjiich was a sop lo minors, pro- vided that thoso workers should not bo kept bulovv tho surfaco for moro tlian eight hours a day. AU thoso billB wore promoted by tho radical wing, but they will íoceivo duo attention in tho Council. Tho prospect is comfort-' »ig. Lnst Wednesday evening, when private business was called on, Mr. Harper mado an unsuccessful attempt to imluco tho Houso to liston to jn attack on our education syatom. ?Ile approves of tho Canadian prin- ciple of local control of schools, and horn that point of viow ho attacked ours. After his having spoken for half an hour, however, to n very few members a count out took place. Ho intends returning lo tho subject at a later period of the session. Tho Government insorted a voto in tho Estimates of £83,000 for prospecting for gold and coal, and lo enable work to bo commenced as soon as possiblo, tho subject was dealt with on Thursday ovening. It lins long boon admitted that the distribution of tho prospecting vote by tho Ministor of Mines in the past has boon unsatisfactory, and tho Government submitted a now schomo. Tlioy proposed that in each of tho sovon mining districts'of tho colony a iucal board should bo appointed to recommend moans for oxponding the nionoy, and that eacli board should solid a uclegato to a contrai council which would roviovv all recommendations and linally decido upon tho manner in winch tho voto was to bo apportioned, in tho dobato on tho question gouoral approval was given to tho proposal to spend so laigo an amount, and «hilo member? also concurred ni tho principle of local boards, they objected strongly to tho creation of a coutr.il body. It was submitted by them that tho council would cause irritating delny without giving compensating advantage, and that it would bosuilicientif tho recom- mendations of tho local boards woro dealt with by tho Minister. Tho voto was ngieod to, and the regulations aro to bo considered at a subsequent stage.
