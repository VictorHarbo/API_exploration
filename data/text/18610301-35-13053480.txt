About 2100 sheepskins were disposed of, at from 5d. to 9d. per lb. Tallow The supply was rather larger than usual, and, as the town trade were the only buyers, most of the large lots offered were withdrawn. 56 casks out of 116 catalogued were sold at from 33s. to 47s. 3d. per cwt. Hides Heavy hides were in greater demand, and prices ruled higher. A lot of 141 hides brought 14s. 6d. each. About 250 hides were quitted at from 13s. 9d. to 14s. 6d. each for heavy hides, and 1s. 9d. to 6s. each for light and inferior hides. At Mr. O. B.

From the Argus we take the following abridged report of the markets :- ] Benin to since that date of his monthly report not been ex- et dingly quiet. Trtfflo with the Interior has been greatly infer fired with, and occasionally temporarily suspended, In some quince of the floods from heavy rains. The unseasonable weather but deterred country buyers from operating to any extent. The advices by the first mill of continued decrease In ship minds of Stone description of goods have tended to (tra a firm nett to prices, but the stock on hand are generally n excessive that a long continuance of reduced shipments motorcar became ill and be influenced for the better. The trade, however, that doing it in a healthy condition ; purchasers bay with caution and to limited extent ; acceptances are well met and the limitation of credit bat induced a founder state of business among the mercantile community. The great want of a steady metal of immigration of course affects the extent of consumption of imported goods. With a limed population, which is the case at present in Victoria, a decreased consumption of imported goods must certainly be looked far and It therefore remains in the hands of shippers In great measure to regulate prices here, by their attention in the amount of their shipments from the home market!. All speculative feeling seems to have died out, ted consequently, whatever tain art effected being for immediate use, reduce weeks, and must ult. may 11 produce . favourable result for shippers, provided sup plies are kept within the bounds of moderation, which has unfortunately been too long lost eight of. With these remarks we proceed to detailed particulars of the leading article! of importation : Ale and Porter The arrival of the new brew having commenced, holders of last season's wheat have shown an inclination to clear out, and lower prices have consequently been submitted to, sale of Batt., No. 3 being reported as low at £7 19s. per hogshead. Draught stout In limited inquiry. Bottled beer be In steady demand, and since the arrival of the mail, Byass's stout are reported at 11s. All of the same brand brings 10d per dozen, and least appreciated aorta proportionate prices. Bag and Sacks. Demand an been very dull, and with the exception of a few small sales of three-bushel bags to the trade, at from 11s 6d to 11s 9d per dozen, there are no transactions to report. Grooerlet.-Tete have continued dull throught the month. Several parcels offered at auction have keen either bought in or forced off at reduced price the trade showing no disposition to lay in stocks.

Flour and Oran. The market for flour has continued steady at the last week, when heavy arrivals having come in from South Australia, and further supplies reached us from the United State of America, demand has been checked and prices show an inclination to give way. As many of our country districts are now supplied by the local mills, the demand in town is nearly cost fined to the consumption of Melbourne and its suburbs, and as arrivals from the neighbouring colonies are likely soon to produce an «eeumolaUag stock In and a fall in prices may fairly be looked for. Quotations are at follow Adelaide sorts. £16 to £17 ; Tasmanian and Victorian, £18 ; Chilian and Californian, £11 10s to £16 per ton; United States, 36«to39«per barrel. Wheat.

Dried Fruit There is totally demand for any description, and with our abundant supply of fresh sorts there is no prospect of demand for dried ports until the close of our system. Quotations are consequently nominal, and ara gives a follows : Almonds (Jordan) of 3d to 15s id, soft wheat and. currant (Patria) the to 4d raltlna-sluieatsli (laren) SUed to 6d, Cape 3s to the.

The Hobart Town Mercury reports as follows ; The Customs returns for the month ending January 31st, 1861 show an excess Inviting of exports over imports. The exports amounting to £104,285 (Hobart Town £65,840, and Launceston £58,446), and the imports to £80,956 (Hobart Town £67,570, and Launceston £32,386) leave a balance in favour of exports of £14,329, the balance the previous month having also been in favour of exports to the amount of £27,91. Comparing the returns for the last month with those for January, 1880, we find an increase in Imports of 6-26 and an increase in exports of «0.907-Hobart Town showing in Inonateln Imports of £17,428 and an increase in exports of 54,45, and Launceston a decrease in imports of £1167, and a decrease in exports or £34,418 ; and as compared with the returns for January, 1859, tbofcCforthelutmonlh exhibit a degree In Imports of £1745, and a decrease in exports of £94.7S4-Hobart Town showing an increase in imports of £2467, and a decrease in exports of £32,930, and lAunceston a decrease in imports of £4212, tod a decrease in exports of £61.804. .

The same journal gives the subjoined report of the markets at Hobart Town : Boots sad Shoes,-Ltdlia' roads are rather wanted, bat for other descriptions the demand is very light. Bottled Board-The series is fully supplied with both ale and porter. Ale has a moderate sale at 10s 6d, each porter of 10s 3d to 10s 3d. Butts.

Flour Flour has not situated in the slightest degree since our last summary, prices having remained steady at ClG'to £17 per ton for Boor from the best colonial wheat. We observe that during January a few shipments were made to the other colonies!, amounting to about 30 tons, which is rather a remarhablseirsum- I stance, no Sour to speak of having been exported from this port for many months. The export of flour is chiefly carried on from the northern side of the island. Grain A few parcels of the new crop of wheat have come in during the month, but no quantity as yet come forward. The recent unpropitious weather has acted unfavourably upon the crops in some districts, and many farmers who a few weeks ago anticipated an abundant harvest have been grievously cheap pointed. Prices for wheat has continued steady at 7s to 7s 6d per bushel, and by our telegram from Melbourne via George Town this morning, we find that the markets there and at Adelaide were unchanged, to the present prices are likely to rule a little longer The inquiry for oats has been very limited during the month at 3s to is 3d per bushel ; tome shipments were made to the limited extent of 9000 bushels In January to the neighbouring; colonies, and a few more lots are In [course of shipment, which will never partly lighten the stocks in this market Cape barley is quoted at is, but supplies come in very slowly. No new English barley has as yet come forward. May-day continues to come in freely, and morts off at former prices, old hay realising from £4 to £3 per ton, according to quality, and new from £3 to £4. Hops Hope are held for high prices, and as each successive mail proves the hopelessness of expecting supplies from England, no doubt consumers must ere long yield to the prices asked. The very wet season we have lately had it against the chances of our crop of 1661 being what was expected. Spirits The spirit market has continued very quiet throughout the month. Brandy wells only in very small quantities, the trade only buying to meet immediate wants ; Martell's is quoted at 10s 9d tolls, which iaadeellneon last month's prices. Hum hat a fair sale at 3s 3d to 8s 6d for the 10 cap. and as 3d to 4s 8d for the Co.p. Geneva hat sold at lit to 161. Old tom and whisky are almost unsaleable at any price. Sugar The market is fully supplied with sugars. The Isabella Brown came in about a fortnight ago with 665 bags sugars, making the second cargo this year from Mauritius. The Cantero having arrived about four weeks previously. Part of the Isabella Brown's cargo was disposed of by auction last Monday, when the following figures were realised Ration, from £19 to £31, and crystals £45. None of the counter sugars were disposed of the prices offering being below the reserve. Tea There has not been much movement in teas. Good con- good are worth from £8 to £8 10s ; second quality from £7 10s to £7 Uti and common from £8 to £7. hysonskin meet with very little demand at 2016 to £6. Timber The timber trade is still very slack, and prices show no symptoms of improvement. The value of the quantity exported from Hobart Town In January amounted to £3710, which was a decrease as compared with the previous month of £295. Tobacco. The price of good fig tobacco In firmly maintained, No. 2 Manila cigars have told at £2 (1 per thousand. Wines.

Wool The season is now nearly over, only a a few small lots remaining in the market. Prices throughout the season have evinced considerable steadiness. The quantity exported from the colony in January was 285, 160 lbs., of the value of £70,335; Hobart Town 530,519 lbs., value £49,333 and Launceston 335,000 lbs., value £37,OtO._
