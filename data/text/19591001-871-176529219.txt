Intake for 1959-60 More than half will be British More than half o Australia's intake of 125,000 migrants for 1959-60 will be of British national The Minister for Immigra tion, Mr. Downer, said this in the House of Represent atives on October 6. He vvai speaking in the debate on the Estimates for the Depart ment of Immigration. Mr. Downer said that it was hoped to get 35, assisted migrants from the United Kingdom and the full-fare intake was expected to be 30,000. He gave these details of the programme for the current financial year — ASSISTED: British, 35,000 Maltese, 1.000; Dutch, 8,500 German, 7,500; Austrian, 1,500; Italian, 3,000; Greek, 1,500; Danish, 1,000; other categories (mainly Finns), 3,000; refugees 3,000. FULL FARE: British, 30, Italians, 15,000; Greeks, 5,000, other categories (including re fugees), 10,000. Mr. Downer said that Australia was facing two growing obstacles in recruiting the most desirable types of migrants These were — • Unparalleled prosperity in the United Kingdom and Europe, which made people less inclined lo pack up and migrate to a country 12,000 miles away. • The re- entry of Canada, with a stepped-up programme, into the field of European migration Canada had the advantage of proximity to Europe, which meant that her migrants could easily return for short periods to their former countries. "However, I am confident that our target of 125,000 migrants for this year will be realised and that we shall obtain the types of people we desire." he said. "Australia will be vastly assisted in this by the operation of our migration offices Europe." Mr. Downer said that during his recent trip abroad he had been greatly impressed bv the quality and efficiency of* Aus India's Immigration ' represent atives. He had found no basis for criticisms that officers lacked a knowledge of the language of the countries in which they were operating. He said that last year Aus tralia received 116,697 migrants —1,697 more than the target of 115.000. Of the arrivals, 60.623 or 52 per cent were of British nationality.
