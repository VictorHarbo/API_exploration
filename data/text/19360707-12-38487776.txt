PREMIER CONDEMNS TARIFF * 'ROTTEN, STUPID AND CLUMSY' SYDNEY! Mondav. pRITICISING the recent decision ^-* of the Federal Government to impose tariff quotas and licences on foreign importations, especially affecting Japan, the Premier of Queensland (Mr. Forgan Smith) said to-day that the whole busi ness was 'confoundedly rotten.' The thing was stupidly conceived and clumsily executed. Mr. smith said there wpuld be a lot of trouble over it. This was not the time to lose a good customer such as Japan. Australia could not afford to estrange Japan while quotas existed on exports to the United Kingdom. Since he had been In Sydney many business men and others had ex pressed to him their resentment of the tariffs which had lost to them the Japanese trade. , Markets, Then Migrants Other points emphasised by Mr. Smith were that the Englishman, had dispensed with his breakfast of pro verbial bacon and eggs. He found he could not afford it because of the undertakings to purchase exclusively all Danish eggs and bacon exports England'' was paying dearly for this. 'I was called before the inter Dominion committee on migration ' said Mr. Smith. 'I told them that migration was tied up with markets. How can you expect Australia to take migrants from the United Kingdom when you put a quota on exports? A migrant can produce more than he can consume. What is the use of a migrant if you cannot take all his surplus production? . 'If Britain gave us a free market for our exportable surplus then Aus tralia would resume immigration and be in a position to restrict imports from Japan and other countries.' The exports of sugar from Austra lia to the United Kingdom, Mr. Smith added, equalled the meat exports in value, and he was able to secure a continuation of the sugar agreement, subject to 18 months' notice of its termination. A scheme providing for a new agreement, involving a loss in exports of Â£455,000, was dropped.
