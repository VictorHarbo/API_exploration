Not All Black Sheep,— Information is in our possession which enables U9 to stnto tbat about 30 men, women, and children, from Kctloy, Salop, Englnnd, have emigrated to Queensland, and many of whom will come to this district. In a report of n farewell tea-meeting given to thorn before leaving England, it is stated that tbe loss sustained by tlio Primitive-Methodists of Kctley by the removal of these families is very consider able, inasmuch as tho number includes those who have taken the greatest interest in the affairs of tho chapel nnd Sunday school. Some of the number were nlso vory useful encrgotic members of tho Rose of Kctloy Lodge, of the J.O.G.T, being well-known in Good Templar circles in tho county. They wcro also intelligent teachers in tlio Sunday School, and trustees in connection with tho chape). Tho farewell meeting held in the chnpcl boforo this band of sojourners left for a strnugo land was ono which will never bo forgotten by those attending U. Very im pressive addresses woro dolivered, nnd suitable presents were mado, The minister of the circuit, the Rev, J. Barnos, said thnt at tho quarterly meeting of tho society it was thought by those present that tho re moval of tho Kctluy friends would bo a grent loss to tho circuit at large, and tho quarterly meeting instructed him to writo thorn a kind of testimonial or character which might be of somo littlo service to them. He had written a nolo to each of tho men, and had slated therein that tlioy wcro sober, honest, straightforward, and upright persons, nnd nil would agree that ho had not in tbo least exaggerated. Tho report which is taken from tho Skrembury Chronicle concludes ns follows The parties left Kctloy on Mon day to leavo Oakengntes for Plymouth by tho 2.15 train, A largo crowd assembled to witness tho doparturo, nnd, ns tboy passed from ono to tbo other, tho scene was most affecting, as those Icavmg bad been life-long inhabitants iu tho neighbourhood, and tboy woro deservedly held in the highest cstoom by thoir fcltow-inhnbitnnts. A large number accompanied them to tlio station, and the Rtntionmastcr generously admitted the fricuds on tho platform. While waiting for tho train, tho i>coplo joined in tho singing of 1 Shall wo moot beyond tbo river V which was song with much effect, Soon after this tho train steamed into tiic etatiou, and after wait ing about fivo minutes departed, taking with it thoso who lmd dono their best to raleo the moral condition of the people amongst whom they hnd lived." To this wo can add that immigrants of this class will prove a blessing to tho colony, and if a fow more thirties of of n similar calibre could be imported instead of thu ilk that camo to Queensland on board tbo Nowsbora, it would redound moro to tho credit of those who work tho immigration system at homo.. This band of Primitive- Methodists may rest- assured also that in leaving old friends and associations tbey will only find new friondB and associations, not the less hoartv, and not the less sincere than there left behind, An Alabaster Box,— Young girls find ing their complexion growing sallow, and thoir skin becoming rough or frcckly, resort to perfumed ointmoiits for a restoration of their bloom.
