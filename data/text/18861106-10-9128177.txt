Of the nine applicants who applied the others asked salaries ranging from £600 to £1100ayear Mr Back came here with the highest testimonials from New Zealand, and he had received private letters from gentlemen of public position in that colony speak in very highly of Mr Backs ability He left the New Zealand service voluntarily because he thought his chance of promotion There was small, as those above him were young men. It was too soon to express a decided opinion of the management as carried out by that officer here, but it had been sufficiently satisfactory to warrant the Government asking for this increase I Mr RUBFYsaid the local officers had not applied for the position because they under stood f quite what the late Premier had said, that it was intended to go out of the colony for a manager He believed if this understanding Md not been arrived at Mr Weedon would have been appointed, and would have made as good a manager as Mr Back The present manager had made enemies to the au way by his management, for Mr Affleck the miller had refused to send hyit,andtho local storekeepers and others were strongly opposed to the cheap Saturday trips With permission to take a hundred weight of produce or goods free JVIr Back had endeavoured to meet the objections, and keep up the railway receipts since the matter had been taken up, and he thought the in crease proposed did not make the salary too large for such an order JI to Mr. CONWAY said the salary was too high, and he would divide the committee upon it He moved that it be reduced by Mr HAWKES said he did not disapprove of the increase, but he was opposed to allow- ing the rails system compete with private enterprise "It v Vvl-Wf S I L I Mr DOOLI Y said the appointment was an instance of the cheap policy of the Government, because ,IJuiy/were told that all the other applicants required more.

Whatever enormity had been committed, it was due to the Minister of Lands who had brought Mr Back here under arrangement I The MINISTER OF LANDS explained that Mr. Black had been told that he would receive the same salary as his predecessor, but he was unofficially informed that the railway system was being extended, and an increase 1 salary might be voted as the work increased Mr BRADDON said that was therefore nato position the House was sometimes placed in They could not tell whether a picture of an increase had been made out ally or unofficially Mr FITZGERALD said he comes from the provision of allowing four or five people to take cow t of goods to the detriment of the district storekeepers, who could not got the goods at the same rule, could hal day be defended and he hoped upon re-consideration that he pi act He would be given up Regarding the unofficial promise he thought it would be sufficient to induce a gentleman to accept the position Mr BARRE ri Said there had been an amount of friction in the Railway depart t ment since Mr Back came here, that was very much greater than it had been during any there I of his predecessor storm of office The locomotive Superintendent upon whom a greater responsibility rested, and who had done his work in such a manner that it could not have been IOHO US sell by any man in the colony Was only receiving £100 a year I Mr BRADDON submitted that a considerable better results increasing the return as could be made by cheapening the ordinary fines to 1) curry and back further than by reducing the merely local rates The present into of fines to Formby, resulted in the car races' travelling empty, whereas if they were full of people, the expense would not be any greater Mr DAVIES said it was, not only the Western line, but the fines on the King is line should be reduced.

He deprecated the comparison between, Mr. Back and Mr Batchelor Thelattergentleroan, though better fitted for his work in every respect than any other man in Australia, probably, and one for whom he had the very greatest respect, did not hold such as proper i n( and responsible office as the manager of the railways The manager had to deal with matters in dispute between the Government railways, and the Main Line Railway, and had the control of an important and increas- ing department For these reasons he could not be contrasted with any subordinate however able and qualified that officer might be The question should not be dealt with from any personal point of view, the simple question being-; whether an officer with such qualifications and experience, and placed in such a position, should receive £000 I Mr TJ ÎR*I**tff>.T,T sorry that the gentleman referred to Who Had withdrawn his freight from the railway did not claim any concession J for himself that would not be given to others, and pointed to the reduction in freighton-the., Pi gal line that had been made to one company for the carriage of coal, which was not extended to others ' Mr DAVIES trusted the committee would pass the increase of salary, as they should I not begrudge an increase to an officer in charge of an important and constantly in I creasing department Various complaints had been made of the difference in charges for a freight upon the Fingal and Western lines. It was most unfair that differences of charges should be made, and be quite agreed with the Government that no , individual should expect concessions that were not granted to others He did not think the manager should be blamed for the changes that had been made, at the Ministry was responsible for having adopted the recommendations of their officer When the new manager had found there was an injustice existing in the charges that had been made, it was his duty to recommend the alterations that had been made. The question before the committee was simply what amount of salary the other should receive, and he thought GCB was not a penny too much to give to such an officer, Mr BARRETT said the Minister of Lands statement of the experience obtained by Mr Back was at variance with the infor- mation he had received If it could be shown at the end of next year that Mr Back had placed the department in the same state of discipline and efficiency as it was at the time of Mr Lords death he would vote for an in crease to that officer I Mr REIBEY said before the committee divided he desired to say that it would be very hard to refuse to vote this increase if the Ministry had promised it officially or unofficially, and he believed Mr Back had received some such promise 1 therefore, he could not look upon the amount as an in crease, but simply the fulfilment of a promise for which the Minister of Lands was responslble ' i r i j Mr FE1« TON could not see how it could be argued that it was not an increase when Mr Back was receiving Bill) this year and it was proposed to give him in a year next year He did not hit the increase was warranted and would vote against it Mr BRADDON said if Mr- Back had been led to believe that he would got £600 a-year, whether officially, semi officially, or unofficially, the House was bound to vote it If no such engagement had been entered into, then there was no reason for voting the in crease The Minister should let the corn iBittee know plainly what had been the" engagement, and then they could divide upon. | The MINISTER OF LANDER said he had tried several times to explain that there was no pledge Had Ministers only proposed to Vote £360 for Mr Bock this year they would have been carrying out their engagement. The engagement was plainly that the 'affair should be eyes, but upon Mr Back asking U any probable increase might be expected, ajnirpptntrng out that the works of the department was increasing he was told that in the ordinary way it - might be expected, Finding that he had discharged his duties i \- -* - is by and rain ability the government had proposed the increase, but they would have faithfully carried out their arrangement' if the salary of' last year (£950) had better again, proposed i i not " j Mr. FITZWERALD/itaid the Minister had witness pu$,tha,iiiattei* in comprehensible Colonel Stf""HIÉL supported the' idea Being passed as proposed, as Tib believed Mr" Back was, by his experience and shrewd in tative knowledge of men, an acquisition to the colony As to the changes that had been made in the organisation and working of the department, Ministers' should be held responsible 2 w 2 5 The amendment that the item be reduced by £50 was then negatived upon the following division, will / j Miss, 8 - Messrs.

Mr CONWAY then moved that the item be struck out. He was perfectly satisfied that the department was in a disorganised state, and that what had been said about the officers abilities and experience was simply leading the House astray Mr Back was over paid and under worked, and had superseded officers who were better qualified than himself Whoievorhe went on the railways managed by this officer he found everyone was dissatisfied and complaining of the management Mr HARTNOLL thought the motion of the hon members would be a departure from the usualpiacticoof the House which was to accept a defeat graciously He had voted for the reduction of the item, and believed a better appointment could have been made, but he could not support such a motion as was now moved , Mr CONWAY After what the hon member has said I will withdraw the amendment Mr I J. ho item was then agreed to J Item - Assistant Engineer, £37 - was seal cod to ^ On sub items Launceston Superintendent, £100 | i he TRF MEURER moved that the amount be increased by Hi) 1 The item as amended was agreed to i On item Gratuity to Mrs Daldy, £300 The TREASURER said this item had been brought down at the request of the hon member for II Franklin, and he cordially i soon mended it to the, consideration of the committee Mrs Daldy was the widow of the late police magistrate at Franklin , 1 Mr. BIRD supported, the item, and stated the circumstances of the case , (Mr CONWAY asked has long who officer, was in the receipt of £300 to year The TREASURER said that Mr. Daldy had only received 2300 a year for two years, and joined the service in lcUJ., On item Recreation ground, Latrobe, £200 was agreed to I ltom-Insuronce.Twins steamer, £6210a - was agreed to On item Repairs to roads and fences and improving and is maintaining Franklin Square and Queen's Domain, and improving Barrack reserve- The TRHÎAStJRERlWoVèd'that the' items' be increased by £300, as it had been gene' rally wished that the amount - should be in creased to what it. was formerly, II ,.., ,",.,, ,,,, [lir.-BARRB-rr.^ped^tho oxueii.litui-0,, would not entrusted. to we corporation, The TREASURER S It is expended under li-áíúttfeTvliHtm of the Minister of'Lands;-»1'" 'MrCf,CONlWAYothoiightiiHobartiBO» too inches taipUblio. receives. the same ,- > vi!

Under the old Act, the managers of Savings Banks were restricted to investing their money in real security, but they had since been allowed to invest on debentures and a practice. had grown up of investing a certain amount in the other banks It was found, however, there was no' legal authority for this practice The liability to loss was very limited, and the money was distributed over a certain number of banking institutions The savings banks of New South Wales had more than half of their deposits out at fixed deposits, and th practice also obtained in Victoria and South Australia If these amounts were not fixed deposits, they would probably be as current deposits without earning interest He trusted hon members, for further consideration, would come to the conclusion that, as the liability to loss from the stability of their banking institutions was so ' small, they would be doing the right thing in passing this bill The bill had already been passed I by another branch I i Mr LETTE drew attention to the fact that the bill had been rejected by the House on a previous occasion As far as his memory served him, no such case had ever taken place in this House, as of a bill being put upon the notice paper in the same position as when it was rejected In " May such a thing had been allowed, but in this House it had never taken place. '1 The SPEAKER Does the hon. member rise to a point of order? Mr LETTE Yes, in I t | The SPEAKER said there was no doubt in his mind as to the power of the Attorney-General to take the course he had done The matter was perfectly plain When the bill stood for its second reading the motion was " that the bill be now read a second time. The House decided that it should not then be read a second time, so that there was nothing to preclude it from being brought forward again. Had any hon member moved that the bill be read that day six months or three months, it would be clear it could not be brought on again Because the hon member for North Launceston could not remember such a case, there was nothing to preclude the bill from coming on again Such a practice was authorised in " May Mr BRADDON thought the House should have been convinced by more forcible arguments that this bill was required The House thought, on the former occasion, that the banks would be given an opportunity of risking the money of depositors, and this was the objection he had against the bill If the bill were passed, he would like to see some limitation placed upon the depositing powers of the Savings Banks Dr CROWTHER said he would reverse the vote he gave on the previous occasion, as having made enquiries he found the bill would be an advantage The money was equally divided amongst the banks, and could be withdrawn at any notice, and he did not hesitate in granting the powers asked It would give the Savings Banks a minimum of 1 I risk with a fair rate of interest I Mr FITZGERALD said he too would I reverse his vote upon this occasion, blaming the looseness of the manner in which it was introduced for the previous failure of the bill He did not know that the practice of deposit- I ing, as adopted in the other colonies was the best, as he thought security should be taken, and instanced that in London the Metropolitan Board of Works, took security for its deposits at the London and Westminster Bank, which, next to the Bank of England, was the largest and soundest financial institution in the world However, as that would be such a disturbance of the commercial institutions here, he would support the bill, but he hoped that the amount would be divided between the banks at Hobart and Launceston, the strangest bank not being overlooked -, I Mr YOUNG said it had been found that the fixed deposits did not give that security which the smaller depositors in Savings Banks should receive the difficulty was that they had so much money they did not know what to do with it A He thought they should be content with a smaller rate of interest, and invest the money in Government debentures He believed that the institution was being used by depositors for the purpose of a current account, getting interest that they would not get in the ordinary banks Savings banks were not meant for this purpose He could not see that any new information had been given to induce the House to retrace its steps " is so"' The ATTORNEY GENERAL said he had given no further information-! than he had given before, except as to the amount of deposits at fixed deposit in Victoria, nor had he used any additional arguments..; The motion, was, agreed to ,, j In committee I Clause 1-" Savings Banks may place out money on fixed deposit"- 1 [ Mr REIBEY said a member of the South, Australian Legislature had been s present ; when the bill was thrown out, and had said the ; House had done wisely, pointing out what would have happened in South Aus-, trana lad the Savings Banks' money been, deposited in the bank which failed there recently He thought the bill should contain a provision that the money should be divided between the four local banks Mr W T H BROWN said he had altered his decision to vote against the bill from information he had received outside, but he would still vote against half the money was not divided between the different banks Mr FITi5GLRALD_.thQUght the best way to overcome the difficulty was to divide the money between the banks in proportion to their reserve funds and secured financial position The ATTORNEY GENERAL thought it would hardly do to provide that the money should be defined as the trustees might not care at some time to place any money in one or more of the banks for reasons that would be sound to them. He thought the case might be met by a proviso that no greater sum than £20 QUO should be deposited in any one bank, which would necessitate spreading it over several banks Mr HARTNOLL said that would not be wise as one bank might be able to offer good security for £100,000, while another might not be considered sound enough to deposit £20,00 in it Mr BRADDON suggested that there should be a proviso that not more than 25 per cent should be so deposited. Mr YOUNG said both provisos could he met Mr HARTNOLL said the Bank of Australasia, which was the only unlimited Just tution in the colony, could take the whole sum, giving the most perfect security Mr BRADDON moved the following proviso as an amendment,-" Provided, that the amount so placed out at interest on fixed deposit shall not exceed 10 per cent of the amount deposited in such Savings Bank The amendment was adopted, and the clause as amended, was agreed to The bill was reported, the amendment agreed to, and the bill read a third time and passed THE FOREIGN IMMIGRATION PETITION 1 The SPEAKER mentioned the matter of the petition, signed by Germans and Danes, presented by the hon member for Westbury at the commencement of the day a proceed mile, about which he had, confers ted with the hon member It appeared that the petition was signed by a number of G,eimauaaud Danes, and in the English House of Commons the rule was that any petition could be received from foreigners residing in the court trying whether the petitioner wore naturalised (as many of them were or not, the petition could be received so far as that was concerned I But I there were two other gi olinda which he thought would prevent its reception 1lhepaperhau4edinbythehou reply he was merely a translation of the petition, and a copy of the signatures-the hon, mern, bar saying had it translated for the benefit of the'House-'but as it was not an original document it could notice received Another reason why it could not be receiVed was that it prayed for money " I i 't r a ".

' .traulwrn»** Was The MINISTER OF LAND? said when the hon member spoke of the hardship to Small farmers he forgot the very large amount that a large sheepoWner had today He supposed a man with less than 400 sheep would be called a small sheepowner, and the con- tribution on 100 at 5d (one farthing) would only be 8s 4d The smaller farmers would derive benefit, not only from the action of the department in preventing scab in sheep, but in carrying out the Rabbit Destruction Act. Each should pay in proportion to the benefit he would derive from the department, and towards an insurance fund The sheep owners were all agreed to it, and he was quite sure the result of the simultaneous action that would be taken all over the colony in connection with the Rabbit Act by the aid of the additional inspectors that would be op- pointed would benefit every farmer and reduce a post that was damaging the property of the colony Mr PILLINGER said this proposal to in crease the contribution was made year after 'year though it was constantly thrown out, and he hoped it would be finally thrown out now It had not the support of the sheep owners as was stated, for the few who met together it were not the sheepowners of the colony. He was quite certain if the country were polled to-morrow there would be a majority of the sheepowners against it. The rabbits were decreasing year by year, and just because there were some districts were they were allowed to thrive oil farmers were to be taxed at a higher rate Those districts should be specially taxed for the work and not the districts where they never saw rabbit Mr BRADDON thought this was the third time the Treasurer had tried to increase the Scab Act assessment, and he hoped the attempt would be as unsuccessful as the others. The object of it was to assist in the eradication of the rabbits and Californian thistle The TREASURER The Thistle Act provides for inspectors Mr BRADDON did not believe in taking money for one purpose and using it for another The impost should be confined to the districts which it more immediately concerned The MINISTER OF LANDS said it was the persons who had nothing to pay who were generally those who were most opposed to this Act In West Devon the w ole amount paid was £47, but in his district all sheepowners were quite willing to pay even ld or 2d per head to keep up a sufficient staff of inspectors It was a matter of immense importance to the colony, and if the tax paying capacity of the sheepowners was not kept up to the fullest extent, the onus of making up the taxation would fall upon the other members of the community Mr HARTNOLL did not think that persons residing in non infested districts should be called upon to contribute He would have great pleasure to support any amendment which would have the effect of confining the tax to the infested districts Mr LYNE would support the tax if it was called the Sheep Inspection Tax, and was kept down to it He thought the general revenue should have its share, as it was a matter of importance to the whole colony Mr FENTON moved an amendment to exempt those farmers owning less than 200 sheep It was more desirable that the destruction of rabbits should be paid for by the sheepowners, rather than out of the general revenue 1 s p Mr REIBEY thought the proposal was an attempt to force unjust taxation upon Parliament to help the large, Sheepowners If the House would not reject the proposal, he hoped the House would continue the tax to the districts which were infected'. The MINISTER OF LANDS gave the hon. member for Westbury every credit for believing he was advocating the cause of justice, but he reminded him that every 1 sheep owner in the island though perhaps not 0 infested now was always in danger of the pest reaching his property Some men who strongly objected to the Scab Act were glad now that the Act had been passed in spite of them. He agreed with the new member for Glamorgan as to the name of the Act being unfortunate, and he would use his influence - with the Cabinet to get the objectionable ¿ name changed i Mr MACKENZIE was opposed to the in " crease I Mr LYNET opposed the amendment. 1 Mr W, T H BROWN would support the tax. He represented the working classes in his district, the rich men a clubbed Jto turn limestone, but he ? looked, at the subject fro^aljepaitpolntiof=! view The time had gone by when the *' working classes benefited by rabbits The large owners' could not afford to employ them, and rabbit skins had become of little value The prevalence of this pest had also affected the towns, as those in country districts had not so much to spend. He advocated the use of poisoned grain as a panacea for the rabbits, stating that he had, used it most ' effectually, killing off his own rabbits and those of his neighbours Notwithstanding: ¡. this, there was a fine collection of magpies on his estate of I Mr PILLINGER considered this an: unjust tax, and he always opposed unjust taxes It was always put on a sheep, but year by year sheep were being driven out and cattle were taking their place. For example, the hon member for Campbell Town run 1000 head of cattle, which was equal to 6,000 sheep, and so he, escaped the tax to a great extent. He i recite! the recommendations of the inspector of stock, that cattle be included in the tax When going round his constituents, at Tunnack, he was asked by the small farmers there, if it was right that they should be asked to pay for clearing, the rabbits on his run, and he said " no ' If the hon member for Campbell Town was willing to pay 6d per head on his sheep, why did he object to pay >-> on his cattle 1 J . Mr W T H BROWN said that his estate 3 4 of Ellenthorpe was essentially a sheep run At present he only owned 40 beat 1 of cattle, and at the end of the month would not own r one except a milch cow .
