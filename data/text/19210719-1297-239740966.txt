The "Herald" tells you:— "A crowded house laughed almost incessantly . . there was much enthusiasm . . . the ul timate achievement of the evening."

Mfos Browne bad a fine reception ... her grace and charm." Agrees the "Times":— "Mian Browne acts as successfully as ever she did" (and how successful that is has been left as nn enduring record in theatrical history by ber work In "Our Miss Gibbs.") The "Sunday News" goes further and contends:— "Miss Blanche Browne has developed . her pio» ture of girlhood is a more bouneing, romping thing than It was in the 'Floradora' dayjw Sat urday night's audience probably bummed 'Love around tbc comer' and 'It's great to be married, as it went to bed." .
