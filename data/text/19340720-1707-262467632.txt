Denmark Sees Hope for Exiles in World Pact ADOPTS POLICY OF WATCHFUL WAITINGâ€”HAS 1,800 REFUGEES (J.T.A. Special Correspondence.) COPENHAGEN, May 22. The Danish government has adopted a policy of watchful waiting in connec tion with the treatment afforded, to the 1,800 expatriates from Nazi Germany who have found a refuge in this coun try. According to information imparted to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency a few days ago,-* government representa tives have given careful consideration to the legal and economic status of the refugees and have conferred with Lea gue of Nations' High Commisisoner James G. MacDonald, of the German Refugee Body. The attitude of Copenhagen might be summarised as follows: The Dan ish government is not unwilling to give the right of remaining in the country to those refugees already here, insofar as opportunities for employment now exist. The government is reluctant however, to be the first government to hike initiatiy/e in this matter and is waiting until other nations join in reaching an understanding with regard to their immigration. There- is a fear among government officials that if Denmark shows itself more favorable in the matter of open ing its doors to the refugees, the pos sibility exists that a great wave of ex iles might swarm! into the country. This is a situation which Denmark will of course not relish. It is hoped that an international agreement among the refugees will eventually be reached.
