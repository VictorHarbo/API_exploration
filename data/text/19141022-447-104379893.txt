It8 growth has been continuous during tbo last century, particularly since the founda tion of the new Empire in 1871. Before the war it was increasing at the rate of over 800,000 per year, due mainly to the surplus of births over deaths, and to a small extent to immi gration from neighbouring countries. The emigration of Germans into foreign coun tries was much smaller than the emigration from England; but there was nevertheless a large number in every habitable part of the globe. All European as well as oversea countries have a mare or less large German popula tion, running very often into six figures. The aggregate number of Germans in tho world in the current year, as far as cau be estimated, reaches 100 millions. Large numbers of foreigners live in Germany. Austrians, Hungarians, Poles, Russians, Italians, Dutch,, French, and Danish to a large extent settled permanently in Germany, because opportunities were greater there than in their native countries. The foreign population proper in Germany amounted at tne census of 1910 to 1,259,873. More than 50 per cent. were Austrian nationality (634,983). Dutchmen came next with 144,175, followed by Russians (137,697), and Italians (104,204). Of British nationality there were 18,319 people, as against 16,130 in 1900.

Almost three fifths of the population live un der urban conditions. The number of people engaged in agricultural pursuits has re mained stationary since the beginuing of the last century, while all increase of popu lation during the last fifty years has gone to swell the town population.
