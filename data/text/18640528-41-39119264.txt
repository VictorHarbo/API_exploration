The Norman, from Liverpool, arrived on Thurs day evening, after a tolerably fair passage. On leaving England for the lirst two or three days she experienced hard gales with drizzling rain, and on the 22nd April some heavy weather is noted in the log: but otherwise it has been marked by gentle and fine breezes. The Got schooner made an admirable run hence to King George's Sound; but from contrary winds the return trip has not lteen performed with equal celerity. She arrived on Thursday night, bringing portion of a cargo of Western Australian timber and 45 passengers. The Fanny Nicholson, from Sydney, was boarded on Friday morning, and immediately afterwards made signal for steam, and proceeded into harbour. The Black Ball Liner Ocean Chief was towed to the anchorage on Thursday night. At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon it was supposed there would not be sufficient water on the bar to allow her to cross it, and the tug in attendance left to bring in the Codan. Another pilot, however, boarded the Chief, and resolved to make an attempt, which was done with a successful result, for the vessel dropped anchor in the roadstead at about 10 o'clock. YE38EL Spoken.— By the Fanny Nicholson— On May 23, off Cape Bridgewater, the ship Japan, from Newcastle bound to Batavia. Jack-s Sea Chest.— When the Cuba proceeded to the Lightship the ship's cook was desirous of leaving the vessel, but his design becoming known to the officers no opportunity was afforded him. On Thursday night, however, he managed to get his chest of clothes removed from the forecastle to the quarter^boat, intending to lower away and make a bolt. The boat was suspended from the keel : consequently, when Jack cut the gripes, she capsized in the davit tackles, and the client fell, making a splash which aroused the mate, who rushed on deck with the idea a man was overboard, but found the very contrary, for Jack was tena ciously clinging to the boat, whilc-thc chest drifted ustern. Wlien the master boarded on the following morning, instead of the man exhibiting any sorrow, he commenced such illustrations of pugilism as induced the captain to send him on shore rather than be bothered with a refractory hand ; consequently Jack accomplished his purpose, though with the loss of all he possessed in his sea chest The Codan was towed to the Port on Friday morning.
