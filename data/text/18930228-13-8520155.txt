MONSTER by AND COMMERCIAL. The Argus Office, Monday Evening. The London Chamber of Commerce Journal for January discusses the subject of " Trade Depression and its Remedy," stating the existing position as follows, viz.: 1st, depressed prices of commodities ; 2nd, reduced wages ; 3rd, maintenance of restrictive tariffs; 4th, the silver difficulty. While the commercial condition of the United Kingdom is not satisfactory, the Journal finds that the economic situation of each of the leading groups of states throughout the world, on which British trade depends I for its det elopment, is even less satisfactory. The Journal proceeds to review the position of each group in detail, and with regard to this part of the world writes : " The Australasian colonies are still suffering from the combined effects of overdrawing their credit and from indulging in costly experiments of state socialism." The result of the survey is that the Journal is of opinion that the improvement of British trade must come from the unaided efforts of the British people. This is merely a truism, for British trade has always possessed the attributes of independence and self-reliance in a high degree. Without re- capitulating all that the Journal has to say upon the measures necessary to be taken, we quote the following passage with regard to trade relations between the United Kingdom and the colonies : " It has become our accepted principle in trade matters to submit, practically without protest, to any tariff limitations which other countries chose to apply. These limitations have been for the lasted > and continuously on the ascending scale, and are admittedly one factor at least in the present depression. Since It is our consistent policy not to retaliate against these excursions we should at least seek compensations in the shape of new developments or new markets for our t rode. This can most easily be effected by the opening up of those of our colonies which place the few est tariff restrictions upon our Mares, or legislate against immigration. Our self- governing colonies have become, with our consent, as far as trade and colonisa- tion are concerned, foreign countries, so that the volume of our trade with them cannot be influenced from this side. But the lesson which results from this season that contradictory position, may enable us to deal more satisfactorily in the future with those colonies which remain integral portions of the United Kingdom. Profiting by the experience with the older colonies, and the unsatisfactory results of our financial dealings with new and foreign countries, such as some of the States of South America, we may be more disposed to invest capital under the British flag, where it will be subject to our own laws and assist in opening up markets which will be free to trade without tariff barriers. It may be advisable to stipulate, clearly the condition that loans and investments in these new colonies are made subject to future freedom of trade and to the right of British subjects to emigrate to, and settle under the British flag in, the new territories. We should also apply the same principle to any future concession of independent gay ornament to any of these states, and necord H only in exchange for freedom of trade." Arrivals of breadstuffs in Melbourne and Geelong by railway from the country districts during last week, according to the Government returns, compare with those for the previous week as follows: ARRIVALS OF WHEAT AND FLOUR.

Exports of breadstuffs on account of the present season, as shown above, amount to 11.78 tons. In converting Hour into the equivalent of wheat in the fore- going table we have assumed that it takes 48 bushels of wheat to produce a ton (2,000 lb.) of flour, plus cattle. The" local wheat market is steady at 3s. 11d. to 3s. 2d., and a considerable business has been done at the latter price. Malting barley is quiet at 4s. 3d. to 4s. 4d. for prime samples.

It will he seen from the table which appears below that the low prices recently ruling for oats have enabled shipments to be made to the other colonies on an increasing scale. Maize has been irregular. Some business has been done, at 4s. 6d. (200 hugs ex wharf) and Is. 11d., but the Sydney market is advised us being weaker, and at close. 4s. is quoted, Teas have had fair sales at 2s. 3d. to 2s. 4d., at which prices any lots coming" forward are readily placed. Last week the quantity of peas received at Williamstown direct from the country was 0,(i!)t bags, in addition to which nearly 4000 bags were transferred from Melbourne ; while 724 bags were shipped to London, as per particulars below.

To-morrow Greig and Murray Limited will offer catalogue of 2,000 packages Queensland sugars. In connection with the Brisbane Heads it was reported in our columns that Messrs. F. and A. Names lost 400 tons sugar, but we are advised that the quantity was only six tons. Arrivals of sugar at Melbourne last week consisted of 1,200 bugs from New South Wales. Exports consisted of 100 bags, 200 boxes, 34 packages, and 5 casks for New South Wales ; 280 bags and 194 mats for New Zealand, 083 bags to Tasmania, 314 bags and 1,511 packages to South Australia, and 233 packages to Western Australia.

The following is from Messrs. G. White and Co.'s report upon the course of the London market in Indian and Ceylon teas from January 15 to January 1!) : " Indian Sales have been heavier than those of last week, amounting to 47,100 packages against 42,100. In sympathy with most produce markets a quiet tone prevailed, the dull and exceptionally severe weather having interrupted business, and over SOO breaks, consisting of 11,100 packages, were withdrawn owing to the offer- being under limits. Prices of pekoe souchong and broken teas have been fairly well maintained, but pekoe and broken pckocH passed Irregularly, though chiefly in buyers' favour. Fine and finest ruled firm without any material change. The first closing shipment of the season was sold on Monday, representing 74 packages of the Mint Co.'s growth, which realised an average of 1s. 6d., while a fine In- voice from the Land Mortgage Bank of India's Moon's lakelet estate, with full autumn flavour, fetched is. 6d. On account of the strong statistical position, importers (Judging from the reduced quantity adver- tised) are not so anxious to sell, and the elections should, as is usually the case at this time of the year, gradually diminish. Tile average obtained for 25,500 packages sold on garden account is tOld. Telegrams from Calcutta state that only 8,000 packages were offered there to-day. There was a quieter tone and an easier tendency', but no marked change in values. The average obtained on the 12th Inst, for 12,000 packages was nine annas. Ceylon Although again large, the quantity brought, forward was rather less, viz., 19,500 packages, as compared with 21,200 last week. The dark and gloomy weather somewhat interfered with Tuesday's sale, and prices were not maintained, especially for pekoe and broken pekoe, which in many cases declined Jil. Pekoe souchong were also easier to the extent of 4d. to 4d., the lower quotations being partly due to inferior quality as compared with previous arrivals of the same marks; Fine and finest show unusually good value at present rates. The average is slightly under 10½d., against lOJd. last week." Cornsacks have been sold at 5s. 11d. A fair business has been done in bran bags at Hi. 7th.', and some woolpacks have been placed at 2s. 2d. duty paid.
