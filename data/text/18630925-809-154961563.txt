Keon have terminated their farewell engagement at the Princess's, not to re-appear in London till they liavo returned from the Australian colonies. In tho short time of their sojourn among us, how much has been done ! ' Hamlet,' ' Othello,' ' Tho Mer chant of Venice,' which aro three of the principal plays bequeathed to us by Shakspeare ; tho portion of ' Henry the Eighth ' in which the genius of our great tragedian is most prominently shown ; ' Louis XI,' naturalised upon our stage by Mr Kean's excol lent acting : and Coleman's pleasant comedy of ' Tho Jealous Wife,' represented with such exuberant humor i that it is almost impossible to identify poor Mr Oakley and his tyrannical spouso with tho Danish prince ? and his conscience-stricken mother. These pieces, wo say, represent no small amount of mental or . physical labor to be performed within eleven days, c Every one of the principal characters severally put c forward on the list belongs to tho highest depart- j I ment of art. Mr and Mrs Kean have left us amid i 1 acclamations and hearty wishes of success in a new ind untried region, fairly earned by many years' toil endured in tho best of causes, the maintenance a jt tho national drama ; and their admirable per formance during tho last engagement at the t Princess's, newly impressing so many vivid images '5 3n our minds, renders -us more painfully awaro of ae magnitude of our loss.
