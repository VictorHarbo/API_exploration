FEiffiAL BUDGET SURPLUS PAID jNTO ? TRUST ACCOUNT. SMALL NET SURPLUS REMAINING Departmental Economy and Reduction of War Debt MELBOURNE, Thursday. The Federal Treasurer, Dr. Earle Page, delivered his Budget speech to-day, the delivery occupying 75 minutes. The following is the financial position dis closed, and a verbatim report of the speech, with portions deleted1— Last year's transactions showed a surplus of revenue over expenditure of- £2,127,415. This amount, with the surplus of ' £659,529 brought forward, gave an accumulated surplus of £2,786,944. Of this amount £2,500,000 was paid into a trust account for naval construction, air services, science and industry research, and debt redemption. The net surplus remaining is £286,944. 1926-27 ESTIMATES Revenue ? ? .. ? ? £51,382,000 Expenditure . ? ? £51,232,619 . , Surplus ... .. ? ? ? £149,381 EXPENDITURE I The chief .increases in the actual ex penditure 1925-26 ovier tho estimate are as follow: — Interest and Sinking Fund on War Loans, War Pensions and other war services . . £311,405 Invalid and Old Age Pensions 472,382 Bounties and other Special Appropriations . . .... 195,348 Ordinary votes of Depart ments ? ^ 130, 752 Other increases and decreases —net increase . . . . . . 64,367 ?Total increase ? £1,374,251 The main increases in the expenditure on war cervices arc iu connection with interest on war loans and .war nen sions. The estimated interest was based- on the assuintpion that, on the conversion of the £67,000,000 War Loan in December last, only one-half year's interest at the inccased rate would fall due for payment within the year. Tlie Conversion Loan, however, was floated with the right of contributors of new money to receive interest from the date of their subscriptions. War pensions exceeded the estimate by £143,664. The estimate ifor inijfljpd and old age pensions expenditure -was calcu lated on the basis that the increased pension of 2/6 per week would come into operation in January Increased payments operated from last Septem ber. The effect of tho wine export bounty, I together ..with preference granted by Great Britain, enabled Australian manufaicturers to .compete witii Conti- 1 nentaJ wiiies 'even more successfully than anticipated. Jlie bounty ;ac-j tually ' paid, due to fhc 'increased cx- ! port, was therefore £172,109 in excess of the estimated An unanticipated amount of £26,992 was paid to the ! Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited in accordance with the Oil Agreement Act 1926. The balance of the increase i under bounties and other special ap propriations is made up of iron and steel products bounty £31,005, and sun dry other increases and decreases. Of the (increase in Treasury expendi ture, £38,183, is for minting silver coin to renlace British coin withdrawn from circulation. The tactun-1 Tcoinagc 're ceipts duo to the profit on this replace ment were £207,036 in cscess of the Estimates. The sum of £25,466 was provided for science and industry in vestigations, whereas when the Budget was framed it was contemplated that this amount would be paid from a trust account. The increased interest on loans raised for the States result? from the estimated loan raisings being 'exceeded. This money is recovered from the . ' ^UBPLTJB FOE YEAH .

Iu Addition it was decided to rcducc the rate of In terest tpayabV by the States to 8 per cent, after 31st December, 1930. iFormal agreements (have now been signed Iby the Treasurer of the Com monwealth and the Treasurers of the several States covering the whole of tha aranaements between the Govern ments in regard to Soldier Land Set tlement. The agreements aro subject to ratification by t3ie several Parlia ments, and will shortly be submitted to Parliament. CANBERRA. In accordance with Hie decision that Parliament shall open at Canberra in May, 1927, the Commission has od justed Its aclivitics with the object of completing the necessary buildings by that date. Provision is made in tho I Loan Estimates for raising a loan of £3,000.000 on behalf of the Commis sion. Various public buildings aria nearly completed; the Government, Printing Office has been erected and I its machinery is uow lieitig installed. The construction of 500 houses in ad dition to Wiose already in existence is 'being arranged for. Four hostels are provided for in tho building scheme and contracts have been let for four large gucsl-houscs. Rfaads, water sup ply, sewerage, tree planting, and other services- are proceeding. MURRAY RIVER AGREEMENT. Tlie amount of £252.500 has been placed on t hjs estimates as the Com monwealth Government's contribution for works during the year. Each of fno Hhree contracting State Govern ments is to provide a similar' amount. Three completed weirs and locks are. In operation. It 1s expected that during, the year 'three further weirs and locks will be completed. Thie total cx_ penditue to date amounts to £4,230,000. Wire netting. ' To assist the State Governments to extend their schemes for ^providing settlers with material for v-ermin- proof fences, the Commonwoilth Go vernment lasrt year undertook to lend £3,000.000, at lie ratje of £500,000 a year for six years, at concession rates, of interest- The proposals of the Com monwealth haying recently been agreed to by several States, the Go vernment- will -shortly _ bring down a pill 10 ClJCCt -IV 11' piwiinoc. ?

The total Commonwealth and State debts, without allowance for assets ?created by the ?expenditure of loan moneys on public works amount to £899,892,535. The gross debt of Aus tralia per head of population is £166. AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCIL The loan operations of the Common wealth and of the States, othor than Now South Wales, were und'artaken during, the past year in accordance with plans made by the Loan Council. Ex perience has shown that tlie Treasurers, acting in concert, can secure better terms tliaji if they acted independently. ' The Commonwealth floated four loans last yeaT. The first of the scries was tlie simultaneous borrowing of £15,000,000 in New York and £5,000,000 in London, and was dealt with in my last Budget speech. Tlie second- was the conversion of the £67,000,000 of war loans -which matured in December, 1925, and proved an un qualified success, though it was the greatest financial operajtdon cvoV at tempted in Australia. Following the conversion, a new Com monwealth loan, onlbehalf of the States, was over- subscribed. The rate of 5J per cent, is well es tablished, sales -of ' Commoinvealtli stocks now taking place freely in the open market on a basis yielding about 5j per cent. Within the last few weeks the Commonwealth has, by private ne gotiation raised a local loan of tl .600,000 on behalf of the States at this rate. During last month the Commonwealth floated a loan in London of £6,000,000, the interest being 5 per cent, and the [price of issue £99/10/. COMMONWEALTH BANK The Commonwealth Bank profits of the last three years, namely: 1923 £328,000, 1924 £261,000, 1925 £452,000, show that the bank is making progress under normal. conditions and under the new management. The savings bauk branch of the Com monwealth Bank shows remarkable ex pansion. In 1915, the deposits amounted to £7,400,000; in June, 1920, they were £1S,000,000, and in the next six months ?thev increased' to £35,300,000, chiefly as result of the taking over of the State savings bank in Queensland. On De cember last the deposits amounted to nearly £44,000,000. ? In *1924 it was estimated that during a few months Australian products to the value . of £140,000,000 would be availablo ' f or Bklcs overseas. Already ?primary producers are &eing; compelled to accept £95 in Australia in respect jof every £100 secured ovorseas by the 'sale of their goods, -and itt®ouic cases exporters -were (buying exchange for ward, . receiving ouly £93/5/ tor each £100 in London. A serious position was averted' 'by the decision of the new directors to lend notes to the other ] banks up to £15,000,000 to enable them | to finance exports. This action imme diately enabled sales of produce ito be continued. The saving to tho com- I munfty arising out of 'the 'wise hand ling of the situation by the Common wealth Bank can scarcely be indicated j in figures. There is no idoubt that it amounted to many millions of pounds. The action of tho bank in the crisis of 1924 has sometimes been criticised ?by ithosc 'who have not -realised the gravity or the complexity of the -situa- tion. They appear to think that the Commonwealth Bank itself could have I dealt directly with the producers, in- | stead of promising assistance to the - bther banks. Such a course was im pijacticaSile. To give one reason only, j it -may 'be pointed out that, to prevent inflation which might have been per- ; mancnt, with tho consequent lessen- 1 ing of the purchasing power of money, it was necessary that -the advances be i repaid within a definite short period, this repayment could not have been depended upon in the ease of individual^ advances to producers, but the banks could be so depended upon. The banks did not avail themselves j of their full rights under the arrange ments. Actually they (borrowed, sums ! which at no time exceeded £2,800,000.. They paid interest: to the Commonwealth iBank at the Bank of England rate of the day, and they Tepaid all the ad vances within a few months. RURAL CREDITS DEPARTMENT The Rural' Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank is passing safely through its initial stages.' '. Already it is handling wheat, frozen eggs, dried fruits, wines and osmirjdiirm. Allegav tions that the Rural Credits Depart ment has been unable to function in particular oases on investigation have been found to Ire based upon instances in which no proper security for ad vances could be given.' The Act re quires that the produce on which ad vances may -be made shall be placed under the legal control of She bank. i-iiis -Jtrgai cuubivi uiuy »uc gncu vivuvi , by way of ddbenturc or by placing the produce in a store or on a ship, and by handing the covering documents to the bank. Iii every case there must, of ' course, ibe sufficient margin between the value of the produce and the advance. No good purpose would be served in taking uncommercial risks. It is in the interests of the primary producers themselves that the -rural credits bnsi ness , shall 1-e conducted on a sound basis. ,;r V GOLD STANDARD After more than a year's experience, it x-an be said that the return to tlie gold standard was effected in Austra lia without 'financial disturbance, and the free export of gold has been main- : itaiped- without any difficulty.

HOUSING In accordance 'with the policy an nounced prior to the last election, the. Government in consultation with the Board of the Commonwealth Bank is preparing the details of a scheme to be submitted to Parliament to enable the Commonwealth Savings Bank to assist . in the provision of homes for the people, both by new construction and by purchase. For this purpose funds up to £20,000,000 iu all will be provided.

The increases of Common wealth expenditure are almost wholly a result of a policy which meets the legitimate demands of tlie people — as in the case of Old-age Pensions and Defencc. The expenditure under the ordinary votes of the departments during the j last six vcars is as follows: — 19-21-22, £2,952,475; 1922-23, j £2,772,920; 1923-24, £2,668,710; 1924 25, £2,758,448; 1925-26, £2,874,463; 1926-27 (estimate), £2,7{-4,141. In .tuis period the annual expenditure has been reduced by ,£158,334, notwith standing that in the meantime the population has increased by approxi mate!* 600,000, and despite the fact that 'arbitration awards have consis tently increased salaries and othdr costs in all the departments. In 1921-22, the cost of the Commonwealth De partments per head of papulation was 10/9; in 1926-27 it will (be 6/2. If the expenditure 'in 1926-27 were made at the per capita rate of 1921-22 the expenditure would he £3,290,951, or an increase of £496,810 over fjiat con templated. DEPARTMENT OF REPATRIATION The cost of war pensions is Still in creasing owing to tlie Ibirth^ of child ren to pensioners and ito liberalising the conditions under which pensions are granted. No immediate reduction in the num bers applying for medical attention is anticipated. ?Certain factors such as imireased age, progress of disease and complications of yrav 'disaUilitlcs with the -ordinary diseases of civil life arc likely to cause the numbers to be main tained throughout the ensuing finan cial year. DEFENCE The five-year programme announced in the Budget, of 1924 to improve the army, the navy, and the air services, and to enlarge tho organisation of a munitions supply, is being actively pursued. Tho 'building flf two 10000 ton -cruisers, two submarines, and a seaplane-oawier is proceeding. The Government has agreed to mako a payment to the Nciv (South Waes Go vernment of £135,000 as a subsidy to wards the cost of a. floating dojk at Newcastc, on the understanding that the dock will be capable of accommo dating. the new -cruisers. Provision is 'being uiadc for t-he /building and filling of an oil tank. INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS The hope that the researches of the Royal Commission on National In surance would be sufficiently advanced to enable tne u-overnment to nneg down, during last financial year, a national insurance scheme in connec tion with old age; and sickness, un fortunately, has not been realised. , The large nuuiber of new claims which have been received shows that i the increase of pensions to £1 par week has 'been greatly appreciated, by ; the old aiid, infirm. In the nine months from October, 1925, 'When the increase to . El a week began to tper ate, more than 21,000 new pensions have been granted.,/: The number of pensions , at preBentlini force is, ap proximately 176,000, .an increase of more thin 13,000 during -the year after i allowing lor deaths. The amouni paid. in pensions during 1925-26' was, £8,252,382, It is -&timated; that 'Ci amount oi £9,000,000 will be required j for pension purposes daring 1926-27. WOOL - ? , . After the suspension of -wool sales in .March, 1925, selling was resumed | iu July, and continued witboni inter- i ruption thereafter.'

DAIRY PRODUCE During the vear tlVc Kxport * Control Board has saved the industry nearly £20,000 per annum by obtaining a re duction in marine insurance, lias re gulated- the export .of 'butter to Great Britain, and, in co-operation -with its Loudon agency, has been able to pre vent -violent fluctuation in priccs. The improvement in quality brought albout bv pasteurisation, the standard isation -of the product under tho na tional 'Kangaroo' ibrand, and or derly marketing, have resulted in bringing the London prices of Aus tralian butter to the New Zealand level aud almost to 4he Danish. The Paterson seheine has at the same time assisted to maintain local prices. Trade with the East in ihutter, cheese, and other dairy produce has expanded* WINE The bounty paid on the export of sweet wine, .together with the pre f-?rcuc-? given in *Grcut Brituiu; lifts abled Australian wines to compete with the products of continental coun tries, 977,000 gallons of Australian sweet wine having been exported to Great Britain. EGGS The annual value of the production of eggs is now approximately £10,000,000. An enicouraging ex port trade has been developed and regulations will shortly be issued pre scribing the grades and standards for export. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE 1926-27 The estimated revenue and expen diture of business undertakings for 1026-27 are as follows: — . iPastuiasicr-Goucral's Department. | Revenue, £11,441,000; Expenditure,; £11,294,480; surplus, £146,520. Commonwealth Railways. — Be venae, £499,000; expenditure, £963,368; de ficit, £464,368. ' . The net doficit, therefore, on 'Busi- ness Undertakings' is £317,848. The Post Office can an no way be characterised as a taxing maeh'.ne, whilst the loss on Commonwealth railways is provided out of general taxation. POSTAL SERVICES It is estimated that the revenue from all sources for 1926-27 will 'be £625,749 greater than that for 1925 26, and represents an increase of 6 per cent., and the estimated expendi ture of the Department' provides for an increase in 1926-27 of £639,600. Arbitration awards have gircatly in creased the expenditure, and with an extension of postal, telephonic and telegraphic facilities, further increases 1UUSL 1)0 lOOKCQ' ever, arc offset by an iuc-roasc iu the earnings of tbc Department. During I925-2G approximately 41,000 additional telephones, were connected, of which 18,210 were in the metropoli tan areas. It is anticipated that in 1926-27, 46,000 additional telephones will be installed, of which 25,000 will be iu the country areas. COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYS The cxtciision of the uniform gaugo into Adelaide has been recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Commit tee on Public Works, and will con siderably increase the traffic on the Trans-Australian Railway, as ' the breaks of gauge at JSalgoorlie, Port Augusta and Terowie have greatly hampered and restricted business on j the railway. „ . ' - , I Tho working expenses of the North rfrii Territory railway, including In terest and Sinking Fund, are estimated at £192,800, bciug an increase of £30,' 506 over the actual expenditure of the previous year. The estimated re ceipts are £76', 000 for the current year, ibeing an increase of £37,121 over the actual receipts of the previous year, leaving a deficit of £6,615 less than in 1925-26. To December 31, 1925. the Oodna datta railway was operated on behalf, of the Commonwealth iby the South Australian Railways Commissioners, and for the second balf of the year Iby the Commonwealth Railways Com missioner. The total loss for the 12 months, not including Interest and Sinking Fund, is £105,936. It is an ticipated far the year 1926-27 the loss on the working of tbc railway will be very much reduced. The cost of working the Qucan ,beyan-Qawbexra -railway 5a estimated at £14,236, and the revenue is estimat ed at £22,500, thus showing a surplus of £8,264. The surplus iu flic previous yealr was only £2,434. TJie improve ment in tho position fan ibe attribut ed to the greater activity in connec tion witb tibe establishment of the Federal capital.
