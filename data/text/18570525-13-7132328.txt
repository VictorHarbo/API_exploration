COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. Argus Office, Saturday Evening. i he export entries for gold passed to-diy at the Customs amounted to 578 ounces only, the whole being for Hong Kong, in the Hebi and Queen of the Seas. There has been a per- fectly inactivo market since the doparture of the Qreat Britain, but prices are unchanged. The brokers are now buying at-£3 16s. par ounce for Castlemaine and Sandhurst ; £3 16s. 9d. for Mount Korong ; £3 17s. 8d. to £8 17s. Cd. for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Creek, and Avoca ; £3 17s. to £3 18s. for the Ovens ; and £8 18s. 6d. to £3 19s. 6d. par ounce for Ballaarat. The reports from the gold-fields havt not b6en of groat moment this week. At Ballaarat several deep sinkings are abaut being bottomed, but we are without partícula- s as to the results. At Maryborough and Dunol y tbe greatest aotivity prevails ; new ground having been opened up on the Emu Greek, Eugle- hasvk Gully, Hard Hill, and near the ¡Maryborough Police Camp. The specimens recently obtained at M'Intyro's will bo exhibited shortly in Melbourne. At Tarren- gower, nuggets of 29 and 14 ounces have been taken out on the " Seventy-foot." and rushes to that spot and to the Mia-Mia had taken, place. At Bendigo complaints of want of water were beginning to be made before the ltd o seasonable fall. This old-established gold-field contributed a larger quantity thau usual to the last escort ; and we are glad to notice that machinery of the very best cha- racter is being ereoted.to aecuro to the quartz miners the reward of their enterprise, without IOES either of time or of the precious metal. An engine of 60 horse-power, with an immense boiler, and with machinery in proportion, has arrived at Bendigo, and is being rapidly put together in a convenient locality to the minea on the Victoria reef, and the proprietors are making arrangements to lay down tramways to several of the shafts. The enterprise is a great one, and is well deserving of success. The weekly escorts have not boon up to the nverago this week : ozs. dsvta.

Exchange on England remains at 2 per cent, premium. Drafts against gold are pur- chased at 1 per cent, premium. Freight oa gold by direct steamers and sailing vessels 3Ad. per ounce, deliverable in London. In- surance li per ceut. The money market was very quiet at the leginniog of the week, the approaching de- parture of the Great Britain occupying the attention of capitalists and the mercantile publ ic. Towards the close, speculation sprung up again. Melbourne Gas and Coke Com- pany's shares have advanced to 85 per cent. premium during the last few days, and Mel- bourne and Hobson's Bay Railway shares to £95, at which transactions have taken place. Holders were asking £100 this morning. The active movement in these shares is caused by the successful opening and the large receipts of the St. Kilda branch. There are buyers of Geelong and Melbourne Railway shares at £22. The Colonial Treasurer has advertised for tenders for tho purchase of ono hundred and eighty-seven thousand pounds' worth of transferable and remittable Government de- bentures, bearing 6 per cent, interest, the principal to bo repaid at the following dates : 20 debentures to be payable in 1858,201 in 1859, 200 in 1860, 200 in 1861, 200 in 1802, 200 in 1863, 200 in 1864, 200 in 1865, 200 in J866, 200 in 1867. The de- bentures svill bo issued under the authority of the Act of Council l8 Victoria, No. 40. The conditions under which the tenders will be received are as follows :-" 1st. Each tender must be for an oven sum of hundreds of pounds, and muat state the yoar in which the tenderer wishes the debentures ho tenders for to bo payable, and whether in Melbourne or London, and also where the Intorest is to ba payable. 2nd. The tenders must be sealed and endorsed 'Tender for Government De- bentures,' and addressed to the Treasurer. 3rd. Should the tender be accepted, debentures in the form set forth in the schedule A to the said act will bo issued for (£100) one hundrei poun ds each, secured upon the general revenue , of the colony of Victoria, and made a first charge thereon, and will bear interest from the 1st July, 1857, at the rate of six pounds (£6) per centum per annum, payable half yearly, on the 1st January and the 1st of July, the first payment of such interest being due on tho 1st Januaiy, 1858. 4th. Any change in tho place at which the principal or interest is payable may be made by_ the holder giving six months notice, in writing, in the manner prescribed by the Act. 5th. The debentures will bo made payable to the holdors, and will pass by delivery, without assignment or en- dorsement. 6th. The amount tendered, if accepted, must be paid in cash oa or before the 1st July, 1857. 7th. No tender below par will be accepted." These tenders will be opened publicly, hefore the Chief Secretary, tho Treasurer, and any members of the Legislature that may de- sire to attend. Mr. John Mackenzie reports sales of an al- lotment of land at St. Kilda, 40 feet frontage by 165, for £372; two lots in the village of Kew, J acre oacb, for £100; 26 feet frontage to Bourke-strcot west by a dopth of 70 feat, £2,080; 19 half-acre allotments at Kew (inter- mediate situations), for £950 ; an allotment at BacchUB Marsh, 165 acres, for £247 10s. In the produce markets there has been no- thing doing, beyond a few private sales of wool st full rates. The demand for hides and tallow has been less active since the Sarcels for the Vanguard have been made up. n the former article the recent advance has been maintained. In the import market the spirit of specu- lation which sprung np soon after the arrival of the Simla has been full of activity, and nearly every article haB been more or less affected by it. The sudden and unprece- dented advance in all descriptions of grain, and the largo sums which have boa i made in the course of a few days by thoa 3 who were fortunate enough to be holders, have brought many buyers into the market. This advance appears to be the natural on sequecce of the discovery that stocks urj much lower than they had been estimated ia all the Australian colonies, and that no fo- reign shipments aro expected. The movo- . ment in flour on Friday and this day has b3« i ' equally sudden, and is not so easily to be ac- » counted for. A rise^in oats and other home- j feed, exercises, as a matter of course, an influ. j ence upon the price of wheat, but in the pre. | cent relative condition of stocks, wheat cannot loDg maintain a proportionate price to other grain, the ona grain being plentiful and all others being undoubtedly Ecarco. The re ports of sales in the rcmuiks attached to .prices current have lieeu collected with core, and may" bo relied upon. In t't? Íresent state of excitement, it is impo3Siblè o predict which way prices will tend. Our papers from Tasmania are to the 20th instant. Prior to tho arrival of the Royal Shepherd at Launceston, with the news of tho rise in oats and grain here, speculators had been buying up oats at 10s. to 10s. Od. per liUBhel. Since that time, speculation had teen rampant, and every available bushel of oats had changed hands.,/."The Cornwall Chronicle, of tho 20th inBt., remarking on the stateof matters just montioned, says If thorn wore largo quantities of Oata stored (or salo in this colony, wo should advise holders to dispose of ? tho article as quickly as possible at tlio present rates, 9s. Od. to 10s. od. per bushol ; but tho colony is almost drained of the whole crop, and wo boliovo there is but little moro than will bo requisito for seed loft boro. The demand for primo soco is geueial In all tho neigh- bouring colonies, so that with such an enormous con- sumption as thoro Is for horse- feed in Victoria, it will require largo importations there to pull the prices down. Very largo shlpmonts aro known to bo ou the avay from England and Calcutta, but It will probably bo soiuo t huo bofore tho Bupply arriving from thonoo exceeds the doinnnd. Thoro is no domand for olthoi Wheat or Flour boro, oxcopt for local consumption, the prices remain as usual, Flour ¡Oil por ton i Wheat, D8. Od, to Os. por bushol. We have Mauritius news .to.tho 7th April hut our papers are only down to tbe 4th o' that month. The proposed alteration in th< times of departure for the mails has boon car ried out. For the future the mail that loavj London on the 10th instead of that whicl leaves on the 20th will be the mail brough hy the steamers from Aden, and a stca.m.ei will leave Port Louis about the 14th of o.er.' month. By this arrangement the stoatne for Mauritius will arrive a day after titi eteamer from Suez, and a day bofore th steamer from Calcutta, thereby avoiding al chance of delay for mails and passenger: There will also be ample time between th arrival and departuio of the Mails to reply ti letters received. The Commercial Gazette, in noticing th bieak-down of the Oneida, asks " Why do no the Australian colonies arrange for a hi monthly Mail by way of Mauritius ?" The exports of sugar to the Australia': colonies had been 32,002,200 lbs. u to the 24th March of the current yearagains 20,188,207 lbs. in the same period of 1850 and 14,406,004 lbs. in the samo period of 185: The total exports for the period wer 102,553,908 lbs. in 1857, 182.700,294 lbs. ii l8û(J, and 141,438,090 lbs. in 1855.

For somo wooks past arrivals have boon moderato, , and with a steady consumption. Stocks of goods which from largo accumulations . had booomo . almost unsaloable, havo boon enquired for and have . realised in many Instances much iuiprovod prlcos. i During tho lattor portion of the wook speculation liaB baen s-ory considerable. , Liquors.-Tho lato advance in brandy is fully sup- ported, but Is confined to parcels imported by houses ! whoso voracity con be roliod on, and wbilo svo quote ïlartoll's,- Hcnossey's, and other genuine Bhippor's brandies as roodily saleable at our named pricos, tho . largo quautitioa of flotion brand and label offor >. ing, aro without quotation, and saloablo only at ratos far bolJiv thoso of genuino articles. ¡ Tho ne! vaneo in brandy has given an impetus to gin, rum, and ivhiskoy, which aro moro inquired for, al ' though at a very slight advauco. Bottled boors conti ,' nuo In steady demand : prices for genuine Importa \ tlons aro fully supported, but the oxtent to whioh tho bottling trado is being carried on (supplied svith laoola . of ovory shipper of reputo) causes suspicion, parcicu I larly svith country buyers, and tends to dopress prlcos. I Draught boors aro dull of solo, except for best brands, 1 in prices of svhlch no alteration has ocourrcd. Wines of all descriptions continue dull of salo, and beyond I supplies tor Immcdlalo uso but little Is doing. j Flour, Qrnin, &o.-Tho; flour market, wbleh has for somo time post exhibited but littlo activity, has within ) the last fosv days becomo oxoosslvoly livoly.

Purchases have boon chiefly for specula- tion ; but as It is patont that country buyors havo licon holding back for somo wooks past, and must I consequently be short of stock of this article, svo see no i canon why tho presont, or ovnn an imjirovod rate, should not bo supported to a moderato oxtent; at tho 1 samo timo It must bo borno in mind that ilio prosout ndvanco is almost conflnod to South Australian flour, i and should holders of othor growth bo induced to I force tho market svith foreign suppllos on hand, the prouts of speculators may bo precarious ; and it is i scaiccly uoodful to worn buyors that tho rapid In- crease in valuo in this commodity will bo quickly re I spoudod to by suppllos from our South Australian neighbours. Brou has been sold to-day in considor I nblo parcols at 4s , and salon aro reported as high as d8. 3d. per bushel, but for tho lattor wo do not vouoh.

Split pous, oatmool, and othor substitutos for oats, for liorso fed, aro in good demand, and commanding full quoted ratos, Malzo Is scirco.and consumers are anxiously look- ing for arrivals of tho now crop from Sydnoy and Now Zoalnnd. Rico continues an articlo of speculation, and though wo cannot record any particular advanco, wo rom irk that prices aro well supported. Provisions.-Our late remarks still hold good as regards those articles. Realty primo aro roo- dily saloablo at full quotations, while inferior and Injured sorts aro nearly unsaleable. Good first Cork butter Is hold for Is. Cd., and Hkoly to advauco in valuo. Oilman's Stores continuo to iinprovo. Tho lato vast accumulations of stocks aro diminishing, and, with moderato arrivals, bettor prlcos may fairly bo rockouod on. Camilos aro of vory roady sale. Stocks of Belmont Bporins nro becoming low, causing an improvod do liiand, and bottor prices for Fronch and other kinds. Dried fruits quite sustain tho lato improvement ; and as tho season of tho yoar iudiicos greater con- sumption, no decline in valuo con bo looked for. Orocorlos.-Toas aro still looking upwards. Good serviceable congous aro worth £7 10s. to £3 5s., sihieh ratos lix the valuo of other sorts of black. Greens aro scarce, in good douiand, and fully support quoted prlcos. Cotices continuo vory steady. Suppllos aro mode- rate, and tho increasing domand for svlntor consump- tion will doubtless couso further Improvement in I prices in the absence ol increased supplies. Sugars arc In good roquestfor consumption; loto sales havo shown the disposition to buy. Tho last cargo offered wont at full rates. Throe cargoes aro to hand, but with a short supply in stock, modorato onantltios on the diggings, and a marked inclination for speculation, wo think there Is uo doubt of presont I rate« being maintained.
