BISCUITS.— Thorc aro 170 of these biscuits in ono pound weight, and are much appreciated by connoisseurs. GUEST, nnd Co. hare received the following letter from an unknown correspondent, who, as a dyspeptic sufferer, gratefully acknowledges the benefit he hn derived from the use as a diet of their Celebrated T.It.G. Biscuit:— "21st February, 1901.— Messrs. T. B. Guest and Co. Prop. Ltd.— Gentlemen. —When you put T.B.U.'s on tho market you had every reason to expect that they would prove a sneceff, and I trust that they hnvc dono so. In advertising that they arc much appreciated by con- nofancurs, you only state part of their triumphs. They arc the lightest, most wholesome and most digestive biscuit an invalid or dyspeptic can cat, as I have experienced to my great benefit. For yours I have had a dlltirulty in not being able to eat a' hearty breakfast, hut about three months Ago n phase of Indigestion— farninceous dyspepsia— prevented my being able to eat either bread or toast for my morning meal, and the rub was, what could take their place! I tried rereral biscuits, but without success, till T.B.G.'si were happily suggested to mc. On trying tbcni, 1 found thcui exactly the thing. For about three months they have boon my principal breakfast food, and have enable mo to gain . woiglit and strength, and. what Is more, they seem so suit able to my cane that I luivo not tired of them. I am vciy grateful. I appreciate them in a way no connoisseur can, for I do not know what my state of health would have been to-day but for them. Except n? to publishing my name nnd address, you can use tills 'letter if you desire to do so in any way you IDEAS.
