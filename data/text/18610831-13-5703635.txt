The ship Rosalie had left Manilla for Ilo Ilo to load a cargo of sugar for Sydney. The celebrated Black Ball clipper-ship Lightning arrived at Port Philip Heads late on Thursday even- ing, where she anchored, and yesterday morning reached Hobson's Bay, when she was placed alongside the Hobson's Bay Railway Pier. She left Liverpool on the 12th June, had light and variable winds to the Equator, which was crossed on the thirty third day out. Thence she has accomplished one of the quickest runs on record, namely forty-four days. She is still under command of Captain James Clark. She brings a very large number of passengers, who have enjoyed very good health during the passage, no death, through sickness, having occurred. On the 30th July, when in lat. 41.05 S., lon. 11.50 W., a sea- man named David Davis fell from the mainroyal yard overboard. The ship was going over fourteen knots at the time, and although every exertion was made, he was unfortunately drowned. The ship is, as usual, in first-rate order, and reflects credit, on Captain Clark and his officers. The ship Atalanta, with Government immigrants, anchored in Hobson's Bay yesterday afternoon. The classification of the immigrants is as follows :— 20 mar- ried couples, 278 single women, 3 single men, and 28 children. The ship is under medical charge of Dr. Willams, and no sickness has occurred during the passage. The steamship Royal Shepherd arrived in Hobson's Bay at 5 p.m. yesterday, having left George Town at 2.15 p.m. on the previous day. Captain McEachern reports having experienced strong N.W. winds, accom- panied by heavy squalls. VESSELS SPOKEN BY THE ARIJ SCHEFFER.—July 25, Pleno Lune, ship, of Glasgow, lat. 2deg. 49min.
