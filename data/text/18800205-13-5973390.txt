POLITICAL SUMMARY. Parliament re assembled to wind up the business of the Assembly on 20th Jan- uary. The proceedings in the Legislative Assembly were in the first instance of a violent and outrageous character, conse- quent for the most part upon new tactics adopted by the Ministry. The Opposition proceeded to discuss some of the disputed votes in connexion with the Estimates, and Ministers, headed by Sir Bryan O'Loghlen, resorted to the policy of time after time clearing the galleries. The exasperation thus caused led to a per- sonal encounter, occasioned by one of the Ministerial members proceeding to as- sault a prominent member of the Opposition. The incident sobered the House, and disgusted the country. The leaders of the Opposition stated at the next sitting their conviction that it was useless to attempt to transact business in a Chamber so demoralised; the remaining Estimates have been passed almost sub silentio, and the prorogation takes place to-day. The dissolution is to follow immediately, and the general elec- tion is to take place before the close of the month, the new House to meet early in March. When the Assembly met (January 20), the Estimates were proceeded with, and a stormy discussion took place on the Shorthand-writer department, tho Oppo- sition commenting on the fact that while Black Wednesday officers were un- employed, a new post had been created for the son in-law of the Chief Secretary. The next night attention was called to the official report of the Audit Commis- sioners on the Embassy vote, to the fact that accounts had been called for, and had been refused by the Chief Secretary. Three times during the evening the galleries were cleared by Ministers. An ex- Minister had just spoken on the Embassy vote, showing how the law had been dis- obeyed, and how no other Minister had ventured to take this step, when the Attorney-General again " applied the gag," as the proceeding is termed, and, in the absence of the reporters, the mem- bers came from words to blows. The scene is described elsewhere. On the following Tuesday the Assembly met, apparently heartily ashamed of the proceedings of the previous week, and with a resolution to wind up business. Mr. Munro, on behalf of tho Corner, rose to express the anxiety felt in that part of the House that the session should be brought to an immediate close, without further debate, and he muted Mr. Berry to state his in- tentions with regard to the transaction of public business. Mr. Munro was ap- plauded on both sides. On the motion to go into committee of supply, Mr. Laurens rose to call attention to the practice of clear- ing the galleries, and Mr. Berry then interposed, and stated that the Government desired that the discussion of debatable questions should bo deferred until the new session. Mr. Mclntyre, Mr. Joseph Jones, and Mr. J. G. Duffy in turn said that while they protested against the special report of the Audit Commissioners as to the noncompliance with the law being passed over, they would reserve their remarks until the new House met. The vote for the Chief Secretary's department was then passed nem con. Members set to work, discus- sion was not tolerated, and by 9 o'clock the four departments of Education, Mines, Railways, and the Post-office had been disposed of, the sum of Â£1,790,000 being thus voted to Her Majesty. A bill to amend the Land Act, by enabling all selectors to come under the bill of last session, was pushed through all its stages, and on Tuesday, February 3, the Appropriation Bill was disposed of. A bill was introduced by Mr. Gaunson to amend the Theatres Act, in order to take away the power of arbitrarily pro- hibiting performances now vested in the Chief Secretary, and to put the stage on the same footing as the press- namely, to allow theatres to say what they pleased, and make them responsible at law for the consequences. A short but animated debate ensued. SIr. Joseph Jones was severe In his condemnation of a system which allowed a play to be prohibited on the whisper of a spy in a Government office, while Mr. Bent contrasted the severity of the treatment of the Aca demv of Music with the immunity allowed to the Ministerial organ, which had been permitted to publish "the immoral piece" in full. Mr J. G Duffy remarked that he thought the bill was unnecessary, as no Govern- ment before had been guilty of the petu- lant, stupid piece of tyranny complained of, and no such Government would be found again. At the same time the hon. member expressed his gratitude that the power exercised did not apply to the press, or the Gazette notice which said The Argus must not be believed, would have stated that it must not be taken in. The Daily Telegraph, instead of being punished by tho withdrawal of Govern- ment advertisements, would have been suspended, and the fate of Punch must be left to the imagination. Ministers had taken the plebiscite from France, and apparently they hungered and thirsted for French censorshlps also. These re- marks brought up Mr. Berry, whose opening words that a defence of the "Happy Land" was to be expected from an Opposition whose tactics "were falsehood, misirepresentation, and slan- der," elicited a shout of defiance on the one side, and an answering roar from the other, and all became con- fusion. Mr. Service, amid much excite- ment, moved that the words be taken down, and a battle ensued, Mr L. L. Smith and Mr. Fergusson screaming chal- lenges, and Mr. Bent and Mr. Gaunson responding. Mr. Service was the first to cool, and he admitted it was no use going on with his motion; he was powerless to punish the Chief Secretary, and he must be content to put the fact of the charge having been made on tho records of the House, and allow it to be contrasted with the repeated admissions of the Govern- ment that the Opposition had been cour- teous and conciliatory, and had facilitated the transaction of business. The bill was ultimately withdrawn. Mr. Gaunson stating that perhaps ridicule enough had been cast upon Ministers in connexion with the matter. The English version of the play was afterwards performed at the Academy of Music, Mr. Berry having no objection to the burlesque so long as he is not included in it. The Postmaster-General has distin- guished himself by making some charges of improper promotions and other unjus- tifiable acts against his predecessor in office. Mr. Ramsay made a defence which was accepted by the House as complete, even Mr. Berry admitting that his colleague's statement was reckless and unfounded. The approaching elections now absorb attention. An important manifesto has beon addressed by the Hon. J, Service, the leader of the Opposition, to the elec- tors of Maldon. The major portion of it is devoted to the reform question, the relative issues being clearly and succinctly explained. It is pointed out that His Excellency, in accepting Mr. Berry's ad- vice for a dissolution of the Assembly, has submitted for the decision of the constituencies the plain and simple question, " Do they desire that the Reform Bill which was introduced by the Government during the pre- sent session, and which failed to secure the necessary statutory majority, shall yet become the law of the land." Mr. Service trusts that the electors will unmistakably signify that they will not sanction any such proposals. He then contends that a settlement of the vexed question of reform is quite possible, and that the Berry Government is the only obstacle in the way. He asserts that the difliculty can be speedily and satisfactorily settled by the adoption of the scheme which he submitted some 14 months ago, and which he still adheres to as a simple, reasonable, and effective method of reform. The utter helplessness and incapacity of the Government in dealing with matters of finance are exposed, and the un- fair incidence of our present system of taxation, particularly in respect to the farming interest, is lucidly explained. Mr. Service aflirms that the new Parlia- ment must grant relief to the farmers, miners, and the manufacturers by such remission of taxation as will lessen the cost of production. Mr. Berry addresses the electors of Geelong on Monday next. Branches of the new Liberal Associa- tion, of which Mr. Munro is presi- dent, have been established in many parts of the colony, and the association seems to have a future before it. The electoral rolls are now complete, and show that the number of ratepayers qualified to vote has increased from 154,021 in 1878-9 to 160,443 this year, while the number on the general roll has increased in the same time from 27,569 to 39,135. The 1877 rolls used at the last elections comprised 148,926 ratepayers and 32,293 on the general roll. Tho total number of voters is now 199,578, as compared with 183,454 in June last and 181,219 at the date of the last general election. There has been an increase of 6,842 in the num- ber of voters on the general rolls, while the number of ratepayers has been in- creased by 11,517. SOCIAL AND GENERAL. The fortnightly service between Melbourne and Galle begins with the present mail, and the Ii M S Indus will go from Melbourne to Southhampton, via Galle and Suez, without transhipping passengers or cargo. It is ex- pected that through trips like this will be made at regular intervals. There has been some fault-finding with the new contract on the part of a section of the Ministerial press which favours the employment of steamers making direct trips from London to Mel- bourne, but nothing has been said against the P. and O contract in Parliament, which has accepted the arrangement without objec- tion. It may be recollected that when the Government advertised 12 months ago for tenders for carrying the mails on and after the 1st February, 1880, the P and O. Company was the only one that made a formal offer, so that the Government had no option but to accept the proposals of that company, which were a great improvement upon the old terms, giving us an 11 knot fortnightly service for Â£85,000 a year in place of the 10 knot four-weekly service for Â£90,000. Eflorts were made by the Government before accepting the tender to obtain offers from the com- panies running large steamers direct from London to the colonies, but none of a prac- ticable nature were procurable Though there has been no difficulty over the con- tract, there has been delay in arranging the terms on which letters and newspapers are to be carried by way of Brindisi since the Southampton route has been dropped. No communication has been made to Parliament regarding the matter, but from correspond- dence between the Chief Secretary and the agent general's department in London it has been ascertained that the Govern- ment are willing to allow the Imperial authorities to retain 3Â½d out of every 6d, collected on letters posted in Eng- land, 2d being for the inland rate on inward and outward letters, and 1Â½d the Brindisi charges. They have at the same time decided that tor the future the rates for all letters posted in Victoria shall be 6d , and for newspapers 1d , in place of 8d and 2d , the old Brindisi rates. The Governments of New South Wales, New Zealand, and Tas- mania have declined to adopt the same re- duced tariff. In New South Wales it is feared that the San Francisco service, which is maintained by that colony in conjunction with New Zealand, would suffer if the Sydney people were allowed to send their letters by the more expeditious Brindisi route for the same postage. The Tasmanian Govern- ment have objected to the new rates on the ground that they would cause a loss of revenue, which the postal department cannot afford to forego. The other colonies interested in the Brindisi service approve of the reduction. It is worthy of remark that letters by the San Francisco route are carried across the American continent, a distance of 3,400 miles, at the cost of the Bntish Govern- ment, so that it hardly rests with New South Wales to complain, if in a similar way no special charge is made for the conveyance of letters between Brindisi and Calais. In our summary published on the 22nd January we announced that the duplicate submarine cable had been laid between Singa- pore and Java. Last week the contract was finally completed by connecting Banjoe- wangie (Java) and Port Darwin (North Aus- tralia) with a second cable. Duplicate sub- marine communication, therefore, is now available between Australia and Singapore. The work has been carried out under the guarantee of a subsidy from the colonies of Now South Wales and Victoria, which will make arrangements with the other colonies. In return for the subsidy, Government and press messages are carried at reduced rates. By having two cables in operation th Eastern Telegraph Company are able to shorten very materially the time of trans- nitting messages. The Exhibition commissioners, fearing that Victorian manufacturers would be rather backward in applying for space and sending in contributions, have been holding public meetings for the purpose of arousing a little enthusiasm among intending ex- hibitors. It is the aim of the commissioners to get the Victorian section completed in every respect by opening day. Up to the 26th ult, when the first meeting in Mel- bourne was held, 45,000 feet of space had been applied for out of the 100 000 feet available for the colony, of which 11,000 feet were asked for by the Railway department. The time for receiving applications does not close until the end of the month. Steady progress is being made with the erection of the Exhibition buildings. There will be 40,000 feet of cool cellarage space for exhibiting wines, beers, and spirits. Arrangements are being made for holding the Social Science Congress, which is to be one of the special events of the Exhibition season. The congress will be opened, under the presidency of Mr. R. L. J. Ellery, at about the same date as the Exhibition. The elec- tion of presidents and vice-presidents of the six departments into which the congress is divided has taken place. Sir William Stawell was chosen president of the department of jurisprudence, but found it impossible, on account of the pres- sure of the work falling on him as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, to accept office. The vice-presidents of the same department are Sir Archibald Michie, Q.C., and Dr. Hearn. The members of the Education de- partment have placed Dr. Moorhouse, Bishop of Melbourne, in the position of president, Mr. E. E. Morris, principal of the Church of England Grammar School, and Professor Elkington, of the Melbourne Uni- versity, being the vice-presidents. Dr. McCrea, who was supported by the medical societies, is president of the health department, Messrs. Joseph Bosisto, M.L.A., and Mr. J, T. Rudall, taking the positions of vice-pre- sidents. In the fourth department-"Agri- culture, horticulture, and pastoral pur suits"-the Hon. W. .T. Clarke has been elected president; the vice- presidents being Baron von Mueller and Sir Samuel Wilson. The department of "Economy, Trade, and Manufactures" has returned the Hon. Thomas Loader at the head of the poll. Dr. Hearn is senior vice-president, and Mr. W. K. Thomson is his colleague, a very excel- lent committee having also been selected. Sir Redmond Barry has been elected presi- dent of the sixth department;-" Literature, Science, Music, and the Fine Arts," Bishop Moorhouse and Professor M'Coy being the vice presidents The news of the arrival of the Strathleven at Gravesend on the 3rd inst, with her ship- ment of frozen Australian meat in perfect condition, has been received with great satisfaction, as a market has thereby been opened for the sale of the surplus fat stock of Australia, and London can now be provided with additional supplies of fresh meat. Hitherto meat has been ex- ported from the colonies cooked in tins. There was one attempt to send home fresh meat packed in ice, but it failed at the com- mencement of the voyage through defective arrangements. The success of the present experiment will be of extreme value to the stock breeders of Queensland. Subscriptions still come in freely in aid of the Irish Relief Fund, and the appeal made by the central committee has met with re- sponses in every inland town. The collec- tion of subscriptions, which have been ob- tained from all classes, and by no means confined to Irish colonists, would be pre- judiced by the violent language of Mr Par- nell, as telegraphed hither from America, were it not clearly understood that the pro- moters of the fund at home are concerned solely to relieve distress, and that the moneys raised here will be impartially distributed. Up to date the total amount received by the central committee in Melbourne has been Â£11,700. There have been several unusually hot days during the fortnight. On the 27thult the quan- tity of Yan Yean water consumed in Melbourne was 18,000,000gal, and the total consumption for the week ending at 6 a m on the 1st inst was 94,000,000gal. Since the extra mains were laid down no complaints have come from any portion of the city or suburbs of scarcity of water; but the water supply de- partment has found it necessary to put a restriction on the use of garden hoses during the hot weather. In inland districts, par- ticularly the Wimmera and Avoca, the want of rain has been seriously felt, and local sup- plies are failing. Experiments in boring for water at considerable depths are being carried on under the direction of the Lands department. It is believed that the under- ground supplies between the Dividing Range and the Murray are extensive, but little has yet been done in a systematic way to render them available in seasons of drought. In the neighbourhood of Melbourne, the weather has been unusually dry and warm, even when southerly winds were blowing and it has been remarked that the sea breezes have not had their customary effect in cooling the heated air. The last week of January is generally regarded as midsummer, so that warm days at the present time are not wholly unexpected. In the grain-producing districts the dry season has been favourable to harvesting operations. Large supplies of wheat have been coming to Melbourne by tho newly opened Goulburn Valley line to Shepparton and Tatura and the resources of the Railway department have been taxed to the utmost. The heavy produce traffic of January and the opening davs of February has had a good effect on the railway returns, which would otherwise have been low. The tail of a large comet was discovered in the south western heavens, near the hori- zon, on February 2 soon after sunset. The nucleus could not be seen either on the 2nd or 3rd but about 2_deg length of tail were visible. The extremity of the tail on the 2nd reached to Ã Gruis, and next night it had shifted considerably to the northward so as to pass close by 0 GruÃ­s. On the first night it made an angle of 50deg with the horizon, and on the second 80deg. Owing to the misty state of the air and the closeness of the comet to the sun, no favourable observations could be made in Melbourne on the first or second night. The latest notes on the sub- ject will be found elsewhere in this issue. It seems likely that Victoria will be repre- sented at the exhibition to be held in Brussels in September, on the 50th anniver- sary of the independence of the kingdom of Belgium. The matter has been taken up by Mr Beckx, the consul-general in Melbourne. The hands of the commissioners for the Mel- bourne Exhibition are so full that they have found it impossible to render Mr Beckx active assistance, but it is expected that arrangements may be made to send some of the articles in the Sydney Exhibition on to Brussels. The Minister of Railways is building two carriages for the use of the Prince of Wales should His Royal Highness visit the colony while the Exhibition is open in 1880-1. Two locomotive engines for use on the light lines have just been imported from the Baldwin works at Philadelphia, at a cost of Â£2,900 each. They have been purchased as pattern engines for imitation by local manu- facturers should they prove adapted to the colony. There are seven different forms of engines on the Victorian lines. Until a change of Government takes place the Harbour Trust will be able to make little progress with the principal features of the scheme of harbour improvement prepared by Sir John Coode. Minor works, like the re- clamation of the foreshore at Williamstown, to cost Â£5,000, and the dredging of the river Yarra, are in progress. It came to the know- ledge of the commissioners that the Minister of Lands was to be influenced to let allot- ments along the route of the proposed canal, but in reply to a question put in the Assembly Mr Longmore said he would not do so. For some time past the Trust has been unable to obtain any reply to correspondence addressed to the Government. It was directed to give up writing letters to the Customs de- partment, with which the commissioners always maintained courteous relations, and communicate only with the Attorney-Gene- ral's department, which department then proceeded to treat all its applications with silent contempt. Last week a complaint was made to the Chief Secretary, who stated that if letters for the future were addressed to his department they would be answered. The above is a specimen of the petty annoyances to which the Trust has been subjected by the present Ministers merely because these Ministers are opposed to the measure under which the Trust was established by the McCulloch Government. In the metropolitan constituencies where its operations are un- derstood the Melbourne Harbour Trust is regarded as a most useful body. In consequence of improvements in Col- lins-street west, and the enlargement of the Hall of Commerce into an exchange, the well known "Verandah" has been taken down. For many years past all brokers business in stocks and shares has been con- ducted on the pavement under this verandah. In future the stock and share market will be held within doors. _The Wesleyan Conference of Victoria and Tasmania met on Thursdav, January 22, at Wesley Church, Melbourne, and sat for several days. It was resolved that a com- mittee be appointed to take into considera- tion the subject of the relation of baptised children to the church and prepare resolu- tions for the conference of 1881. The con- ference was chiefly occupied with the arrangement of district affairs. Recruiting in connexion with the local Artillery Corps has been given up. The men, as vacancies arise, are drafted into the police force, and it is calculated that if no further recruits be taken on the corps will eventually be totally absorbed. A large number of drilled men have already been passed into the police since the corps was established. In volunteer matters there has been nothing doing during the fortnight, beyond the gazetting of a few promotions of officers. Since the failure of the Crown in obtain- ing a conviction against the promoter of "Miller's sweeps", no proceedings have until very recently been taken against the projectors of similar undertakings. The legality of these sweeps was, however, tested in the City Police Court on the 27th ult, the result being that they were declared contrary to law. Henry Cohen and Robert Cohen, tobacconists, of Elizabeth-street, were the proprietors of a 1s sweep on the Melbourne Cup, for which they sold tickets, and which was drawn by them at their own premises. Evidence was given proving these facts in a case against Henry Cohen, and he was fined Â£15, with 10 guineas costs. Two other cases against him were withdrawn, and Robert Cohen, pleading quilty by consent, was fined 1s , with three guineas costs. An inquiry into the circumstances under which several persons have recently been more or less seriously poisoned by colonial beer has made it clear that the mischief must have arisen from the accidental use of bottles which had not been properly cleaned. Strychnine was found, for a positive cer- tainty, in one bottle. It is known to be the practice of market-gardeners and fruit- growers to keep dissolved strychnine in bottles, in order to poison sparrows, minahs, and other birds with soaked grain. The supposition is that some bottles in which crystals of strychnine had been formed by evaporation were picked up by the bottle cleaners, and passed on to the brewers. Of late the demand for empty bottles has grown very large, and suburban localities 10 miles from town are now explored by the collectors. Since the occurrence of a fatal case of poisoning at Queenscliff, the brewers have consulted analytical chemists as to the best method of guarding against danger for the future. The annual manufacture of colonial beer in Victoria is over 15,330,000 gallons, of which the major quantity is sent out of the breweries in casks. A fortnight ago it was stated that a young Frenchman named George de Thenar had stuck up Holey Plains Station, near Rosedale. He gave himself up to the police a few davs later. The prisoner said that he was the son of the late Comte de Thenar, of France. He tried to make out that his exploit as a bush- ranger was a mad freak. He asked for work at the station a day or two before sticking the homestead up. The obituary of the fortnight contains the name of Captain J. A. Stubbs, staff officer of the local forces and captain of the Garrison Artillery Corps. Before he took service under the Victorian Government Captain Stubbs was 11 years in the Imperial army. He was in India with the 45th and 95th, and also at the Cape under General Carey, upon whose advice it was that he joined the local forces here. His term of service in Victoria ex- tended over 13 years. The present eflicient state of the volunteer service in Victoria is largely due to his skilled supervision and to the universal respect which men and officers had for his conspicuous military qualities. The funeral of the deceased ofiicer, which took place on Friday last, was attended by 1,000 men, representing all branches of the service. Captain W. W. Fentiman, of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's service, died in Melbourne on the 25th ult. He was well known in the colonies. His latest command was the H M S Tanjore. On the voyage of that vessel from Galle to Melbourne in November last he had to hand over the command to the chief oflicer. He stayed in Melbourne on sick leave, but never recovered. The deceased was 48 years of age. Mr Hector Norman Simson, an old colonist, died on January 29, at the age of 60. The deceased was a native of Islay, Argyleshire, and came out to the colonies 40 years ago. He was chiefly occupied with pastoral pur- suits, and he afforded the turf a good deal of support, being an excellent judge of blood stock. The interest taken by the public in cricket matches this season is not very great. The moderate attendance of spectators must be due to reaction from the surfeit the general public had of cricket last season, when the English gentlemen were here, and engaged in encounters with first-class elevens. Since the New Year, when the Australian Eleven (No 2) played fifteen of Victoria, there have been several good club matches and some large scores. Up to the present this has been de- cidedly a batsman's season. Melbourne and East Melbourne played a three days' match, which ended m a draw, scores -MCC, 177 and 237 Ã.CC, 281 and 137 (with four wickets to fall) For the M C C , F McEvoy 51 W Tobin 47, and Terry 20 and 47 were the highest scorers, while on the East Melbourne side the fine totals of 97 and 68, not out, were made by Groube. Horan got 55 not out, and 2. The Australian Eleven (No 2) are going on with their tour preparatory to visiting England. In Sydney they have defeated Fifteen of New South Wales by 75 runs. It Is said that A. Bannerman may go home with the team, but the services of Mr Evans, the great bowler, will evidently not be procurable. In batting, the Eleven are pretty strong, and their stock of bowlers is little if at all inferior to that of the first Australian team. The annual race meeting of the Geelong Racing Club was held on the 29th and 31st inst. On the first day the Hurdle Race was won by Rover, the favourite Rocket not getting a place. Eight horses started for the Gold Cup, for which Petrea was backed at 5 to 4. Columbus, with Zambezi for a com- panion, made the running all the way. At the finish Columbus ran Zambezi out, and the pair crossed. Lord Harry, who was coming with a fine rush, and in all probability would have won but for this interference. Columbus and Zambesi ran a dead heat. In the run off Columbus again ran out and took Zambesi fairly across the course. Columbus passed the post a winner by a head. A protest was entered against Columbus, and the stewards gave the race to Zambesi. Eight youngsters started for the Sires Produce Stakes. Meg Merrilies, by Gang Forward, dashed away ot the start, and showed such a turn of speed that she was never caught; Sir Joseph was second, and Good Morning third. On the second day Sir Joseph, by Bethnal Green, won the Barwon Stakes, Western Princess was second, and Haidee of the Hills third. Only three horses started for the Mares' Produce Stakes, which was won easily by Avernus; Caspian, who was made a great favourite, being a moderate second; Terrific, the other starter, was never in the race. The Geelong Handicap brought out six starters, Monarque being the most fancied. The favourite made the running till entering the straight, where Columbus and Wellington caught him, and Timothy joined the leaders After a grand finish Wel- lington, by Panic-Frou Frou, won by a length, Columbus was second, and Timothy third. The Steeplechase was won by Trum- peter, who led all the way, and beat three others very easily. In music, the only event of importance since the departure of Madame Camilla Urso and her company has been a grand concert in aid of the Irish Distress Relief Fund, which took place in the Town-hall on Saturday even- ing, the 31st ult. The following ladies and gentlemen gave their services gratuitously, namely, Madame Carlotta Tasca, solo pia- niste; Mr Henry Curtis, solo violinist; Madame Simonsen, Mrs. Smythe, Miss Rosaly Merz, Mr Lineker, Mr S. Lamble, Mr W. R. Furlong, Mr B. T. Moroney, the Melbourne Liedertafel, conducted by Mr J. Siede; Mr David Lee, Mr W. Hunter, Mr George Peake, and Mr Alfred Plumpton. The entertainment musically was a great success, but the attendance was not large. For the rest the Thursday and Saturday con- certs, conducted by Mr Summers at the Juvenile Exhibition, and Mr David Lee's organ recitals at the Town hall, fill up the measure of our musical doings. Mr Sum- mers gives excellent selections of orchestral music, including symphonies by Beethoven and Haydn, and Mrs Cutter, a fine contralto singer, has been the principal attraction amongst the vocalists. The organ recitals are always well performed and fairly well attended. On Wednesday night last an ex- cellent concert was given in the Melbourne Athenaeum, as a complimentary farewell to Mr W. Hunter, honorary pianist to the Mel- bourne Liedertafel. Mr Hunter sails by the Sobraon to pursue higher studies in the European schools The Musical Artists' Society of Victoria held their first meeting this year on Satur- day night last. The chief item in the musical performance was the Beethoven Quartett, Op I6, played by Messrs. H. Curtis, E. A. Jager, A. Montague and J. Buddee At the Theatre Royal the pantomime "The Babes in the Wood", still continues to draw fair houses, notwithstanding the heat of the weather. The pantomime "Robinson Crusoe" will be withdrawn from the Opera house this evening. The London Comedy Company will return to this theatre on the 7th inst. Mr. and Mrs. Lingard reappeared at the Academy of Music on the 24th January in the comedy of "Old Bachelors," Mrs. Lingard also ap- peared as Selene in the English version of "Happy Land", but the piece was not a success. They have since appeared in "En taged" and "Pluto" and have been very well received. "Forlorn Hope" has been kept on the stage of the People's Theatre. The last performance is announced for the 7th inst. St Leon's Circus has arrived in Melbourne aud the public have patronised it liberally. THE OPPOSITION PROGRAMME The programme of the Opposition on the reform issue has been embodied in an ad- dress issued by Mr. Service to the electors of Maldon. The hon. gentleman reminds the electors of the leading principles of the Government bill. They are three: - 1 The abolition of that provision in our Constitution Act which precludes the possibility of public moneys being expended except under the authority of an act of Parliament, and the substitution for that provision of a power for a majority in the Assembly - that is, in effect, the Ministry of the day - to spend these moneys in any way they please, without the check which in England, and in other English colonies, is supplied by the second Chamber 2 The abolition of the Legislative Council as an elective body, and the substitution of a nominee Council, one fifth part of which is to be appointed every year by the Ministry of the day. 3 The introduction of the plÃ©biscite as a means of settling questions of general legis- lation on which the two Houses have, for a certain period failed to agree - all votes of money and money bills being excluded from its operation. Mr Service continues: - These are the three principles of the bill on which the Government have obtained leave from His Excellency to make a special appeal to the people of the colony. I voted against all three, and I trust to receive your approval for having done so. I am persuaded that proposals like these cannot find favour with you or the electors generally. They did not find accept- ance even among the followers of the Govern- ment in the Assembly, and outside of Par- liament, where, on the platform or in the press, has there arisen a single voice or a single pen to defend, as a whole, the bill which you are now invited to approve of? How then can the question be settled? Mr Service proceeds: - I answer that it can be settled both speedily and satisfactorily by the adoption of the proposals which, on be- half of the Opposition, I had the honour of submitting some 14 months ago. You will remember those proposals; they were 1 To accept as a basis for reform the bill passed by the Legislative Council, which provided for Reducing the size of the provinces and increasing their number Reducing the qualification of electors Reducing the qualification of members Reducing the tenure of office from ten years to six. 2 To provide for the dissolution of both Houses in the event of a continuing disagree- ment between them on any measure. 3 To provide that if in the new Parliament the two Houses should still disagree, the question should be settled by a joint vote of both Houses sitting together. Those are the proposals which the Opposi- tion submitted last year, and those are the proposals they submit now. The Opposition have made no change of front on the Reform question, for the more they consider those proposals the more satisfied are they that they constitute a sound basis for a satisfactory and lasting settlement of the constitutional difficulty. The scheme proposed is simple, reasonable, effective. It would cure deadlocks without trampling our second Chamber under foot, it would insure the pass- ing into law of all measures which the people had deliberately and definitely decided on; it would promote and enhance the dignity of Parliament as the embodiment and exponent of the will and the power of the people. The power of dissolving both Houses I regard as a most valuable provision. It would exercise a salutary influence in pre- venting disturbances between the Parliamen- tary bodies. It would insure deliberation, courtesy, and conciliation on the part of both Houses, and promote in each a keen and earnest regard for the deliberate convictions of their constituents. In all these respects it is the very antipodes of the plÃ©biscite, which, whilst degrading and destroying the true meaning and object of representative govern ment, would tend to render members of both Houses careless of discussmg measures whose fate depended not on their vote, and indifferent to the opinions of the other branch of the Legislature, whose opposition could always be overcome without appealing to either reason, history, or facts, but simply to a mass vote. I am glad to see that the scheme sketched out above has made great headway in the country since I first had the honour of an- nouncing it - in December, 1878 - from my place in the Assembly, and afterwards in the hall of your Royal Hotel. I have a strong conviction that on these lines will be con- structed a Reform Bill which will both satisfy and benefit the country. And this scheme has the great merit of being possible - a merit not possessed by any of the numerous Minis- terial schemes. We can get it, and get it quickly, and thus end the strife which has now raged far too long to the injury of all classes in the community. THE BANKS AND THE GOVERNMENT Reference was made in our last Summary to negotiations which were proceeding be- tween the associated banks and the Govern- ment with regard to a new contract, the original agreement having expired under the terms of the six months' notice given by the Government. The terms have been at last arranged and settled, and the whole corre- spondence has been submitted to Parliament and published. The correspondence gives a good illustration of the business incapacity of the Berry Government, and discloses the startling fact that they require to start with an overdraft of Â£470,000, and will be in debt all through the ensuing six months. We give the following abstract - On the 10th of June, 1879, Major Smith, as Acting Treasurer, wrote to Mr. J. Matheson, chairman of the associated banks, giving notice (in accordance with the agreement entered into on tho 12th April, 1875) "of tho termination in six months of the arrangement under which the public account was entrusted to the 10 banks," and stating that " it must be under- stood that the present arrangement for the custody of the departmental accounts, under which these accounts are distributed as equally as possible among the 10 banks, will, in all probability, be modified simul- taneously with the intended re- distribution of the public account," Before the six months had expired the Government saw that, as usual, they had in their foolish bravado made a huge blunder and desired to retract, and on tho 9th of December the under-treasurer sent tho fol- lowing communication to Mr. Matheson: - "Sir,-With reference to the notlce which was addressed to you from this office on tho 16th June last, of the discontinuance of the present arrange- ment between the Government and the associated banks for the custody of the public account, I beg to say that the notice referred to was given simply as a precautionary measure, and that the Government do not now propose any alteration in the existing arrange- ment." " Under these circumstances it may, I presume, be considered that the terms upon which the banks agreed to allow an overdraft of the public account to the extent of Â£250,000 will be so far modified that the credit will be continued for such further period as may be required- say to the end of the current financial year." The associated banks, however, declined to continue the contract under the old terms, and after some further negotiations they sub- mitted the following proposals as the basis for a new agreement: - "1 The balance of the public account to be con- tinued divided as nearly as may be in equal propor- tions amongst the 10 banks, and the departmental accounts to be distributed, as at present, on a similar principle. '* 2 The banks to allow interest at the rate of 3 per cent per annum on the balance of the public account so long as such balance in tho aggregate is not less than Â£50 000, but when such aggregate balance is below the sum named no interest is to be allowed thereon. "3. The departmental accounts kept at the Mel- bourne offices of the banks to cease bearing interest as already is the case in respect to those kept at their country branches. "4 The agreement to be terminable on 12 months' notice on either side, instead ol six months, as here- tofore. In replying to the above the under- treasurer said he was desired to express the Treasurer's (Mr Berry's) surprise and regret that the banks should have seen fit to take the present opportunity of stipulating for a substantial alteration in the existing arrange ment, also to represent that Mr Berry was unable at present to command sufficient leisure for the due consideration of the sub- ject, and to request that the arrangement hitherto existing might be continued for a further period of three months. We quote the following from Mr Mathe- son's answer - "3 I am requested to remlnd you that all agree- ments, excepting those embodied In the special con- tract for the custody and conduct of the 'loan account' were deflnitely determined by the notlce given in the Hon. W Collard Smith's letter of the 16th June last, No 4,368. Whatever may have been the motives which actuated the Government In giving that notice, it was accepted bv the banks In perfectly good faith, and was dealt with upon simple business principles. When it expired on the 16th inst, the interest allowed on the public and departmental ac- counts necessarily ceased to accrue, the undertaking of the banks to advance the Government Â£250,000 abso- Iutely lapsed, and the then existing loan of Â£235,675 on 'coupon account' became due and payable in terms of my several letters noted In the margin-No 741 of 23rd Julv, 1879; No 744 of 22nd September, 1879, No 746 of 22nd October, 1879. I may here be allowed to remark that In those letters the attention of the Government was three times recalled to the pending effluxion of the then existing agreement, but that li was not until the 10th inst., or within a week of the expiration of your notlce, that the banks were favoured with any intimation of your deslre to treat that notlce as inoperative. "4 At the present time there Is obviously no existing agreement in respect to the public and de- partmental accounts which the banks can undertake to 'continue,' but they are willing to enter Into fresh arrangements with the modifications proposed in my letter of tho 16th Inst, No 750, and they are also prepared to consider any suggestions which you may desire to make on the part of the Government. "6 Past experlence, however, has conclusively de- monstrated that the banks cannot prudently enter Into the onerous obligations to which the Government find It necessary to commit them, both as to deposits and loans on the public account, unless they can be assured of some more settled tenure of that account; and as six months notice has been found insufficient for their protection, they are quite unable, with any regard to consistency, to assent to your present pro posai for carrying on the account for a flxed period of only three months, without any assurance as to what may happen at the termination of that period. " 6. In the absence, therefore, of any specific agree- ment it must be distinctly understood that no interest is at present accruing on the public and departmental accounts, and that the loan of Â£235,675 on 'coupon account' is now repavable. "7. On the other hand, the banks assert no present claim to the continued custody of the public and de- partmental accounts beyond the legal right to set off the credit balances against the overdraft on the coupon account. But in the Interests alike of the public, the Government, and the banks, they respect fully submit that it is desirable to restore the Go vernment banking business to some settled con ditions." The under-treasurer by direction rejoined that he had informed the chairman of the associated banks verbally that he was autho- rised to state that the Government did not intend enforcing the notice to terminate the original agreement In the meantime, he continued, the Treasurer was desirous of knowing whether the arrangements neces- sary for the maintenance of the public credit would be " continued as found necessary," and he enclosed the following memo showing tho position of the Treasurer's cash account and the accommodation likely to bo required to June 30, 1880 "Cash in banks December 23, 1879 Â£103,000 Probable receipts to March 31,1880.. .. Â£1,450,000 Â£1,553,000 Estimated expenditure to March 31,1880, including remlttance to be made in January, and including coupon account due to banks Â£1,812,171 Â£259,171 Probable receipts April 1 to June 30 Â£1,270,000 Estimated expenditure April 1 to June 80. Â£1,026,006 Balance as above .. .. 259,171 Â£1,285,167 Â£15,167 Remittance to be made In March or April for Interest due In London on July 1, 1880\. Â£235,675 Â£250,842 "The foregoing shows the probable result at the expiration of each of the quarters (March and June, 1880), but as the remlttance for Interest will have to be made during the first month of each of the quar- ters named-in one case, say, Â£212,000 and in the other Â£235,675 -the extent of advance required during the first part of each quarter may be, say, Â£470,000 and Â£250,000 respectively. The expected improve- ment In the reyenue will, it is believed, soon render these advances unnecessary. "(Signed) E S SYMONDS" A special meeting of the representatives of the banks was at once (on the 24th December) convened, but those present were so much taken by surprise at the financial condition of the Government (as disclosed in the memo ) that they could not arrive at any decision until a full meeting was held. Another meeting was held shortly afterwards, and on the 30th of December Mr. Matheson, writing to the Treasurer, pointed out the verbal communication which the under treasurer spoke of was not of such a nature that could be submitted to the representatives of the banks as a body, and that no sufficient opportunity was afforded upon which the banks could act until the receipt of the Treasurer's letter of the 9th December. The modifications which the banks were desirous of introducing into a new agreement were not suggested by the Treasurer's notice of termination, for they had long seen their necessity, and would probably have sought an opportunity for introducing the changes had not the Government's notice rendered such a step on their part necessary. In the same letter the following passages occur - "With regard to the willingness expressed by the Treasurer to substitute a new agreement for that which expired on the 16th inst., and his desire for a delay of three months, in order that the terms thereof might have the further consideration of the Govern- ment, during which time the agreement existing up to the 16th inst should be continued, the banks must respectfully decline to acquiesce in this suggestion, still holding to their opinion as to the necessity of such new agreement being made without the further delay sought for, and prior to the renewal or con- tinuance of any adyances required. " Nevertheless, with the view of relieving the Government from embarrassment, the banks are pre- pared to provide the funds necessary to meet the local disbursements the under-treasurer has verbally and unofficially notified to me as having to be made immediately, but it must be understood that this accommodation is to be purely temporary. " In reference to the remark that 'the Treasurer is desirous of being informed whether the arrangements necessary for the maintenance of the public credit wlll be continued as found necessary, I am requested to protest emphatically against the clearly implied assumption that the banks are responsible for the maintenance of the public credit.' Such an Intima- tion, coupled with the unexpected disclosure that the Treasurer will probably requlre a permanent overdraft ranging from a quarter to half a million sterling during the ensuing six months, has changed the aspect oÃ® the public account in a manner for which the banks were wholly unprepared. That they are not unmindful of the obligations to which the Govern- ment may reasonably seek to commit them in the matter of advances is evidenced by the remarks in my letter of th3 18th inst., No 761, paragraph 5, no less than by the liberal accommodation they have afforded hitherto. But that thev should assume the unmeasured responsibility of affording whatever facili- ties may be 'found necessary for the main- tenance of the public credit' is a proposition which they are forbidden to entertain by every con- sideration of prudence and by every principle of sound banking....... I am also desired to direct your attention to the altered position of the public account and to remind you that it formerly pre- sentcd a steady credit balance of from Â£300,000 to Â£100,000, thus allowing the banks to prudently em- ploy a certain proportion of the money, and enabling them to pay interest upon It. But it is obviously impossible for them to deal in the same manner with funds which are not only liable to be suddenly ex- hausted, but which require to be supplemented by heavy advances out of the banks' own capital."' After a wrangling letter from the under- treasurer, the representatives of the banks waited by invitation on Mr Berry, and the result was that on the 24th January the Trea- surer signed the following agreement on behalf of the Government - "1 The public account to be divided as nearly as may be in equal proportions amongst the 10 banks, and the departmental accounts to be distributed on a similar principle. " 2 The banks to allow interest at the rate of three per cent per annum on the daily current balance of the public account so long as such balance in the aggregate is not less than Â£50 000; but when such aggregate balance is below the sum named, no Interest is to be allowed thereon. "3. No Interest is to be allowed by the banks upon any of the departmental accounts. "4 The banks to receive and transmit moneys on the public and departmental accounts between their branches In Victoria free of exchange. "5 This agreement to take effect as on and from the sixteenth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and seventy nine, and to be terminable by 12 months notice on either side. ' A SCENE IN THE ASSEMBLY Strangers were excluded from the galleries of the Legislative Assembly by the Minister of Lands twice on the 20th January, and during the discussion of Mr Berry's refusal to supply an account of the expenditure of the embassy to England, the galleries were again cleared in order to stop reporting. On the last occasion of the exclusion of the press, the most disgraceful scene which has ever occurred in the Assembly was enacted. Sir Bryan O'Loghlen directed the clearance of the galleries. This step at once plunged the House into excitement as the Opposition warmly resent these continued tactics of the Ministry of "prohibiting the performance," the phrase which the "Happy Land" episode has brought into use. There were cries of "shame," and of "the Ministry apply- ing the gag again," from the left of the House, which were warmly responded to by Government members. Amongst these Mr Fergusson, the member for South Bourke, was conspicuous - as usual - by his ejacula- tions. It so happens that during the Christmas recess Mr Fergusson's appear- ance has undergone a remarkable change, and the member for South Bourke has had to submit to some lively badinage on this account, members remarking that they "respect grey hairs, but not brown," and in other ways indicating a belief that the hon. gentleman, as it was put, "dyes his whiskers." One member called out, "We will whiten your hair for you," and Mr McIntyre re- marked in answer to an interjection from Mr Fergusson, " We will give you a wig, old man, to match your whiskers." The joke had unexpected results. Mr Fergusson strode to the table. He endeavoured to wrench away the wooden stand from the mace. Failing in that, he grasped with his two hands a heavy volume of the statutes, and with it struck a blow edgeways at Mr McIntyre. Mr McIntyre grappled with his assailant, and seized his wrists, and the blow fell upon Mr Bent, who rushed to prevent the encounter, and inflicted a severe bruise. Mr McIntyre's strength of grip threw Mr, Fergusson over, but he dropped the book and grasped at his opponent's beard and whiskers. By this time all was confusion, and the shouts and the cries of the excited members could be heard despite the locked doors in all parts of the building. Mr. Carter, Mr. Zox, Mr. Young, and Mr' Bent, seized Mr. Fergusson, who had tumbled over on the seat, and drew him away, he struggling violently and ejaculating, "Let me go, let me go ; let me get at the black- guard." He afterwards returned to his seat behind the Government. Mr. Smyth at once refused to continue the sitting, vacated the chair, and sent for the Speaker, and reported that gross disorder had occurred in committee. The question then arose whether particulars should be communicated to the Speaker. Sir C. Gavan Duffy intimated that if he was officially informed of what had taken place he should certainly insist upon the ex- emplary punishment of the offender, and the consequences must be most serious. There was some division of opinion on the point. Some members were of opinion that the offender should be spared, while Mr Orr took the ground that punishment was called for, and he declared his belief that if a knife had been at hand Mr Fergusson would have been a murderer. However, Mr McIntyre inter- posed on behalf of the culprit, declaring his belief that no punishment could be so severe as would be Mr Fergusson's reflections the next morning, and it was agreed that the matter should not be reported to the Speaker, and that Mr Fergusson should make an apologv in committee, which he did in not very gracious terms. Ministers then wished to report progress, but Mr Bent ob- jected, in absolute terms, and declared that come what might not a step should be taken of any kind until the press was admitted. He held Sir Bryan O'Loghlen and his colleagues responsible for all that had occurred by their persistence in applying the gag. Sir Bryan O'Loghlen still pro- tested, but gave way to the general remon- strance, and the galleries were then opened, and instantly afterwards the disreputable proceedings were brought - at a quarter- past 11 o clock - to a close After the House had risen hon. members freely exchanged expressions of regret, and stated their sense of humiliation consequent upon the disgrace of the evening. No absolute blow has been struck in the Victorian Assembly before this, and the outrage appears to be keenly felt on both sides.

The Con- struction Bill would appear to be very much of a sham, for it transpired in the course of the discussion on the measure that the Rail- way Loan Fund has almost disappeared. Nominally there is Â£750,000 on hand as the balance of the loan but a large amount has been hypothecated for railways now in course of construction, and only Â£345,000 is now available for new lines. The dilatoriness and the want of capacity of Mr. Woods, the Minister of Railways were strongly com- mented upon by Mr Munro, but the Opposi- tion elected to let the issue go by default, in order not to delay the closing of the session. THE WEATHER During the past few weeks the weather has been marked by a preyalence of high tempe- rature, and a scarcity of rain has been felt in the country districts. The highest tempera- ture in the shade, 94.3 deg.,, was recorded on the 28th ult, and tho lowest 50.1deg, on the early morning of the 27th ult. The total rainfall since the beginning of the year up to tho 1st inst was 1.33 as compared with 1.11in. during the same period in 1879. 0 04in. in 1878, 0.28in. in 1877, 1.40in. in 1876, 0.57in in 1875, 2.14in. in 1874, 2.07in. in 1873, 4.98in. in 1872, 3.00in. in 1871, 3.15in. in 1870, 1.46in. in 1869, 2.11in. in 1868, 1.92in in 1867, 1.43in. in 1866, 0.16in. in 1865., 2.07in in 1864, 1.84in in 1863, 1.25in. in 1862, 2.25in. in 1861, 1.97in. in 1860, 2.86in. in 1859, 0.88in in 1858, or an average of 1.77. AGRICULTURE Another fortnight's hot and dry weather has enabled farmers, even in the latest dis- tricts, to cut their grain, and in most cases to get well forward with threshing. In the early districts the work of harvesting is mostly performed by strippers, which roughly thresh as well as gather the ears, so that no threshers are needed in those parts of the colony. ln the later districts in which oats and barley can be grown, the climate being, cooler and therefore more suitable for those crops, much damage has been done to them by caterpillars, which have invaded the dis- tricts in large armies, indeed, they had got piled up in such numbers on the rails, in one instance, on an ascent as to cause the engine wheels to lose their grip, and thus absolutely to hinder the pro- gress of the train. The harvest has resulted in giving, the largest aggregate of wheat for exportation that this colony has yet had at lts disposal. Whilst some of the crops have been thin in qualitv, there is a largo bulk of plump and bold wheat; the condition of all -plump and thin alike-is good, the weather having been favourable throughout. Water is becoming extremely scarce in many dis- tricts, especially in those relying upon dams and reservoirs. We learn from our Jeffcott correspondent that " in parts of the county of Kara Kara farmers who thought they had mado ample provision against a dry season find their resources exhausted, teams going to St Arnaud, each carrying with them a barrel of water, as the dams at Donald are nearly dry. Thompson's dam has been dry since last year, Barren Hut and Hoiles' are dry; and Egan's all but finished " This is a fair type of the condition of things in many other parts of the colony. Rain appears im- minent now, but at this season of the year the sky often threatens, with barren results THE LABOUR MARKET. There is but little change to report in the labour market since last mail. The harvest is getting well over, and no improvement has taken place in the building trades. The boot factories continue to be fully employed. The clothing factories are preparing for the win- ter work, but few hands are employed as yet.

WHAT ÃB like!? to prove a valuable dis- covery has (reportÂ» the Â¿foid/i Australian Ad- vertiser) been made in the vicinity of Nairne, in the shape of a silver-bearing reef. A piece of the cap of the reef has been assayed, and yielded 2oz. 6dwt. 16gr. to the ton. This piec. was token only 18in. from the surface. The reef itself is strong and well defined, and comes nearly to the Burface. At the place where it has been opened it is about 2ft. through, and runs north-east by south-west Several specimens having the appearance of copper have been found aa well, which leads to tho supposition that that metal is also to be obtained in the neighbourhood,
