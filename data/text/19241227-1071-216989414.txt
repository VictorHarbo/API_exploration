QUEENSLAND i'ASTORAL SUPPLIES, LTD., Direct Universal Suppliers. BOW.SN STREET. BRISBANE. GEORGE YOUNG, AGENT; lost for three years DANISH ROBINSON CRUSO FOUND LIVING ON SEAL FLESIi IN THE ARCTIC. After an adventurous voyage td the Arctic in search of a missing ex plorer, the tiny Danish schooner Sokongen lias reached Aberdeen (says tlie London 'Daily Chronicle' of October 21. The explorer, Peter Freuchen, a Dane, was rescued when his food was almost exhausted. He -bad left Copenhagen in 1921), and nothing bad been heard of him for three years. On his voyage to the north the Sokongen carried 9tores for- Greenland trading stations. Af ter a fair passage across the North Atlantic she reached Cape Fare well, in the south of Greenland, and proceeded up Davis Strait. She encountered very bad weather, ami Captain Pedersen and his crew had hard work - making their way through the ice and dodging the ice bergs that were moving southwards. After a harassing passage North Stur Bay, one of the Danish Com pany's stations, was reached, and here some stores were landed. Hearing- from the Eskimos that the explorer, had gone to Baffin Land, Captain Pedersen set off fur Pond's Bay. .Tliey found Freuchen suffering from frost bite and iu a bad state of health. His toes had been frozen off, his food was run ning short, and lie was living on seal, walrus, reindeer, - and fish, which lie shot and caught. Four, of the explorer's Eskimo helpers were also lost — two men and two women. Owing to Freunohen's condition the- natives, had set out with' dogs and sledges to try to secure assistance. Their Intentions were to cross the ice on Lancaster Sound to North De von; thence they were to make tliei'r way over 'Jones Sound to Ellesmere Island, and finally southwards to Cape York. / ONCE A YEAR BOAT. Owing to. the severity of the win ter, however, .their.; plans were frus trated, and thej> had to turn , back and were strand-ed on the north of Bylot Island, where they were dis covered by Captain Pedersen, 'who . took them and. their dogs and sledg es on board the achoonor. The only boat" which ' touches Ponds Islet, where' the explorer was found,' Is n Canadian police vessel which -calls once a year to land two constables and a sergeant of Hie Canadian' North-West . Mounted. Police, and take those who have been there bach to Canada. The explorer, however, had evidently been "taken ill' after the boat had gone, and as it would not be back for another year,- and as the police had probably moved on the Eskimos bad set out tor help.
