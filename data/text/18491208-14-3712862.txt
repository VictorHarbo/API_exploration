The Tamar, having left the bay on Saturday evening, the 24th ult., arrived alongside the wharf in Sydney at 6 A.M. of the 27th, the wind during the run having been N. to N. E. up to Sunday evening, and afterwards strong from the westward. On her return, she carried a southerly wind until Friday the 30th ult., when it shifted to the west- ward. Reports the Eagle, hence, off Port Mac- quarie at 5 A.M. that day. A schooner, bound to the southward, was sighted off Cape Byron at noon on Saturday last. Captain Murphy states that, on passing Seal Rocks, the heaviest sea was breaking that he had ever observed upon this coast. The Lima, hence, arrived in Sydney on the 28th ult. The Una, from Plymouth, with 318 government immigrants, arrived in Sydney on the 22nd ult. LAUNCH OF THE SCHOONER "FAVORITE." Yesterday afternoon a new schooner, of 173 tons, builder's measurement, was launched from the building-yard of Mr. Chowne, at Pyrmont. About half-past two, the necessary preparations having been made, the blocks were knocked away, and she glided swiftly and gracefully into her native element, having been named by Mr. Plant (lady of Captain Plant) the Favorite. This vessel is, perhaps, the most beautiful model ever built in the colonies, and that she will prove a favorite we fearlessly predict, every care having been taken in her construction, as regards strength and ac- commodation for passengers. She is built upon the same principle as the Phoenician, now in habour, and it is considered by able judges that in speed she will rank second to no other colonial vessel. Her measurement is as follows :—Length of keel for tonnage, 85 feet ; length over all, 98 feet 4 inches ; extreme breadth, 24 feet 2 inches ; depth of ship, 9 feet 9½ inches. Her accommo- dations are well adapted for the Moreton Bay trade, in which she will be placed, under the com mand of Captain Stericker.—S. M. Herald, Nov. 23. At seven A.M. the Johanna O'Loffa, a Danish schooner, arrived in port, Captain Euyers, from San Francisco September 14th, Sandwich Islands October 7th, and Bay of Islands November 16th. Passenger — Mr. Joseph Lloyd. The Eleanor Lancaster is dismasted and converted into a store, and doing a first-rate business, at San Francisco. Captain Lodge has made up his mind to remain for some time. The attraction must be inviting. —Newcastle Cor. Maitland Mercury, Nov. 28. The master of the Cumberland reports that an emigrant ship from Liverpool was signalised as he left Sydney on Thursday week last. The Eagle, hence, was off the "Brothers" at 7 A.M. of Friday the 30th ult., and the Beaver off Smoky Cape at 8 P.M. of the same day. The Ann Mary arrived in Sydney on the 26th, and was advertised to sail for this port on the 30th ultimo. The ship Lord Stanley is advertised in London to sail for Port Phillip, Sydney, and Moreton Bay. The day of sailing was not fixed. The James and Amelia arrived in Sydney from Wide Bay on the 26th ult.
