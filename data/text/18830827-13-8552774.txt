SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. Parliament continues to make progress with its work, and two leading measures have been assented to by the As- sembly during the fortnight. At the same time there have been one or more twisted evenings in the Lower Chamber, compensated for, however, by extra progress being made on other occasions. The old tendency to debate impromptu questions rather than settle down to the business on the paper has not been wholly suppressed. An hour was consumed at one sitting in determin- ing whether a bill could be recommitted after it had been read a third time, on the question that "it do now pass." Neither the Speaker nor the individual members who are looked up to as Parliamentary authorities had any doubt that such a retrograde movement was im- possible, but the hon. gentleman respon- sible for raising the point of order took a great deal of convincing. At another time Major Smith spoke for two hours and a half on the Ministerial defence schemo before it lind hoon proporly brought undor the notice of the House. The items ho objected to were not very important, nor was ho quito correct in his facts, but the lion, gentleman had beon crammed for the occasion, and his case would not brook delay. Major Smith is averse to tlio Government obtaining the sorvices of four commissioned mid 1. non- commissionod officers from England, and would prefer tosend home a few select mon to bo trained in tho mother country, whereas the Government proposal is to establish a school of military instruction in lho colony, which tho whole of the volunteer oflicers will bo ablo to avail thomaelves of at once. Mr. Service briefly answered Major Smith, correcting some of his mistakes, and announced that the defence ostimatos would bo submitted as soon as certain routine votes and the education estimates had beon passed. In our last summary, tho details of the defence schemo were given. Tho Railways Mlmngoment Bill and tho Supremo Court Proceduro Bill were passed the week beforo last by tho Assombly and sent to the Legislative Council, where they now await considera- tion. On the 23rd hist, the Harbour Trust Bilí was carried through committee without being materially altered. It is to bo recommitted, for lho purpose of dis- cussing tho constitution of the Trust, but no ono exports to seo any alteration made. Tho Mallee Bill will bo taken up as soon as the Harbour Trust Bill is cleared out of the way, it boing the rulo of tho Government to proceed with its measures in rotation, and to dovoto portion of the Wednesday sittings to the estimates, most of which havo now boen voted. On Tuesday last Mr. Service inlrodttcod a much-needed bill to reform tho civil service, which has boen de- moralised by political patronage. The audit commissioners will administer the measuro, classifying the work and reorganising tho statT, whilst appoint monts and promotions will bo made undor rules, and not nt the discretion of any individual Minister or'departmental chief. A summary of tho provisions of tlio bill is given in anothor column. The Legislativo Council is at present giving its attention to the Ainendod Local Government Bill. Once a week the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company's Bill is taken into considera- tion. Tho Council is favourable to tho immediate laying of tramways in Mel- bourne and suburbs, and tho only ques- tion about which a difference of opinion exists is as to the powers to bo conferred on the company. The Assembly has already assented to tlie bill. Tho Eloetions Committeo of the As- sembly is inquiring into the potition by Mr. C. E. Jones against tho return of Mr. Pincham, tho member for Ballarat West. Mr. Fincham was elected by the voto of the returning officer, after having boon tied by Mr. Jones. Tho petitioner has proved that one voto given in his favour was improperly re- jected, and the effect so far is to put him one ahead ; but tho sitting member has undertaken to show that votes woro given for Mr. Jones hy persons not on the roll. It is stated that a scrutiny will be demanded. SOCIAL AND GENERAL On the 15th inst, Mr W. Redmond lectured at at Patrick's hall on the subject of per- sonal recollections of Forster's Coercion Act. He described it as au arbitrary und despotic measure, and stated it was administered in a harsh, brutal, and barbarous way. After referring to his own arrest under it, he alleged that " it had been used to cast into prison the flower of the farming and indus- trial classes of Ireland " The real motive tor passing the net was the sume us that ot all British legislation, namely, the desire to sustain the iniquitous system of landlordism in Ireland He complained of ill-treatment while m custody, and added that, while hoping for peace, he feared it would not come until his eountr) wns a respected, honour- able, self governing nation A cable message from our London corres- pondent was published on the lbth inst, stating that the Irish National League had receiv ed a report from Mr J E Redmond and Mr W Redmond respecting the progress of their mission to Australia. Thoy reported, it w as stated m the telegram, " that the arch- bishops of by dney and Melbourne were hostile to them, but that the bishops of Maitland and Goulburn were favourable , and that Mr Henry Copeland, the late Munster of Public Works for New bouth Wales, was compelled to retire from the Cabinet for expiessing sym- pathy with the cause they were advocating " This statement, it was pointed out, was alto gcther untrue Mr Copeland was forced to resign m coiiseciuencc of the extraordinary speech made by lum at the banquet held in b)dnc), on the 17th March, to celebrate fat. Patuck's Da) His resignation became neces sury, not on account ot his expression of s)mpatli) with the Redmond mission, but be cause of the condition in which he appeared and the manner in which he conducted himself at the banquet The accuracy of the telegram was impugned by Mr William Redmond, who wrote a letter to The Argus declaring that neither his brother nor himself had sent home, or caused to be sent home, any report or nccouut whatever of their mission to the Austi allan colonies A telegram wus at once despatched to our correspondent in London, asking for confirmation of his previous message, and the following telegram was received in reply -" A ' communicated' Earugraph ni The "tmes states that reports ave been received from Australia respecting the operations of the delegates of the Irish National League The) show that the Arch- bishop of b) dney (Dr Vaughan) and the Arch- bishop ot Melbourne (Dr Goold) refused to facilitate the meetings held by the Redmond Brothers, and that their unfriendly attitude elicited counter action on the part of the Bishop of Maitland (Dr. Murray) and the Bishop of Goulburn (Dr Lanigan) It was further reported that the Bishop of Goulburn had vv ritten a letter supporting the Redmond mission, and that the press had published it Mr J E Redmond, writing to the treasurer of the league, asserts that tiley hav e held 70 meetings m Australia, that the meetings w ere attended by persous of all cieeds, and were presided ovei by Ministers ot the Crown, members of bqth Houses of Legislatuie, the mayors of cities, and justices ot the pence " This telegram was published in The Arque of August l8, and neither Mr W Redmond nor his brother ventured upon a second denial At the Intercolonial Postal Conference held m bydney at the beginumg ot the year, it wns decided by a majority of the colonies repre sciited to tom the arnon on condition that ouch of the colonies should be accorded a vote in the proceedings of the union, ho as to pro tect their interests and to prevent them being injuriously aOected by the voting power ot states which had no mai me postal service to maintain In reply to an othcml intimation of the result of the Intercolonial Conference, forwarded some time ago by Mr Kerry, the state secretary of the German Postal depart- ment expresáis himself quite prepared to give Bupport to the objection of the colonies to tiny reduction being mude in the sea transit rates and surtaxes fixed by the Pans Conven- tion for the next six years but the condition of separate voting he considers of such tren chant import upon the whole organisation of the union, and of a nature involving essential questions of political and uiternational law, that he cannot countenance it He suggests that to avoid delay and insuperable difficulties the colonies should not insist upon the con dition, but leave the matter to be decided by vote ot congress Lvalence from the Wesle} an point o£ view on the subject of religious instruction m state schools is being taken by the Education Commission The Kev J Wntaford denied that the Wesle) an Conference represented the voice of the church vv hen it expressed its approv al of the Bible in State Schools League Ile pointed outthatatthe late general election not one candidate could be found to identify himself with the manifesto of the league. His principal ground of opposition to the league was thnt ii the state legisluted for the pnrti cular beneht of the Protestant sects it must m justice concede the Roman Catholic claims, and that meant a return to state aid to reli gion Ile was ltrmly of opinion that if the churches only chose to exert themselves voinntnr) religious teaching agencies could be successfully established and maintained ni all parts of the colonj Hie Kev J C Symons on the other hand, expressed his ap Îiroval of the action taken by tho conference le would have either the Bible itself or the Irish National Board s scripture lesson books introduced into the schools for the benefit of the Protestant children He would go even further, and sanction payment bj result to separate schools that found their own buildings, paid their own teachers, and educated children up to the prescribed secular Btandard, taking no cognisance what ever of vv hat was done outside the hours set apart for secular teaching Ibis might mvolve an extra expenditure of from £00,000 to £80 000. but that was a mero trifle com pared to the final settlement ot a question thut had been distracting the community for yean» Hie Hev W A Quick was emphatic in his advocary of the voluntary system as against the scheme proposed bj the Bible in State Schools League Ile corroborated the evidence given by the Kev J Wntsford m all essential particulars Another Wesleyan clergyman, the Rev Georgo Daniel, dissented entirely from the views enunciated bj Mr Quick, and declared that neither the Sunday school nor the voluntary movement could adequately supplj the place of system atic Bible teaching in the state schools A Lutheran clergyman, the Kev If Hcrlitf?, vvus the next vv îtncss, and ho expressed some what similar v lews, and mfoi

Bubjecta up to the prescribed departmental standard ot elhcicncy lie laid it down as a broad principle that any body who relieved the state of the expense of educating children m secular subjects should, as a matter of justice, be recouped The excitement caused by the lecture dell vered m Scots Church by Mr Justice Higin botham on " Science and Religion," which was referred to in the last summary, has not died out I oremost amongst the defenders of dogmatic theology, which His Honour deprecated, have been some Presbyterian clergymen, who have made the lecture a fresh point of attack upon the Rev Charles Strong, the liberal, popular, and able minister of Scots Church The Rev A J Campbell^ principal of Ormond College, took occasion at the closing of the annual session of the college, on the 17th inst, to dehvci an' address with refer enee to Mr Higinbotham's lecture After explaining and detenduig the system of theo logical instruction pursued at the college, Mr Campbell said that he had a special and very serious duty to perform, such duty prov ing to be the making of an important charge against the Scots Church authorities Mr Higm botham's lecture was given under the auspices of the Scots Church Literary Asso ciation, m the church, but it was intended to serve not literary but theological pur floses It was intended to strengthen the ninds ot the Rev Charles Strong, to rouse up the Presbyterian laity to a sense of their shameless indifference and cowardice in con tinning to profess a creed which they nbhorcd, and to unfold the banner of Uni taruuusm in the heart of Presbyterian ism But Mr Higinbotham was not responsible for the subject of the lecture or the manner ot its treatment That responsibility rested with the Scots Church and its officers They brought him there to do a certain work, and Gointed out how it vv as to be done It must e concluded that the work he did wus the work lie was brought there to do The work noa, amongst other things, to overthrow the divinity ot Christ But Mr Campbell wassure that the audience did not perceive the drift of Mr Higinbotham's words, or they would not havo applauded them, und he hoped that, now they were enlightened on the sub ject, they would repudiate the "naked rationalism and unitarianism ' that had been thrust upon them so unexpec tedly At a meeting of tho Presbytery of Melbourne held on the 21st inst, the convener of the committee appointed to consider the proceedings m the bcots Church on the oc casiou of Mr Justice Higinbotham's lecture reported that it had met und devoted con siderable attention to the matter, but con- sidered it desirable to take further time for deliberation 'lhere has not been so much agitation over the matter in the Church of Lngland, of which Mr Higmbotham is a member , but the Very Rev Dean Macartney mid the Rev R B Dickinson have suggested that Christian people should make it a mutter of special prayer that God would overrule this discussion to His glory and the good of His church 'I he completion of the Clarke buildings at Trinity College was celebrated by a déjeune) on the 20th inst In connexion with the death of ArchbiBhop Vaughan " Ihe Mass for the Dead ' was cele brutid in St Patrick's Cathedral and St 1 rancis's Church, in the presence of large and sympathetic congregations, on the 20th inst Archbishop Goold in the

Australasian becular Association lias recently been sitting m Melbourne Delegates were present Irom other colonies It wus resolved to federate the various freethought societies of Australasia. Tor some time past the association named has been holding morning and evening meetings m the Opera house on bundny in consequence, however, of the "morning service" having developed into amusing entertainments, such na are given at concert halls on week days, the Chief becretary, at the instance of the police, has prohibited the use of the Opera-house for the purpose This decision has resulted in a movement for the erection of a hall tor the use of the association bu Andrew Clarke, inspector general of fortifications, has, for very many years, been drawing a pension of £800 from this colony, which was granted to lura in consequence of the official position he once held here A question has been raised as to whether under our Constitution Act the acceptance by Sir Andrew of a lucrative office under the Imperial Government did not invalidate his claims to the pension Mr Service is in- quiring into the matter Sir Archibald Michie, late agent-general for the colony, lins -ina letter to The Argus-contended that the pension ought legally to have been stopped years ago Express trains c ¡xpress trains are now runnmg between Melbourne and Sydney They have been rendered necessary by the growth of the overland trtifhc The distance is 575 miles, and the tune occupied is about 21 hours In connexion with the coronation ot the Czar of Russia, a number of honours were distributed to the members of tbe military and diplomatic service Among the reci- pients was Mr Damyon, the Kussian consul in Melbourne, upon whom was conferred the Order of bt Stanislaus It is intended to establish a Victorian branch of the Geographical bociety of Aus tralasia, latel) formed m New South Wales At the last half jeurly meeting of the Aus traban l'rozcn Meat Export Company it was resolved to increase the capital of the com puny so as to be able to make regular ship- ments ot meat to England, and with this view the secretary (Mr llotson) has since visited the Vteatcrn oistnet of the colony, and lins Iwen successful m procuring addi- tional capital to the amount of __7,0_0 fiom the graziers and stockovv ners m that district '1 he directors, hovvivcr, ure anxious that a still larger sum should be subscribed, so that I they may be prepared for all eventualities, and that the large and regular operations which they contemplate may be undertaken without tear of interruption from temporary want of funds 'lbey trust that those in tcrcsted will appreciate the necessity for prompt action mid will give the necessary assistance without further dels) In the meantime the d.-cctors are negotiating for freight, whereb) regular and continuous ship menta can be made. So fat only one shipment has been despatched from tbe company s new works at Williamstown, vi/ , per s.S.

Several agriculturists have subscribed for and procured a very handsome toml ne, to i be placed over the remains of the late Mr. Josiah Mitchell The proposal of Mr Twopeny that an Aus traban exhibition should be held in London was unanimously rejected by the general meeting of the Chamber of Manufactures on the 20th mst It was objected that the exhibition would not bring people to the colony, nor would it increase the sale of Vic torian products in the United Kingdom The great scarcity of labour m the colony was dwelt upon, and it was urged that as the Government would not undertake an immigration scheme for fear of offend ing the working classes, it was left to pn vate enterprise to take the task m hand If the employers of the colony would subscribe funds, they could bring out skilled labour to meet the grow ing necessities of the manufac turnip: interests The sum of £100 per annum w as promised by Mr 1 erguson towards this object On the other hand, it w as contended that immigration was a subject ot such general importance to the welfare of the colon), that the cost of reducing the passage money of desirable persons should be borne out of the Treasury, instead ot private pockets No conclusion on the subject was arrived at The annual election of the honorary pro- fessional staff of the Melbourne Hospital took place on the 23rd inst., the following being the successful candidates :—Drs.

On tile policy ot annexation or a protectorate, the Governments of Australasia were unani mous.

The prices paid for the stock ranges from £12 to £7 The labourers are fed well, and throughout New Caledonia are in good con ditton, sleek and after the manner of their land happy According to the Government scale the minimum monthly wages exclusive of rations and clothes range from 6f for boys and girls under 14 years to 12f for males over 18 years The boys occasionally get callings often deserved sometimes un deserved In Noumea the work they do is really very light But the one sphere of labour in which they are discontented is at the nickel mines The hard work there is unsuited to them and they die quickly It is hoped in New Caledonia that when france annexes the New Hebridies and the labour trade thence to Fiji and Queens land is stopped more hands wiil be available for the mines In the mean time the labour traffic to New Cale doma has been temporarily stopped by the Governor for the ostensible purpose of providing the convict population with em ployment As labourers however the islan ders are preferred to the convicts In New Caledonia, the islanders speedily forget what they may have been previously taught by the missionaries Our correspondent thinks that, owing to the great diversity of languages in the islands the English missionaries would have done better to teach the natives English, instead of translating the Scriptures into so many different dialects The French priests tench the principles of religion in their own language Me have received despatches from our special correspondent in New Guinea He was at the date of writing penetrating into the interior with a well cc_ui| ped i art) On July 11 he left Port Moresby for the Astrolabe range. He says - It was 4 o clock before we found ourselves breast ing the pinch over the coast hills the summit of which is 600ft above bia level Ihe country here is metamorphic-tertiary, and 1 think miocene 1 he secret of its ter tllity lies in ti c quantity of limestone that everywhere forms the subsoil I found jasper chalcedony and some very fine white marble in this vicinity Once on ti c ton of the range we struck a vny L b 1 descending rapidly mto very broken ridgy country, rav mes running into the track at every few yards The country is all open forest, eucalyptus, acacia and leguminous si rubs formint the bulk of the vegetation ex cepting where the scrub tdls up the mountain ravines or lines the banks of creeks The soil is good and «ncrcd I y a dense tr°wth ot many si ecies of grasses mostly Australian ln fact any one dropped suddenly into this part of New Guinea would imagine himself in Northern Queensland It was quite dark when I reached the Four-mile a patch of scrub in which there is a spring of cool water, and a clump of fine sago palms, tHie first 1 have seen in New Guinea, 'ihoy oro very beautiful, 50ft high, and form quito a feature in the landscape They aro grow- ing on private property-the whole country here belongs to the natives, every man having his own land-but the trees are not quite old enough to out down for sago ' 'n July 15, having proceeded further, he writes -" 1 started over broken rndges with rugged hills on eich side for three miles, country improving at euch step Splendid diluvial sod, wonderfully fertile, covered vv ith a dense growth of good grsases, not at all rank, but just the sort that would make an Australian country hunters heart leap with joy. The natives brought in a kangaroo, and borrowed our buckets to cook it Then they came and asked for a little salt to flavour it Of course they got it, and every drop of that liquor was treasured as if it had been liquid gold These inland Papuans value salt above all earthly things When they come into Port Moresby—or Burri Burri, as they call it-they run down to tho beach and drink the sea water with as much gusto an we drmnk champagne Savages ! I never saw such savages, nor any one else Let Australians disabuse their minds once for all of such ideas These Papuans are no more savages than we are Barbarians they are, no doubt, but even as barbarians they compare very favourubly with us and our vaunted civilisation Their gardens show an amouut of thought and well-directed labour and enterprise of which savages would be utterly incapable. 'Iheir houses are well built, comfortable, and quite up to the standard required by the climate They are cleanly in their habits, washmng eveothuig bofore they cook it, and them selves whenever they get an opportunity Their laws are strict, and are generally obeyed Their women are chaste, womanly, and pleasant I am quite delighted with these ferocious Papuans, and can foresee nothing but mutual benefht from my trip through their country . , We crossed several creeks, and 1 saw some very line alluvial flats well suited to sugar growing In fact, I have not seen any better in Queensland, while the open forest ridges are well suited for cattle " Our correspondent desenbes Robbertoom, a village l8 miles east of Port Moresby, consist mg of 11 houses, built several feet off the ground, and seven tree houses called "Dobo, ' 60 or 70ft in the air, nestling amongst the boughs of lofty scrub trees These houses serve as refuges when the village is attneked by neighbouring tribes The people form part of the Coijari tube, with tho chief of which our correspondent had an in terview He states -" Hte village is nearly surrounded by sugarcane plantations and bananas Some of tihs cane is 15ft long ! It these people, with their primitive ideas of agnculture, can produce such cane, what will scientitic agriculturists be able to do when they bring all the resources of our civilisation to bear on tho land ? These Robbertoom natives are very, very different from the Motu tribe at Port Moresby The latter nre the very incarnation of infernal scoundrels. Thieves from their cradles, they will smile at you and steal your eyebrows without your knowing it These inland natives have no religion, yet one's property is sacred among them If you drop anything and they find it, you will have it returned to you imme dintcly They are far more moral than Europeans Any breach of the marriage law is punished with death But from what I gathered from Luija the chief, such breaches are hardly ever known to occur The men and women of this Coijari tribe are very superior in physique to the "Motu" The women particularly are very well developed Their legs and thighs are immense, and it is owing entirely to their having to carry heavy weights from their very childhood that this is the case They seem perfectly happy and contented , they have their own rights, their own property, and are treated kindly, nay, affectionatelv, by their husbands Of course I am not going into heroics about them They are no more faultless than other women belonging to other people, but these Papuans have been always portrayed as such utter savages that I consider it my duty to let Aus tralian and English people know, without exaggeration, the kind of people they have chosen as fellow subjects Dogs and pigs were to be seen fighting every where And such dogs and pigs—little stunted dingoes and parti coloured pigs, the latter striped something like a young emu Every woman seems to have a young piggy as a pet It follows her about like a lapdog, whenever she sits down, down goes young 'Denis,' and as soon as she moves off goes his piggyship squeaking in her tracks The children were well worth studying Not like the Australian type at all They are a very handsome race as a whole, the children being particularly pleasing and intelligent . . 1 saw some of the very finest agricultural land here that ever my eyes rested on-superior in every respect to the Lower Herbert or Port Mackay in Queensland The grasses in some places formed a velvety sward of a beautiful emerald green, and quite 4in thick, completely covering the soil Kan garoos—the sole occupants-were hopping about enjoying the succulent herbage An Australian squatters heart would leap with anger to see such land under sugar But under sugar it eventually will be . . There are about 80 people in Robbertoom They cultivate large gardens, yams, sweet potatoes, taro, sugarcane of several varieties, bananas, tobacco, cocoanuts, titoo, and awaroni, the two last being native names for species of yam that I have not seen before Their gardens are neatly fenced in, and great care is taken to keep the land clear of weeds I have wondered that the missionaries have not introduced maize and other equally valuable crops among these people They would more than double the supply of food, without materially increasing the labour, and thus give more time for mental improvement . It is a pleasure to me to bear witness to the truly wonderful honesty of these so culled savages lho laws of property here are inviolable Everything is perfectly safe My things-the paraphernalia ot an exploring expedition, the thousand and one articles ot trade and use one has to carry about m acouutry Uko this-aro lying about m the verandah I occup) ,and strange to say they are safer there »han they vv ould bo m any European thorough are I If a till) bit of tobacco or a nuil or a jieco of paper foils through the cracks it will tie brought back tis soon us found And this is New Guinea! The land of the bloodthirsty Papuan The Coijari have no idea of a Deity that I can find out after repeated attempts They are strictly honest, m fact, they carry their honesty to ridiculous lengths-to such lengths that, were I to mention certain facts, my readers would blush My trip to Robbertoom is over 1 ara writing irom a village on the Astrolabe Range 1 ittcen Papuans are bing asleep round me, unmindful of the lact that nlles, revolvers, und breach-loading guns are plentiful, trust mg to my honom as I trusted to theirs, und perfectly sutished that I bIiuII deal lairl) by them as they dealt by me. 1 nuself feel as safe here ns in a church 'I he people v io with one another to show me ever] thing worth seeing My love of botany, and a habit 1 have of sticking specimens in my hat when on the mnrch, seems to bnve endenred me to them I reciprocate the feeling I am actually beginning to love these Papuans-so much be- lied, and ) et so good ' We hav e received further communications irom our special correspondent in New Guinea, dated July 17 and 1<> He was still with Luijo, the chief of the Coijari tribe, and they seem to bave been on the most friendly terms At the invitation of the chief, our correspondent went on a visit to Narinoona, Luija's village, E S E of Robbertoom On lhe way they ascended the Astrolabe Ranges, ¡he summit of which is 2,850ft bj aneroid measurement above sea lev c1 The animals ind birds are of the same species those indigenous to Austruhn, as is nlso lhe vegetation Writing from Nnnnoonn, our] correspondent observes -"Sitting on a rock nt the foot of Mount Astrolabe, I obtained a glorious view of the vale of Laloki.
