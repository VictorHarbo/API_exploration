LOYALTY TO UCP. -<>-. Waranga Action RUSHWORTH, Wednesday. - At a I well attended meeting of the Waranga district council of the United Country party, a motion was agreed to commending the State Parliament for having elected the Labour representative against the Liberal Country party representative for the Senate vacancy. Referring to a proposal that the Waranga district council should mediate with the breakaway section, Mr. R. V. Hoddlnot (Nagambie) said that he had moved the motion because he thought there might have been some chance of reconciliation. It was now apparent that the breakaways had no desire for it. He moved that the council thank the Parliamentary party and the central council for the sincere efforts for reconciliation, and express its loyalty to the central council and the Dunstan Government. The motion was agreed to. A motion was agreed to deploring the action of certain Country party Federal members in voting against the interests of primary producers on national insurance, and Country party Federal Ministers In voting to silence Mr. Wilson, M.H.R., when urging the stabilisation of the wheat industry. Motions were agreed to supporting the orchardists of Harcourt and Castlemaine in seeking Government assistance to carry on until next season's crop was harvested; that the council protest against high valuations for drainage rating; that the council directs the attention of the Government to the necessity for complet- ing the Eppalock weir; that in view of the successful administration of closer settlement by a commission, the council considered that the future control of settlement should be in the hands of a commission answerable to the Minister, and that, as far as possible, temporary officers, particularly field officers, should be appointed to the public service; that the council protest against any proposal to place little brothers and Danish immigrants on the land until such time as the sons of Australians were satisfactorily settled.
