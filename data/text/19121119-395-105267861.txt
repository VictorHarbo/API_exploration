Hundreds of women hail Dannebrog as a blessing to womankind, because no otheT remedy can so satisfactorily destroy superfluous hairs. No woman is looking her best if she has hairs 013 her face; and even slum people pity the unfortunate woman with inous'tacho or a beard.

STATEMENT BY AN ADELAIDE MAN Before a statement can be accepted here it must be supported by local tes timony-by the evidence of someone re siding in Adelaide. Statement from un known people in remote places may be true, but we cannot prove them. Here is a statement by an Adelaide man. MT. C. Meazel, 16 King "William street, Kent Town, Adelaide, says:-"For about twelve years I suffered from kidney and bladder trouble. The secretions were seriously disordered, being irregular, _he color of blood and causing intense pain. My back constantly ached, and this caused me a great deal of inconvenience. My rest at night was broken, and I was generally ill and miserable. I consulted the best doctors, and carefully followed their treatment, but without any bent fit. Then I "Was treated for three months in a hospital. They said there my only hope was in an operation, but I refused to undergo an operation. I lost two stone weight 111 a few months. I commenced using fcxiney remedies, but again met failure. I gave up bope, feel ing sure that nothing would ever do me any good. A man asked me had I yet used Doan's Backache Kidney Pills.
