SUMMARY FOR ENGLAND. THE COLONY OF VICTORIA. The Royal Mail steamship Oneida is under engagement to sail to-morrow with the Australian mails which should have been despatched on the 15th of January. The Oneida is the last of the vessels of the Royal Mail Company to be employed in the service of the Aus- tralian mail contract. On the 15th instant the Salsetie, the first of the Peninsular and Oriental Com- pany's boats, will sail on the new route, by way of Mauritius. The present opportunity is not a good one, but in order to keep up our monthly review of the history of the colony, we make use of it. In all probability, the mail by the Salsotte will be delivered at the same hour as this. The Euglish mails of February will bo due hero on the 6th of April, but as tho Oneida cannot bo at Suez on the 27th of February to receive them, the Australian colonies will havo to put'up with the inconvenience of allowing a month io pass without tho receipt of a mail. POLITICAL. The Parliament of Victoria rose on the l7th of December, the date of our last Summary, for the Christmas holidays, and re-assembled on tho 11 th of the following January. It was expected that tho session would bo a very brief ouo, and that after the rapid despatch of ooma necessary business, a dissolu- tion ttonld prepare the woy for n new Parliament, elected on the basis of the Keforui Rill recently enacted. Several causes have cormiiiced to disappoint this expectation, and it U at this moment doubtful whether the business now before the Houses will be disposed u( before the latter end of the preBent month. This delay is, In a great measure, to ho attributed to the factions ßpirit displayed hy the Opposition, who lose no opportunity of Importing into tho debates of tho Assembly the most extraneous and irritating topics. Whilst it has gained credit in many oiroles by lit, diligent and effective attention to the practical work of administration, and the evi dencoi'lhasattordedofarixietytodoalwitlidiftî cultits that besot mining enterprise especially the Cabinet of Mr. O'shanassy has exposée itself in many points to the attacks of i ti «nemice, and greatly weakened In consequenci Its political position. By the appointment o poison? notoilouBly unlitted by education antea-dent, and, in some cases, by persona .character, to the magistracy ot tho colony the Ministry have ciettod a strong politic feeling opposed to them. Members c the (iovormnent havo openly proclaimed 1: rarllamont their conviction of the necesalt of fUlirig official vacancies with political pai tisana. Ou th. '¿OtU ult., the Hon. Hour Milioi, thu Uommissionor of Trade and On toms, du-iurod in the Upper House that "j was an inévitable clrcu-istauce that tfc ofiicea 01 thu Government should be filled u whou vucancles occurred with supporters of ti Government. It waa the eourso which hi been imisued by preceding Governments, an would bu adopteü by succeeding ones. The Vieta man, und not angels. It was necess¡ti that competent men Bhould be appointed I the ollie s, but they wore pretty sute to 1 appointed from among supporters of tho G veinnu-ut." To throw aside this principio appointment, the Lou. gentleman said wou be to strive after "a ridiculous and ii .possible purity." The general publio feeling of tho colony far from coinciding with tho views of t! Ministry on this point. Tho Press has almc nniveisiilly condemned tho principle as mc nnoouud and dangurouB. it is felt that : adoption would bring lu the Amoricau ayate of packing the public offices bodily with pc tical adherents, and making a general swe to propore the way for new mon on eve Ministerial change. If one Government fou it iniuostjible to conduct the administrât! with subordinate opposed to thom in pc tics, and determined accordingly to conti all patronage to their own supporter?, eve new Ministry coming into office muse bri with thom an entire army of new mon. _ American system would thus have to resorted to as a necessary measure of si protection, whilst Us evils would be ex ileuced In an exaggerated form, because ( changes of adminlutration do not occur as the States at fixed and comparatively dist! intervulB.butwheneverandhowoftensoovor chapter of political accidents moy dctormi It is felt to be all the more extraordin; and unsatisfactory thuttbis principio of pa patronage should be uudisguisedly adopted the uissont Government, since they have A somewhat of ostentation issued a scheme tho "competitivo examination" of candidi for public employment. It is fait to extraordinary as indicating gross incoe toncy.and uoBatisfaotory as suggesting a gr doubt ua to the honesty with which tho amioation scheme 1B likely to bo wor in the department to which alone id at present professodly applied, 1 matter of pationage is, without do the weak point of the Government. It subject on which the public generally sensitive, so that whilst the Ministry have boen endeavoring to strengthen thutnse by patronising their partlsauB, they hav< reality weakoned themselves by di violence to a publio sentiment. From Indications which have been thus offoi of a disposition to abuso tho prer tlve of appointment, a strong re-actioi movement has been begotten. A Bil before the Upper Honso, rendering all per holalng ofhccB of profit under the Otown ( the exception of tho responsible Ministers eligible for seats. A very stringen t clause been inserted in this Bill in Oommittee, dering every person accepting au offlo profit, not only whilst o member of the H but within six months after he has ceased to be a member, liable to a heavy pecuniary penalty (£609) recoverable by any plaint 'i'hosubjectot tho purity of political at 1B undergoing, ventilation in connection Other forms of political practice. It has discovered that grave abuses exist in present system of electoral registration. stalling has become quite a familiar wo our debates. In our anxiety to oarry o Its fullest extent the principle of uulv suffrage, faoilitios for /eglstration have afforded which enable any political agei pack tho roll with names belonging to pe whose utter indifference to publio a renders them at election times the easy of unscrupulous partisans. A measur been introduced, and passed through se of its stages which makes the registratl qualified electors the work of Govorm to he performed by an instrumentality similar to that by which the consus re areobtained. One objection urged again* scheme is the enormouB annual expei would entail upon tho country. A much BoriouB one Iles in the fact it leave, the existing facilities the registration of improper pt unabated. By this term we mean pi disqualified for the enjoyment of ele privllerrea by political ignorance and inert nets. The eBtr.rjliBb.ment of univeroal suff- rage wnB no1, it is contended, designed to place on the electoral roll every man, whether he had or had not a political idea, or an iota of interest in public affaire, but to throw the Buffrage open to all whose interest in the business of the country was tool and earnest. To enable this conception of universal suffrage to bo embodied in our registration system, it has been proposed that the onus of registering Bhall be thrown on tho elector -iinBelf, and that no claim. Bhall be inserted on the roll unless it boars tho aignature of the claim .nt. At present, however, Parliament seems indis- posed to accept the suggestion. Very little advance haB been made in our mining legislation oinco wo last noted pro- grese. Tho Solicitor General has explained the provisions of his Bill for the leg.lisation undor certain circumstances, of mining on Erivato property discovered to be auriferous, ut no discussion has yet been taken on tho measure. The Assembly has been proceeding, when party feeling has not interfered, with the Estimates for the year, The end of this all but interminable catalogue of our public expenditure haB almost been reached. The passing of the Appropriation Bill will be the signal for a dissolution. Before this comes, howover, wo are to have the Ministerial statement of the principles to be em- bodied in the Land Bill to bo submitted to the new Parliament. Mr. O'shanassy has j promised this for Tovaday next. Ou Wednes- day evening a land discuB3iou was attempted in the Assembly, Mr. Everard having Bub tm'tted tliu following resolutions : " That it is desirable, for the purpoBe of pro venting speculation in tho public lands, aud tho squandering of tho publio domain, prior to the passing of a permnment land law, to impose conditions of cultivation and resi- dence on the purchase of all agricultural lands, and to limit the amount of such lands to be sold to any one individual. " KeQolved, therefore, that until the let day of January next, no larger quantity of such land than one hundred and sixty (160) acres sholl be sold to any one individual. "That Bach landa shall bo sold on strict condition of cultivation and residence, to ba performed within 12 months from tho day of sale, otherwise tho salo to bo void, and the deposit hereinafter mentioned to be tor felled." " That fhe amount of cultivation to be required shall bs one acre in every ten, and the residence shall bo for at least eight months next preceding tho expiration of tho 12 months hereinbefore mentioned. "That the purchaser shall be required, at tho time of sale, to pay a deposit ot ten (10) por cent, upon the price, and that at any time previous to tho expiration of twelve months, on paying the balaceo of the purchaso money, and producing BaÜBfactory evidence (a part of v/hich shall be his own affidavit),, that he has complied with the conditions bereinbeioro montioned, he shall become entitled to his grant." Theso resolutions were opposed by the Government as likely to intorfero with the revenue data upon which the financial ar- rangements for the year had been framed. It was proposed to get tiri of them altogether by a motion to defer their consideration for six months, but an amendment to postpone their discussion only until tho day after the promised statement of policy from the Go- vernment waa carried on division. Mr. William Nicholson baa re entered the colonial Legislature OB member for the district of tho Murray. His candidature was con- tested by Professor Hearn, of the üniver sity of Melbourne, a circumstance which gave rise to a question as to tho eligibility of acorn bination of the two offices of Professor and Parliamentary representative. Mr. Nicholson on entering the Houso took bia Beat on the Opposition Benches, and bia name is in- cluded in most of the Ministerial com- binations which are spoken of as likely to replace the O'shanassy Govenmcnt, when its timo comes. How near or bow datant that event may bo depends simply upon the throw of the die. The present Ministry have dono much, as we have said, to consolidate support ; nnd as far as tho administration of the departments of Go- vernment is concerned, have fully realised all tho expectations it was reasonable to enter- tain. It must be said that tbey have applied themselves industriously to tho duties oi their position. But, unfortunately for thom nud for the country, what they have done in this respect they have to a groat extent undone in others. And ono of the singular circumstances of the political position is, how men who have shown in one direction BO much political sagacity, should betray in another so much misapprehension ol the temper and tendency of the publio mind April next will probably witness the new elections. What their issue will bo; who are our coming men ; what political elements al present undeveloped will spring Into life ; what luminaries bo eclipsod, and what no« unknown stars nrisain thone w firmament; hov existing parties ti iii bo uffjeted, modified, 01 displaced, are questions, which the couditioni of our political Ufa ut this moment aro to: crude and unfixed to ouable uti to determine. THE GOLD-FIELDS. Between the time devoted to holiday making at Christinas, and the frequent in- terruptions from the late floods, the regular work of the miner has been much broken in upon during tho last six weeks. Still the escort returns, although varying widely eaoh week, havo not shown any falling-oil on the average, and it is a noticeablo fact that (the amounis forwarded from the oldest gold- fields have been the best maintained, thua proving that theso are yet a long way from being worked out. In fact, it becomes eaoh day moro evident that under a system allowing of association, and the working of large partios In proportionately largo tracts of ground, the gonoral yield must fast Increase again. Quartz mining is now the main-stay ot the long-worked goldfields, and Eome of the most valuable reefs have to be abandoned, or the work bus to be stopped until some equitable mode of compelling each small party of claim- ownora to bear a fair share of tho expense of keeping the reefs clear of water, oan be carried out. The excess of water experienced as tho shafts attain to any groat depth, and tho impoBBlbility of this being drawn off from one claim without at tho same time draining those adjoining, for which service the owners of the claims so bonefitted cannot be compelled to pay, has ruined or driven out in despair many a small party, which If form lug part of an association to work the Bame reef from the most convenient point for the benoät of all, would have been richly re- warded for their labors, instead of being constantly baffled in their struggle with an element that ought to be au aid, and not a hin- drance, on the gold-fields. A3 difficulties of this nature arise attempts ato made to provide against thom by special by-laws, and even by législation ; but BO incongruous aro the different parts, und ao inapplicable is tho entire system of small holdings to the older gold Holds, that nosooner is one difficulty patcbod up than another breaks forth. In only ono dlstri.t, that of Ballaarat, have leasing regulations been yet proclaimed, but in nil flint, nrn nn-lnil-Wr lnnlrnrt fnr fin. vernment has been propared for some time I paat to IBBUO regulations tor all, tho delay being oauBed by tho Mining Boards, which from a defect in the Gold- fields Act have still the power practically to prevent the issue of leases, although one of the special objects of tho Act was to deprivo local bcdits ol this power. Now, however, the old Mining Boards aro to be replaced by a general election of new members, and BO Btrong is the feeling of a majority ot the miners in favor of an in- troduction of the leasing system, that the new boards are not likely to be so obstructivo as wera the majority of those about to be replaced. -ince tho opening up of the Indigo Lead no discovery of especiul importance has been made. The hopes nf tboao who expected other loads equally rich tobo found in that part of the country have not been realised, bat several quartz-reefs with indications of great richness hare been taken up and par Hally worked, although there is as yet little or no quartz-orushlng-machinery in that far- away district. Indeed, on all tho gold-fields the discovery of new reefs is of constant oc- currence. Those are either found cropping oat on the surface, or are encountered acci- dentally in deep sinking, or underground driving. We have seldom to record tho dis- covery of first-rate alluvial ground, but of nn_lferona_eefa.it moy be truly said there is no end. Nor are the paying portionr of these of Bmoll extent, or confim-ri toa few feet near the surface, it haviog been the case with many of the reefs worked hitherto that the Btono increases in richness with the depth. Much importance is attached by many to the lately-published analysis of an ore found in different parts of the Bendigo (liîtriot, but, until cow, treated as rubbish, and thrown asido with refuse matter from the mouth of the shafts. The analysis of one chemist shows the existence of zinc in the proportion of nearly one-half, with iron and sulphur present in quantity, and as much as one por cent, of gold. If such were to bo the average yield, the gold alone would nay enormously; but another chemist says that ho also has tried specimens from these veins of ore, and that the average proportion of these metals is BO small that the oro is really as valueless as it was long supposed to be, although possibly email pieces might be found which we.uld yield such a result in the laboratory. With tho conflicting testimony now before the public, no opinion can bu formed of the value of these veins of ore ; but specimens have been Bent to different chemists for analysis, and it is to be hoped that their reports will set at rest a now much disputed point. LABOR. Every week the report from the labor offices in town is, that the demand is dull, that many more men are offering their services than are immediately required; tbo farmers aro supplied with all the extra bands they want through tho harveBt ; hundreds of mon areidliDg about all the railway works, on the chance of being taken on ; many trades- men and meebanics have long been seeking employment in vain ;-such is the burden of eaoh week's report, and unfoitunatoly the statements are too true. A state of things which a few months since was believed to be only temporary, and certain to be abolished for some years at least by the commencement of railway?, has become chronic, and it is now hard to predict when the demand aud supply in this market will be more evenly balanced, lu two or three of tho outlying districts the furmors s«y they cannot get as many men as they want, but the number they require ÍB but stnull, und does not militate against the truth of the reniatk so frequently beard, that we cannot find profitable employment for nil the working hands wo possess even at this the busy season of the year, and that there must bo some yet unexplained, or rather unrecog- nised, cause for such a state of affairs in a now and wealthy country. But for the quail tity of rain which has unexpectedly fallen on nil the gold-ficlde, at short periods during the last two months, tho number of unemployed would have been far greater than iti?. The abundance of water has allowed many to con tinuo the avocation of gold-digging «ho would otherwise have been obliged to leave the gold-fielde during tho summer, and pud dlers and other employers of labor have boen enabled to keep their mills and machinery at work, aud retain the eorvices of the men whom, but for the unseasonable though not unwelcome supply, thoy would have bet-n long since obliged to part with. The farmers also have, in conBcquonoe of the wetnesB of the sea- son, been obliged to keep their extra men at work much longer than usual. So there are many reasons why wo should have no super- fluous labor just now ; yet the supply is far in excess of the demand. Several meetings of the unemployed traies-1 men and others have been lately held ia Melbourno, to make known and direct atten tion to what the speakers believed to be the causes of the present difficulty in obtaining employment. Unfortunately politics ure too much mixed up with this question by tho men who figure most prominently on such occasions. No doubt the mode of disposing of, or rather of locking up, the public lands, and other mistakes made at different timea by the partizan politicians of this country are the prime causeB of the ovil ; but the romoval of impediments to the itencral progress is a work of time, and hungry men cannot wait with pationce to seo wi at they have to expect from the mensurua of a reformed Parliament. The course taken by the uscociated memberi of the diff-ront trades is also an unwise one. Am-mij the masons, for instance, there is a determi- nation not to work below the eenie of wages fixed by the trade. If business were good, and labor in even moderate request, the rate would be fair and reasonable enough, but when house and store rent Is falling lust, and there la a general disinclination among men of capital to inveBt hi building, it would bo manifestly the lntereet of this traie to Euccumh to the times, nnd work for a Bomowhat reduced rate of pay, rather than to maintain an artificial ecalu of woge?, whioh only a small proportion of their body can really obtain. In their dispute with the contractors, the rate of payment has also becomo involved with the original cause of difference, and agents have been 6ent to Europe for the purpose of brlngiug oui inusonB from Switzerland and Germauy, whe will be glad to work (or half the rate demanded by the trade hore. In COBBI quenct of the long - continued strike, of which there is no prospect of a termination, it if also likely that Iron will be substituted for Btone-work, wherover such a chango can be made; so that the quantity of work to be don« by masons will be much reduced, and addl tional hands will be brought to theoountry ti do it. Union among the tradesmen for thi purpoia of affording legitimate a'sistance ti each other is praiseworthy and beueficl ii, hu when they combino In the hope of obtatului a fictitious value for their services they an sure to suffer most themselves in the end whatever Bpirlt aud endurance they ma; display dunns the struggle. While we cauno" admit the wisdom of the proceedings of som' of tho associated trudea of thiB colony, wi are bound, however, to state that they havi strong and just grounds of complaint, botl against the Government and the railwa; contractors. The Government have insartei a olattBO in tho railway contracts probibitin, the contractors from sab-lottlng the work without permission, but this permission ha hitherto been granted, altbongh tua uecesait' of withholding It has long since been prove! by the cccurrence of Beveral cuses ii whioh the workmen on public work have been defrauded of their wages b; the failure or flight of dishonest and iusol vent subcontractors. The railway con traotors, too, have beon openly charged wit! transmitting falsa information to Europe, bj means of advertisements and letters, respect ing the state of our labor market. No sails factory answer to the churge hn8 boen offeree and the evidence in support of it ia so stron that the wor._i.ig classes In Great Brituli would not, we think, be justified in plaeiu the slightest reliauce ou any statements thii moy be made to them In future, either by th rullway contractors, or by their agents, r< spectlng the labor murket of thla colony. AGIUOULTUKE. It has long been a matter of general belle/ that the Bummers of Australia are all BUQ shino and drought, rarely tempered by a pass- ing shower ; but tho farmers have had during ' the last year or two convincing proof to the contrary-nover before, however, to the same extent as this season. Evor since tho earliest bay crops were fit to cut the weather has been broken, not a week passing without a heavy fall of rain, eo heavy in Bomo parts of the ! country na to cause serious damage, and very much to impede and delay the operations of harvest. There waa a tórrido thunderstorm at Geelong last week, daring which an immense quantity of rain fell within a very short space of time. This waa succeeded by hail of alarming and destructive raagnitudo Near town the hailstones did not exceed tho size of wulnutB, but on the plaina to the north-cast ward lumps of ice fell, some of which measured more than six inches ia circumfe- rence. These of courBe beat down everything before them, passing through the roofa ot bouses, smashing fences, stripping fruit trees, killing fowls, calves, and even fall grown cattle. Such a quantity of ball fell In some filaces, that although the storm occurred early a the afternoon, on the following morning masses of the hailstones, four or five feet thick, waa found even thon unmelted, having been blown or washed together by the flood, which oxceeded anything ever witnessed be fera in that part of the country. Geelong, has been often visited previously by hailstorms, si vere enough to break a quantity of glass, and do other damage of a similar natnre, but tbo storm of last week far exceeded them all i i violence. The general state of the country may be imagined from the fact thut at the trial of roaping-machinoä near Melbourne a month since the maohlne3 when set to work actually bogged in the harvest field, although this is on high and sloping ground, well-aituated for drainage. So soft wore Bomo portions of the field that the woik allotted to the machines could not bo performed, aud each had to be tried by itself where the ground was Bound enough to carry it. At this trial, which was not very largely attended, the farmers being now well acquainted with the different reaping-machines in use, tho prize was taken by a Melbourne-made machino with a side delivery, and Burne trifling improvomentB iu tho cutting parts. Oao good effect of tho unusual weather we have hud during the last two months is to be seen in the general aspect of the couutry, so different from what it usually presenta at this time of year. Insteadof being thoroughly parched up and quite bare of grass, even the plainB are covered with verdure, and grasB la everywhere abundant. The crops, too, are much heavier than was expected dmiog the exceedingly dry spiing, but the qnality will not bo so good as usual. Much hay has been quite spoiled, or very serioUBly injured in appearance and value, and the grain, although plump and full, is generally much discolored. Before it was quite ripe much of the stand- ing corn was weather-beaten in appearance, and little or none has been secured without one or two wettings after it was down. The farmers have had, altogether, a most trying season to contend with-trying both to their skill and to their pecuriary resources, for the harvesting expenses this season are much greater than they should have been consider- ing the moderate rate of wages. Thoro is now some prospect of the Board ol Agriculture Bill being passed thia session, unless the sitting of Patliamont is brought te a close sooner than appears likely at present It has beon passed by the Oouncil, and while before the Committee some altera tiona were made whioh will tend to disarm any opposition it might otherwise have encountered in the Assembly. The political elemont, of which some were, or pretended te be, so much afraid, has been quite expunged As tho Bill now Btands, the Board is te consist of representatives chosen by the different agricultural societies, together with threo persons to be nominated by Govan ment on account of their Bcientifio attain mt nts. It was proposed that the Olde Secretary and the President of the Board o Land aud Works for tho time being shoult have an ex officio right to seata at the Board but a cry was raisud that this was oui; required to give them a political influent» over the farmers, and It haB boon decided b; the Council that Government is to have ni part in the management. Thus, if the Boan ia constituted according to the provisions o the Bill as amended, the farmers will hav only themselves to blame if its eBtablishmen dü63 not nrove beneficial to their interest. . Mr. Ledger, whose name ia known in Eng- land as the porBevering collector of alpacas in Peru and Bolivia for shipment to Australia, and whoEe arrival at Sydney was notified last month, has sent an agent hither, to offer the whole flock to Government on terms which we scarcely think will be accepted. There ia little prospect of disposing of these aDimals at Sydney, as they must be sold in one lot or not at all, and tho amount ia moro than individuals are inclined to risk on an experi- ment. The price for the entire flock, consisting of 270 in all, is fixed at £35,000. If a sale cannot be offccted, Mr. Ledgor would, we believe, be willing to bring thurn to Victoria and eettle hero, pro- vided that the sum of £10 000 is advancod to pay off liabilities incurred in South Amerioa, and a run is given to bim rent free. If neither of those propositions be agreed to, the whole flock is to be sent back to Chili without the Bale of an individual animal, Buch belog Mr. Ledger's agreement with his creditor there. As to the likelihood of alpacas thriving in thlB colony, there is much difference of opinion. It ia doubted by many that the climate of any inhabited part of Our territory is suited to their habits, and with this feeling eo go'ieral it is scarcely to be expecÇed that Parliament will place so large a sum at the disposal of Government for an experiment which ought first to bo tried on a smaller scale. _ RAILWAYS. In railway affairs the all-absorbing event of the month has been the opening of the first portion of the main line from Melbourne to Sandhurst. On the 13th ult., this and the line to Williamstown were formally opened by the Governor, accompanied by the members of Parliament, the City Corporation, Government officials, and some 3,000 persons besides, who had all been invited by the contractors to a grand dejeuner at Sunbury, in honor of the occasion. The line to Williamstown should have been completed long since; but no time has been lost in preparing for traffic the only considerable portion of the national lines that can be rendered available within the next two years; beyond Sunbury the heavy work commences, and all that time will be required to complete tbe next few miles. On the Geelong and Ballaarat line the great difficulty, the one work which will require years for its completion, the viaduct across the Moorabool, is only three miles from town; so we must be content with the use of this first portion of our national railways for the present. On this there were no engineering difficulties to be overcome, the line passing over a gradually rising plain all the way, with a small water- course to be bridged here and there. Still the construction of so many miles of such a very substantial railway within a period of seven months is something for a young colony to be proud of. Although the earthworks were trifling, the quantity of broken stone must amount to something enormous, the whole line being ballasted with small bluestone metal. Some delay was also caused by the masons having all struck work several weeks before; still the appointed day was kept, and a large number of persons were conveyed safely to their destination without accident or inconvenience, save what arose from the engines not having sufficient power to draw such long trains up-hill without frequent stoppages. Notwithstanding the speed with which this portion of the line has been formed, the soundness of the work was evinced by the smoothness with which the heavy trains ran, even at the highest speed. On this score the most critically inclined engineers and men of experience in such work a could find no fault, although some object to what they call the needless extravagance of using such a thickness of rather costly material as ballast. Some saving, no doubt, there might be in the first cost of these railways, but the principle on which our national railways are to be constructed is that of having the permanent ways constructed of the best material, aud in the most substantial manner, without any lavish expenditure on ornamental work or buildings, and this, in the end, will probably prove to be the most economical system. The line to Williamstown haB been open to the public during the last two weekc, and the line to Sunbury is to be opened for general traffic on the 10th instant. What the traffic on this portion of the line may be is u point respecting which no decided opinion can be formed. In such a short dis tanoo there can be no great saving of time for passe.gers, and the chargea arc fixed at such a high rate that there can be no great savin» of expense either. Under theso circumstances, it is a question whether the coach pr opile tora will consider it worth their while to break up their establish- ments in town and transfer them to Sunbury, making that their startlng-place, or whether they will not be rather inclined to run this short distance on the macadamised road in opposition to the rail. If this alteration be not made, the passenger traffic will be prin- cipally confined to pleasure-seekers from town in search of the picturesque, and the com- paratively small number of inhabitants in the district around the temporary terminus. Travellers to and from the gold fields must still patronise the coaches and adapt themselves to the arrangements of the proprietors. Nor is it at all more likely that any change will be made in the present system of loading drays and waggons at once from the merchants' stores in town. If goods are sent by the rail- way they must be loaded and unloaded twice before they are placed on the waggon at San bury, th*t is to deliver them at their destination; and this extra work, together with the railway charges, would amount to as much, or more than the ordinary carriers would charge for the same dißtanco. The road ia good, and as the mercba-tj and storekeepers aro likoly to pre- fer that system which la most convenient to themselves, giving at the same time an undi- vided responsibility in case of loss or damage, the carriers will have little iuducment to stop at Sunbury : and on them and the coach proprietors it will principally depend whether this township is io becotno a place of im- portance duriDg the next two yearn or »of. Beyond Sunbury little has been done during the last few weeks, the contractors having put out their whole strength on the first sec- tion of the line, to have it finished in time. On the Geelong and Ballaarat line, the prin- cipal work, the viaduct, has been at a stand- still for some time, in consequence of the body of masons refusing to work on either line until the system of aub contracting is abolished, and their scale of payment adopted. Just now there is a trial of strength and en- durance between the contractors and the masons, without any proBpeot at present of a trnce being proclaimed ; so our national rail- way works generally do not advance as fust as thev oucht. With regard to the purchase of the Geelong and Melbourne line, no final arrangements can bo made for some (imu. Onthe27thult.the Chief Secretary made a full and elaborate statement of the origin and present petition of the company, and submitted a series of resolutions to the Assembly, affirming the desirability of empoweiing the Government to purchnse the company's right, title, and Interest in this railway, on the following tonna, narady : " I. That an authentic and aatisfocfoiy statement of the whole expenditure and lla bilitieE incurred hy the company be furnished to Hie Gjvornmenf. " II. That the assent and authority of the proprietary to the transfer of the line bo ob- tained. " III. That the Government be authorised to pay in cash, for the entire proparty of the company, i-uch payment to be chargeable on the sum of £8,000,000 already authorised by Parliament for tho construction of rail- ways'. " IV. That on the ratification of the terms proposed, a Bill be submitted to Parliament, enabling the Government to carry into effect tho terms of purchase agreed upon." The resolutions were carried by a largo majority ; and on the 1st inst. the adjourned half-yearly meeting of the shareholders of the company was held at Geelong, when, the report having been road and soma explana- tions given by the Chairman, the following resolutions were put to the meeting and passed, the last by a majority of only seven votes : "1. That all guaranteed interest whichmay become poyablo by tho Government to the company be appropriated to pay tho mott gage interest, in accordance with the 69th clause of the Act of Incorporation, until the company shall be in a position to provide for it otherwise." "2.ThattheEngliBhBharoholdersbeBppclally addressed nu to the propriety of being repre- sented at the next half-yearly meeting, in order to consider the resolutions arrived at by the Legislature with recpect to their under- taking." "3. That the directors of this company be, and tbey heieby are, authoriged, If necessary, to apply to tho Legislature fur an Act autho- rising the laaue of preferential shares, to remedy the present anomalous position of the company's debenture hoads, to carry out the arrangement» entered into with tho Ashby Association, and to amend the several iuaccu ruciefi existing in the Act, as counted out in counsel's opinion." " d. That it IB the opinion of this meeting that, in conformity with tho practice of all railway lines, this company should run such number of passenger trains on Sunday na would meet the gonerol publio convenience, and afford an opportunity to residents along the line to attend Divine service, either In Geelong or Melbourne, but that such trains should not rnu during the usual boura of church service, and that no goods traffic of uny kind be permitted on that doy." in tue ntraire of other private co-ipanies we have no alteration to report, except that the St. Kilda and Brighton Railway Company's Extension Bill has been passed by the Assem- bly. The Suburban Company's line to Bich mond ia nearly completed, and will bo opened for traffic in a few days. AMÜSEMENTS. At the Theatre Royal, a pantomime, en- titled "Bobin Hood," but having little of Bobin Hood in it except th9 name, was pro- duced on the customary day. It had a run of about three weßks. Tho getting up was in Bomo respectB creditable to the management. Somo little American ladies, of the name of Worroll, were enr/oged coincidently with the bringing out of this piece. They dance very prettily, aud the younga is peculiarly agile. Since tho withdiawal of the pantomime, aeveral old burlesques have bson revived. Mr. Brooke has now returned, and is gsing thiough another " round of his great charac- ters," though it was understood that the grand " round " of laut March was to be his final one. This broaking faith with the public is generally o.-nsidered as reflecting but little credit upon cither the manage- ment or the tragedian. Mr. and Mrs. Heir have been ro-ongoged. The Princess's Theatre opened on Boxing night with a new company, including the Misses Nelson, and Mr. Fawcett : the other names are mostly new to the Melbourne boards. Mr. Greville is the lessee, and he is also a low comedian of great merit. He has already become a very special favorite. The opening piece was the extravaganza of '.Camaralzaman and Badoura." This was most efficiently represented, whether B3 regards the genoral getting up or individual exertion. The musical portions were particu- larly well g1 ven, for the three Misses Nelson are all accomplished vocalists, and Mr. Greville possesses a rich, olear voice, which he USCB with the happiest effect in delivering the aeveral humoroua compositions with which tho burlesque ia interspersed. Mits Carry Nelson has taken theatre-goers by surprise, for whereas when at the Theatre Royal sha was regarded only as a very clever actress of what aro teimed " chambermaids' parts," nae has, as it were, all at once acquired tho excellence of a thorough burlesque actress, Misa Sara Nel- son's voico has wonderfully improved and developed itself during the period of her absence from Melbourne. She gives indica Hong of boin« eventually a bigh-clasa operatic singer. To the burlesque named, that of "Atalanta" succeeded, and the last piece of this kind which has been presented ia " The Invisible Ptinco," which was pro iuoed for the first time on the 27th ulr.,the occasion of Miss Carry's benefit, Light vaudeville and extravaganza are manifestly the class of dramas for the successful performance of which this company la best fitted, and the mansgimenc has, with come exceptions, ex- hibited a disposition to keep within this range of pieces. The priceB of the theatre have been modified with evident advantage to tho establishment. Two new pianists have made their appear- ance before a Melbourne nudionce. Tho first is a Mr. Boulstnger, who has been some time io Sydney, where ho io said to have acquired considerable favor. His style of playing Is characterised by much delicaoy of taBte, und warmth of expression. M. Lisâignol, the other debutant, Is a recent arrival from Europe. He is manifestly a thorough musician, and haE evidently studied in the first Echools. His manner ia bold, decided, and evoti grand and his presence among us is a decided ac qulsitlon. At Cremorne Gardens a fair in imitation of the English effete institution, was extern poriBed during the Christmas week. It wai but a sorry mockery of the real thing, ant; was admissible to a Hinitod numbor on pay- ment of half-a-crown. Mr. Butler, willow of the late Mr. Samue Butler, bas lately arrived ia the colony. She has given ono Shakspearian reading witt much succoBä. There can ba little questior that the intellectual kind of entcrtulnmen abo will in all probability establish w11 become very popular. COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. Tho golel market has boen, as IB usual at this season of the year, dull. Production has been at its-lowest ebb, and the quantities dis- posed of by the minors have been small as compared'With the general averages of previ o_i y.ears.. Among Melbourne bullion-brokers there has not been much doing. The prices j quoted by them have been;-For Omeo, G7_. C j. to 7is. Gd. ; Pleasant Creek and Goulburn, H¡. Oj. to 76J. ; Castlemaine, Sandhurst, aud Jim Crow, 75s. to 1Ù3. ? Ararat, Maryborough, Dunolly, Fiery Creek, Avoca, and Ambetst, 763\. to 77s. ; Ovens and Yackandandah, 77a. to 78a. 6d. ; Ballaarat, 77s, Od., to 78j. 6J. per ounce. These prices are based on the calcula- tions of 74j. GJ. per ounce for standard gold; or, with export dnty added, to 77s. The last escorts received at the Treasury amounted to 34,507 ounces, against 3G.GS1 ounces for the corresponding week of last year. The separate quantities received are uboutthe average, those from the older fields of Castle- maine and Bendigo being above, and those from Ballaarat nnd Ararat below. The total yet brought down Is in excess of that of tho same period of 1853. In the following list the escorts are compared with those of the fourth week in January, 1858, the fortnightly beiuu distinguished from tho weekly by the prefix of an asterisk: Gold-Huld.

So much for the returns of the gold-fields for the currant year. Since our last monthly Bummary, the year 1858 has beon brought to a close, and we are enabled to comparo the gold-fields statistics of that year with those of its predecessors. The escort returns amounted **to 2,295,053 ounces, against 2,478,826 ounce3 for 1857. The weekly average production was 44.841 ounces, against 47,670 ounces for 1857. The weekly average of tho first quarter of the year was 41,925 ounces; of the seeond, 45,290 ounces ; of the third, 48,235 ounces ; and of the fourth, 43,917 ounces. The shipments of the year amounted to 2,501812 ounces, or, 104 tons 7cwt. lqr. 9 b. 4oz. troy. The quantity shipped in 1857 amounted to 2,752,869 ounces, or 114 tons 14cwt. 81b.; and in 1856 to 3,007,281 ounces, or 125 tons Ccwt. Gib, 9JZ. In the following table, complied by Messrs. W. Clarke and Sons, our shipments are given month by month from tho oponiog np of the gold fieldB to the close of the year : The discrepancy between ihe totals of tho last three years in thisieturn and those given above arises from the tiifferent way in which tho shipments at the beginning and the end of the years are apportioned.

The quarter's revenue amounted to £906 859, against £830,276 for the correspond in« quarter of 1857, tho net increase being £56 583. There was an Increase in the Customs of £37.545, iu the ports and harbors of £590, In the licencea of £106,295, in the postage of £3,664, and in miscellaneous receipts of £2,_48. There was a decrease iu the gold-fields receipts of £3,568, in land revenuo of £89,668, in fees of £505, and In fines aad forfeitures of £1,019. We subjoin a table, showing the revenue of the quarters and the year?, aide by side. In both periods it will ba seen that the great Item cf decrease has heen in the land department Less land has been alienated from the Grown, and less revenue has accrued in consequonce.

The returns of the nine banks carrying on business in the colonies were completed last night for the third quarter of 18G8, and their averages compare very evenly with those of preceding quarters. There Is a slight diminution in the stock of bullion and specie, and, as compared with 1867, of advances 1 to customers, but the fluctuations have been so gradual and unimportant as scarcely to call for remark. Some consternation waa caused at the commencement of the year by the temporary suspension of n house enjoying unbounded credit; butthediffioulties.although of u character not to be foreseen and guarded agfinsc, wore speedily met and surmounted, - aud confidence has been re- established. The clamor raised by the London shareholders of the Geelong and Melbourne Ballway has ' canBed gome diegos*. The report, it appears, has been in part believed that the Victorian Government has entered into an engagement, and has not carrlod it out. The statement of tho Chief Secretary, in the House, on Thura, day, tho 27th January, is a complete answer to thu attacks whioh have been made on tho integrity of tho Government of this colony, and the proposal to buy the line on équitable 'oros,forc.ifb, will be regarded in-thought of a guarantee to the exioliug .praprietuo m that their cUimi will be met. .Under Buy circumstances, the line will .be a. .dear one ts the country, but tho expediency of ptircha^iriK it is ReucrtHy .admitted.
