IMMIGRATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir-Will you permit me to respectfully' suggest for the consideration of "the powers that be,' that it would be money well spent to have the " Prize Essay " published by the Philadelphia Exhibition Commissioners translated into Ino German," Dutch, Swedish, and Danish languages, for distribution through the Resident British consuls or other agents, among the n numerous working men's associations in those countries The printing might be haps be done by the Government press, in which case the only expense would be the cost of translation and freight-say Â£200 at the utmost, and I am sure it would be the means of attract- ing to this colony a great number of those emigrants who are even now leaving; the counties mentioned for America in thousands per vv deck, only to meet with dismay pointment and sometimes actual starvation on their arrival there The superior inducements offered by this colony need only be made known to make every emigrant possess d of common sense, and who can possibly afford to pay the difference in the cost of passage, prefer New South Wales to America, and if arrangements could be made to offer emigrants has enges from English and continental ports to Sydney at rates, not higher than those to American ports, I think something like one-half of the total early emigration from Europe could be secured for the benefit of this colony for years to come.
