To the Electors of Mary borough. GENTLEMEN.— In accordance with a re quest to allow myself to he nominated as a candidate for tbe representation of Mary borough, I consent to do so. After seeing what the policy of the present Government is, I can only come forward as an Isdependent Candidate, reserving a right to vote for or againBt any measures the Government may bring before Parliament. I agree with a great part of .ibp policy de clared, but I think the Lauob Question should be settled, as promised, one way or the other, and I c nsider it doubtful policy to lower -wages by increasing immigration before a large loan for publio works has been subscribed for. If elected I will use my best endeavor, to Beoure . Line Westward via Gayndah, and urge the immediate construction of the Lines already passed to Kilkivan and Bundaberg. My knowledge of the requirements of tbe District, and my interest as a local man will insure my very best attention to the Dredging of tbe Biver, the improvement of the Harbor generally, and tn. all matters tending to benefit Maryborough nnd District. I approve of the proposed Loan to be floated by the Government, and will work to secure a fair .bare of it for Public Works in this District. The principle cf the Land Bill, .ubstitnting tbe leasing of large areas instead ot alienation, 1 approve of. . . ! I am in favor of developing Goldfields by offering liberal re war 3 e for tlie Disoorery of Payable Fields, and in granting the use of Diamond Drills to person, io searoh of mineral deposiu. My experience in the Council will assist me materially in dealing with any question, affect ing tbe Municipality, and I shall endeavour to obtain the concession of Jrd off the Loan charged for our Waterworks, recommended by tbe Municipal Conference. As this wonld reduce the Water Bate by one third, I consider it of the greatest importance. Additional ^Representation.— I feel satisfied I could .how that we .hould have an additional | member for. the town, i shall at an early date meet the eleotors, and I explain my views.
