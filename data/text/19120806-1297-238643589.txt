In their half-yearly circular, Messrs, II, E, Moss, of Liwrpool, Loudon, and Newcastle-on-Tyne, referring to the enhanced cost of new ships, stale:— "Most builders and engineers ore full cC work, in many coses for two years ahead, but there are still a few who can give fairly quick delivery. Costs of materials and wages continue to advance in all branches of shipbuilding and engineer ing, and are likely .still further to increase. The oppor tunities for building cheap tonnage, such nn we linvo been accustonjud to, in our opinion, have passed, ana we doubt if they will over rtme'bnck again. Trices for building are fully 25 per cent, higher than two years ago. and many special steamers of large tonnage, ex ceptional speed, and good specifications, which were ordered some time ago by lar-sccing shipowners, have re cently been sold at very large profits, in some eases amounting from £20,000 to £30,000. The demand fur nearly tow ready tonnage and for second- hand steamers was never greater, and such as art for sale, command very high prices, as comparatively few are available, and those afloat are so profitably employed tlrnt It Is fre quently' difficult to bring burimr-s about."

MORE MOTOR SHIPS ORDERED. , Tlie Hfunbii7g,A,b'(,ricnn Line hns ordered two more motor ship of the Fionia type from Messrs. Burmistcr and Wain. At present Messrs. BurmcistcV and'Wnin nre. building two luigo motor ships for tbo Norastjernan Com pany, of Stockholm, which lias Just given an order for two more vessels of the same type, while the East Asiatic Company lias contracted for a motor ship to replace the Fionia. The Copenhagen correspondent of the Lonaon "Daily Telegraph" says that Lord Plrrle, who arrived there in his yacht Valiant, said:— "I . was on .board the Danish motor vessel Fionia during her recent trips in the Keilfjord, aqd can 'only admire the way in which Den mark has worked out- and solved this problem. I think motor vessels will be of special importance to ocean navigation.. The only trouble is that oil does not exist in England, Germany or France; but in America, especi ally in Western America, motor vessels will be largely used soon, as oil Is plentiful and much cheaper there than coal. ' Ilowever. rat Icrge Transatlantic liners steam power will prevail for the present, until more experi ence has bceit obtained. There is no doubt -that for tho carrying trade ' motor vessels of 10,000 to : 12,000 tons are superior to steamers of the same size, and for that rea son their invention means revolution in navigation." \- STEAMSHIPS AND SEARCrnJOHTS. At the request Of Mr. E. T. Chamberlain, United States Conurusrioncr of Navigation, Collector Locb has had confidential inquiries mado amcng the captains of the big Atlantic liners to- get their opinions as to tho expediency of earning searchlights on merchant steam ships. Captains of American, British, German, Frcnctt, Dutch, Italian, and Russian vessels have been inter viewed at New York, and. their replies sent to "Washing ton to bo attached to the report which .will go to hA rifmnTMirirviAl Oflmmittee dealing with the pro- posed alterations of the navigation laws. Tlie majority of the captains' whose views wero taken were of opinion that a searchlight might be of use in case of emer gency, such as taking up boats, making out buoys, ta in narrow .waterways, bat all agreed that the use of searchlights indiscriminately would be a menace to navigation, as the glare would have a blinding effect astern, as well as on the" perrons In the ship it was thrown en. The searchlight, it was argued, should be absolutely under tha/control of the fflcer of the watch, and should not be 'feed without his orders. It would, it was held, be a serious danger to navigation to have a searchlight always lit, on the same principle as a mast head Hghri Moreover, it would be cf no use in foggy or misty weather,' or in the ice regions in given atmo spheric conditions. . In rose of emergency, such as trans ferring pafsengers at night by boats, a searchlight would be very useful, it was held, and it might also he handy for the officer on the bridge to pick up a derelict or a vessel in distress after he had seen her with his glasses. The mariners -all gave their opinions very cautiously, and none Were enthusiastic over the proposal to add searchlights to their numerous cares on board ship. It Is admitted that the Bureau of Navigation has power to enforce the adoption of searchlights on oil shlpa earning an American passenger certificate, hut whe- ther the commanders use the searchlights at sea is quite another proposition. It is quite expected that a law will be passed compelling all passenger steanwhips to carry them, whether cpastwfrc or foreign bound. nr.n nt.tPPrn srnp vamps '( FROM A CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, July 6.— It has not escaped the- notice of London shipping men— those men, that is to soy, who hove been ' engagrd in maritime business for a score or more of years— that there is a tendency to -bestow on new Australian vessels names that were famous many vears ago, when they belonged to clipper ships and barques. . The latest example of this perpetuation of a famous name is to be found in the case of the new P. and O. branch Hocr Bollana, a fine Clyde-built ves sel of 055 net tons, now loading in London for Sydney, via Capetown. About a' score of years ago there was an earlier, and a vastly different, Beltnna. running regularly in the London-Australlun trade. That earlier vessel was a clipper sailing ship, and she was as well known in the Australasian ports Bhe traded to as sho was in the Thames. Another, and comparatively recent example of this scheme of reviving a famous old clipper name occurred when tho .Morialta, the 1846-ton inter-State liner, own ed by tho Adelaide S.8. Co., was launched at Glas gow. This vessel recalls the old sailor of the' sumo name which, away back in the past, was engaged in trading between London and Australian ports. Yet another instance is to be found In tha .Kapunda, which was added in 1008 to the fleet of steamers plying on the Australian coast. A few days ago the writer met a bronzed quartermaster off one of tho Cane liners. That seafarer was one of the few men who, from actual cx- poriehee, could - recount what happened when the old emigrant ship Kapunda was sent to the bottom in the Atlantic, through being struck by the homeward- bound barquo Ada Melmore, The Kipunda was carrying a full company of emigrants from vfto Old-country to the antipodes. ..The cataslronhe happened in the early hours of the morning, and there was a . terrible sacrifice -of lift v It must; be 8bout> quarter of. a, century ago that ' ' ' . ' L-A this old vessel was lost, and for many a long year the name Kapunda nwqs considered to be an ill-omened one for a vessel.. But the memories of. that disaster arc i becoming dim, and when, a few years ago, , there was 1 .launched for the Melbourne Steamship Company a now 3000-ton coastal liner, the name luipunda was given to her as she went down the launching way.
