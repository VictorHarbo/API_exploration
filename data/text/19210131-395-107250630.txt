He hud seen iiie miners exposed to ail sorts oi dangers and had bL'-en LiiLUll sent to I an early grave. While the company could cnuru out dividends and the men were content to li\e in iitud liouses on the leases and work for a -pittance all was well, -The First Million. Xiiey could take Bendiso, IJallar^t, Mount Morgan, me (irnu BouJdgj and ? the ji.alsoor.ne, or e>en Uie Broken Hill miiios, nut tin) vva.naroo and Mooata ilinmfa' Company was the lirst mining company in Australia to pay its share holders £1.000,000 in dividends. Even tually the men became connected with the A.Vi.U. and had sscured an award 11 the niUii wno. were picd^ed to the award- as ihe company should have been -iiad reiused to work tney- could have been punished. Yet the company, be cause the award did not suit them, could close the mines -down. In the case of tlia men it would have been '.direct actio<n," but Mr. Barwell had said they could not deal with the com pany or make thea* work their mines if they resorted to "direct action." The I speaker believed the latest trouble was really an attack upon the miners who bad decided to join the A.W.U. Mr. Barwell had in effect told the men to go back to wort for less than a living wage. Australia at the cost of £20,000 had ascertained by a royal com mission that £5 1£J per week was a basic wage or the amount necessary to en able a maa with a wife and three chil dren to .live decently. Yet they had the head of a capitalistic Government Urying to drive men to work down in ! the mines for "a rate that would keap people alive." -'(An Organised Attacii" The ati'-itu'de of the anti-Labor Premier was in keeping with the tactics of St3 .party thirsjughout the world. An or ganised attauk was being made upon the v. orkeia. The obje<i4ve was to get the toideie bac'i: to the place and position tney occupied in pre-wax days.

I?o. 2.-Sir Frederick Young. Sir Frederick Young, M.-l'-. was on a mission to Australia, -and addressing com mercial meu of tlie city, he bad 8P°"-?U of an impending storm. The* ^peak^r kneiv that Sir Frederick Young with iir. John Greeiy Jenkins an ex-i^remier, and other well to do "absentee" Austra lians iu London, had been prominently connected with the an^i-double las move ment there. They drear their tojl from the Australian workers' products and of" jected to paying an Australian tax on i their income here and another tax on it I when it passed through the hands of tk.1 liritisli Government. That was probab:y part of Sir Frederick's minion to Aus tralia. Sir Frederick «said in effect that i ail political influence must be removed ! de"; in other words, they jn^s bflve a free liand to do as they desired. ? He admitted that when the Empire was in peril and when capitalism with no j soul aoove profits and no patriotism that : reached its pocket failed, the Government had to take control of industry and trade, but now he wanted a "free hand" for the profiteers, the exploiters., the can i tains of Industry. Was Sir Frederick j \ouhg in some way connected wiUi pro. I mine ill wheat dealers? The speaker had : heard thp late Ait Boberts quote reports in that ring showing that certain wueat i agents, rings, or combines had practic I ally polled the farmers of ulna .State in j handling their wheat. The intervention i of Parliament was unwelcome, and Sir ? Frederick wanted ii all "cut out" aggin. He no doubt 6poke for the direct action ; ists among the profiteers. Sir Frederick ' Young's attitude, taken in conjunction with the statement by Mr. Barwell should showthe people generally and the workers particularly that they had no chance of securing redress, and there was no solution or salvation to be hoped for from thig parties '.-hey led? No. 3.-Mr. Storey. Mr. Storey's advice to set np and keep up a united and vigorous agitation was, in the speaker's opinion, opportune and ! appropriate. The workers flaw the o*ther ! side scheming in many ways, and unless i'oey were united they would not with stand the organised attack on Labor. -"BiS" Figures.
