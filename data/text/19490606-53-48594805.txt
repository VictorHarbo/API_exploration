4 Arrests On New York, June 5. Four members of the crew of the Polish liner Batory have been taken off the vessel by immigration officers. The officers did not know that the men were under arrest and there was no immediate explana- tion for their removal. Crew members removed were identified by an officer of the ship as the chief steward and assistant ?pursers. One of the' fpur was said lo be a Danish citizen. It was in the Batory that the German-born U.S. Communist leader (Gerhart Eisler) escaped to Europe. , ' Each member of the crew and the ship's captain (Captain Jan Cwikaiinsky) were keenly ques- tioned at length by U.S. immigra- tion officials, presumably in a search for suspects who aided Eis ler's escape. Later the captain left the chip accompanied by an immigration inspector and a director of the Gdyna-American Line, which ope- rates the Batory. * . Apart from that visit- ashore, the captain and crew were ordered not to leave thc ship while it was in New York. A close U.S. guard was maintained over the vessel.
