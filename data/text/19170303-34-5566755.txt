"If idleness is the root of all evil," said Van Brugh, "then matrimony's good for something, for it sets many a poor woman to work." Well, how about the idle days that follow marriage? In "union there is strength," but in a marriage union there must alto be co-opera rion, if all goes -well with husband and wife. It is fair "that a husband* should shoulder the major problems, but those of the wife are no less great, and the peculiar nature of her problem makes her part in co-operation most trying. Sometimes the husband is at fault, as -was Richard Baker' in the great Broadway success, '^Husband and Wife." It is a play that will set you thinking, and perhaps help you solve your problem.
