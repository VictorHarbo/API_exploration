This magnificent Estate has been subdivided into EIGHT BLOCKS SIX OF WHICH ARE TO BE SOLD. THREE BLOCKS have WATER- FRONTAGES, NATURAL DEEP ANCHORAGE and permission will be granted for a Purchaser to construct Swimming Pool and Jetties.. Two Blocks have frontages to COOLONG ROAD, one taking in the magnificently constructed stone Billiards Room and Garage, the remain- ing block being in the centre and comprises half the Tennis Court. It must be remembered that Coolong Road offers the most sought after waterfrontages in Sydney and their with their small Beaches and beautiful north-easterly aspect are unsurpassed All blocks command magnificent views. The Maritime Services Board has stated that the present Jetty in Vaucluse Bay is a temporary structure due for removal. To-day the old associations and traditions of this historic site are overshadowed by the residential demands of modern Sydney. The blocks we offer have exclusive and distinctive advantages which cannot be equalled in any other sites available in Sydney to-day and owing to the land being comparatively level it presents no building difficulties.
