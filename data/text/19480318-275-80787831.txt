Lack Of .SMppiog J LONDON, Thurs. (A.A.P.) â€” There is doubt in London about how Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, French and Belgian members of war time resistance movements will be able to migrate to Australia. . Immigration Minister Calwell' has announced that they will be eligible to do so under the assist ed passage scheme. | Shipping is the difficulty. Under existing arrangements such people would have to travel from Continental ports and few passenger ships are leaving the Conti nent for Australia. France, Belgium, Norway and Denmark discourage emigration. Holland and Australia already have a small migration scheme for Dutch farmers involving the use of existing shipping. Ex- resistance fighters can no*t travel in British ships because foreigners cannot displace Britons from mir grant ships and the clamour from Britons for free . and assisted passages continues to overwhelm the Australian Migration Department in London. Applications average 5000 a week. A Copenhagen message says that Danes are showing great interest iri the migra tion proposals. , About 5Q Danes have been able to .migrate to Australia since the- -war, but more than 5000 have applied for immigration permits.
