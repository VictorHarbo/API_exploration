The most noble labour is the ouJtivation of the soil ; the most important science is tba/ of Agrlcal ure ;-yet the cultivation of the soil is nowhere leu understood and less practised than in this colony. Not only are we dependent upon other countries for breadstoffs bat we import altogether, annually, about three millions sterling of articles, ail the prodaoe of the soil, and all of which could be raised ia thia colony, so as* to compete with the imported articles, without any proteo ¡on whatever in the Bhaje of import duties, Besides these articles, a variety of produce can be raised to advantage for whioh there is no consumption ia the colony, bat which woold always find highly profitable marketa abroad, such as Cotton, Silk, Indigo, Cochineal, Jote, Hemp, Flax, Gums, Lack Dye, -affloivcr, Saffron, «feo. The difficulties however, to the foll development of the resources of a young coan ry must be palpable to every re- flecting mind, so long as individual enterpriie alone is calculated upon ; and as a matter of course, if left to such, I it will take centuries to accomplish what would be achieved ia a few years. The cultivation of tbs Yine, the introduction of which os I anything like an adequate scale, is ea instance of this. A . still better illustration of it is given by the cultivation of i 1 the Sogar Cane. For years'past it baa been ascertained I beyond a doubt that the Sugar Cano can ba grown in soma j parts of the colooy to an enormous advantge, yet such are the conflicting and erronebndy directed interests Instit has never been practically attempted. j The great drawbacks aro the want of oapttal on the part of the enterprising portion of the population, and want of knowledge on the part of those who have the means profit- ably to Bupply their spare funds in the development of the resources ot the colony. To overcome these obstacles the above Association has been started. .g combination of capital,' labour, and knowledge, is the E-iflt way of leading to the right direction.- j Agricultural parsuits, however, io this colony; are carried ' on, in tbs majority of caaea, in the most primitive mariner; the establishment of aa' Agricultural College-ia . therefore aa absolute necetsity, and as the professors will be men of undoubted science and skill, a. large .influx of pupils can be expeoted, not only from this colony, but also from the adjoining colonies and other ports of the world. . The Agricultural College .will form (ia their precepts) thereqnlBttelsbonr, skill, and science, and at the same time by; gradually extending i:a operations, provide employ- ment fer such labour, as well as setting the exampol to the whole country-of what is moat beneficial to the com inanity.; ' ? ? .
