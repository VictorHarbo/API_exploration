VIOTORIA VIEWED IN HIER REL~ATION TO THE OTHER COLONIES. A mere glance at the statistics of the Aoustralian colonies brings out these two striking facts-- firet, the amazing strides the rest of the colonies are making, wit! one or two exceptions, in the race of progress; and next, the way in which Victorisa has outstripped, and is still outstripping, them all. But neither of these facts is so well known as it desorees to be, and that must be our apology, if any is needed, for ectting out both a little at length. In order to this, however, those colonies must be taken separatoly and collectively; they must be viewed as standing apart, yet as forming a whole; each as possessing a speciality of its own, yet all as contribhting to one great, to one grand resulte-to an exhribition of what the indomitable energy of the Anglo-Saxon rmce ean do in an incredibly short space of time towards founding an empire at the distanco of 14,000 to 16,000 miles from their fomer home. We shall have to take their population, their trade and commerce, their publicreceipts and expenditure, their pastoral and agricultural, their mining and other etatietical returns, and place them side by side, and if, in doing this, it should be found that Victoria has gathered around herself more of the elements of national wealth than any of the others, none will havess just caueo to complain. We shall simply be acting in furtherance of one of the objects for which these staitisticl returns are collected and publishled--simply endervouring to let the world know what each and all are doing. Let us begin with the population. PoPrUAIvoN ErBTuvaB.

Still, thle population of Victoria at the end of 1870, or the beginning of 1871, was upwards of 38,000 more than those of New South Wales and South Australia taken together, and nearly 63,000 more than the whole of the rest of the colonies, New South Wales excepted, combined.

Her imports amount to £12,455,758, while those ofNew South Walesand South Australia taken together only amount to £9,606,7098, and those of the rest of the colonies combined, New South Wales excepted, amount to £9,192,301. Again, her exports amount to £12,470,014, whlilo those of New Soouth Wales and South Australia taken together only amount to £10,209,486, and those of the rest of the colonies combined, Now South Wales excepted, amount to £10,625,669., But the most noticeable and astounding fact of all is, that the import and export trade of these colonies conjointly should have arisen, as it has done, at so early a period in their history, to £60,160,800 sterling per annum.

It is not a little saigular, however, that the outward tonnage in the New South WaTles ahipping return should exceed the inward by upwards of 82,000 tone. Tlhis is probably an error m thIe New South Wales shipping returns, or there may be some other way of anccounting for it which we do not sec. Enough for us, however, on the present occasion to call attention to those two facts: 6rst, that the combined shipping of the whole of lthese colonies, inwards and outwards, amounted in 1870 to 4,240,762 tons; and, next, that nearly onethird of this was engaged in the Victorian trade.

There is, consequently, little ground for what we oc casionally hear of the extravagant cost of government in Victoria. She compares favrourably with the rest of the colonies in this; and, having regard to the revre nue raised in each without any great pressure, there is ample security for a much larger amount of public in debtedness than has yet been incurred. Still, we must not overlook the fact that the figures given above only refer to the ordinary receipts and expendi ture of the different colonies. They neither include what is locally raised and expended, nor do they cover the expenditure on public works out of borrowed money. PnBLtrC IInBDxTEDNtIIS.

Western Australia is the only colony in the group without a public debt, and upon this the is not much to be congratulated. \Withll re gard to Victora, whilst much less burdened than most of the other colonies rateably to their respective populations, she has much more to show for what she has done with the money borrowed. Her railways and other public works are rising into a high lstate of productiveness, nd will, there is every reason for bo lieving, ultimately fully justify the outlay upon them. Nor, looking at the colonies as a whole,can £38,8345,671), which is thebo sum of the figures given above, be re- I garded as a large amount of indebtedness. They I would be justified in doubling the sum, if they hiad I reproductive works to spend upon it. It must be re membered, however, lthat this £38,335,671 only refors to what was outstanding on loans at the close of 1870. But if what has since been borrowed could be brought to account, it would not probably increase this amount to any great extent. Pasroano AND AoncrLTURAma. Of those kinds of animals most useful to man, three colonies lhave never been wanting from the first. Iows they have inereased in number in the ditlerent colonies may be gathered from the following: Horses. Iloe dCattle. sOeep. Victoria...... 167,220 721,096 10,761,887 N. 8.

In this table New South Wales has theb proponder ance, owing to the large amount of her grazing roand. Pigs have never been allowed to increase greatly. In the whole of these colonies cthey do not number to much above 600,000 in number. In reference to agriculture, we have barely space for the land in cultevation, and thle quantity under wheat: Land In Cultirattion. Under Wheat.

The tolal land under cultivation in all the colonies is 3,780,702 acree, and the total under wheat 1,200,931 acres, or nearly one-lthird of the whole. ExrPOant or Wo. Weight inlbt. Value.

But after makinse oery allowance for this, the amount of wool is still prodigious. In weight, it amounts, according to tlhe foregoing table, to 187,855,0921bs., and in valuo to £9.805,507 sterling. Victoria's share of this was £3,205,106, against £1,756,950 in 1859-that is, ten years proeiously. ElOBTr or GOtD. Quantlty.

But we have no space for further details. Other cxports must be hastily alluded to. Victoria ships large quantities of tallow and oil, and in this New South Wales, Southl Australia, and Queens land assist her. New South Wales raises and exports a large quantity of coal. Southl Aussralia, afteror sup plying hier own wants, ships breadstufls to the other coloices to a very large extent, and supplements this with largeshipments of copper. Queenoland is direct ing her attention to the culliration of cotton and sugar, with every prospect of auecess. Tasmania sets an example to othlers in a revival of the whaling trade in tlieir seas. All are doing something apart from the industries already enumerated to show their capacity for developing the resources of the countries in which providence las cast their lot. Nor can any doubt that a glorious destiny.waits those colonies as a whole. In tills summaried account of the compaaotive statistics of these colonies, we were obliged to take those for 1870 in order to start fair. As yet those for 1871, witll ono or two oeceptions, have either not been published, or are not available, in whlole or in part. Victoria is one of these exceptions, and we may, there fore, appropriately add a word or two to what con cerns her in the foregoing. Her live stock on farms and stations have inereased very considerably, the increasein sheep amounting to little atortof 1,000,000. Her land under cultivation has also incresoed to the extetat of upwards of 80,000 acres, this increase being spread over almost every desoription of crop. At no time, in fact, were there stronger indications of tie growing prosperity of this colony. To her pas toral, her agricultural, and hesr mtining industry, we have now to add her manufacturing industry. These combined could not fail to mabe any country great, and Victoria, according to the returns before us, boasts at the present time of not fewer than 149 flour- mills, and 1385 manufactories of one description or other. duts. The prospects for both sugar and cotton are (says the Qaeensoander) highly encouraging. The weather is fsvoursble for both, and for the latter tile prices ruling in England, according to the latest telegrams, amre such as will pay the growers here. Picking is now rery active, the main obstacle in many places being the diticulty of obtaiining pickers. This is a diffeulty which, according to piesent appearances, can only be remedied by increased population. This is one of the most urgbnt reasons for inducing an active immigration of people withll families. The qualityt the staple, as Uplands rotton, could scarcely be saurpassed. The average length of the fibre from West Meorcton and tile Logan and Albert districts ranges between six-eighths and a full inch, and wher ever we have aeen it, it is silky, strong, and of more cveu growth-that is, with fetower flaws, short or stained bits, than the crop of any previonus year. The dry weathlerhas ripened tile seed and made it very firm. This, in connection with the other features mentioned, makes the fibre come away freely from the seed, with out any chance of breaking, unless the gins are in very bad order. The proportion of fibre is also heavy. During thie wek we had three lots ginned, of B0lbs. each, from the Ipswich Reserree, from Redbank, and the Upper Albert, respectively, snd in each case the yield of fibre was between 10lbt. and lilbs., the Ipswiclh lReeore lot coming within talf an ounce of 1Elbs. Thlis is a very fair return, and should fully justify the buyers to pay 2d. per lb. for cotton in the seed-the pries ruling at present. Should tlhe weather continue fine, and the ginning and baling of tlhis year's crop be carried out withll the care of last year, we may fairly look forward to the cotton of Queensland taking the very first rank and price in all classifications of Uplands or woolly seed cotton. The density of the cane of one year's growth and upwards has gone up considerably during the last month. It hIas been reported at 8 degse. in several places; we saw one test where Chlignc cane of 20 monthls' growth gave juice at 10 dega. A rvery early crushing is spoken of. From Port Mackay, and also from the tacleay River, New South Wales, we hear that it is purposed to commence crushing in May. No doubt caution will be observedin such eases, that the stools are sufficirntly protected from the effects of cold during June, July, and Angust, lwhen they can be expected to grow but little. Withl thle experience of crushisg hi eay, and care in the partmilc ars mens tioned, we should be able, ero another season passes, to hIave a pretty fair idea of the possibilitiy ofdoing all the crushing during the wietar season, withoat injar ing thegrowth of thefollowing ratoons.-u?neenslander. From the following, which appears in thie Hobart Town Mereaury of tile 2lth ultimo, it seems that it has taken precisely as many years to exterminate the kan garoo in Tasmania as it has to kill off tlhe aborigines. Our contemporary says:-~Yesterday's Southern Cross brought to our shores a male and two female kaugarooas as a gift from Mr. Parkinson, of Gippsland, to his nsative home. For thle present the strangers will be removed to the paddocks at Caldew, but it is hoped that some day not far distant, and when the taste of lthe people improves, a suitable enclosure will be made in the Government Domain for such like interesting specimens of natural history. These magnificenat crea tures-some of their kind standing as high as a ehurch door-were called " Booma" by the aborigines of this island, but corrupted to thie vulgar " Boomer" in the lwhite man's vernacular, are now nearly extieact with us. True it is that Mr. T. I. Clarke, MAr. Arelher, and a solitary gcntlemaa or two still gladden the eye of the traveller with thie sighlt of a group of odd numbers on their estates; but for all that, the race of the " Booma" may be described as something of the past. Before it be too late, let us do something in our day to preserve to our children a rememhrone, at all events, of the wondrous works of the Creator in the land of their birth. RERVEUDY JOHNSON ON T E nAnen.o QUITETIONz, \--Tie following telegraphic message appears amongst tbhe news brought by the Californian mail:-3Balti more, February 28.-At a meeting held last night under thle auspices of the American Peace Society, to discuss the Washington Treaty, Rererdy Johnson made a apeech of two hours' duration, in the course of which he said it was clear that the preferment of con sequential claims by thIe United States before the Genera Convention weas not contemplated by the High Commissioners under the terms of the treaty. There were three modes of settling tIhe latter:-First. That England should consent to permit the claim to go before the Genera Commission, and if that decided it had jurisdiction of the quesation. it would reject thl claims. Second. The withdrawal of the claim by the United Statee. He would adeise such withdrawal Third. The postponoment of the subjoot to future negotiations, INcTExRSnettN TO TYPs'"--Ae an example of ex rellence in composition we chronliole the fact-of ooors interesting only to printers-that the foreman of onre ofioe composed 121 lines (fifteen ems) of lean long primer in the short epace of ninety-two minutes, or eit the rate of about seventy-seven linen per hour. The proof sbowed only four "literals." In this inltanoe the "compo." had not been on "?piece" for fully six years.--Jount Gaf bier 8tandard. In reference to this the S. A. Regitrler has the followig :-A number' of compositors have been rather amused at the fest in setting type which the Mouet aGoamier Standard habe thought fit to chronicle. They intimate thst in the newspaper ofiles in the city there are several who could do more than whatban been recorded. One type sends us the following as an antidote:-" An Amerirsen paper says:-We have a compositor in this onoe the friction of whose movements over the type in his stick fuses them solid like stereotype plate. The way to prevent this is to have hs case submerged in water, and the rapidity of his motions keeps the water boil ing and bubbling so that eggs have frequently been boiled in the space-box. Pipes lead from the bottom of his ease to the boiler in the press-room, and the steam generated by our fast compositor's motions runs the power-press. In one day he'set' so much type that it took all hands, from editor to devil, two weeksto read the proofs ; and it wasn't his gooddayfor setting type either." The Britannia, one of the Anchor Line of steamers sailing between Glasgow and New York, arrived at Noew York on Jan. 23, after an extraordinary and peril. oue voyage of thirty-two days, and it is conceded by nautical men that the passage of the Britannia is the longest on record from port to port. On the.Srd of December the steamer left Glasgow with a full cargo and ninety passengers, and the weather con tinued farourable until Christmas Day, when sfearful gale sprung up, and at midnight increased to a hurrit cane-the ship labouring heavily, and taking on board immense volumes ef water. During theonight two of the lifeboats were store, and one of the sailors was seriounely injured by being crushed against the taftfrail by a tremendous sea. On the 26th the storm in creased, accompanied by snow and elect, and such was the state of the rigging that the sailors were unableto furl the sails, the result being that they were torn to shreds by the force of the wind and tempest. On the 27th a mountainous wave struck the vessel at noon, and Captain M'Clellan, who was on thIe bridge.at the time, was nearly washled overboard, whilst twoseamen narrowly escaped being drowned by clinging to the catlines near the mizen-mast. The 29th and 80th found the Britannia struggling with the gales, with engines at half speed, and the water at times plunging down the companion way and submergieg the cabin floor. The passengers during this time exhibiting the wildest terror, and imagining the ship was going down, reeiested all efforts to keep them below until the storm lulled. On Noew Years' Day the barometer fell, and another fearful hurricane set in. The hatches 1were battened down, and none but the captain, ofieers, and crew were permitted on deck. At 2 o'clock several sailors were sent to the jibboom to secure the anchor and fix the sails. The captain and the chief ofllicer were standing oe the bridge, at thie time, when suddenly, and before they had an op portunity to escape it, a tremendous weave engulphd the ship. Captain M'Olellan and the first offlicer was severely injured, and the sailors were swept aslong the deck as far back as the cabin, andhad tobe taken below to have their wounds dressed. The captain and the chief mate were still suffering from the lonaise when the steamer reached New York. For thirteen days after this the weather continued tempestnous, and the ship received large quantities of water on the deck, which swept down into the cabin and steerage apart ments, rendering thecondition of the paienedgers mcsera ble in the extreme. On the 1th of FJeanaryCthe coal began to give outwhile the storrwas still aging,and to heighten thie calamity the provisions grew searee. The result was that stringency in gitvig out water was necessary, and the speed of the vessel was also thethed. - Another trouble that stared the officers inthe fae'was the difficnlty of gsining an observation, for the aenn had been obscured for days; and consequently theydid not kuow where they were drifting, except by dead reckoning. On the 16th, however, the storm abated i the sun was visible, and at 6 o'clookin the evening the Britannia reached the port of Hslithx. Here the reriotualling and coaling was scoomplished, and after five days of exceedingly rough weather hereaohed few York on the 23rd ultimo. Tihe Paris papers state that a few days ago Loullier, the well-known Communist oficer, who has been con demned to hard labour for life, was removed upopen his own petition to the prison at Olairvaux. He.made the journey thither in a frest-class carriage aeccom panied only by a prison fficear. Lulliter ohndatsd himself very quietly until approaching the laststation but one befo reaching Clairvsux, when the train slsekening speed he puddenly opened the door and leaped out upopen the eloping bank.which bordered the line. The officer, startled at this unexpected aot,of the prisoner, after a moment's hesitation leaped out, and falling upon him seized him by the collar. Luller, who had sustained no injury, struggled with the offier and succeeded in freeing himself from his grasp. He then took to fight, pursued by the of8fcr, whose ries' brought some peasants to his aid, and Lullier was shortly afterwards safely Ipdged in a prison-ell at Clairvaur. Thie luck of the house of Rothschild is proverbial and it was pointed out as yet another instance of that luck that, although the great .bankers are very large owners of house property ii, Paris, not a frano's worth of damage had been done to them by the shells of either the Prussians, the Versailles troops, or theCom munists. But it seems that thIe luck of the Bothl. childs does not follow.them into the law eourta, for they have just been condemned to pay the trife,of 674,000 francs (£27,000) for stamp duties due on the shares af different companies of which they are the agents, the said sum having been already paid to M. Gourde, the Finance Delegate under the Commune. It certainly does seem rather hard that the State should refuse to aceopt the receipt of the Communal taxgatherers as valid, for, as M. Bothsehild's lawyer pointed out, had his clients refused to pay the Com muno their establishment would have at once boen given up to pillage. A return of the Suez Oanal traoffic for 1871 has been published by Mlessre. Cory Brothers and Co., showing that the total number of ships which passed through was 761, of an aggregate burden of 771,409 tons, against only 491, of an aggregate burden of 4356,618 tons, in the previous year, and that the tonnage pro portion of each nationality were as follows:-oBr~itish; 546,621; French, 91,841 ; Austrisn, 43,113; Italian, 29,4001; Turkish, 16,959; Egyptian, 18,994; Dutch, 6711; Russian, 4820; Belgian, 4400; Ameriean, 4170; German, 3520; Spanish, 2157; Norwegian, 1316 Portuguese, 919; Danish, 6601; Burmaman, 408; total, 771,409 tons. The marriage of Mr. E. T. Wolseley, brollther of the present baronet, with Florence Mary, daughter of Mr. E. J. Weld, of Lulworth, Dorset, was celebrated last week by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Plynouth. A caurious and inconvenient mistake was diseonered after, the ceremony-viz.,that it had been celebrated twenty-. four hours before the expiration of the notice to the, registrar. The consequence was that the wedding.trip had to be delayed until thIe following day, whena the young couple were a second time married at the regis trar's ofce. REsonnc?s InOnC?NxCc.-A certain fsbhionsble lady, whlose lorvely daughters were regarded as the most elegant belies of the season, having become dis gusted with the arrogance, lies, neglect, and passive insolence of her upper footman, suddenly discharged the powdered personage, and imported a man from the country, who had been strongly recommended to her for his attention and respectful behaviour and in variable truthfulness. On the third day of his inaugn ration, the poet Moore, who was very intimate with the family, made a "call" some quarter of an hour later than his dining intention warranted. "Are Lady B - and the htisses B - at home?" in quired Moore. The new footman from the country eyed the poet with a sorutinizing gaze, then looked behind apprelhensively. The question being repeated, he took a step forward and replied, in a suppressed tone, "They told me to say they were out; but they're in. They're gone upstairs to strip for dinner." Mark Twain had his fortune told by a celebrated star-gazer, and here is the result :n-" Yours was not in the beginning a criminal nature, but circumetanees changed it. At the age of nine you stole sugar; at fifteen yen stole money ; at twenty you stole horses; at twenty-flre you committed arson; at thirtyg hardened in crime-you became an editor. Since then your descent has been rapid. Yon are now a public lecturer. Worse things are in store foryon you will be sent to Congreess, next te the Penitentiary and then, finally, happiness wil come to you agan you will be hanged." A lady, some time back, at the British Mtseum, asked if they had the skull of Oliver Cromwell. Being answered mn tile negative, "Dear me:'," said she, " that's very strange, for they hare one at Oxford."
