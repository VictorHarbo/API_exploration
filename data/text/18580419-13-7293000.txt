COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Saturday Evenlng. The only gold export entry passed at the Customs to-day was one for 5½ ounces for shipment in the Shooting Star for Liverpool. There has been a decided lull in the gold market since the departure of the mail, and prices have given way slightly. The banks aro now buying at prices calculated on the basis of £8 18s. per ounce for standard. At Melbourne the brokers quote £8 15s. to £8 15s. 6d. for Castlemaine and Sandhurst ; £8 16s. 6d. to £3 15s.9d. for Mount Korong ; £8 16s. 6d. to £8 17s. for Dunolly, Mary- borough, Fiery Creek, and Avoca ; £8 16s. 6d. to £8 17s. 9d. for Ararat and Pleasant Creek ; £3 17s. to £3 17s. 9d. for the Ovens; and £8 18s. to £8 18s. 6d. for Ballaarat. The escorts this week have been below those of the corresponding week of last year by 8,733 ounces, but above the average of the 13 weeks of the first quarter of the year by 5,380 ounces. In the following table the fortnightly escorts are distinguished from the weekly by the prefix of an. asterisk : 1868\. 1357. ozs. dwts. Oüs. dwts.

Gold specie WBB exported to the value of £76,956, of which £71,777 were for England via Suez, £1,979 for Mauritius, and £3,200 for Hong Kong. I Thore is little to add to our report on tha gold-fields in Thursday's issue. The newi from Ararat is encouraging. Another nugget of over 43 ounces has been taken out aj Opossum Gully. The Petticoat lead has baan Etruck with great success in two places. At Pleasant Creek the Deep lead is recovering favor with the miners. In the wet ground, al a depth of 84 feet, some large quantities hav ; been taken out. The Fifty-foot Hill is also in full activity, some of tho " coment" having yielded one pound weight to the ton. We hear oi nothing new from Ballaarat, so far as the yield is concerned ; but there appeared to be a general movement of the population in favor of Mr, Gabrielli's proposition for tho supply of machinery and for the supplementing of labor. Maiyborough and Dunolly are increasing ia population, At Bcudigo, complaints of want of water are again being heard, especially ai Elysian Flat and the Whipstick. The quartz reefs in the Castlemaine district are being worked. On Specimen Hill several adjaojnt claimholders were diocussing the co- operative system, with a view to put it in practice by uniting in the purchase of machinery, At Wattle Gully, the main reef is said to be struck nt a depth of 142 feet. Two tons of quartz taken from this reef yielded 14 ozs. 11 dwts. Beechworth presentB no now feature calling for remark. Seven hundred and two persons have landed at Melbourne during tbo week, of whom 806 were from the United Kingdom, 1 from Gottonburg, 49 from San Francisco, 60 from Hong Kong, and 287 from the neighboring colonies. The departures are computed at 310\. The net addition to the population by the seaboard during the current year has been 7,100. Arrived. Departed.

Oolonial bank shares have been done at £G, and an advance of Is. Od. per share is now asked. The Melbourne Firo Insuranco Company's shares Lavo been sold at 12a. 6d. per share on 10s. paid. Capital is plentiful, and large sums are continually offering for mortgage on good property, but in commer- cial circles the continued check given to the credit system is causing soma tightness. The banks charge, for bills under 95 days' cur- rency, 8 per cent. ; from 95 to 125 days', 9 per ent, ; over 125 days', 10 per cent. ; and on verdrawn accounts, 10 per cent. E,Exchange on England is, at all the banks, except ono, at 1 per cent, for CO days' sight ; for amounts under £50, at 1J per cent, pre- mium for 30 days' sight. Freight on gold, by direct steamers or sailing vessels, 3d. per ounce, deliverable in London: insurance li per cent, ; by the overland route, J per cent. that is 7d. per ounce, as nearly as possible insurance, li to 1$ per cent. Of tho stato of the markotB there is nothing new to report. We subjoin a table showing the weekly imports and exports at the Port of Melbourno, according to their declared values, for the current and for the corres- ponding period of the paBt year. Imports.

Vivian and Co. are erecting in the rear of the Na- tional School. These gentlemen have for some time past beon carrying on the business at Moonlight Flat, and notwithstanding the difficulties inseparable from every new enterprise, have succeeded so far in their attempt, as to compete with the Melbourne firms in many descriptions of castings. Many of our quartz mills have availed themselves in emergencies of the services of Messrs. Vivian, and we believe that the portions of the machinery thus supplied have been quite equal to similar work done in the metro- polis. Every encouragement should be given to under- takings of this doscription, as they tend to retain and employ a permanont population, exclusive of their utility. We have now in the neighborhood of Castle maine flour-mills, tanneries, soap and candle manu- factorles, a pottery and an iron foundry. These form the germs of different branches of domestic industry, which hereafter may attain proportions of consider- able magnitude. There is no valid reason why Castle- maine should for ever be entirely dependent on its auriferous resourcos. On the contrary, we believe the time is not far distant when it will become a seat of manufacturing activity, and produce, with advan- tage for itself, many of the heavier and coarser fabrics that are now imported from a distance. We have Sydney papors to the 14th inst. but they contain no commercial information requiring notice. Dates from Nelson, New Zealand, to the 20th March, are acknowledged. Tho Examiner makes the following remarks On the financial position and the resources of that province :— We find that the goods cleared for exportation at tho port of Nelson, in 1867, woro valued nt 70,000!. ; that the gold during tha samo period, amounting to 0,642 ounces, may be talton at 88,0002. moro; in nil, 108,0002. That is our income-tho monoy wo have to spond, and which wo havo paid away. Now, on tho other hand, what have wo bought ? Why, if our customs averago 10 per cent, upon our imports, wo havo Bpcnt above 160,0002. ; but we believe it is not really so much. Wo believe that our imports for tin 3 car amounted to somewhero about 140,0002., of which less than ono-fourlh carno directly from England, and tho remainder from tho Australian colonies. So that, on this supposition, tho80,0002. just gono would about supply the deficiency. But without resorting to this supposition, wo have, within the yoar itself, received a supply from another source, which goos very far towards balancing tho account. A sum of 20,0002. has boen lont from thoJTrust Funds, and one of 8,0002. or 0,0002. from the Archdeaconry Board, end this has flowed out to fill up the vacuum ; for poid, like vvator, has a wonderful tendency to find its luvel ; and wo havo vory llttlo doubt that tho monoy which carno out to na from England a yoar ago has long oro now found its way back again. So far as we have its representativo valuó in improved farms, and dwolllngs, and Implements, and stock, and furnlturo, and othor conveniences, wo aro tho gainers; but so faras it hos gono In payment for the fearful quantities of spirits and liquors of all sorts, which figuro so largely in our Customs returns, in our advortiicmonts, and in our sales, wo aro losers, and to a frightful extont losers in cash, losers in health, losers In morality, losers In ovory way. Each cask and puncheon ropro f>6iits a plough or a horse or a cart tho loss to our Kelson family, a house less wind and vvator tight, a flrosido less ohcorful, a family loss happy and comfort- able I Now, to koop up our expenditure at the samo rato for this year as It was last j ear, wo must get, from some quarter or othor, additional produce to tho valuó of SO OQ0Z or 4.0,000i Wo shall havo a recurrence of tbo old BJ niptoms- complaints that trado is dull, that no ono buys anything, that there is no employment for labor &c; Wo may certainly reckon upon an in oreaso in our wool oxport-a stc idjTand rateable In croaso Our agricultural produce foods us at home, and doos vcrj little moro, its export last yoir being uiuloroOOOI Last comes our gold Up to tho prosent dato tho declared oxport amounts to 8,232 ouueos sa} £12,000 worth , which, carried on throughout tho year, would give us a very satlslactorj total But wo must recollect that our gold fields or (.old gullies aro unworkable for fully one half of tho }ear, and that, although doubtless moro gold exists, and moro rich gullies lilli be found, tho country Is of a most difficult and almost inaccessible character as you penotrato further into it, and although it may probably foryoars to como furnish a Hold of activity for tho hardy and enterprising, it w 111 not find cmploj racnt for a largo population, and if it did, tho question of how thoj wore to bo occupied during their soasons of on forced abstinence from gold digging would bo 0110 of no little Importance and requiro tho serious attention of our Exeoutho Wo hopo tnat It may oventually be found possible to give to the search after gold moro the character of a settled pursuit and a regular branch of industiy, Uko all other mining operations and that, when tho district shall no longer offer sufllciont temptation to tho individual searcher, or ho has boan nttrnctod to more promising fiolds of labor, it may bo found a sufflclontb remunerating occupation to engage tho attention of tho capitalist, and to tako its place as a pormanont and lucrativo branch of trado, and a ttond} sourco ol employment.
