EEPORT OF THE AQENT-GENERAL £0R QUEENSLAND TO THE BON. THE COLONIAL SECRETARY. Painted copies of this report wore received by the mail from London lost week, and we have obtained one of them, which we give m full On inquiry at the Colonial Seorotary's office, we are informed that tho original document is not yet received from Mr Douglas, and that the report cannot therefore be presented to Parliament, and through it to tho public, m the usual manner Queensland G-ovorumont Offices, 32, Charing Cross, Mardi 1,1871 Sir,-I beg to submit to you a report of my proceedings as Agent General foi Queensland during the year 1870 Having arrived in England on the 9 h of December, 18C9 I commenced my duties by informing mysolf on all matters of detail con nected with the Queensland Government Emi gration oftico as conducted at No 2, Old Broad street Mr Wheeler has acted as clerk in charge of tho Loudon offico since January, 1863, and «neo Docomber 31st, 18G5, he has boen in sole ehargo of all buBiness connected with emigration to Quoenslund His long ox ponence and perfect acquaintance with tho duties of the office and with the genoral subject of emigration, coupled with the roadiness ho ehowtd to supply mo with information on all matters of detail, onablod mo to outer upon an examination of tho s) stem with some confidence The state of the books and of tho official rocords satisfied mo that tho management of these had boen in admirable hands, and further exponento has ciueod me to i egret, m tho interests of emigration to Queensland, that any change was j made as regards tho administration of the office by a gentleman who appears to mo to havo vory justly enjoyed tho confidonco of tho Oovorn mont On tho 31st of December I caused notices to | bo servod on Messrs James Baines and Co , and on Messrs Mackay, Son, and Co , that in six months from thal data the contract made with them in 1861 by tho Government of Queensland would torminoto In doing so I acted undor legal advite and ni) action in this matter ap pears to havo boen in consonance with the views of tho Govornmoit as I subsequently rocoived instructions in accordance with tho course whioh I had takon During tho intorval betwoon the 1st of January and tho 30th of Tune, all tho Bhippmg arrangements were conducted uccoiding to existing uso and " on a scale little in excess of previous instructions " Imding thit tho premises at No 2, Old Broad street, were hold subject to a quarter's notice, and deeming that they wore not suitablo for the moro goncral business of the Queensland Agonoy, which I waa justified m behoving I should be called on to dischn'go, I rented a set I ] of offices at 32, Charing Cross, on a first floor, < nourlv opposite the Admiralty The officos at ? Old Broad street consisted of one room divided by a partition, and being situatod on a third flooi were not so oocossiblo as thoso now occu pied, which aro lu proximity to tho Govornmont offices at Westminster, and to the offices of most of tho other colonial agents They aro thus centrally uud tonremently situated, and conBist of four rooms, one of which not being required has been sublet The leuse is for throe years, at a rental of £260 a year, and it contains a clause undoi which two of the rooms can be sublet if tho whole of them aro not required I entered into occupation of these offices on tho 20th of January, at o cost of £125 for removal, fittings, and additional furniture required During tho first three months of the year I visited several of the pnnoipal cities of England, Ireland, and Scotland, and formed the oo quaintanco of somo of tho pronnoial agents through whom the business of this office has boon conducted The emigration question was at thut time attracting a good deal of public attention, and I thus had excellent opportum ties of forming ray own opinion from various sources of information Acting on thjs infor motion, and having regard to what I considered of the highest importance-namely, the con tinuity of administration-I determined to make as few change as possible, and in framing fresh instructions for tho country ageuts I waa careful to depart as little as possible from those regulations which were then in force, and which wero tho rosult of some considerable experience With this view, I continued to give effect to the existing piaotice bj offering assisted pas sages to single men at £4 instead of at £8 as specified lu the schedule to the Acts both of 1864 and 1869 It hud been the custom ever since the end of 1863 to grant a lreo passago for every assisted passenger booked by an agent This practice continued m force till the end of 1866, and when Mr Wheeler received instruo tions to rosumo emigration m 1868, the Govern mont sanctioned a uniform and invariable rate of £4, without granting any free passages for single men In this way the cost of a poasogo to Queensland was placed nearly on a par with that of Canada or tho United States, though the latter still retained the advantage of a much »horter pa«sago This usage, sanctioned by I c the Government, worked satisfactorily as re I garded the receipts of this oflice, as well as in I soounng a steady Bupply of this class of omi I r grants It appealed to me to be expedient to depart as little as possible from previous m structions, and I therefore drew the attention of the G-overnracnt to this when I submitted to their attention the regulations I had adopted A " Handbook for Emigrants to Queensland" was compiled, cmbodving tho latest facts, ab »traded from the official statistics, and was distributed gratuitously ¡ additional forms and a large amount of fresh printed matter opplic able to the new Act were provided, and in this manner I had hoped that the best means had tbeen adopted for tffecting a transfer from tho operation of the old Act without sacrificing tho loading features of the now Act, which I under stood to be-1st, the issue of non transferable land orders, and 2ndly, the security afforded for the repayment of advances Duriug the first six montliB of the year, 1173 adult emigrants were dispatched-a number by no means in excess of what appeared to bo the demand , and I wob informed by competent judges here that they were quite equal in quality to any which have left England for Australia Ab speoial exception has been taken to tho cost of the first three ships dispatched by me, I beg to submit a Btatoment showing the averago cost per head lins uv orago is by no means an un favorable one, considering tho largo number of single women who roooivod freo passages liarly m Moy I ratified au agreement nogo dated by tho ugont for Gormon emigration with Messrs L Knorr and Co , of Hamburgh , and I beg hoio to lefor you to tho report from Mr Kirchner, whioh ac ompanico this It is almost superfluous for mo to remark that tho war bo tneen Fnnco and Goimony has rendored it moBt diffioult for him to discharge his duties with offeot I have rendorod Mr Kirchnor every assistance in my power, and have endea vored to take caro that all tho precautions adopted under our system, which havo been the result of long expenenco should as nearly as posBibio bo applied in tho case of our German emigrants In July I was informed by the Government that my action in retaining the scale of assisted rates for singlo men nt SA could not bo bus tamed It bocamo my dutv thoreforo to givo hteril effect to the Act lho adoption of the advanced rates at once affected tho icecipts of the office, and in addition to the restriction of freo passages to «ingle women only, rendered it moro difficult to obtain a regular supply for Blups at stated periods Tho contract with James Baines and Co, and Mackay, Son, and Co , having terminated with tho dispatch of the Roval Dane foi Roekhomp ton, it bocamo necessary for mo to make fresh arrangements for the dispatch of succeeding ships In tho meantime I had not boen advised of any remittances, nor had I as yot been authorised to diav, on tbo Govorn mont for part payment of such shipments I therefore considered that I should best consult the interest and the credit of tho Government by endeavoring to inuko some special aiiangouionts without going into the opon inarkot by calling for tenders for each shipment as suggested by an Executive Minute of the 10th February, re coivod on tho 16th of May lho ordinary con ditton in calling for tendéis for the conveyance of emigrants is that tho Hist moiety should bo paid in cash I was not in a position to comply with this condition Aftor correspondence, thoreforo, with Messrs Mucka), Son, and Co , of the noturo of which you uro awnio, and to wlncb I need not further íofor, I arrangtd for tho dispatch of two molo ships, ono for Bru bane and tho other for Rockhampton, at £13 17s 6d and £14 12s 6d per statuto udult respectively, instead oi at 113 and ¡CIS, us under tho previous contract I also obtained further advantages in tho lomisoion of a oom miBBiou of 15< por hoad previously pnid upon all full paying eteorngo pusscngcis, us well as in a further reduction of the rato foi full pnymg passongors In August I wont to tho Wostei n Highlands of Scotland, m consequonoo of information I bad received that a considerable number of ohgiblo and hardy emigrants in>ght bo oblamod fiom Ieluy aud Skye , and I then ontered into a provisional arrangement v. ith Messrs Aitkin and Ltlburn for tho dieputch of ono of their "Ben" hue of clippers fioui the Clydo m No vember By granting a cortapi number of fico passages I havo no doubt that I could have ob tamed a vory fan shipmont of oxcollont pcoplo from tho Islands, but white taking steps for this "purpoao Inas instructed by telograui to grant no more freo passages, and I was at tho Bame timo mfoiraed that ray land order war rants would not bo rooogmsed Under thoso circumstances I folt that I had no othei altar native but to abandon my efforts m this direc tjon, and I at onoe roturnod to London without further loss of time lho furthor alterations rendered nocossarv by tho operations of the Act boug restricted to granting onlv assisted passages to agricultural laborors and other oli^iblo persons from tho country districts, added to the increased difh culty in obtaining domestio female servonts, who >roio at that time and still aro in demand for How South Wales, Victoiin, and Now Zoa land, rendered it impossible for mo to fill Bhips at regular intervals, and I thoreforo found it necessary to poBtpono the departure of beth tbo Light Brigado nd tho Star Queen, which last ship left on tho 21st Decombei I bog boro to requoBt your attontion to tho tabular returns accompanying this report The reports of the surgeon supei intendente as to tho Bocial and sanitary condition of the emigrants undor their cuargo havo boon on the wholo satisfactory I am not yet in possession of thoso roforrmg to the Light Brigade and tho

In thoeo'"refeinng to the five ships roportod on, tostimony ib givon in each case to the general good undordtauding which has oxistod between the surgeon superin- tendents and tho captains and officers m tho oinploymont of the shipping contractors. lho cordial oo operation of the surgeons and officers is ono of the most important clements of suc- cess in maintaining order and discipline, and in promoting tho general comfort and huppmoss of nil on board during tho tedium of tho long voyage to Australia. The provisioning and tho general arrangements appear to have met with your approval, and suggostod improvoments havo boen attended to. During the ycor a re- vised list of medicines approved by the Immi- gration Board at Brisbano lins been adopted The rule which has been established that the hospituls shall bo on deck, together with tho special attontion of the medical ofheors to the cleanliness of the several com- partments, have conti ibutod greatly to reduce tho mortality, which has reached tho romurkably low rate of 1 per cent This loas has boen mot by a corresponding number of births in the English ships. In tho ono German ship which has been reported on, the mortality waa equal to 1 6 per cent, reduced by births during the voyage to 1 por cont. The receipts for this year on emigration account havo beon £5473 3s 8d Tho expen- diture on account of the same, including all office exponaos, salai íes, printing, advertising, legal, country agencies, and travelling expenses, has been £4218 8s 9d , thus showing a credit to tbo office of £1254 14s lid , sub|oet to a further deduction of £110 14s 3d , on aocount of the Gorman agency. The Savings Banks RogulationB havo been brought into operation for the oonv onionco of emigrants wishing to avail thomselvc3 of such a means of remitting money to Queensland Be- tween the 30th of May and tho 31st of Deeom ber £1836 was placed to the credit of 28 depositors An extensive correspondenco has been carried on The number of letters received lula been 9227\. Tbo nocossary rophes, together with the circulation of a largo mass of printed matter, including the issue of 3854 forms of application, have involved a largo amount of clerical labor. The generul business conducted by me as agent for the Government in London has had reference to telegraph matters, to the legal claims against Sir Charle» Fox and Son, to correspondenco connected with the International Exhibition of 1871, and to some minor matters connected with contracts for Government sup- plies I nocd not refer further to the negotia- tions which I conducted with the British and Australian Telegraph Company, as moat of the correspondenco has been laid before Parlament In reference to the claims against Sir Charles Fox and Son, I may remark that tho case sub mitted by Messrs Ingle, Cooper, and Holmes for counsel's opinion, was drawn up from infor- mation compiled by myself from official records which were supplied to mo from your office be- fore I left Brisbane, without which I could not havo taken any effectual steps to carry out my instructions to obtain a legal opinion I think it well to take this opportunity of stating that it is very important that the officer ni charge of the Queensland Government buBine-s in this country should be supplied with all documents and maps published by tho Government print- ing- office The conduct of the futuie proceed- ings in tho case of Sir C Fox and Son will rest with Messrs Julyan and Sargeaunt, the Crown Agents for tho colonies, to whom I have handed over all the official documents connected with it. I have at the samo timo informed thoso gentlemen that I ehall be very willing to aûord them any assistance which my knowlcdgo of tho subject may enable me to place-at their disposal At an earlier period of the year I had handed over to the Crown agents, in accordnnco with your instructions, somo orders which bad been entrusted to me by your predecessor in office, and whiob were in coureo of oxocution. You will not feel surprised, I think, when I oxpiess a hope that my resignation, which was for wardod to you in Docembor, may bo accepted without delay. Whilo vory willing to plaoo my best services and mv dohborate judgment at tho disposal of the administration, I am unwilling to undertake, any sorvico without the reward of re- ciprocal confidence, and in tbo faco of instruc- tions which from first to last havo plated mo in a falso position. I must bog to resorve any justification I may havo to offer until I am rohovod fiom my offitiul duties. I havo oudeavored during my short tonuro of ofllco to not up to tho spirit in which I accoptod my appointment, as the repiesentativo ia England of the Government of ono of the self-governing colonies of Australia, and while not shrinking from the responsibilities oonuectod with such nn ofllco, I am not conscious that I havo assumed authority in auy mattors which did not rightly attaoh to mo.-I havo the honor to be, Sir, your most obodiont sorvaut, J.

by the war will cause an extensive emi gration movement in Germany as soon as tho restrictions tboreto will be removed, and I shall do my best to bring forward tho claims of Queensland, in order to induco some of our small capitalists to settlo there 12 Many other countries howovor, are striv- ing to ottraet Continental Emigration by liberal concessions and facilities The United States, with a short and cheap passage, give large grunts of land and freo railway passes into the interior , the Brazil Government advanoo passages and rations during tho first eix months of arrival, but perhaps the most liberal conditions arc modo to emigran s for tho Argentine Provinces, and I enclose herewith particulars of one of these Ger man settlements which proved very successful 13 similar settlements might be formed in Queensland, where, by growing cotton and sugar, even moro favorable results might bo obtained 14 I believe small capitalists might bo attracted by advancing thoir passages, on their showing that they aro in possession of at least £25 for ovory adult in tho family,-on arrival, thoy would havo to bo allowod to sslect and settle oa their land (without entering into Ber- rico for two years as stipulated by the Act) , but the legal pos esaion of their land not to bo given until the repayment, within two vears, of the advances made 15 I beg to remark, at the

May I -equest that they aro allowed to reduce their timo of service to one year, by repaying their pnsengo witbin that period P 16 I am very hopeful that my Gorman eau grants will, under proper
