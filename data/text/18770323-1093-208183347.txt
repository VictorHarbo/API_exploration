'80-7 rro THE ELECTORS OE THE _L LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen—I wish specially to direct your attention to my opinions on the following six points:— Legislative Council Reform:.—I think that whenever any penal dissclutien of the House of Assembly takes place, one-third of the members of the Legislative Council should retire in order that you may give your opinion on the ques tion which has caused such dissolution. This would render the Legislative Council more re sponsible to you, and prevent any deadlock between the two Houses. Land Laws.—Having been a consistent land reformer ever since the question first arose, I congratulate the farmers of this colony on their success in breaking up the monopoly which formerly existed in land. I shall be happy to advocate any amendment of the law, shown to . be required, especially the reduction of the price of scrub land to a nominal sum to those willing to clear and cultivate. Mining Laws.—1 advocate a peppercorn rent for unproductive mineral lands, with conditions enforcing the employment of labor, in order to prevent monopolies, and a Eoyalty or percentage on dividends. Taxation and Free Trade.—If it can be shown, as asserted by some, that no further taxation is required I shall be most happy to be convinced, as nothing but absolute necessity justifies the imposition of taxes; but if further taxation is required it should fall on the wealthy classes, who have hitherto never paid their fair share of the expenses of the Govern ment of this colony. Every one should con tribute according to his means, whether such means are derived from shares, lands, mines, slieep, or any other description of property. That " large and important class, the men of no property," who have hitherto through the Custom-House paid more than their fair share of taxation, should be relieved by the introduc tion of Free Trade, has been done in England, Immigration should be carefully conducted, and stopped by telegraph as soon as the first symptoms of bad times or scarcity of employ ment manifest themselves. Law Reform.—I am and always have been an ardent admirer of the Real Property Act and all other endeavors to simplify and cheapen the law of the land and the procedure of the Courts. I advocate the adaptation of the Local Court procedure to the Supreme Court. I remain, Your obedient servant. 78zexS3c R. C RAKER LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL ELECTIONS. TO THE ELECTORS. In the present juncture it is of the liighes, importance that you should choose the best men to represent yon in the Legislative Council. I have determined to support Mr. Ingleby and shall give him ONE VOTE, for the following REASONS. 1\. He is a gentleman, of matured experience who on points of law is equal to any of the Bar.—Vide Bunyiji, March 9. *2. He is an "Honest Lawyer."—Vide Methodist Journal, March 16. 3\. His views on the alterations desirable in the Constitution Act are in advance H those of any other candidate. 4\. He is in favor of a Property Tax, not for the mere purpose of raising additional Revenue, but with the object of readjusting the burden of taxation, which is now mainly paid by persons whose income is under £200 a year, and compelling the holders of property to contribute towards the payment of the interest on Loans, the expenditure of which on Roads, Bridges, and Jetties directly benefits landed pro prietors, and because it is the only Tax which Absentees can he compelled to pay_ 5\. He does not belong to any political party, but is a truly representative man. 6\. He is in favor of amending the Real Property Act, and applying it to all Real Property. It will be seen that Mr. Ingleby's views are eminently progressive, and are not limited to the passing questions of the day. 82-3zx83 AN ELECTOR. J&.
