Appeal To Admit 3 Danes An appeal to give three young Danes a chance to make good in Australia was sent to the Department of the Interior yesterday. It was written by Mr. J. A. Meagher, a Sydney solicitor. The three Danes are: â€” Lauritz Peter Svendsen, 21, sailor; Knud Borge Jensen, 20, steward; Carlo Erland Larsen, 18, deckboy. Charged with being prohibited immi grants, it is alleged they deserted from the Danish vessel Asia, now homeward bound. Appearance Impresses The three are in Long Bay Jail on remand. "They asked my advice professionally, at Central Court on Wednesday," said Mr. Meagher, yesterday. "Their good appearance impressed me. I am trying to do more for them." Mr. H. B. Cody, Inspector of Customs, said yesterday that the Danes were very desirable types.
