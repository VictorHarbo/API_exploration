! IS BRITISH ELEMENT IN AUSTRALIA MENACED ? PRIME MINISTER'S DEPARTMENT SAYS "NO" The ImpreS£io» is widespread that pel 1 : i eons of foreign birth are eiitei'iug Austra- 3ia in numbers 60 large as to menace tie preservation of.the preponderant British clement of our population. In a statement issued today by tbe publicity department of the Prime Minister's Department, the situation is renewed. For the three years and six months ended September, 1924, the 'avearge annual •excess ol — arrivals in, over departure: - ., , Australia, ox British peoples was 39,120.; During the same period, the avearge an-j nuftl excess of arrivals over departures oi persons of foreign hu'th wM- tflO. i^e average annual -increase m the population j by excess of births over deaths during i the same period was.S2.00Q. j Assuming that only 20,009 Britishers (a decrease of 9120 on the above figures,! I came here each year during the nest de-1 cade, and that 20,000 aliens (an increase of 15.390 on. the figure above given) were admittedannually during the same period, also assuming that the natural increase in file ixjjjulaion remained stationary, tno British poDulation of Australia at the end of'10 years would represent Si per ecut.j of the total—a' dilution of the present British preponderance to the extent of only 2 per cent. , Tn all probability, however, the number.,of British assisted migrants will, when the uew agreement about to be entered in- .to by the British and Commonwealth Governments and the Governments of the eix. States is in operation—show an increase over the number who arrived dining'the period above stated. The mm-. 4>er of -unassisted British migrants is unijkely to decrease, wliich is generally cumulative, will also be greater _in tue future. From present indications m view of the .agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and certain foreign governments to. restrict the issue of .passports or the granting of visas, it is litdy to bfc some years before the number of foreign arrivals reach 20,090 per annum. . The-Italian "Government lias agreed to limit the granting of passports to persons who have been nominated by persons in Australia au"d wKo are 111 possession of £40 each. In the case of Greets, Jugoslavs, and Albanians the British authorities. at the request of the Commonwealth .Government, are limiting the granting of -visas to .passports to 106 per month in each case, and visas will not be granted •to - persons unless they are individually in possession of £40. , The Foreign Element. Tlie census of A-pri!, 1821, showed that the number of persons in Australia not born here, or. in the British Isles or New Zealand, was 139,«73—or slightly over 2% -pel- cent. The uuuiber owing jallegiance to foreign governments -was 48,529, or .-08 per cdiit. During the past few years, and particularly since July, 1924 (when the latest Immigration Restriction. Act passed by tie .United -States Congress came into operation}, there has been a quicker movement of peoples from Southern Europe to Australia. During the 3% y^eis . ended .September 30, 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign-born immigrants ..numbered 1G,14S, a figure representing about ll.fi per cent. of. the total foreign born persons who -were in Australia svhen the 1^)21 census was taken. ..

United States Act. In Slav, 1U21, the Jirst immigration gtrietion Act was passed by the United Urates Oongress. This, Act introduced the "quota" system. The quota was limited to 3 per cent, of the number of nationals of each countrv who were domiciled in the U.S.A., according to the census ot 1910\. This Act operated for a year, and was replaced by the Act which came into force on Jjily 1, 1024. This later, Act reduced the quota fr«n 3 per cent, to 2 per -cent, of the numner. of natioual6 do-i micSled in Uie" Unttfcd" Stet®, as a«terj mined by tbe-ceasus pf 1890.' ... ,» " The reason' for this is s^nificant. Ine <rreat ^:ream of so-called Nordie immigration flowed to tbe United States before 1890—tie "new" or Southern European immigration caaie later.

The Congress Committee in reporting on this matter said:— "The most • troublesome administrative difficulty -encountered since the enactment of- the 3-per cent, law' has -"been the'enforcement of the numerical limitation. The actual, physical counting of human being? arriving by ship and train lias been a task of magnitude. Mistakes have been made. Steamships have raced to port in efforts to land passengers within time limits. Delays and disappointments have brought hardships. Distressing appeals for relief in individual --cases have assailed the officers charged with enforcement of the law. Senators and Representatives have been besought to aid either in nullifying the statute or in -mitigating its force. All these troublesome obstacles are confidently expected to be eliminated in the event of the enactment of the -new Bill. The Bill contains provision for enforcement of the numerical limitation not by counting immigrants upon their arrival, but by counting immigration certificates" issuable at 'American consulates overseas. . The plan, briefly, is to issue for each nationality a number of inimi' gration certificates to be placed in the na ands * of - intending • immigrants as they obtain American visas upon their passports. Each certificate has a validity of two months to the time of taking ship,, Therefore, the intending immigrant, hav-i ing obtained his passport, his' immigration! certificate, and his visa, is at liberty to I •proceed to the United States in' the* full knowledge that he will not be debarred solely by a quota. limitation. He must, (however, -undergo'further examination at the port of entry, and be. able to pass under the provisions of the 1917 Act. It is expected that tlie number of those who cannot pass will be greatly reduced • by reason of the preliminary investigation.) There should be no arrival of excessquota * cases, and there need be no racing of _ steamships. If this Bill' reduces to the minimum the number of arrivine alipns that must be turned back, it will have accomplished one of its important; purposes." It seems to be' impracticable for Australia,.,which- has no Foreign Service, to enforce a quota law. Another significant passage in the Tenort of tUe United States Congressional Committee* is the following:— "Decision by "the committee* to_Iim\t admissions of quota, immigrants* to 2 ner cent., based on. census furores of 1R90. instead of 3 per "cent.'. "baseS' on the census pf JfilO. was reached after Inner and careful consideration of every element, of tlie entire immicration problem. An impelling reason for the '-liange Is that it is desired to slow down the streams of the trrms of immicration which' are not easily assimilated. Naturalisation does not .necessarily mean assimilation. The natural- isation process -cannot^ work, well with the continued arrival in large numbers of the so-called new immigration. .The new type crowds in the large cities. It is exploited. It gains liut a slight knowledge of America and American institutions. It has grown to be a great undigested -mass of alien thought, alien sympathy, and alien purpose. It is a menace to the social, political, and economic life of the country. It creates alarm and apprehension. It breeds racial hatreds which should not exist iu the United States, and which need not exist when the balance shall have been restored." , 1
