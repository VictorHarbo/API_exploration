IN obedience to a return moved for by Mr DEAKIN in the Assembly, in Sep tember last,there has lately been printed and distributed some valuable informa tion, showing the number of letters, newspapers, and packets despatched and received by the Orient steamers since the 1st January, 18S0, and the amount of postage paid to the Orient Company for the same; the number of letters, newspapers, and packets despatched from "Victoria, including those received from other colonies by the supplementary mail forwarded via Adelaido by the. Orient steamers, and the amount of postage paid to .' the ' Orient Company for their- - conveyance . the amount of: > postages , ' received' .by the government _ from the public for the v .^conveyance' of' '.y.tliQ..-letters, newspapers, and packets des patched according to the foregoing! returns ? the time occupied by each Orient steamer in the delivery of mails out and home ; the time occupied by the subsidised steamers of the P. and O. Company 111 performing a similar service ; the loss which the general revenue has sustained by the decrease in postages on letters, newspapers, and packets despatched from other colonies by the P. and 0. steamers. The Age newspaper has persistently assailed Mr Bi:niiv for having concluded a contract with the P. and O. Company for con veyance or the mails, and, as Mr DF.AKIN has intimnte relations with that journal, we may suppose the returns to have been asked for in its interest, and with a view to demonstrate that the Orient line ouglit, in the public in terest, to have been selected for the mail service of this country, in prefer ence to the service of the P. and O. Company. The official returns do not, by any means, support the position assumed by the Age, although they show that the Orient line is one of considerable value as a supplemental service, and that Mr BEKHY, who gave tbc Orient Company every reasonable opportunity of tender ing for the service, was quite right in every sense in the course that he pur sued. There are returns of fifteen Orient ships despatched from London to Melbourne between the 2nd Decem ber, 1S79, and tho 9th July, 1SS0, and taking the average passage for the whole, we find it was made in a trille under 45 days. Between the 5th December, 1S79, and the lGth. July. 1SS0, there were seventeen vessels despatched from London by the P. and O. Company, and the average passage was 39 days IS hours. On the home ward route the Orient made better time. Between the 31st January and the loth June, 1SS0, nine ships were afloat, and the average run occupied 41 days 13 hours. The nine vessels of the P. and 0. fleet, however, averaged a trifle over 41 days 3 hours. Thus, as regards speed, the palm must be given to the contract company, both out and home, while it clearly estab lishes the fact that, so far as the mercantile community is con ccriicd, Mr BERRY certainly made the arrangement that is most to their ad vantage. and one which, so long as we ignore the advantages of immigration, is of greatest convenience to the public. In fact, notwithstanding the splendid work done by the Orient line we don't find that the public take much advan tage of the company's ships for correspondence. Between January and August of this year, the Orient ships carried but 19,973 letters, 1258 postal packets, and 13,2SG newspapers, an altogether insig nificant item in the correspondence between these colonies and the mother country. It is true there is a loss to tliis colony on the P. and 0. contract of £2075 Ss 6d during the first half year of 18S0 by a decrease of ocean postal business with the other colonies, but this is accounted for in the fact of New South Wales, New Zealand, South Australia, and Tasmania still charging the Sd rate for letters sent fiVtBrindisi, whereas the postage on correspondence despatched via San Francisco, or by non-contract steamers, is only Gd. Taking the whole returns there is nothing in them to justify the position taken up by the Age, or which proves that Mr BERRY when in England made a contract for the mail service that tho people of the colony have the least rea son to be dissatisfied with. ANT DOCTORS PRESCRIPTION carefully pre pared. and ample directions given, that tho intention of tho medical man may b« folly carried out. CHEMICALS, TJRCQS; ' and . DRUQ GIST'S SUNDRIES. W. H.
