OUR IDLE LANDS. A BOLD POLICY NEEDED. PAlM'PH LET BY THE IMMIGRATION) LEAGUE. "The Peril of 'Melbourne" is the title of a pampnlet to be issued towards the end of the week by the Victorian Land Settle ment Division of tlie Immigration League of Australia. The object of the pamphlet, which has been prepared by the lion, score- tary for Victoria, Air. Alaivhall Lylo, is to arouse the interest of all sections of the community to tho urgent necessity for an enlightened and thoroughly up to date land policy, which will not only secure land for our own people without the exasperating delays which arc so fatal to settlement, but will provide for the absorption of tens of thousands of new producers, for whom there is ample room. Three very significant statements aro made at the beginning of the pamphlet, which are worthy of special consideration. It is pointed out that there arc 50,245,760 acres of land in Victoria; and that while 31,518,526 acres appcur in the departmental records as "occupied," only 4,209,877 acres are under cultivation. The second statement is that from 1S01 to 31st December, 1008, Victoria lost by. net emigration toy sea (by excess of de partures over arrivals) 77,058 .persons, of whom 24,428 went to New Zealand. Thu- third statement is tliat Victoria is threaten, cd with further losses in the immediate future owing to land in the other States and in the Northern Territory being inado available for thousands of settlers. It is admitted that -tlie first duty is to provide land for our own people before in ducements -are held out to immigrants; and it is contended that the aim should be to . make the Settlers so satisfied about their condition and prospects that their letters to friends in Europe and America will prove tlie best advertisements we could display to desirable immigrants. The position of tlie pifblui estate on 31sb . December, 1905, is stated as follows: — Approximata Areas. ' PRIVATE IMJfDS. Acres.

Vic- torn, as before stated, has 50,245,700 acres. ' and it hns a population of 1,231,733. Den mark has an area ot 9,500,160 acres, and in Population of 2,449,540. .

Vvc want more work for all here, and a good deal more money. We do not want to flood the country with the idle and thriftless from liuropc. We are not in favor of indiscriminate immigration. Wo do not want to make life harder for any man or woman in Australia. We have a splendid country, upon which millions of money have been expended to fit it foe vigorous agriculture. But we have "left it to the Government." California and Canada, liave gone ahead so rapidly because com mittees of private citizens and public bodies took/ up as public duties the business of seeing that people were settled upon the lands in these countries. We must do tlie same. The only way to keep undesirable immigrants out of Australia is to bring plenty of desirable immigrants into it. The only way to secure tlie standard of living of the white man in Australia is by having enougli wliite men to defend it. The standard of European civilisation must be maintained in Australia. This continent has the vastest areas of unoccupied or slightly occupied lands oirthe earth. Aus tralia has over 8000 miles of coast line ab solutely unprotected. In our present state we invite invasion. Asia is crowded with teeming millions, always on the verge of- famine. Eight millions are within a few days' steaming time of our northern shores. "We are 4,000,000— men, women and children —and wo have to provide for the defence of a continent. Our backdoor is lying open in the north. We live upon a continent ' which we cannot internationally claim to be our own without effective occupation of it. We do not and w6 cannot effectively occupy it with our present population and its natural increase. Agriculture is the first line of national defence. The world ia filling up .fast. . The East is awakening. tion to Australia. The only question is vJMiat races of men will occupy it. '
