Tho great increnso ot population in this neighbourhood during tho pnst two years in tho mining and agricultural interests, and tho fresh occupation by squatters of the back country lying between tho Lnchlnn, tho Bogan, and tho Darling Rivers, coupled with tho fact of our being so fur from tho Metropolis, and, therefore, our wants hoing so little known to tho Government, render it very neces- sary that tho rising and important town of Pnrkes,.with its surrounding neighbourhood, should bo represented by a local newspaper. In politics tho PARKES GAZETTE will bo woddod to no party, but will give its support to alt, so long as it is conceived they do right, but no longer. It will know ni clique, but its columns will bo always opon for tho dis| cussion of topics of public interest so long os such discus- sions nro conducted in a proper spirit ; but tho right tj> libel must belong solely to thc proprietor. ; Advertisers will be donlt with as libornlly as possible, and will find it to their advantage to uso tho PARKES GAZETTE as an advertising medium. Intending subscribers will please send their names to tile undersigned as emly as possible. I Terms:-Yenrly in ndvance, £1. HENRY H. COOKE. Parkes, January 7,1874. BOOKS, STATIONERY. AND MUSIC.
