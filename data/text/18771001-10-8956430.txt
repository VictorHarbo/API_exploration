On all diseases arising from early indiscretions. On Gout. On Rheumatism. In these colonies, those excesses which we have indulged in " her youth tell upon us with fearful interest. "Our regrets are useless, our repinings futile. The sole idea should be the chances we possess of remedying the ills we already have, or com- bating the effects likely to result. Hide it as he may put on as good an exterior as he can, still is the victim conscious that he is a living legend that sooner or later his vices will discover him to the world. Our Faith, our obliga- tions to society at large, the welfare of our future offspring, and the duty we owe to ourselves, forbids procrastination, and points out to us, not to wait till the ravages break out in our constitutions. Before negociating with a merchant, before engaging with a confidential clerk, before employing a barrister, a cures a man makes enquiries as to their standing, their length of occupancy or residence and in the case of a legal adviser, both as to his legal qualifications and as to his capabilities of transacting the individual business he consults him upon. Strange to say, however, in the selection of a medical man, the sufferer frequently omits these necessary precautions, and without regard to the fitness, qualification, experience and ability for the particular ailment requiring treatment, he consults the nearest man; whose experience and practice, perhaps, lies in quite an opposite direction. It is astonishing that so many are driven mad, are ruined in health, and are bankrupt in spirits, hope and money 1 Have I not for years pointed out to them that J, Dr. L. L.

Although the modern Materia Medica includes many valuable remedies for human afflictions, it is a matter of certainty that in all cases where the animal vitality is failing, PHOSPHORUS is decidedly superior to every other remedy at present known. It will work effects such as nothing else will produce, and it possesses the great advantage of not causing, when its use in relinquished, the slightest reaction or depression. Protected by Royal Letters Patent, Dated October 11th, 1869. UNDER DISTINGUISHED PATRONAGE. DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE. (OZONIO OXYGEN.) The New Curative Agent, and only Reliable Remedy for Nervous and Liver Complaints. This Phosphate combination is pronounced by the most eminent members of the Medical Profession to be unequalled for its power in replenishing the vitality of the body, by its supplying all the essential constituents of the blood and nerve substance, and for developing all the powers and functions of the system to the highest degree. It is agreeable to the palate, and innocent in its action, while retaining all its extraordinary properties and OB a specific, surpassing all the known therapeutic agents of the present day for the speedy and permanent cure of Nervous Prostration Lassitude Liver Complaints Shortness of Breath Palpitation of the Heart Trembling of the Hands Dizziness and Limbs Noises in the Head and Ears Impaired Nutrition Loss of Energy and Appetite Mental and Physical De Hypochondria pression Female Complaints Consumption (in its first General Debility stages only) Indigestion . Timidity Flatulence ' [ness Eruptions of the Skin incapacity for Study or Busi- Nervous Debility in all impaired Sight and Memory its Stages Nervous Fancies Sick Headache Premature Decline impoverished Blood And all morbid conditions of the system arising from whatever cause. The action of the Phosphodyne is twofold on the one hand increasing the principle which constitutes nervous energy, and on the other the most powerful blood and flesh generating agent known ; therefore, a marvellous medicine for renovating impaired and broken-down constitutions. It quickly improves the functions of assimilation to such a degree, that where for years an emaciated, anxious, cadaverous, and semi-vital condition has existed, the flesh will rapidly increase in quantity and firmness, and the whole system return to a state of robust health. The PhoB phodyne acts electrically upon the organisation for instance, it assists nature to generate that human electricity which renews and rebuilds the osseous, muscular, nervous, membranous, and organic systems. It operates on the system without exciting care or thought upon the individual as to the process. It moves the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, stomach, and intestines, with a harmony, vigour, yet mildness unparalleled in medicine. The Phosphodyne gives back to the human structure, in a suitable form, the phosphoric or animating element of life, which has been wasted, and exerts an important influence directly on the spinal marrow and nervous system, of a nutritive, tonic, and invigorating character, maintaining that buoyant energy of the brain and muscular system, which renders the mind cheerful, brilliant, and energetic, entirely overcoming that dull, inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience in all their actions. The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are frequently shown from the first day of its administration, by a remarkable increase of nervous power, with a feeling of vigour and comfort, to which the patient has long been unaccustomed. Digestion is improved j the appetite increases wonderfully ; the bowels become regular ; the eyes brighter ; the skin clear and healthy and the hair acquires strength, showing the importance of the action of the Phosphodyne on the organs of nutrition. Finally, the Phosphodyne maintains a certain degree of activity in the previously debilitated nervous system ; its use enables all debilitated organs to return to their sound state and per- form their natural functions. Persons suffering from Nervous Debility, or any of the hundred symptoms which this distressing disease assumes, may rest assured of an effectual and even speedy cure by the judicious use of this most invaluable remedy. - DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE Is sold only In CaseS at 10s. 6d. by all Chemists and Patent Medicine Vendors throughout the Globe. Full Directions for Use in the English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Danish, Turkish, Persian, Hindustani, MadraBse (Tamul), Bengalee, Chinese and Japanese Languages, accompany each Case. IST CAUTION.-The large and increasing demand for DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE has led to several imitations under similar names ; purchasers of this medicine should therefore be careful to observe that each case bears the English Government Stamp, with the words " Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne " engraved thereon (white letters on a red ground), and that the same words are also blown in the Bottle. Every Case bears the Trade Mark and Signature of Patentee. WHOLESALE AGENTS FOR Victoria : FELTON, GRIMWADE, k Co., Melbourne, New South Wales : ELLIOTT, BROS., Sydney.

EXTRAORDINARY CURE OF A COUGH. The following letter has been received from WILLIAM BOARDS, Esq., an extensive agriculturist and land agent, residing at Edmonton, Middlesex : " Nightingale Hall, Edmonton. Dear Sirs-I have recently suffered much from a most violent cough, proceeding from a tickling in my chest, which no remedy, out of many 1 resorted to, could allay. My head was constantly aching, and my whole frame entirely shaken. Having seen the good effects of your Balsam of Aniseed in several members of my family, I purchased a small bottle, and, when going to bed at night, took a teaspoonful in two tablespoonfuls of water, just warm. The effect was immediate ; it arrested the tickling in my chest, I slept well, and arose perfectly restored in the morning, with the exception of debility, arising from fatigue by incessant coughing for some days previous. My cough entirely left me and has never returned. Having since heard of a lady in the neighbourhood who for a long time had laboured under a most distressing cough, and who had resorted to every remedy within her knowledge, I sent the remainder of the bottle to her and that long-standing, obstinate, and (as she thought) incurable cough was perfectly cured. You are at perfect liberty to make what use you may please of this communication, to the contents are strictly true. I shall take every opportunity of recommending your in- estimable medicine, feeling as I do fully assured of its efficacy. I am, dear sir, yours very truly, " WM. BOARDS." POWELL'S BALSAM OF ANISEED.

THE WOODLANDS IRIS, TO STAND THIS SEASON AT WOODLANDS, MELTON MOWBRAY. HORATIO, Limited to number, besides owner's mares. SIRE, Maribyrnong, the wife of Woodlands (the winner of the A.J.C. Derby of 1877), Hamlet, The Diver, Imperial, Richmond, Miss. Jessie, Sunshine, Cap-a-pie, etc. DAM, Rose of Denmark, by Stockwell, the sire of Blair Athol, Doncaster, Gang Forward, etc ; g. dam, Marchioness (winner of the Oaks), by Melbourne ; g.g. dam, Cinuelli (the dam of Marquis), by Touchstone ; gaging. dam, Brocade, by Pantaloon. Rose of Denmark was also the dam of Hamlet, Florence, and Sovereign, and a I half sister to Fishhook and Angler. Maribyrnong, by Fisherman, imported. Dam, Rose de Florence, imported, by the Flying I Dutchman, out of Boarding School Miss, by Plenipotentiary, out of Marpessa (dam of Pocahontas, Stockwell's dam), by Muley, etc. Rose de Florence, dam of Nathan., Fenella, King of the Ring, and Ferryman (the sire of Charon, Lamplighter, etc.) She is also full sister to Peter Wilkins (the sire of The Quack, Benvolio, etc.) On reference to Horatio's pedigree above, it will be seen that, independently of his having a strain of Stockwell blood on the side of both sire and dam, he is closely allied to all the stoutest and best blood in the world, and, without doubt, is one of the most muscular and handsome horses now at the stud in the colonies. His victory in the great Metropolitan and 3 year old Handicap, and his running in the Melbourne Cup and other races, prove him to be a racehorse of the highest class. In offering his services to breeders in Tasmania, the proprietor deems it unnecessary to refer to this horse's terms, beyond the fact that his own brother, Hamlet, is now standing at Woodstock at 20 guineas and his sire (Manbyrnong's) list is full at 60 guineas. RINGLEADER, By South Australian, imported ; his dam, Ring- leader, by Jersey, imported ; g. dam, Fairy Queen, by Mozart ; g.g. dam, Fairy, imported of Colonel Latour for the Cressy Company, and pronounced to be one of the finest mares that ever left England.

Ringleader, bred by Mr. Gerrard, in South Australia, in 1869, also the breeder of The Ace, King Tom, etc., combines within himself some of the fastest racing blood, and his points for a sire horse for either hunters, steeplechasers, hacks, carriage horses, or racers have never been questioned. He was at the stud one season in Victoria and for the last three seasons in Tasmania, and he has not only proved himself a sure animal for stud purposes, but his stock are pronounced to be very promising. Ringleader will travel through Hobart Town, New Norfolk, Hamilton, Bothwell, Richmond, and home every tenth day. TERMS.
