EXTRACT FF05I THE LONDON TIMES. i MR AND MRS KEAN AT THE PRINCESS'S. ' The brief fortnight is over, and Mr and Mix C. Kean have terminated their farewell engagement at the Princess's, not to re-appear in London till they have returned from the Australian colonies. In the short time of their sojourn among us, how much has been done ! ' Hamlet,' ' Othello,' ' The Mer- r chant of Venice,' which aro three of tho principal plays bequeathed to us by Sliakspeare ; the portion of ' Henry tho Eighth ' in which the genius of our great tragedian is most prominently shown ; ' Louis XI,' naturalised upon our stage by Mr Kean's excel- r lcnt acting : and Coleman's pleasant comedy of ' The Jealous Wife,' represented with such exuberanthumor that it is almost impossible to identify poor Air Oahley . and his tyrannical spouse with the Danish prince ( and his conscience-stricken mother. These pieces, wo say, represent no small amount of mental or 1 physical labor to bo performed within eleven days. Every ono of the principal characters soverally put forward on the list belongs to the highest depart ment of art. Mr and Mrs Kean havo left us amid 1 acclamations and hearty wishes of success in a new a and untried region, fairly earned by,many years' : J toil endured in tho best of causes, the maintenance v of the national drama ; and their admirable per formance during the last engagement at tho Princess's, newly impressing so many vivid images on our minds, renders ins more painfully aware of the magnitude of oar loss.. nHBaaaaBaaaaaaasnBaiaflomBBEB | Amusements. | J^OYAL HAYMARKET THEATRE, Sole Lessee and Manager . .Mr James Simmonds.
