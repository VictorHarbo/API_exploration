DEVELOPING VICTORIA. -m HOW TO FOSTER ITS INDUSTRIES. IMPORTANT SPEECHES. STATE GOVERNÔ"ing PREMIER AT COLAC. nr our ow v nitrogen it ) COLAC, Wednesday. A number of important public questions were dealt with to day by His Excellency the Governor (Sir George S denham Clarke) and by the Premier of A real n i by (Air Irvine) in the course of speech to the opening of the Farmers' Convention THE INDUSTRIES OF THE Land His Excellency the Governor spoke at some length on the subject of the industries of the kind, which he recognised as the backbone of the pro polity of the state (Hear, hear ) The more he saw of this wonderful country the more eel team he was that these great many-, trees should be widely developed There were three things needed to ensure pro gress co-operation, association, and other nisation these were three ugly Latin words, but they represented times things that we could not do without 1 farmers in all countries found it difficult to secure con- bination, on account of the special conditions of their life Lie lived far apart, and then occupation was practically continuous Even if those happy condition-! came to pass when farmer- would go about on automobiles, they would still have the same difficulty in combining They but not the same opportunities of coming to gether to receive instruction and mining' tion and of exchanging views as were at the disposal of dwellers of the towns He therefore anew ed the convention is extremely important, and hoped that it would be the precursor of many future conventions Victoria was pre-eminent among the states of Australia as an agricultural country. The value of the total the cultural productions for the year 1901 was far greater than that of my other state, and more than one fourth of the total agricultural production of Vitv tralia In con win crops the Victim in averages were higher than any other and much of the victorian land was of splendid quality The Boer delegates w h > recently visited Australia remarked upon this fact, and told him that New Zeal as I could not hold a candle to Victoria in the respect A great deal of the poorer he with a little more science might be no i lo reproductive The possibilities of production in Victoria were only now beginning, to be closed The high prices winch line obtained, combined with the activity of the Agricultural department induced you to hopes for the future of A'letom More I li in 2,000 years ago an ancient Roman write a treatise on agriculture Two of his leaving were that a farmer should feed his stock well, and that a good husbandman should be a seller and not a buyer That ancient husbandman did not know anything about better. because he used it on the outside instead of inside (Laughter) This man did not know anything about mistake but Australians would admit that there was profit in feeding stock well It better provision had been made for feeding stock there would not have been such heavy loss through the recent drought It should be the object of the farmer now is it w as then, to get as much as he could out of the soil, by selecting what yielded the most economical advantage An important matter with which they would deal was the export trade in agricultural products for export trade of Victoria was capable of being very largely developed The development of the export trade in butter was in instance of what could be done there is id, however, been a large falling off on account of the drought, which might have been prevented to a great extent if proper measures had been taken. The foreign butter in a set was a very large one indeed, and A re tons had great competitors 'in production of Danish butter now approached a maximum and Siberia and Argentina were also lives lie biDomn production mu increased very much during the past few years, but, considering the conditions of climate, it must be possible to boat Siberia. With regard to Argentina, though it had developed very much the resourceful ness of our own race should enable us to win in a contest (Hear, hear.) The frozen meat mar Let also was a very late one, and it was perfectly certain to increase He did not think that we played as great a pub in that market as we should do New Zea- land made enormous strides in the frozen r meat market, and Argentina also, and t ice was a great future for the farmers in Vie Iona The cheese market seemed to be neglected in Victoria He had been told that cheese at 9d paid better than butter at 17 The cheese production for 1901 win 113,6001b, and in that year New South Wales imported 12 million pounds of cheese Surely that great market over the Murray was open to Victoria With regard to the foreign wheat market, he was less sanguine Looking to the future, it would be more and more difficult to compete with the great markets of the world Canada in 15 years should be able to supply all the wheat required by the United Ki -dom. The production of Argentina was into rising by leaps and bounds, and there was Egypt, with its wonderful litigation scheme which enabled it to produce wheat with absolute regularity and certainty The Arit corian wheat crop average for 10 years w is very low, amounting to only 70 bushels, while the average of the United Kingdom to the same period was 31 bushels Uni showed that the wheat crop of Victoria w is very thin indeed. It was the smallest of any in the we orld-considerabl} less than that of a little country life Roumania, and considerably less than that of Al gentilli. There was always the Australian home market, which would grow with increase of. population With regard to the foreign market he was afraid that competition would be too serious Japan would take, very much more wheat in the future, but there, too, Canadian competition would come in In 1901 the value of the wheat crop in Victoria was £1/3/7 per acre, tim fe of oats 1/14/0, barley £4/11/2, and maize £7/13/6 Experience had shown that 60 bushels of maize could be grown per acre There were other crops, such as millet and sorghum, about which we know nothing as yet, but for which there were bright prospects for the future At Traralgon a crop of 120 acres of flax gave a net profit of U> per acre On the question of population there was one thing which caused in anxiety as to the future of Victoria has great growth of the United States and its immense prosperity had arisen entirely from the influx of population _ Canners it's - self received over 200 500 immigrants in one N V car-men who would go straight on to the N land and add very much to the weill of the Dominion The Victorian birth ntr killing 40 years had declined from 40 3 lo I 25 7 per thousand It was in enormous falling off, considering the fact that emigration from Victoria exceeded minion tion. He was not sure whether the production of children came into the council him of an agricultural society, but the question of population bid a very great deal to do with the future of agriculture in Victoria We could not expect any great permanent progress for the state unless we could bring about an increase of population on the land (Hool hear ) Mr. II by me had one advantage over him that of being able to say what he liked He hoped that the convention would be productive of last nig benefit to the agricultural industry (Loud applause ) MR IRVINE S A NEWS Mr Irvine, who followed, said that 16 had been a great pleasure to him to listen to the very admirable speech of His Excellency the Governor It was a very easy matter, in one way, for a gentleman occupying his high position to make formal speeches, but he observed that Sir George Clarke did not satisfy himself with mere formalities but took the utmost trouble to bring some new finds before his hearers (Applause.) He had in the course of a short speech dealt with a large number of very important questions On one of these questions regarding the prospects of the wheat growing industry, He was not disposed to take such a gloomy view It appeared quite possible, with the rapid development of a light culture and the chair ening of processes, that Australia would be able to compete even with the more favoured countries of the world. It must be remembered that in those countries will capital that was expended in growing in light was hampered by the high prices of land. Vnsti illa had the advantage of vastly j greater noise at the disposal of its framers a thin was the case in other countries he is did not speed is an expert but while on this subject he hoped that we had entered upon a period of renewed prosperty^C)I» heal ) Anjono reviewing the p years of drought must be "here tonislimont that the corn" in was not much worse It 0 for the energy and second that there were still signs Till WATER O There was a serious di when the conditions a' scarcity of water we 7 \ sons of the drought ii m His Excellency heaves the people of JVK__">b" (Mr. Irvine) ted'WjTiP' they would never forget the lessons of the drought They would have to be re minded that their prime duty in the future was to store and conserve sufficient water to meet any drought that might occur '(Hear, hear) There was no country in the world not even lev pt 01 India-in Hinch, compared with the population the facilities were greater of the advantages more momentous In the North Eastern district he was struck with the fact that the country was not only suitable for iron gut inn, but almost perfectly graded for the purposes of utilising water by irrigation in the cheapest manner PORTION AND CLOSE SKTTITVIENT He looked forward to a solution of the difficulty regarding the lack of growth of population, and of increasing the prosperity of the country by irrigation and closer settlement Perhaps he should say closer settlement in all things including in aga tion We wanted a much larger number of small freeholders on the land (Hear, len) The spread of socialism in every country was remarkable until it had be tonic a jib ink in the platform of a party which, though not representing a large section of the people had exercised more power than it was entitled to in the past The 1 about pal ty was now paying for the propagation of doctrines of absolute socialism The great problem of the future W is socialism, as against individualism and the sooner people realised what socialism meant the better it would be for them As a general theory it meant the nationalisa- non of means of production The ideal the dream of socialists was that we should have again a universal brotherhood in which every man should work according to his capacity and receive according to his necessities, in which we should have a pet fret Pal lament and a perfect Government taking over an ideal people composed chiefly of civil servants (Laughter ) He did not think that we were coming to that just yet The idea of bringing about the millennium by such a means was not likely to succeed, but he mentioned it because it seemed that the only bulwark against the inroads of socialism was to have is large a number as possible of still free holders settled in the country (Hear, hear ). The interests of fat mel s must it not be opposed to the increase of Government functions (Hear, hear) TUF MURRAY W VTFRS QUESTION He felt that he must take this opportunity of referring to one aspect of the question of irrigation which had recently arisen He referred to the attempt of the Premier of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia as to the temporary division of the waters of the River Murray Since this agreement was entered into, or ten gentlemen had taken it into their heads to go through the country endeavouring to make out that the agreement would have the effect of destroying all irrigation for a period of five years Then attitude assumed that the Premiers were either knaves 01 tools It was said that Altona gave up to South Australia all that South Australia claimed, that she claimed navigation and that we gave her navigation It was also said that the effect of the agreement would be to stop all extension of munition works in Victoria. He would ask them to give him a few minutes and to consider a few definite facts which he would lay before them He had said frequently that he believed that as far as law was concerned, there was no law which entitled South Australia to claim a legal right to any of the water that flowed in American soil He did so now, and the same remark would apply to New South Wales But it did not follow that it was not our duty, if an iron cement could be arrived at which would give us all the water that we wanted, and more than we wanted, and which enabled South Australia to get some share of the water that flowed through her tenderly, to make such an agreement, so long as we did not impose any bar or restriction on the future development of the country (Hear, hear ) It was better that the three states should make that agreement for them selves than that the Federal Parliament should be called upon to intervene, and that Queensland Western Ansti idea and T istmnin should come in and settle these matters for us. The only care that had to be taken was that this agreement did not injuriously affect Victoria's future lights, of the future development of the irrigation of the country Moreover it was said that if an agreement could have been made for five tons a similar agreement might have been concluded at once Ulti merely some sultana] would have to settle the allocation of the waters of the Mur ray on some basis He preferred that the States should settle this matter for them selves if they could do so on in amicable Iiimb (noir hen) But let them suppose that the Federal Parliament were called upon to settle that question, and to settle it five years hence THE IUTritrST*! AT STAKE AT the present time there were very large Intel ests vested in navigation, while there was a comparatively small amount of capital sunk in station But five years (hence he hoped and believed that naviga- tion instead of increasing, would have dwindled in importance as the railways sup planted steamers On the other hand no nation would have increased by leaps and bounds (Hear, hear.) The longer Victoria could go on developing her irrigation schemes the better Critics of the action of the Premier assumed that the report of the commission was unanimous which was not the case. The claims of South Aus- tralia were, first of all, that the average navigation of the river was ten months also that navigation was with the Consta tution, paramount to irrigation Not a drop of water could be far on away for irrigation when the river sank below the point which was necessary to maintain existing savage lion South Australia claimed that 317 000 cubic feet per minute must be allowed to flow into South Australia before a drop of water was allowed for unga tion purposes This was unjust. Victoria's claim was that we were entitled to take as much water as was required for irrigation. The result of the compromise was that instead of potting 30 months' navigation they gave up all possible navigation for five months of the year. During the remaining seven months they gave up navigation when the river fell below the height necessary to give 3.'!7,000 cubic feet. Victoria's position was that we were entitled to take what water we required for irrigation. An analysis of the figures which he gave recently to a deputation showed Heat even in the worst month of the worst year that had ever been known, Victoria had the right to draw twice as much from the war were of the Murray as was ever used. (Hear, hear.) They must remember that the future extension and development of irriga- tion must depend on storage. There could he no great extension by means of pumping. If they remembered that principle it would be the key to all the difficulties that had been presented. There was nothing to pre real victors making as much storage of water as was required. There was nothing to compel Victoria to give up one drop of playful she chose to start during the wet r-Tiiontris hf-tljo-year«--The average flow of the river during the five dry months was 30,00(ft. per minute. In the extraordinary Reason through which we had just passed, in April last, This amount had shrunk to ITs 000 cubic feet. The agreement only affected the water that was withdrawn from the natural flow for the time being. It was a subject upon which he fell strongly, and a rat was not calculated to encourage him to say that he had given up the birthright of the state. A little fair-play was desirable, 7, and if his critics had taken the trouble of asking for an explanation of their difficult ( ties they might have been spared much misapprehension. STATE DCTTS. There was another subject to which he would briefly refer-that of the future financial position of the states of the Commonwealth. He alluded to the question of the transfer of slate loans to His Commonwealth The conference of Premiers at Sydney recently decided that it was in the interests of the states that those provisions of the Commonwealth constitution should be brought into effect as soon as possible. At the end of the period allowed by the Braddon clause the Commonwealth Government would have a revenue of four times as much as was intended by the constitution, and might cast upon the state Treasurers the onus of providing taxation. This was a position which they could not face without the strongest protest. What was the use of the states endeavouring to reduce their expenditure if they found that the Commonwealth Government would have the power of spending unlimited sums of money? The states desired that, if the pre- next amount was insufficient, the Commonwealth should raise the remainder by di Scot taxation. This question should not be allowed to sink into oblivion.
