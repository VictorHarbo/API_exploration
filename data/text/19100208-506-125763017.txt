The latest official figures relating to the West Australian harvest places the I yield at close upon (i,(i(X).0(H) bushels, or 3,518,00(3 bushels more I'han for the I corresponding season in 1908-9. j If Vhe estimate of 5,97S.OOO bushels I is realised, the quantity available for ! export, after providing for local food and seed requirements in West Austra lia, is estimated by Mr. Malcolm A. C Frasoc. the Government Statistician at about 3,681,000 bushels, or 98.598 tons. In the Emmaville district many sot tiers are now busy gofting land ready for ploughing, and a greatly increased area 'will be under cultivation next harvest.

Mark Reynolds, inspector of agriculture for the W--.sU-rn distri --t-s. ha.-: been in Mudgee for some days supervising the harvesting of the Government Kx|-orimt-ntal potato plots at Mr. V. I). C'ox's Burrundulla Kst at^v. The crops were planted early in September under i'he inspector's super vision, ami ill!. |M-iiiiMl allowed [or growth wa- ajiproximati-ly four aJid :i half months. The samples are all fn*1 from disease, and may 1r- classed as maiketalile [xitatoes. The geneial rains ctiu-ed a second growth in Brow nell's lieauties. and also to some ex tent in i'he other varieties. Altoge ther eight varieties were tried in tin plot, namely. Brownell's Beauties. Early Rose. Coronation. Manhattan. Cambridge Kidney. Ruby, Satisfac tion, and Bliss's Triumph. At plant ii;i;-tim-- the l:i --t namcl was iiitWted with iloc-li. ii conditios re--ognis---l l.-y rusty s|-ots in the flesh of the. pota t-i It has l-ccn f«nisid-.-retl a consiitu ti--nal)le trouble, as no organism has so fa/ been .so traced to cause the di» i-iiM'. However, note was taken of the fact' that on tlijigiug this variety a considerable numlier ol the sets had missed and rotted. With the Early Rose variety it was notiixnl at plant ing time Vhat th-- tuln-rs contained a very hug.' number of eyes, and the potatoes were more than usually soapy. This variety wa.» also affected (luring tin- growing period by a diesase known as Alu-riiiiria solani. which destroys th- foliage and reduces the yield. It was noticed that other varieties grow ing in close proxiiuit v to the Karlv R-;s-- were not :.ll-- cU-d. ^ The best yield was given by the Ruby variety with four and a hall tons to the acre. Cambridge Kidney was next with a yield of four tons 3c wt to the aero. half of .-which comprised smitll tubers. Manhattan variety yielded 3 tons Gcwt per ncre. with a large percentnbo of marketable ]-otatoos. Tlu- Coronation ran 3J tons, mostly marketable. Brownell's Beauties yielded 3 tons 5 cwt,', with a very bad second growth, but was nevertheless a good sampl'.;. Satisfaction yielded 2 tons 6cwt: ISnrly Rose 2 tons 4cwt: Bliss's Trium ph 1} ton iK;r acre. The results of the experiments are: — Cambridge Kid ney, whole seed 2 tons 2cwt' p-er acre, cut seed 4 tons lewt per acre ; Man hattan, whole seed 1 ton lewt per acre.,. Cut seed 3 Voius 8c wt per acre. The results suggest that_ when using large seeds which contain well mat'ured eyes a better return is ob tained by cutting them into sets tlrin by using small seed with small eyes. Before planting the seeds were all dip ped is formalin solution to prevent scab, and as a result the potatoes dug show no sign of the disease. ? ' i
