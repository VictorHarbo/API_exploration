DISTRESS. TO THE EDITOR. I am, Sir, &c.;, P.B. MORONEY. Eudunda, 10th August, 1877. Sir—A Dane named Anderson died in the Adelaide Hospital last week, leaving a wife — who cannot speak one word of English — with four children in a destitute state in a tent here, where he had been employed on the railway. During his illness the family have been assisted by subscriptions from the navvies, who intend to supplement what they have done by another collection soon. This will not be sufficient. We therefore request you to call the attention of the benevolent to the case. This family landed from an emigrant ship from Germany on the 22nd of January last. The widow states that according to the rules under which they emigrated from home this Government are bound to send them back at anytime within 12 months of landing should they desire it. She begs to know, through your valuable paper, if those rules are recognised by this Government, and if she will be sent back to Denmark; also if there is a Danish Consul in South Australia, and that you would he pleased to publish this, so that the attention of any of her country people and others who maybe desirous to assist her may be thus called to her case — a very dis- tressing one indeed. [Our Government will recognise no such rule as that stated, as it forms no part of our immi- gration system. Mr. John Beck, J.P., Currie- street, is the Danish Vice-Consul.—Ed.]
