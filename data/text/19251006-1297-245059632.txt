, BUTTER IN BERLIN TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA "There Is no doubt that there Is a market In Germany not only for Aus tralian meat, but also for Australian dairy produce, especially butter," writes Mr. F. Sauer, under dato Berlin. Au gust 25. He continues: — "During the recent tropical summer weather I chanced to buy some butter, which my grocer told mo in a con fidential sort of way— as if he wore afraid of telling ipe — was Aus tralian. This butter, owing to Its con taining a low water percentage, was quite hard and stiff, whereas the Dan ish and other butter, owing to the heat, was quite soft, almost oily. The gro cer told me it was the best butter ho had over handled, and his customers were continually inquiring for it. "If Australia were to properly or ganise this butter trade it would, I feel sure, oust Danish butter, which en ters Germany in enormous quantities. But to develop business of this kind it is necossary for the Australian Gov ernment to abandon Its hostile attitude towards Germans. There is a good deal of sentiment in trade, as is proved by the fact that no patrio tic German with any feeling of self- respect will to-day buy French wines. "If you want to develop trade in Australian produce tho Australian Government must abandon its atti tude towards Germans and everything German. Australia is admitting thou sands of undesirable immigrants, and refuses admittance to Germans, the best white settlers in tho wrold, whose 15 million descendants havo so largely helped to build up the prosperity and greatness of the United States of Ame rica. Does Australia ignore tho exist ence of the flourishing German settle ments In Queensland and South Australia? Mandated German New Guinea, over which the Australian taxpayers are losing millions, is now shut up to Germans, and even Ger mans aro not admitted as purchasers, when the formerly prosperous and pro mising German plantations aro put up to auction."
