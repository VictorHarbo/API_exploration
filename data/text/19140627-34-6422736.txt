If this inflammation is not arrested it invades the passages which lead from the nose to the head, cars, throat, and Jungs. It injures the sight and hearing, destroys the sense of taste and smell, renders the "breath offensive, breaks down the affected tissues, and consumes the nasal cartilages. The discharge causes dyspepsia, also consumption. Probably 20 per cent, of the population have but one good nostril-the other is closged with catarrhal de- posit or by some weakness caused by neglected cold. This forces them, perhaps unconsciously, to breathe through the mouth, and, unless at- tended to, will result in lifelong annoyance and other serious trouble. TREATMENT WITH "0Z0NIA" restores the organ to its normal condition, and enables it to perform its functions properly. Hay Fever may be known by its violent fits ot sneez- ing. 1/6 0Z0NIA m gives instant relief, and is a'quick and easy way of curing Kosai Catarrh, Hay Fever, Irritated and Sore Throat, Earache, Noises in the Head, and Ear, Discharges from the Ear.

The prestige of these famous Engines is ever Increasing, and we are continually receiving orders, many of tbem being repeat orders, from ?li parts of the Commonwealth and South Sea Islands. These Engines are built for hard work, and the construction is so simple and the work- ing parts are so easily accessible that the merest novice has no difficulty in obtaining every satis- faction from the running of the Engines. The fittings on the Marine Patterns are nickel-plated. Mr. SID. ROBINSON, Halifax, N.Q., writes: "Mt two engines (a pair of 4-h.p.) run lovely. It is a treat to ask them to run a couple of hundred miles. They run like dockwork. The more one sees of these engines the more one can appreciate being the owner of a 'Frisco STAN- DARD ENGINE."
