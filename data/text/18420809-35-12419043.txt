LATER ENGLISH NEWS. THE ship Susan from Plymouth, April 24, having arrived at Hobart Town, pre- vious to the sailing of the Waterlily, we have received our files of London papers to the 22nd, two days later than those which had previously come to hand. In the House of Lords, on the 21st April, the Corn Bill was passed through the committee in two hours and a-half. Earl STANHOPE opposed the bill ; and is doing so made a warm attack on Sir Ro- rert PEEL and the Government ; who, he contended, had giossly deceived the agri- cultural interest, which had placed them in power. The Earl spoke at great length ; and concluded by moving that the bill be read a second time that day six months. Earl HARDWICKE declared his perfect conviction that the bill did not touch the substantial protection which the farmer enjoyed, while it satisfied the people by modifying a law on which the country had expressed an irresistible opinion. The Duke of BUCKINGHAM viewed the bill with feelings of the deepest alarm, The Earl of WINCHELSEA supported it as a " final settlement" of a question which had dangerously agitated the country. Lord WESTERN saw no- thing final in it, brought forward, as it had been, by a Ministry from whom different things had been ex- pected. Similar opinions as to the instability and temporary nature of the Bill were expressed in the course of the evening, by Lord BROUGHAM, Earl FITZ- WILLIAM, and Lord MELBOURNE ; who all treated it, however, as a step in the right direction. But Lord Brougham proposed, as an amendment on Earl STANHOPE'S, that it was not expedient to lay a duty on the importation of foreign corn. The other speakers were Lord FITZGERALD, who vindicated the Govern- ment ; and Lord BEAUMONT, who ex- pressed his alarm not only at the Corn- importation Bill, but at the reductions and alterations of the new Tariff. The House then divided, and the numbers were— For Lord Brougham's amendment 5 Against it. . . . . 109 For Lord Stanhope's . . . 17 Against it . . . . . 119 Mr. SHARMAN CRAWFORD brought forward his motion for extending the suf- frage, and pledging the House to adopt what is known as the " five points" of the Chartists. Several of the Liberal mem- bers energetically opposed the motion. Sir JAMES GRAHAM opposed it, because to adopt it would destroy the peerage. Sir ROBERT PEEL and Lord STANLEY took the same view as Sir JAMES GRA- HAM. The House was occupied with this subject during the whole evening, and on a division the numbers were 226 to 67. the motion being lost by a majority of 159. Two Theological Professorships have been recently instituted by the Crown in the University of Oxford, and a temporary endowment of the Professors, until canon- ries of Christ Church shall fall vacant, to be permanently attached to the Professor- ships, has been provided by the Uni- versity. It is said that Sir ROBERT PEEL has presented the Professorship of Eccle- siastical History to the Rev. Mr. HUSSEY, of Christ Church, late Censor of this col- lege; and the Professorship of Pastoral Theology to the Rev. Mr. OGILVIE, of Balliol College, rector of Ross. The Marquis of BUTE is to be appointed Her Majesty's Commissioner to the Gene- ral Assembly of the Church of Scotland. As every thing uttered by Lord STAN- LEY is important, we quote the following remarks made by his Lordship in the House of Commons, on the 21st April : In answer to a question from Mr. Mangles, Lord Stanley said, that he had been misunder- stood in a portion of the answer which he had given to the honourable member for Renfrew, on Tuesday evening, on the subject of the comparative advantages which our colonies afforded to emigrants. What he had intended to say was, that with regard to New Zealand he could not speak with the same confidence as to the present prospects of emigrants, but that he believed that at the government set- tlement of Auckland there vas a considerable demand for labour. He had stated that there was a sum of £12,000 in the hands of govern- ment, available for the assisance of emigrants to New Zealand, and that he believed thal the settlement offered a fair immediate prospect for labourer. He had said that he could not speak positively as to the settlements of the New Zealand Company, as, of course, they were the best judges of what proportion the import of labour ought to bear to the capital of the colony, He had intended to state that he had understood that at Port Nicholson wages were to a certain extent falling, and that a considerable number of persons were employed on the public works. The following report of the state of the money market, is taken from the Morning Chronicle, of the 22nd April :— Spanish Active Bonds, 21¾ to ½ ; Deferred 12 5/8 to 5/8 ; Passive, 4¾ to 5; New Three per Cents.

After the above was in type, we received files of London papers to the 27th April, which came to Sydney by the Marian Watson,—the Isabella Watson, with con- victs from Dublin, May 2nd, having arrived at Hobart Town, and we were obliged by Mr. EGAN with a Dublin paper of the 30th April. The Corn Law Bill was read a third time in the House of Lords, on the 23rd April, and passed. The income-tax was in committee, which would occupy some considerable time, as the opposition divide the House on almost every clause. Among the appointments announced in the Gazette, are Mr. MEREWETHER, to be Immigration Agent at Sydney ; and Mr. PINNOCK, to be Deputy Registrar at Port Phillip. On the 28th April, Mr. CHRISTOPHER presented a petition from Port Phillip, praying for the establishment of a Court to try civil causes. This must be a mis- take, as the Supreme Court at Port Phillip was established by an Act of the Legis- lative Council, passed in 1840. At a Court of Directors, held on the 27th April, the MARQUIS OF TWEEDDALE was sworn in as Governor of Madras, and SIR G. ARTHUR as Governor of Bombay. In the evening there was a grand dinner, when some high compliments were be- stowed on SIR GEORGE'S important services " in both the eastern and western hemisphere." The PRESIDENT of the United States, in a message to Congress, proposed to borrow twenty millions of dollars. The finances of the Government were in a very bad state. We subjoin the state of the Money Market, from the Times, April 27. TUESDAY EVENING.—The premium on gold at Paris is 10 per mille, which, at the English Mint price of £3 17s. 10½d. per ounce for standard gold, gives an exchange of 25.40½, and the exchange at Paris on London at short being 26.62½, it follows that gold is 0.88 per cent, dearer in London than in Paris. By advices from Hamburgh the price of gold is 434 per mark, which, at the English Mint price of£3 17s. 10½d. per ounce, gives an exchange of 13.9½, and the exchange at Hamburgh on London at short boing 13.1 ½, it follows that gold is 0.92 per cent, dearer in London than in Hamburgh. The course of exchange at New York on London is 107 per cent., and the par of ex- change hctween England and America being 109 23-40 per cent., it follows that the exchange is 2.57 per cent. against England. But the quoted exchange at New York being for bills at 60 days' sight, the interest must be de- ducted from the above difference. The English funds continue to advance with every prospect of permanent buoyancy, there being more money than stock in the market. The jobbers strong buyers, the de- mand for actual investment being still on the increase. With the news from Paris, the ad- vice of the demise of M. Human was received, but it created no sensation here. Consols for money closed 92¾ to ½, and for the account, 92½ to ¾ ; Three per Cents. Reduced, 91½ ; Three-and-a-Half per Cents. Reduced, 100½ to ¾ ; New Three-and-a-half per Cents,, 101¾ ; Long Annnities, 12 11-16; India Bonds, 20s. to 21s. premium; Bank Stock, 166 to 167; India Stock, 245 to 247; and Exchequer-bills, 38s, to 40s. premium. In foreign stocks business was limited, but prices underwent little alteration, although in all respects they appeared to be a trifle firmer. Spanish Actives closed 2 li to | ; Ditto, New, 24¾ to a; Portuguese Five per Cents., 37¾ to 38¼ ; Mexican, 31½ to ¾ ; Dutch Two-and-a Half per Cents., 52 7/8 to 53 ½ ; Ditto Five per Cents., 100¾ to 101¼; Colombian, 26¾ to 7/8 ; Brazilian, 67½ to 68½ ; and Belgian, 103½ to 104½.
