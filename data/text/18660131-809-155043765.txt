But especial attention is called j- to tho moro important fact that SINGER'S MA- ' CHINES make the TRUE LOCK STITCH, which is Z oxactly alike on both sidos of tho fabric, and ono that J. positively will not ravel ; that they do not make a ^ ridgo on one sido of the material sewod, as do all _ CHAIN STITCH MACHINES ; that they do not uso one-tlurd as much cotton or sewing material as do all CHAIN STITCH MACHINES ; that they will not 3 ravel when ono e*d of a seam is started, as will all .. Chain Stitch seams. And further that Singer's Ma- £ chines do not uso a curved needle and circular motion. t On the contrary, SINGER'S NEEDLES aro straight t and tho motion perpendicular, henco thoy will stitch E through a very great thickness, and sew across seams, _ which would provs instant destruction to a curved or £ bent needle. _ r For a confirmation of our assertions wo would re- j spectfully refer to the manufacturing establishments q of Messrs Sargood, King & Sargood, Messrs Harris ^ is Heymanson, Messrs Solcsberg & Son, Monster s Clothing Company ; Mr Skinner's Crinoline Manu- a factory, and to all othor largo manufacturing houses both in Victoria and tho other Australian colonies, s and to the thousands of families who havo Singer's _ Machines in daily use.
