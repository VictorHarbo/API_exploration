ARRIVAL OF THE ENGLISH MAIL. The arrival of the R. M. S. S. Nuba, which anchored in Hobson's Bay at half- past 11 o'clock last night, places us in possession of our London correspond- ence and files. The following are the letters of our correspondents and the extracts we make from our files:- NOTES OF THE MONTH. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, Oct 2. Seldom in my recollection has there been a drearier September or a sillier season than that through which we have passed. Never have the newspapers been so severely exer- cised to keep up their title for there has been no news and nothing has happened. There has not even been a pilgrimage to keep up our spirits and but for cases of wife-beating and railway accidents there would have been nothing to read. The usual devices which at this time of the year are resorted to by the gentlemen of the press to fill their columns have shown by their tenuity and barrenness the desperate nature of the situation. In vain have the public been challenged to take an interest in the great question of secondhand liveries in relation to tailors morality. In vain have perplexed Protestants put long questions in Roman Catholic drawing in- genious replies. That the question of re- ligion should be started by newspaper corre- spondents and articles of faith allowed to be discussed is a proof of the extreme destitution to which we have been reduced. A good use has been made of " Immigration to a Free Country," and the letters which have appeared on this subject as well as certain leading articles have been perhaps not the least entertainment we have had during the season. You will observe that there is a great desire on the part of certain ad- venturous spirits in this country to know where there is a land of free- dom where living is cheap and there is no winter where salubrity can be combined with a regard for gentility and high wages with the diversions of the field. In fact there are people who advertise for a new colony in the London papers precisely as they would for a good plain cook or a gentlemanly residence. Just as she is required to have a knowledge of jollies and it a pleasant south west aspect upon gravel soil with a truly Protestant church and a medical man in the neighbourhood so a long list of advantages is demanded of the free country without which no colony need apply. The otherday an ingenuoua inquirer in the Standard was "anxious to know" whether there were in London any respectable per- sons who had ever been in Victoria. The man had probably been visiting the general agency or attending a course of Australian exhibitions. There is nothing too absurd to be written or to be asked about a colony in this country and it is astonishing con- sidering how many people must have brothers and cousins and Australia to find the gross ignorance which prevails at home with respect to your condition and your affairs. Taking advantage of this The Tîmes steadily devotes itself to proving how dangerous it is for any man to attempt to leave the shores of his native country where there are workhouses and every other comfort for the poor in search of fortune abroad. On this question of course The Times, whether it affects ignorance or not is simply the mouthpiece of the commercial community and the employer class who would rather see work- ingmen remain at home so that wages may bo kept down In this patriotic puri oBO it is not a httlo assisted by ex colonists such as Mr Iuchard Schlesingor who oljccts to thopeoploof Victoria spending then money on immigration to flood the local labour market and to destroy the pros peels of the working classes already there I Ins is the ago of congresses and one great resomcc of tho season has been the cluo niclnife of their discussions There have been congresses on all Borts of questions treat and small-a congress on the usages of war and a congress on yarns not canauh but twisted cottons-a congress on inter national law and a poet.il congress-a con Bress of Orientalists and a congress of the Social Science Association Ev. erybody wants to congress with somebody else There is a sort of craving for association-a vj mania for speculatin0 in moral joint Btocl crj The result as in commerce is not altogether favourable to legitimate business -Moral stock is raised far abovo its leal value and goodness and knowledge bulled to a perilous extent The mixturo of many common places cannot make anything else than common place, and in vam is it sought to enhance the import ince of wares m trniBically worthless by bringing thom together in a heap and advertising their agglomeiation Congresses aro usually made up of fiiBsy porsons who unable to lind any othei audience are content to liston to each other Sometimes thoy do good but it is in spite of themselves by letting us see what are the bounds of then knowledgo or their ambition 'When tho congress sits upon questions not roduciblo to positivo science or which depend on other than abstract considerations the members generally make asses of themselves as when the Brussels Congress tried to for- mulate patnotism and to limit the powers of resistance in the case of an invaded countr. Tho only useful congress I ever beard of is tho congress on yarn In these at least there is something to untwist as well na to bind But though you may fix a measuie oi a weight on cotton yarns what are you to do with tho terrible jams spun by a Social Scienco Association ' 'N hat is social Bcienco is a point hitherto undetermined Its domain judged by its denomination should bo as vast as the provmco of Juvenal s verso QHulquul anunl liomin The science of Bocietj should indeed bo an important ono but what are its axioms and its postulates from what do wo start and whither do wo go ?

So far as it is Bcionco at all, it is an exact and posi tivo science So far as it is "social, it is humbug, if not quaokor. Thoro is indeed, a kind of social scienco dealing with the phenomena of mans life npon earth, and going to the root of society tntt this is prooiselv what congresses in variably shirk. The philosophy of the rola. tionof the aeree, for instance, is a legitimate subject foi social science, bat we can imagine the consternation with which a proposal to read a paper on the subject would be receivedl by the philosophers meeting in the good town of Glasgow. They prefer to have empty discussions on strikes, which in variably end by everybody retaining his own opinion, and which can never be decided on general principles, or discussions on educa- tion, on which everyone ia agreed, but which are not scientific at all Mr Disraeli is ill with gout and bronchitis, nnd cannot go to Ireland, and Mr Gladstone has been delivered of a pamphlet on Ritual ism, and need never go to Ireland any more The disorder in both cases is of an aggra- vated form, and at the age of tho respective patients is serious Mr Disraeli may re- cover, but the other case is almost hopeless 1 or some time past Mr Glad tone has been believed by many of his enemies to cheriBh a Bneaking regard for Popery It was certain that he was High Church in belief, and in the minds of a great rainy Englishmen High Churchism is only Popery writ large In order to justify himself, or for what other purpose IleaAen only knows, Mr Gladstone has contributed an article to this months Conicmvorary Review, setting forth the rea sons of his faith in ltitualism Perhaps it would be more correct to say that he defends the piactice of a ritual and endeavours to lay down the limits within winch it may be safely allowed Ritualism according to him is the vice of ritual-winch is an attempt to give warmth and colour to religious observances to introduce art into the ceremonial of the church A very eloquent and ingenious though somewhat far fetched, analogy is drawn between ritual and tho elotlnng and the fringe which men aroaccus tomed to give to civil ceiemonies In fact, ritual is s ad to bo to the clergy what court diCBSes are to the court the wig and the gown to the judge the uniform to the soldiei-a language and a symbol, which go down through all classes, and finds its ulti mate expression m the " bands and badges of the foresters " Ritualism, on the other hand, is defined as the "unwiBe and undis uplmed reaction from poverty, from cold ness, from barrenness, from nakedness, the attempted substitution of the secondary for the primary ann and the real failure and paralysis of both ' To distinguish be tw een what is allow able and safe, and what is unlawful and dangeious m religious practice Mr Gladstone gives ub Six Rules , but, unfortunately these are of the vagues' kind, and clothed in that language, ' less than pencil, ' winch Mr Gladstone so much affects, and which has been the rum of all Ins new rules The substance of his apology for Ritual l8 that it is not introduced as an aid to devotion As for Ritu- alism, it is an undue disposition to ritual,' only, therefore, the love of esthetics earned too far Mr Gladstone himself is evidently not quite satisfied with this dis tinction for he admits, which is ttio « ux of tho whole question, that ' an important connexion is to be traced to a consider able extent between High Ritual and High Doctrine in the Church of England ' This Romanising tendency Mr Gladstone strongly condemns, and m language too emphatic to permit us to doubt of his sincerity But it will seem to most of his readers that lie has not satisfied the public as to the main point connected with the question of RitualiBm That question, is not whether Ritualism does or does not leid to Rome, but whether it is not itself sacerdotal ism in a form quite as dangerous as Romanism and almost renders the adoption of the contemned denomination quite un necessary It does not matter Avhat name the Ritualists adopt so long as their practices cieate m the English Church tho same sys tem of priestly domination as m the Church of Rome Now that high doctrine and high ntual netrly alwajs go together, is precisely Avhat ia said by the anti ritualists and to them Mr. Gladstone s treatise is a very insufticient answer It is not complained that there is too much art in ritualism-that there ia too much that is merely beautiful, and which appeals to tho senses AVhat is complained of is that such ni tas is used very paltr^ m its kind, is dia tmctly intended to symbolise doctrine -that nearly all the vcBtment, the genuflexion, and the mummery business, ia designed to convey externally the belief in tliedoctnne of Transubstantiation-adoctrine which is of the \ ery essenco of sacerdotalism, and which, rightly or wronglv was rejected at the Reformation and cannotbe lawfully held by the Church of England if it is a Protestant Church I need not go farther into a question which is not only religious, but political, ard which promise to be of very great im portance in the -voild before long So far as Mr Gladstone is concerned, I cannot think thathe has been judicious m this publication It will please neither party m the country. It has deeply offended the Romanists, who had socret hopea founded on the character of his policy, of the ox Premiei It has alarmed and roused the suspicions of the great majority of the Eng- lish Church who, in spite of all wo may say, iro Protestants, to the full extent of that unfashionable word. The article in the Contemporary Renew is certainly not meant to be a defence of Ritualism, and m its general tone is highly commendable But it is equally certain that a very large number of timid Englishmen, Liberals m opinion will bo from this time moro than evor estranged from their late leader With reference to the very general scandals which havo been afloat respecting the Prince of AAales's debts, The Times had a leading articlo yesterday which will tend greatly to re assure the public and to increase our loyalty It had been asserted in a paper called tho World, supposed to be edited by tho notorious Granville Murray, that the Punco of Wales s debts, amounting to £000 000-that repeated applications had been mado to succcbsivo Ministers for a grant towards thoir liquidation, and that in order to avoid the unpleasantness which would ne- cessarily ensue from tho subject being brought beforo Parliament the Queen had come for- ward and paid oil her son s obligations out of her private purse This attractive story is now declared to be baseless, except m so far as that the Prmco's income not equal to his expenditure Thero are no debts however, of any consequonce The Princos accountB havo been always duly audited by lim treasurer, and are in porfect order. Ho has an income of £100,000 a year from all sources, and m order to discharge the quasi Royal functions with which ho has been for Bomo years invested, he has been compelled to mcui extraordinary expenses But it is not true that ho has over contemplated nsl ing Paihament to pay his debts, or that the Queen has oflered to liqui- date them Theoxcees of expenditure over income has been made good, so far as I can understand, out of tho sales of the pro- perty belonging to the Duchy of Corn wall, which, as The íí'tmcs describes it as "capital," and not income, I presumo means that the Punce has boon obliged to spend w hat ho ought to Iwa o kept. After thia explanation the affair of course assumes quite another aspect, If the Pnnco of Wales's mcomo will not onablo him to koop the state necessary to him while ho re- presents Royalty, it ought to bo sup ¡demented ; and there aro very few m this country who will grudge him the extra sum required. So long as wo havo a monarchy and exact duties from princes, 80 long w o aro bound to pay for them , and it does not becomo a great nation hlco England to be niggardly in this matter. An income of £100,000 a year is, in theso times, cer- tainly not sufficient foi a Prince of Wales who has to perform the part of a king It is exceeded by the incomea of many noble mon,1 and oven commoners, coal ownore, contractors, and soft goods men Thero is nothing new in the European situ, afion In Franco the Republicans and the Imperialists continue their competition. The only fresh sign of the day is a tendency of all the Monarchists to mtvko common cause against the Republic In Spain the two sides are always gain.ng astonishing vic- tories over each other, and killing a great many Spaniards, and destroying mach Spanish property , but the solution ia as far off as ever The Carlista have heon domg their best to drag Bismarck into an inter- vention, bat that old bird is not to be caught. A correspondence between Don Carlos and the RusBian Emperor has afforded subject to the Trench journalists, ever ready for a sign cn the horizon which may promise the much, desired advent of the . eianche HISTOIU OF THE MONTH (from OUR OWN COUItI.srO_.DE,.T ) LONDON, Ocr 2 DENMARK AND GERMANY V\ e have fallen upon times of comparative quietude Such times aie often the intervals of wholesome progress, but wo have no social barometei to which to apply foi a sure test It is the season of political rest, and of the small talk that makes it pleasant, and of the larger speculations in which men are .pt to indulge when relie\ ed from the heavier pres- sure of routine The crimes of violence which disfigure our newspapers are still their most sensational reading, and disturb our serener reflections with the thought that the laces of dangerous wild animals are not yet extinct among us The only disquieting amour in Europe relates to iho lelationa between Germany and Denmark, for affairs in Spain continue m their ordinary state of nnai chj and the last hope of foreign interven- tion is fading out at Madrid The letter of the Czar to Don Carlos though its contents are still doubtful, appears to have been a reality, but it ib now said to have been written m answer to one from Don Callos thanking 11 ib Majesty for not recognising the Serrano Government, while the action of the C^ar in that matter is explained as dictated solely bj a desire not to interfere in the internal affau s of Spam Thus our Spanish news goes round the compass In like manner we heard the othei day that the Carlista having attacked the position of General Moñones, had been repulsed after four daya hard fight mg but tins morning contiadictory ac counts report that it was the Republicans who w ci L obliged to fall back The policy, however, ascribed to Prince Bismarck in relation to Denmark would havo far more serious lBBuea than any complications in the south, and must necessarily aiouse the jealousies of RuBBia aa handing over to Gei many the key of the Baltic The Vienna Tagespi essc reiterates the story, and asserts that the pioject for bringing Denmark into the German confederation dates so far back as 18C7, and that more recent proposals comprising a íetrocession of the whole of Schleswig have íeally been made A state- ment from St Petersburg comfirms this account Although much questioned, it has not jet been authoritatively denied, and thoBe who most suspect Prince Bismarck of aggressive schemes, hear with uneasiness that the Tederal Government is still devising fresh means of defence It is understood that a bill ia now in preparation providing for the embodiment in time of vv ar of all able bodied men no longer included in the line, the Reseñe or the Landwehr and that this separate force is to bo called the Land simm. While 1 raneo is steadily recruiting hei strength, Russia in spite of the difficul ties encountered in the new conscription is also ev erj month becoming a more formidable neighbour, and the new measure ia probably designed as another wall of defence on cithei hand The whole breadth of Europe is thus becoming one ^astcamp, created in the in- terests of peace, and every whispei of move ment or of new combinations, at once ex cites alarm The Berlin papers reply to the criticisms which havo been evoked by the revival of this Danish question, that the treaty was concluded between Austria and Piussia and defend the attitude of their Government in its non fulfilment, by an appeal to the difficulties of the case, making even the text of the treaty some justification for delay They make light of the expulsion of a few troublesome Danes from Schleswig and do not take into account the actual hard ships of the Danish speaking population The present state of affairs is perhaps best explained by the admission of Geimany, that the stipulation so long disregarded waa the result of unwelcome pressure when Napo- leon waa a power in Europe and gave his in- fluence to Austria OLD CATHOLIC SCHEMES Or RE. UNION If congresses, and the interchange of opinion winch they imply, are a sign of ad \ancing civilisation, old Europe is making progress The last month baa been fruitful in conferences of many kinds Tirst m im. portance, perhaps, was the Old Catholic Congress, which met at Trieburg, and which was characterised by strong nationality of feeling. Its discussions were free and vigor ous perhaps the moto so that the Old Catholics baie now their synod, and the con grees therefore, is not fettered by the reapon sibihties of a legislative assembly. The poBition which they now take up is signifi- cantly shown by their demand for a îehgious census They are no longer content to allow the great body of the indifferent to be reckoned as nominal adherents of the Ultra montane doctrine, they would not only com 1 el their opponents to make good their giound, but to renumber their forces and they urge that it is the duty of the state to step in, and ask ev ery man officially whether he accepts the decree of tho Vatican Council and m default of such adhesion that he should be held to be an old Catho he Such a proposal maj appear to out siders chimerical, but it indicates the changed relationship of parties, and they say they are not afraid to abide the inquiry, which would multiply largely the 100 000 adherents whom they now claim, from the 14,000 000 of Ultramontanism A greater interest attaches however, in this country to a conference which was held, after the dispersal of the congress at Bonn, under the presidency of Dr Dollingor with the object ol framing some baais of reunion for the churches of Christendom The Anglican Church was represented by men of different Bchools- the bishop of V inchester, Dean Howson, Canon Lid- don and others Trom America ramo 'he Bishop of Pittsburgh and other Episco palians Ihe Eastern Church was repre sented by conspicuoua men from St Peters burgh, Moscow, Athens, and other places 'I here w ero also present several delegates of German Protestants threo pastors from Den mark and the Abbe Michaud, as an old Catholic from 1 ranee In all there were moio than CO names inscribed on tho lists , but the attendance was much larger Dr Dolhnger who spoko English with ease piovednmdmirable president and showed that he thoroughly understood tho difficulties of tho task to which he had addressed him- self. The warmest debate related to a question of interest only to theologians , but which it was necessary to settle before the members of the 1 astern Church would enter into the negotia- tions As ia well known tho groat difficulty between the churches of the east and the west relates to "the Procession of the noly Spirit " and the addition of the J ilwflite to the Nicene Creed A declaration was first submitted to the effect that the way in which this woid was inserted waa illegal, and that with a view to peace and amity, the original foi m of the creed should bo re- stored But this declaration did not satisfy the eastern theologians and only after pro. tracted debate and reconsideration in com nuttee could they be bl ought to any conclu- sion linallj, all parties atreed that it wa dcBirable tho whole church should set itself senouslj to consider whether the creed could be restored to its primitive form, " without sacufice of anj true doctrine which is ex piessed in the western form " A more import- ant series of articles was presented by Dr. Dolhnger, with the purpose ot meet- ing Anglican objections to the Roman doctrines Tho chief of thom affirmed that the reading of the noly Scrip turo in the vulgar tongue cannot lawfully be foi bidden , that, in general, it is moro fitting the Murty should bo in the tongue under- stood by the people, "that faith working by love, not faith without love, is the means and condition of man's justification bofore God ' and other points the moro enumera- tion of w Inch w outd carry mo into the regions of controversial theology A subsoquont paper was directed against the excesses of modern Roman Catholic doctrino and re jected the Immaculate Conception Touch- ing confession, it was affirmed that the prac tico had como down from tho primitive church, and that " purged from abusoB and freed from constraint, it should be pre- sen ed." The declaration on the Eucharist which was subsequently adopted, I may give entire as relating to the central questions of ecclesiastical interest, and ascharactonstic of the general tcnourandaimof the conference It ran as follows -"The Eucharistie celebration in the Church is not a con- tinuous repetition or renewal of the propitiatory sacrifice offered once for ever lv_ Christ upon the cross, but ita sa cnficml character consista m this-that it is the permanent memorial of it, and re- presentation and presentation on earth of the one oblation of Christ for the salvation of redeemed mankind which according to the Epistle to the Hebrews is continuously presented m Heaven by Christ who now appears in the presence of God for us While tins is the character of the J' ucbarist in re ference to the sacrifice of Christ, it is also a sacred fcust wherein the faithful recoiving the body and blood of our Lord have com inumou one with another ' Readers will pardon the theological language, which may seem out of place in these columns, but which, by ita carefully guarded words, best re- presents both the spirit and the possibilities of this new movement The members of the Conference when they repeated together the Te Demn at it« clone believed that they had taken a step which might lead to larger results of hiotherly intercommunion It was an honest attempt to subordinate differences by mutual concession, and to formulate articles m which the membeis of divers churcheB might agree, but the main en deavoui waa to find words which concealed differences rather than removed them and the fatal weakness of all such compromises still remains The re union of Christendom is a dream worthy of Dr D Dinger, and the boldest of our religious reformers but what is wanted is not so much the discussion of theological subtleties as united action against the evil and corrupt practices which infe3t the church as well as the world CONGRESS oFÖRILNTALISrS The Orientalists, who met last year ni Pans, assembled this last month in London It was their second congress and those who took part m it had a week of unalloyed intellectual and social enjoyment Dr Birch, the keeper of the Oriental antiquities at the British Museum gave the opening address, on the Monday, at the Royal Institution The point of widest practical inteiest upon wbie.li he touched was the importance of adopting a uniform system of transliteration Ho referred also to the attempts made to introduce a means of universal communica tion by cyphers " This system has been for some time in uBe in the West, and diffeient ways have been proposed to arrive at the result One is the moda of communicating by signals, consisting of numbers, at sea Certain sentences of general use are numhpred and translated into the different European languages The flag which carries the number speaks the same sentence, when hoisted, to vessels of all other nationalities, injfact the number is an universal medium of maritime communica tion A ilag w ith a few numbers asks a ques tion, another with fewer or more gives the answer Now, this douce contains the ele- ments of an universal language, limited in- deed to a few stereotyped sentences such as are generally wanted inmantime intercourse A modification of this system has been adopted for the purposes of commerce, for the Transatlantic and other telegiaphs to supersede the necessity of long and continuous messages which would take too much time and trouble in transmission It evident that when dictionaries on this principle shall have been compiled it will be Eossible for a limited communication to be eld in writing with Orientals of whose language the European is ignorant, in the same manner as by maritime signals It is a step towards universal language and, although a feoble one, prolnbly the only stop which will evei bo mado " The next day there was.i re ception in the morning at the British Museum, and in the afternoon Sir Henry Rawlins and Professor Oppert opened the discussion of Assyrian antiquities On the Wednesday Sir Bartle and Lady lrere entertained the members at their house, on Wimbledon com mon, later in the day Dr Hooker re ceived them at Ken gardens and in the evening another of the sections met when various papers were read notably one by the Rev E Edkins, of Pekin, on the state of the Chinese language at the time of the in ventionof writing who gave it as his con- viction that "the intuitive origin of moral ideas is decidedly favoured by the Clnneao etymology of words having a moral meaning and that the Darwinian method of account ing for men s notions of morality would gain no support from the Chinese language On the Thursday there were receptions at the Soane Museum, at the library of the India Office, and at the Museum, and at night Professor Max Muller addressed the Aryan section Ile is one of the most eloquent of scientific men, at a time when science is gifted with not a few brilliant expositors His address runs in channels too deep and among topics to re condite, for the ordinary reader but ho hi ought out into clear relief the influence which oriental thought is now exercising in our own schools of learning and on our literature He introduced his themes by a reference to to the danger which beset seien tifie w orle at present from extreme speciali j sation and to tho intellectual giants of [ earlier days who ' carried a weight of know« ledce far too heavy for the shoulders of such mortals as now be " Their chief strength "consisted m this, that they woro never

tho discussion of tho knotty points raised by tho Washington treaty, and the recent congress atBrussels, with other cognate subjects Dr Bluntschli, who had taken part in the deliberations at Brussels, said that all the declarations adopted at the congress were a modification of tho force of tho great military powers, in order to mode rate as far as possible tho cruelties of war, w ithout fettering
