This company is being formed to acquire and work that valuable and favorably situated gold mining lease, No. 888, at Broad Arrow, 45 miles from the township of Cool- gardle, consisting of 25 n., aud locally known as tho " Norrin Nerrin " property. The vendors have spent a considerable amount of money in prospecting the property, and, as a result, have proved tho existence of a highly payable reef run ning right through the lease. Three shafts in ail have been sunk: the main shaft at 75 feet has cutn strong reef (3 feet in width) showiug splendid gold— this reef is also to bo seen in a 60 foot shaft further south ; and in an underlay shaft 40 feet still further south has also bceu cut at a depth of 40 feet, showing a similar sized reof, The work of development shows it to be a sound and valuablo mine, only requiring the provision of the neces sary plant to make it highly remunerative ; aud, in order to raise the uecessary capital for this, the property is now placed on the market. Timber for all purposes can be obtained In abundance close to the reef. As an evidence of their belief in the uiine, tho vendors have agreed to subscribe for 4000 of the contributing , shares on the surne terms ns other applicants. Bulk assays have been made at Buyley's Reward ralno and also at Footscrny of stone taken from tbo property, and highly payable results have been obtained, proving the stone to be exceptionally rich. It is estimated that there are 40 tons of good payable stoue at grass, part ot which was sent to bo crushed nt Parker's and Bayley'a Reward. Copies of nsBay tickets nre given hcrowith. A copy of Mr. John Hartley's report on the mine is appended, and further information can ho obtained from tno company s uroker, Mr. D. Nnsnuth, 92 Queen-street, Melbourne, who Is now receiving applications for shares. If no allotment, the application moneys will bo returned iu full ; iu tho caso of allotted shares, when the allotment money is not paid within seven days of allotment, tho allotment may bo c&ucellcd; nnd tho application deposit forfeited to the compaoy. . .

I have much pleasure in reporting on your nunc. The vertical shaft (main shaft) is down 74 feet 6 iuclies, nnd has cut through the lodo. A drive has been extended cast 10 feet, showing quartz lenders and more stono run ning in that direction ; the reef lias also been cut at tho 42 feet level (this is 69 feet deep in the underlay). Tho stone Is looking very well. The reef is a littlo over 3 feet wido. It iB a healthy, strong reef nt both levels, and, I firmly beliovc, will continue to make down. It is dark brown In color, so does not show its gold as freely ns the lighter stone, yet we can sec splendid gold. (Signed) JOHN BARTLEY.
