In accordance with the provisions of our constitution, Dr. Evans had to go back to his constituents, in consequence of his acceptance of a new office. He was re-elected by a large majority, only attraction of the constituency, however, polling. This election was attended by some remarkable incidents. It will be remembered that the " plan " of a land Bill prepared by Mr. O'Shanassy, was considered by many persons as too indefinite to give any positive clue to the Ministerial intentions. The members of the Convention pronounced it unsatisfactory on this ground. Its main features were, free selection within certain prescribed areas, and the cessation of the present squatting tenure, at a date to be fixed by Parliament. It was asked, what guarantee does the explanation give that the agricultural areas spoken of shall be coextensive with the popular demand for sites for settlement? It was asked further what date does Government intend to propose to Parliament for the termination of the squatters' preferential, occupancy ? And further how is it proposed to deal with the public lands after the pastoral licences have been cancelled? On these points Dr. Evans was pressed at Richmond, and gave his written adhesion to an interpreta- tion of the Ministerial scheme, which does not certainly appear on the face of it, nor could be fairly inferred from it. in fact, Dr. Evans the Minister of Lands and Survey at the time pledged himself, with some slight reservations, to Convention principles, and in so doing is understood to have pledged the Ministry. He said the present system of pastoral occupancy, it was intended should cease at the termination of two years and a half from the present time, at which date the squatters 14-year leases would have run out, and they been issued, as was at one time contemplated that the agricultural areas to be thrown open to selection will be of ample extent to meet any present demands; that the interval between this and the end of the year 1861 will be occupied in making a geodetic survey of the colony and that this and the squatters' term being completed simultaneously, he was in favor of then throwing open the whole area of the colony to free selection and free commonage. The only points in which this proposal falls short of the Convention programme is, in insisting on survey before selection, in requiring cash payment for lands purchased, and in limiting the right of free commonage until 1861. It remains to he seen how far this explanation of the Government plan will conciliate the support or stimulate the opposition of those whose assent to it is a constitutional necessity in order to its becoming law. Its popular effect will probably be "one favorable to the Ministry. But a very strong feeling of disapproval has been created by the manner in which the explanation was extorted from Dr. Evans, rather than volunteered by him. The plan originally promulgated being deemed unsatisfactory, a candidate on strict " Convention principles" was found in the person of Dr. Mackay, a barrister. Dr. Mackay was proposed on the hustings, but during the interval between the nomination and the poll a party of Dr. Mackay's supporters waited on Dr. Evans, and elicited statements from him in the direction of Conven- tion views, which went very much further than the sentiments he was reported to have declared on the hustings. In consequence of this adhesion to Convention principles, a question was raised whether Dr. Mackay should proceed with his candidature, but being submitted to a public meeting, it was decided in the affirmative. Many felt that he had been treated without eithorgenorosity or honor in being first urged to come forward, and then abandoned, bccaiisonis antagonist bud bid up to him. And many others felt that Dr. Evans had acted a weak and unworthy part in buying off an opposition that threatened to be formidable by an almost unconditional surrender to the terms the opposition exacted from him. We are looking forward to the election, under the new Act increasing the number of members of the Assembly ; but owing to a hitch in the registration it is probable that those will be deferred for some two or three months. The Registration Act is so clumsily worded that a doubt exists as to the "residence" requisite to enrolment. The Attorney-General and the Chief Justice are said to have called that in the annual registration the residence must date from two months anterior to the commencement of the year. Provision is made for a supplementary registration every quarter, and thus all persons having resided in their districts for two months prior to the 1st day of April, July, and October, are entitled to have their names enrolled. The registration now being effected is the primary or annual one and as it takes place in April, the residence of required to qualify is a five months' one. This will have the effect of disqualifying many persons entitled to vote according to the obvious intention of the law. It is expected that this difficulty will be obviated by a delay in the elections, so as to allow the Pint supplementary or quarterly registration to come into operation. If this is done, we may not expect the general election to take place till the month of August. In the meantime, the Government will, of course, remain in undisturbed possession of power. THE GOLD-FIELDS. No changes of importance have occurred on the gold-fields since the date of our last Summary. Two of the three great rushes are fully answering the expectations then formed of them, while the third is not turning out so well. There is a very large population at the Back Creek, near Amherst in fact, the largest that has collected in one spot for a long time past, and the gold there must be very rich; but only a small proportion of the miners on the ground have any chance of drawing prizes, or indeed of getting any share of the gold which is obtained by the lucky few on the lead, while the outsiders, after waiting patiently perhaps for weeks, find that they must take up fresh claims a long way ahead of the proved ground, and again await their chance, or else return to their old localities, and set to work again without a hope of more than a fair living. This many are now doing from the monster rush, the population at which was estimated at 30,00 at the close of last mouth. Instances of great success are reported from there, such as the obtaining of 10oz. of gold from one foot of washing-stuff, 18oz. from two cupfuls of dirt out of a claim, a share in which was valued at £10,000, and dab. weight from a hatful of scrapings off the bottom, the nugget ting of ILS much out of a spot of ground a foot square, and other equally large yields ; but these are the prizes bearing about the same proportion to the blanks as do the prizes in a common lottery. The largest nugget yet found at these diggings weighed 17oz. The Commissioner's Hill rush, in the Ararat district, has not excited so much attention nor attracted so large a population, but there is reason to believe that fewer disappointed men will leave it. The crowd not being so great, more have a chance of getting a claim in the paying ground, which is here also of great extent, though not perhaps so rich as the ground in the for most' locality. Thus there is little shepherd- ing, most of the miners being able to set to work at once, with a fair prospect of success. Some of the cliffs (seat opened are now nearly worked out, and the returns to each man have been estimated at somewhere between £800 and £100 on the average, for their six or eight weeks' work. The prospecting party, to whose exertions the opening up of this is due, had some time since washed out 30lb. of gold, and it is expected that they will take at least half a cwt. out of their extended claim before it is exhausted. The deep ground at New Ballaarat, in the Ovens district, is not turning out so well as was anticipated from the prospects obtained in the first doing bottomed on the now lead there. As far as it has been proved, this is not very rich for a deep load ; but it will afford profitable employment to a number of people, though, perhaps, fortunes to none, and, in tracing out its course, further discoveries may be made. The first deep lead opened up in this district, at the Indigo, has been worked for a long distance with fair success, and there is every reason to suppose its course will be followed for many more miles, probably until it and the new lead were found to unite somewhere on the plains of the Murray. With the exception of the few fortunate parties on the new field, the mining interest generally is in much the same condition in which it has been for years past. The steady men, who are not fond of running about in the vain hope of being among" the fortunate few at a new rush, can make a good living from old and worked out ground in almost any of the places that have been proved to be rich ; and it is surprising how long it takes to exhaust this so-called " worked out ' ground, Scarcely a week passes that we have not an account of large parties, or of a number of smaller parties, obtaining weekly returns of from £3 to £10 per man, by stripping some of the old gullies and iv washing away every thing to the bed rock, 01 else hythe systematic work mg of ground abandoned in haste for some new locality Then, when the European miners have taken all they can, the Chinese succeed them, and work the ground over again with much put out to themselves All this shows the necessity of a fixity of tenure and the use of better machinery for the thorough working of the ground in the first instance, but on most of the gold fields there is still a strong feeling against the introduction of the leasing System, evidently based more on prejudice than on any substantial grounds of objection, for in all the cases of opposition to the granting of leases applied for as yet the decisions have been satisfactory, cv on to the minor-, themselves The quartz-reef interest is steadily increase begin importance, new engines and machinery being sent up the country almost every day) There has been such a scarcity of surface water in many places, that several of the crushing mills have been unable to work for some weeks past, but the rains of the last few days have given most of them a supply, and the stampers can not be set a-going again While there has been this scarcity of water on the surface, both for the walls and for the washing out of alluvial soil, many rich quartz- claims have remained unworked, in consequence of the difficulty and expense of keeping them dry enough to allow of the quart being extracted, by that from the scarcity of water above ground, and the superabundance of this element beneath, the total yield of gold from the reefs has not been equal to what this should have been Yet the quantity of amalgamated gold sent to town weekly no very great, and may be expected to increase rapidly as machinery is erected near the many new reefs which have been opened of late, but from which little gold has yet been taken On all the distant gold holds there is a cry for machinery to reduce the quartz raised in anticipation of steam power being supplied, but although so many engines are sent up the country, most of them are set up before they reach these distant places, and the on hero of claims worth retaining will have for some time longer to resort to the primitive mode of extracting gold from the richest specimens, by pounding these with a hammer Several huge yields from quartz have been recorded of late, but the largest of all has been the enormous cake of amalgamated gold obtained from 45 tons of quartz out of one of the Bendigo reefs This weighed no less than a 7 oz 15dwt, and was sold for £2,890 The largest nugget found lately was one of 70 oz taken out of a claim on the Durham Lead, near Buninyong, a fortnight AGRICULTURE Although there was so much run through the summer, water has been more scarce during the last few weeks than it has been for some years past Grass is more abundant than usual at this season, but had not heavy rains fallen just now, the stock must have suffered severely There is generally a break in the weather early in April, and this has been accompanied by copious supply of ruin which has gladdened the hearts of the stockowner s, and set the farmers to work with their ploughs As far as prices are concerned, the prospects of the latter class have not improved of late They are now obliged to sell their produce at rates which a year or two since they declared to be ruinous, and there is no likelihood of prices rising Grim of all sorts has been largely grown, and the merchants stores are full of oats, barley, malt, and other articles of consumption The only thing of which therewill be any deficiency is flour, and this can be supplied from South Aus- tralla to the full extent of our requirements in the country markets the farmers get somewhat better prices than they do in Melbourne or Geo long, but production is increasing more rapidly than population, and the difference is becoming less each year Some persons, intent on gaining a temporary p plant) in the agricultural districts, are urging those who complain of low prices to demand protection, but the fallacy of the proposed remedy is too plainly seen by the majority, who know that a duty on grain would not be tolerated without duties being at the same time levied on all manufactured articles The Port Phillip Farmers Society's annual grain show, the papers in show of the kind held here, took place a fortnight since in the Exhibition Building, and was numerously attended by many besides agriculturists and their immediate connection An additional feature, of interest was added this year, by the offer of prizes for wine by the society, and of a handsome silver cup by the Mayor of Melbourne for the best 50 bunches of grapes, to be all grown by the exhibitor The cup was offered for this large quantity in order that large growers might have a fair chance of winning it There is a strong feeling among the farmers that it is becoming necessary for them to extend their range of operations, and rise products more strictly for the trial, in addition to the ordinary crops The vine is naturally the first thought of, and many of those possessing land of their own are about to commence the plantation of vineyards It was to encourage this feeling, and to prey sent the cup being taken by the owner of perhaps one or two carefully tended vines that the large quantity of 50 bunches was insisted on, and certainly the Mayors liberality caused a fine "show of grapes, both as to quantity and quality There were not many entries of wine, but among the few samples were some widely differing in character The simple of white wine which took the pi-170 in the only class in which there was competition, was a light pure wine, made from the Wantage and sweet water grape by his Worship the Mayor, who is in amateur vi met on, while another "sample, said, and we believe truly, to have been made from the unsaleable grapes of a vineyard, a mixture of all sorts-, and without the addition of sugar or brand), was well and Biveet, almost similar to Conatantia in flavor A red wine,

general expectation before the show, the first prize was taken by a Victorian wheat, although in competition with a fine sample of wheat from South Australia, to which the second prize was awarded The season here was very unpropitious during the harvest time so much so, that even the pure wheat very plainly showed the effects of the weather ltwisashoit, plump, thin skinned white wheat, of the character usually missed by judges here, but not so bright in the color as it ought to be As usually happens, the judges' decision was not quite in accordance with the opinion of all the persons present, some of whom consider ed a sample of red wheat to be more perfect of its kind, and therefore deserving of first prize, although avowedly a wheat of a lower class The led wheats, being more hardy, have suffered less from the effects of the bad weather than the tender white varieties, and thus show to more advantage this year, but still the judges choice was very generally approved The Adelaide wheat which obtained the second prize is comparatively large and coarse looking in the grain and is of a kind known in South Australia as the "White Tuscan variety The barley was very fair, but the first prize English barley did not fairly represent the growth of this year much better sample being on its way hither from the W. eastern district, but not for war died in time Several good parcels of C ino bailty were exhibited Any deficiency in the two foregoing classes was, however, made up by the numerous entries of oats, which have not suffered from the unusual man fall Amongst them all, the judges must have had some difficulty in aw aiding the prizes, so many of the lots being almost equal in quality But it was not in grain this show so much excelled us in the collection of roots and produce adapted for fodder The potatoes were very hue, and in great abundance and variety Early and late kinds were there, and also some very promising seedlings, one named at a former show "The lady Hotham" being already established as a f w onto sort If the potatoes were good, the onions were still better , the entries this year for the first time coming up to the standard of pei fee tion, judging of what onions ought to be in such a climate Those who advocate the system of growing roots for stock must have been pleased at the collection of mangolds and beets of different kinds Amongst these were the long and the globe varieties, and the white and reduce. all remarkably good, and allowing very plainly that root crops can be grown well here, whether they may be pi suitable at present to the farmer or not. The field carrots were also very fine for the prize offered for cut fodder pi units there were several entries, many people being oslo cashed at the luxuriant growth of the maize and sorghum. Ripe maize was also shown, but, with the exception of the 90-day corn, was not very superior. Altogether the show was a decided improvement on that of last year, and gave visitors a most favorable opportunity of judging of the agricultural and horticultural capabilities of the colony. LABOR. We have little now to report on the subject of the labor market. The cry of want of employment is a continuous one, and now and then we hear of cases of severe distress, and even of fearful casualties arising out of it. Yet there are none of the usual incidents of want visible in our streets. Mendicancy lins hardly an existence hero. And it is a circumstance from which various inferences may be drawn, that those who apply for work in answer to advertisements for laborers, appear generally to feel themselves in a position to use their own discretion in accepting or rejecting the terms proposed to them. In reply to a public notice within the last few days, for " navvies" to execute a public work, only one or two of the class really wanted made application. The others consisted of persons altogether unused to severe manual labor, yet wanting to get "something to do." They were comparatively worthless as laborers ; but as the work in question was a public one, and these persons appeared to be in circumstances of want, 7s. a day was offered them for such services as they could render-and the offer was refused. Ascertained facts like these, standing side by side with constant stories of distress, leave the labor question in great mystery. We maintain the eight hours' system. Workmen are enabled to exact a high rate of wages and other favorable terms from their employers. Yet it is constantly said-and there is constant proof of it-that the labor market is over-stocked. We believe, however, that this complaint arises chiefly from the fact that there are a good many people here looking for employment who have no aptitude at all for the kind of work that is wanted to be done. If a contractor . advertises for navvies, 60 persons present themselves, whose destiny it is written on their faces to be clerks or shopmen. Of this class we have always had more than enough since the first rush of immigration set in. There are very few openings there for such persons. Unaccustomed to toil, even the diggings prove unattractive to them. The first fascination that attracted every one-the limit, the maimed, and the blind-to the gold-fields, is gone. We look at them as a regular branch of industry, with no extravagant but with tolerably certain returns. But with the romance has gone, in the eyes of many, the charm. And there are hundreds of unemployed here who would rather be out at elbows in black coats than become the hard working self-denying sons of toil. These people do not succeed hero-never have succeeded and never will. There is no evidence to show that the real laborer finds any great difficulty in obtaining work, and the rate of wages is well sustained. In one direction or another, the man of strong muscle, able and willing to undertake a rough job, can usually discover some opportunity of turning his energies to good account. But it is to this particular class belong whatever openings the labor market presents. Men who have not been accustomed to the rougher species of toil and who cannot readily accommodate themselves to it, have to wait for special opportunities of finding their own place in the great labor system. To persons of this class the colony presents at present few attractions, and generally it may be said that the labor market is over-supplied. This remark does not apply to the class of female servants who still find themselves in a position to command wages of from £30 to £10 a-year, and to impose restrictions on their servitude wholly unknown to their own class in the mother country. Victoria is still the paradise of servant girls. COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The gold _otiirnsJfor the first. quarter of the year although they exhibit the period as nearly equal in production to the first quarter of 1858, will not hear so favorable comparison with former years. The yield has been fluctuating rather than steady in the Melbourne market there has been a steady demand for the metal for shipment, but the transactions have been insignificant in amount as compared with those taking place on the gold-fields. The bullion brokers quote the following rates Omeo, 63s. to 75s. 6d. per ounce j Pleasant Creek and Goulburn, 75s. to 75s. ; Castlemaine, Sandhurst, and Jim Crow, 75s. to 70s. ; Ararat, Maryborough, Dunolly, Fiery Creek, Avoca, and Amherst, 76s. to 77s. ; Ovens and Yackandandah, 76s. to 76s. ; Ballaarat, 77s. 6d. to 72s. 6d. 5 Goulburn River and Livingstone, 67s. to 72s. ; Boggy Creek, 75s. 6d. to 76s. per ounce. The escorts brought down last week week were much below the average. In nearly every instance they were below those of the corresponding week of 1858. The returns for the Forest Creek and Ballaarat districts exhibit the greatest deficiency.

In the first quarter of 1858 the sum of £158,843 was realised from this source, and in the first quarter of 1859 only £73,322 deficiency, £85,521. In the year ending at the first period the sum of £1.033.185 was realised, and in the year ending the 31st March, 1859, only £614,326-deficicney, £418,859. The falling effie in both cases accounted for by the fact that less land has been alienated from the Crown. In all the other departments the fluctuations have not been very marked, if we except a decrease in the sums received during the year for auctioneers' licenses. The Customs returns show neither increase nor decrease worthy of special notice. In the gold revenue there has been a decrease of £12,000 on the year.

The monthly Insolvency Circular issued on the 1st Inst,, gives the digest of insolvency business for the month of March. Eighty-two schedules are included in the list, of which the majority are those of small estates, involv- ing liabilities under £300. The trades are thus divided : - 2 . accountants, 1 auctioneer, 1 builder, 1 baker, 2 butchers, 1 broker . 1 blacksmith, 3 clerks, 3 contractors, 1 car-driver, 4 commission agents, 1 engraver, 1 engineer, 8 farmers, 1 gardener, 1 gingerbeer manufacturer, 2 laborers, 1 lodginghouse- keeper 8 miners, 1 machine-maker, 2 master mariners, 1 news-agent, 6 publicans, 2 plasterers, 1 painter, 1 restaurant-keeper, 17 storekeepers, 1 solicitor, 1 surveyor, 1 stationer, 1 stonemason, 1 surgeon dentist, 1 tinsmith. 12 assignments for the benefit of creditors were registered. 15 certificates were granted, and 2 suspended. The completion of the immigration returns for the past year enables us to compare that period with 1857. We subjoin the monthly totals of arrivals and departures for the two periods. It will be seen that while the arrivals have fallen off 30 per cent, during the last period, the the pictures have increased nearly 25 per cent. The fluctuations in immigration have been very marked for the last few years. In 1855, the total arrivals were 60,519, and departures 26,395, showing a net increase of population of 40,124. In 1856, the numbers wore-arrivals, 41,713; departures, 20,702; not increase, 21,011. 1857. 1858. Arrived. Left. Arrived. Left.

The report, which passed in brief review the leading subjects which have occupied the attention of the Chamber, was a adopted, with one amendment on the question of the postal service between Great Britain and Australia i. The office-bearers elected for the coming year- were Pres- dent, Mr. William Nicholson ; Vice-president, Mr. Charles Bright ; Committee -Messrs. J. G. Francis, David Smith, James M'Culloch, M.L.A , D. S. Campbell, M.L.A., James Lorimer, S. P. Lord, A. H. Newell, T. A. Drysdale, H. Henty, F. B. Franklyn, J. Morris, J. Se vice, M.L.A., R. Turnbull, F. H. Lempriere, F. D. White, F. S. Bligh, T. Rae, J. Fowler, and B. Cohen. The retiring president, before vacating the chair, delivered a short address, and the meeting terminated. The Chamber of Commerce, as representing the mercantile interests of the colony, presented, on Thursday, the following memorial to the Chief Secretary, on the inconvenience caused to Victoria by the detention of the mails on their way to this port at Kangaroo Island, in order to land those to South Australia : " Memorial of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce and others, to the hon, the Chief Secretary, upon the New Mail Contract between England and Australia. " Sir,-The undersigned have the honor to lay before you the following memorial with respect to the new postal arrangements lately made between England and Australia, and to request that the some may be brought under the notice of His Excellency the Governor, with a view to the amendment of the contract In the matters hereinafter pointed out. " It appears by the condition H, that the company's steamer is compelled to land both the inward and outward South Australian mails at Nepean Bay, Kangaroo Island Nepean Bay being about 650 miles from King George's bound, and 600 from Hobson's Bay, while the whole distance from King George's Sound to Hobson's Boy Is barely 1,300 miles. By this arrangement, the steamer- has to go out of her direct course about 200 miles each way, besides incurring the loss of time in landing and taking in the mails for South Australia. "In the event of the steamer arriving off Nepean Bay after dark, there being no lighthouse at that station, she could not, under the most favorable circumstances, enter the bay or deliver Or receive held- in Its, until the next morning. "It is therefore evident that the Victoria Hall, as well as those for New- South Wales, Tasmania, and New Zealand, will be delivered on the average some 30 hours, or a day and a half, inward and outward. ' ' As the distance between King George's Sound and Nepean Bay Is 220 miles less than from "lung George's Sound to Hobson's Bay, the fall into liner will arrive at Nepean Bay only 30 hours sooner than she would reach Hobson's Bay If she were allowed to proceed direct; while a branch steamer will have to be employed between Nepean Bay and Port Adelaide, and will not make that passage in less than nine hours. By the present arrangement, therefore, South Australia will have her nails delivered about three days and a half sooner than if they came on to Vic Tlino saved by mails delivered at Kangaroo Was' Island Instead of at Hobson's Bay.

Upon a very careful examination in the whole subject, and consideration of the 12 V«,ñ..rt<V,? which has taken place, my Lords ore was those objects can be best attained by roK in- the S__Ä;_a *?£_ Sie_?2t_!,,S._f"lx__ be provided with branch service lift it into "_ arrangements at the main service. Mv\or_hove carefully and especially considered the "diAco " views upon this subject, entertained by the colonies of Victoria and South Australia. The authorities of the latter colony very naturally desire that the steamer shall call at Port Adelaide ; but when it is considered that vessels of the size which must be employed in this service are unable to cross the bar of the Port, and are obliged to bring up at a distance from the Port of 15 miles, and from the land of five miles, and often in very bad weather and that under any circumstance, a small branch steamer must be employed and when it is further considered that calling at Port Adelaide would cause considerable detention to the more important Halls of Melbourne and Sydney (if the 1 eastern route shall be adopted), as well as a loss of tune also on the return voyage and that, therefore, the entire voyage out and home would be lengthened -a disadvantage which would affect South Australia as well as the other'colonies-my Lords feel convinced that the inhabitants of that colony will be satisfied, upon due consideration, that so far as the arrangement above proposed may be a concession on their part, it is one which the general interests of all concerned calls upon them to make and that they will see that the saving of time in the outward and homeward services together, so obtained, will be an advantage to them as well as to others, "It may be added that the desire so decidedly expressed by New South Wales and New Zealand to establish a Panama line, and also the partial opposition of the former colony especially to the Suez route, must be greatly influenced by the fact that their mails are now to be delayed a day and a-half finch way, merely for the convenience of one colony, and to the inconvenience and detriment of all the others-or about thlrteon-fourtoonths of the parties interested. Whoiiovcr, In fact, the steamer shall exceed her time, the delay of 30 hours at Kangaroo Island will so much further jeopardise the chance of replies by the return mail and of course more particularly as applies to New South Wales, Tasmania, and New -caland. , "But with respect to the homeward mail, your Memorialists would suggest that, while the delay in calling at Kangaroo Island Inwards is attended with undoubted inconvenience to all the other colonies ; there are some reasons for the homeward steamer being allowed to make South Australia the last port of departure and such a course is recommended, as one which, owing to telegraphic communication, may prove of advantage, not only to South Australia, but also to the neighboring colonies, " In conclusion, your memorialists have the honor to submit, that no arrangement by which South Australia is made the first port of arrival can be considered Just or satisfactory to this and the other Australian colonies and your memorialists therefore pray, that the condition of the present contract, which compels the mail steamer to call at Nepean Bay, on her arrival, may be forthwith rescinded proposal that your- memorialists believe would be readily acceded to by the contractors, and by which a portion of the subsidy will be saved to the country."

The imports of specie during the first quarter of the year have amounted to £112,371. and the exports to £77.227. The steady demand for goods, in moderate parcels, which has set in during the past four weeks, has caused a livelier feeling to the markets generally. The arrivals have been occasionally enormous. During the week ending the 2nd instant the import entries passed at the Custom House represented merchandise to the value of £032,010, but as second houses were becoming short stocked of many articles, numerous transactions took place for delivery from the ship, and these served to counteract the heavy 131383 which was beginning to be felt. Considering the overcrowded state of some of the markets, and the number of persons employed in catering for the public wants, it is to be wondered at that .? values have been so well maintained ; but holders have been firm in refusing to realise at a loss, , preferring to hold on and give the markets a chance of righting themselves. In this they have 'seen assisted by some legitimate speculation, which has led to large quantities of goods being taken out of the market for the present. There has been during the last few weeks a steady increase in the consumption of goods, arising, it is said, from the more general employment of the population along the lines of railway works and all the inland townships. But while chronicling this fact, we must do so with the usual warning, that out- powers of consumption, great as they are, are already estimated at too high a ratio in i . the home markets. Tho whole of the season's clip of wool being now shipped, with the exception of a few small lots from distant stations, or remnants of parcels already exported, there is scarcely anything doing in this trade ; the few lots, however, which Ifliave been brought forward have been readily disposed of at the previous rates. Tallow is in active demand for local use and for shipment to the neighboring markets. Mutton sells at from £50 to £50, beef lit \- from £43 to £40 per ton, which rates keep ex- porters out of the market. Hides are not in much demand. Good country hides bring about 9s. to 10s. each. A few lots of heavy have been sold at 11s. each.

IlAYMAUKKr.-Tho rain which has fallen during the last few days has caused a lighter supply at market and although a fair demand has rendered sales more readily effected, there is no alteration in prices. A few arrivals of oaten hay of prime quality have come to hand from Adelaide, and the uncertainty as to what amount of supply may be coming from that quarter somewhat depresses the market. Quotations are Best hay, £8 to £810. ; second class and inferior, £5 to sell! 103. ; straw, £3 per ton. WOOL, TALLOW, HIDES, ice There are no sales of wool advertised this week and the season being now no far advanced, quotations have become all but nomine!.

Tallow is in steady demand for local use, and sustains prices, which may be quoted at from £43 to £46 for beef, and from £50 to £60 for mutton per ton. For shipment there is very little doing.

prices have under gone more frequent change than has been the case for some months previously The continued heavy arrivals have, however, checked the buoyant feeling almost as soon as it has made its appearance There has been a considerable amount of speculation in articles of general use, in which has imparted a livelier air to the markets The uncertainty as to the date of arrival of the February mail, with intelligence of amount of shipments from the home markets, renders buyers ory cautious of increasing their stocks and although a steady demand exists for most descriptions of imported goods, there is little prospect of important changes in present values occurring, with the exception of some few articles, stocks of which have become much reduced Liquors-Drought beers are in steady
