The deputation laid before him certain written statements, declarations, and other papers which were submitted to the judge who tried the case, with a view to finding whether they could have any important effect upon the question determined by the jury. and it did not appear that they were of such a nature as to make further inquiry necessary There would be no objection to the production of all the documents in the case if moved for, except the expense of putting so much matter but he would strongly object to the separate production of isolated portions, such as the statements, declarations, and papers referred to in the question Sir HENRY PARKES, in reply to Mr M'Elhone, said he would lay a on the table a return relating to palm seeds and plants obtained from Lord Howe Island Sir JOHN ROBERTSON, in reply to Mr Jacob, for Mr Reid, said that during the A ears lS76,1S77,187S, 1871, 1860, and 1861 several cases of supposed violation of the 6th section of the Lands Act A Amendment Act were investigated, but in no instance was the evidence considered suffi- i Clear to justify forfeiture During the present year 11 conditional purchases had been forfeited for the reason stated Mr J WATSON, in reply to Mr Pigott for Mr. Tarrant, said the quarantine station in provided with an apparatus for fiiiuigutiDglotterswith sulphur oils acid, which had been in use for 20 A years On the recommendation of Dr M Kellar, the present health officer and with the approval of the Board of Health, he had sent to London for ft. largo ho -mrdisinfecting furnace of the most modern type.

M. G. , the land taken from him in the Ashfield nmuKipuitj ' He said in moving this resolution he would ask the attention of the House to the peculiar circumstances in which Mr Halloran had been placed in reference to this matter in the first place, the land itself was one of the oldest events in the country, It was a portion of grant that was made in 1701 only about six j cars after the colony was in existence and in that day there is reno reserve mons with reference to roads This land was really "caused almost as soon as a man had been established at Pi rramatt i or Rose Hill is it was then called, the stores of the men working the farm being taken up the river by a boat named the Lum] Tin road for a great many years after that, was simply a bush track and it was not until 1817 that it was made fit for traffic This grant was made long be, re an -Vus If Parliament were passed with reference to it is, the first Act relating to roads being a« ed in line, and 1 now nus 4th 'AA llliam lAr , No 11 In that AI iron nut tree t waited on the land which was a portion of of the present house occupied by Mr Halloran, and it was situate within about 50 yards of the bush track which had been developed into the Parramatta- road The house had been a added to by Mr Halloran, who had occupied it since 10-13 straight be said that the question was entirely one between Mr. Halloran and the municipalities Ashfield but it was nothing of the sort lins road was a win of the public roads of the colony, and had never belonged to the municipality The, land was completely outside the sale of legislation, which had taken place afterwards a 1817 this land was fenced He had a later signed by j the late Captain Johnston, Messrs Thomas M'Culloch , Theo J Jaques, D ivia learns ly, and James Byrnes, a Stating that they knew the fence to have stood in that portion for half a century, and never did form or was supposed j to form any part of the roadway Their letter was as follows .-" SVe, the undersigned, have known the Parramatta and passing. in front of Ashfield Park, during the last half cen- I turn, and we certify that the fencing as it blood in 1885 and until recently, in front of Mr Halloran's property, called Mowbray, stood in the very 1110 in which it | had stood during that period, and that the portion thereof with the ornamental trees thereon, outside the present fence I never did form, nor was ever supposed to form any part of the public roadway, but was and was well known to be a part of the Ashfield Park property as far as our memory or knowledge extends Theo J Jaques, since 1837, Thos M'Culloch, since 1830 Robt Johnston, 1828, David Ramsay, 1840, H S labatt, 1112 j James Bj roses, 1817 Sydney, 28th November 1889 In the printed papers, great stress was laid upon a plan pro- 1 pared by Captain Wilson, but that was a private plan, and should not be allowed to over-ride thoplausof Mr Hoddle and other officers of the Department The cottage was in BMstenco before there was any legislate about roads at all. The fence was put up in 1817, and the first Road Act was passed in 1838 Although the papers passed through Mr Halloran's hands, he did, not know anything about them then because there was nothing particular to call his attention to them When the land was taken from Mr. Halloran by the municipality, Mr Halloran, thinking the matter was in the hands of the Roads Department, declined to fight the municipality. He did not now ask the House for any outside price for this one- sixth of an acre which had been taken from him He simply asked the House for a small sum to recoup him for the loss he had sustained. Dr. RENWICK said he had considerable sympathy with Mr. Halloran in this case, but he hired a public duty to perform, and he regretted that he would pay e to oppose the resolution. Hear, hear.) Application was made by the? Municipal Council of Ashfield to have certain goods and streets aligned and proclaimed in the usual way The Parramatta-road opposite Mr Halloran's ' property called Mowbray was included it was included at the suggestion of the Commissioner for Roads in whose charge the Piiriiitnattti-rond and Liverpool road were at that time placed 1 house Proceedings nil occurred during the time Mr Hill oran was Drmcipil Under-biHrctnra, and the vera proclamation was forwarded through Mr Halloran. When he matter of the alignment of those roads came under the consideration of the Surveyor-General's Department special instructions were given with regard to the l Parramatta-road, nun spit the surveys were made in order to discover why that the provisions of the Acts then in force would have any effect in regard to these particular roads It bon numbers would turn to these Acts they would find a ample provision for the special purposes referred to in the second clause of 4 william IA" . No I 11, power was given to the Government to form, and alter any line of rail and under the 45th, 46th, and 47th clauses of the Police Towns Act powers were also given in reference to arrange and footways These were the clauses upon which action was taken in this matter at the request of the M unter in Council of Ashfield in order that the streets might be likened to the extent necessary for the public convenience and in order that the pro latona I ! of thrills in regard to public roads might be carried out, all the preliminary steps usual in such cases were taken, and i he was surprised that Mr Halloran should not himself have noticed that the surveyor was aligning the road, a circumstance which was known to over body. As far as he could see, and he had made by our cl to view the matter earnestly, both in regard to Mr Halloran's interests and the interests of the public the requisitions of the law had been carried out in every respect by the Sure o) or General s Department when it came to the manner of dealing with the align- ments in regard to the ii planner of fences perhaps some hardship was once isiOucd, and perhaps Air It Halloran's grey - ance originated at that stage Mr Halloran took down his fence for the purpose of making some necessary powers, and the mtimcipilttv armed with the powers conveyed to them by the handing over of these roads from the sun over-General s Department, prevented him from replacing his fence in the position at which it originally stood. He had a grievance against the municipality and brought an action against them, but after consideration he withdrew it, finding he had no chance Mr Halloran then came and made a claim against the Government, but he submitted that if he had any claim it was against the municipality, and not the Government hon members must also remember that if they formed a precedent in this case there were numbers of persons placed in precisely similar positions, who would ask for compensation taking the whole case into consideration, and view the; tt in the light that Mr Halloran was Principal Under-Secretary at the time this action was taken, seeing that due notice was given and that the roads were handed over in the usual way, and that Mr Halloran had every opportunity of getting his case reviewed, he hardly thought a case had been made out against the Government, and it would be improper on the part of the Government tophcothis acting upon the Estimates Ludoubteilv, Mr Halloran had suffered injury by having this land taken away, but whatever view was taken of the matter he could not and me that there was any claim against the Government, I Mr TARN ELL wild the law quoted by the Minister for Mines wnsobsolitH in this colony, and he happened to know that the Crown law officers were preparing to ascertain the opinion of the ladies on the 4 VA ill in II The Government could not prod um roadstead under that Act, and it had nothing at all to do with the arrangements made between the Department and the municipalities If the Government did an injustice to an individual, the) more liable for compensation Mr Halloran did not succeed against the municipality because the municipality had no authority to deal with the matter It was the Government who had the authority the land was taken from Mr Halloran be the anthem of the Government, and Mr Halloran hull nothing at all to do ywthtliopiii.itoHrnm.ro ment made between the Government and the municipality with reference to the alignment of these roads He would support the motion, as he really thought Air Halloran was entitled to compensation Mr M'ELHONE would vote against the motion li was quite clear if a string had been done to Mr Halloran he was a party to his own wrongdoing If any one ought to say, it was the municipality, and not the Government Mr PIGOTT said that none of the reasons given by the Minister for Mines could be taken as any answer to the charge that the Goa ernment had done an injustice to an individual He had not touched upon the legal aspect of the case, nor the injustice done to Air Halloran He thought he should be able to show that the alignment was illegal The Government were wrong from first to last in the course they took, and that was the reason, apparently, why the Attorney General had declined to swear opinion in the matter He did not agree that this was a matter entirely between Mr Halloran and the municipality The I municipally) willingly took over the road but the Crown was the aggressor for putting the municipality in possession of the land, and an action woy Id lie now against the Government for taking possession of the land [Mr DccitANAS Why not take in the answer was that Air Halloran did not w ish to go to law against the Government He would not of whether this was the manner in which men were to be treated who came to this House asking for justice which wrong had been done that they should be told by a law) or " Go to hold No reason had been shown why compensation should not be granted The Go- | vernment from tirsttolnst were acting illegally It had been said that Mr Halloran had slept upon his rights but i HWHS only in December, 1880, that he discovered what had been done Ilowouldask it there was a single member of this House who read the dot tammy Onzettt-, unless his attention was specially called to it for some special purpose, and BO It was not right to say that Mr Halloran could have had notice of this fact by the mere notice published in the Ouicnment Gazit t He submitted, therefore, that a fair case had been made out for compensation on the part of the Government Mr POOLE said that hon members had been very care- I fail to rest Mr Halloran s claim on the ground of occupation, but that they had no read the Surveyor s report and | inspected the accompany ing plan which showed that Mr Halloran was in possession n me of the land originally granted to him. The third clause of Mr Surveyor Deben hands report would show this As far as the alignment of the Great Western-road was concerned Mr Halloran had no claim against the House, and if he '-had a claim he should J bungil against the municipality, and in the law courts i Mr B WIDGERY said that it was all very well for the ( hon member Mr Forde to say that Mr Halloran had now nearly all the land granted to him, but that there was proof that Mr Killoran had occupied and improved this land for many years, and if there was a question as to whether or not this Hollow could grant Mr Halloran compensation i he thought that the House could Mr BYRNES said that in his view the municipality j had no power to grant compensation for the 1 and which had been taken, as it was portion of a man mad, and the matter was one for the Government to deal with He should support the resolution, as he thought Mr Halloran was entitled to compensation I Mr ABIGAIL said he should oppose the resolution, as in his opinion Mr II tlloran know in was encroaching upon the road and that fo 11 in in of that I again The road had improved they had 1 his own pilot to) li die House con s ntcdtothisie bilious there w his 1 be a plentiful crop of cases of this kind on the part of people who could get hon members to take them up Mr GARRARD said he should certainly vote against the resolution, as Mr Halloran had not a leg to stand upon a lie Huould Ung and have taken the proper steps to assert his claim if he h lU one In reading the torn spondence he had been quite surprised at the impudence of Mr Halloran, who accused the turns II who laid out the road of taking note of his hand and less of that of a friend of his than was necessary) Mr Halloran had been most persistent in his attempts to press this dam, and it continued its (hi -aura over General Sot craft not with more. speaking and writing), howled round the other os of Ministers and brought pressure to bear on the Colniuil friends in the claim had neither moral I nor legal foundation, and it had been urged in a most impudent manner Mr M>LLHONE It's a good try on Mr KIDD the right that Mr Lord as had offered good demands for his in turn and that the victims and report of the survivor would justify hon members in voting for it the Goverment should she the quit) of granting fair comp 1 pensation for land sale took for any purpose c Mr O'CONNOR thought that Ali II Halloran had put forward him I am in the in st legitimate manner and that the toe t of his receiving a pension should in no way interfere with the justice of it. The question for them reconsider was whether the claim was a just one or not Mr Halloran had occupied a high position in the Civil Service, and had been an honour to it, as well as to the colony, and if there was anything that would help forward a weak damn it was that fact He had not made his appeal in a pit ttifocgiiiK manner by getting men to interview Ministers in their offices, but had placed his dependence upon faintness merit, and this was enough to challenge their admiration He hoped they would long have men like him-retiring After splendid service, and with such a character For the reasons which had been adduced by Mr I turned he would have much pleasure in voting for them ition Mr COMBES, in reply, explained that when the papers passed through Mr Halloran's finds that gentleman was not aware that his property was endangered There was no doubt in his mind that Mr Halloran had a good claim against the Government in the matter, and he thought it had been preferred in a modest manner Air Halloran was not an impulsive man, and he only asked for justice. He had one MAIL of an acre of land taken from that before his house and he would like to know if any member would like to suffer such a deprivation for the rule of £200 There was no iiliBnmeut made at the expie»»dcsiro of Air Halloran and the land had been fenced since 1917 This was proved by evidence, and when a gentleman made a claim for the small sum of £200, why, he would like to know, should it be regarded as an impudent one A in in who held land for so long a time should be permitted to hold it still or receive compensation for it, and if then, were people who would set his right and they were not alive to what f were the rights of the people.

The motion was put, and agreed to ADJOURNMENT Sir HENRY PARKES moved that this House do now adjourn. Mr PARNELL desired to ask the Colonial Secretary what businesses Pbo Government intended to go on with to- rn arrive M' G iRRATTD rose to call the attention of the Colonial Treasurer to tbofirxding of the Murray Downs inrefrirdto the loss of the onions. It seemed to him that there had been gross neglect on the mart of the officers of the Government in not seeing that the low, line of the vessel was properly placed He believed that the officers of the Marine Board had power to see that the load line was placed where it ought to If it was taxed where it was by the consent of the office of the Government, they certainly had neglected their duty. He thought the Navigation Act had not been worked as it might to have been He saw that last night there was vs a meeting of the marine engineers, who expressed much incarnation with regard to the loose manner in which the ironing villers were allowed to proceed to sea, with the hatches of, six tons of coal on the deck He had seen this sort of tb.ing\hni»self, and he considered that it ought to be looked into Mr Al ELHOXL said every night the steamers coming from the Hunter River bad when decks literally covered with cargo, and the passengers had no place to lay their heads down upon They had to pay high enough for their night's accommodation but they got no accommodation for their money his state of things ought to be prevented The law was sufficiently explicit upon the subject that no deck cargo should be taken on a steamer, and A of these steamers had their decks crowded every night He would ask what was the good of having this law unless it was carried out ? Mr J P ABBOTT said he could bear out every word that those member had said, and more than that, he had written to the Colonial "Treasurer eoinplammgiof the excess of passengers earned in these steamers He believed that his complaint had been referred to the Marine Board without an j satisfaction whatever He had seem upwards of 400 passengers on board the Coonanbara going to Newcastle, and he had seen deck cargo of requmith He had heard some of the captains say that they were afraid to go out on account of the manner in which their decks hereunder with cargo He believed there was an inspector, but he never knew that either to go down to inspect the cargo on the Bleimors He had also complained that the provisions of the Licensing Act were not carried out on board those steamers, and the Illaivarr*-»teauier« as will, but things want on as badly as over Mr ABIGAIL endorsed the remarks of the hon. member for Balmain Every day these vessels were coming in so loaded that they could not get their hatches on, and the slightest rough weather must bring about at the same results as in the case of the Wonior i And Yet they found it described an article in the Ilenuifna a M situation of God He would rather describe it as the greed of man, by which there were lb widows and families left destitute upon the world And on the day following that d disaster another steamer belonging to the same company can. o into the harbour loaded in the same way If these things; is were allowed to go on the Colon ii 1 Treasurer would have B something to answer for, unless he took steps to see that it his officers did their duty He would like to know who was responsible for examining these vessels in regard to the inquiry into the low of the 'VA union the iv found the Marine Board taking evidence from people who were interested in the company Mr M<LR.HN called attention to the deplorable state of the Pyrmont Bridge-road Air \ OUN G said it was known throughout at the whole of these colonies that the navigation laws of the ss colony were carried out in a much more lax manner than 'in any other colony He had had some experience in chartering vessels, and it was well known that vessels that Wf is) not seaworthy did not go to South Australian or Victorian ports, but they came into the ports of Queensland and New South Wales without let or hindrance He know that in South Australia vessels were thoroughly examined by a committee of underwriters and he behevid(thal it was the same in Victoria. He was quite sure that lunnA vessels went to see that were more little be burns! If our navigation laws were not sufficient they should be amended Mr T W VI SON s not that the steam r AA emotions not lost by overloading She was mi of the finest vessels in the harbour of her class, and was built to carry 250 tons of I coal in any) weather On this occasion she had only 240 runs on I Hird, and he attributed his loss as one hon member had said to the visit turn of God did Munno Board of li it were perfectly satisfies us to her condition Show is lost in weather such as had not visited the coast for years With reference to the Hussar River steamers it was another they were licensed to carry passengers for which they had not got a commission Mr STUART said that he attribute to the loss of the Woniora to an error of judgment on the part of the minister That steamer was perfectly fit to carry iLo coal she had on board Sir HENRY PARKES said that it was the intention of the Government to go on with the Lard Hill tei-morroiv,and to lonQno themselves to that the issue until it No matter was settled the Ilouse».nujoiiruod at 7 15 pm until IVo clock to-morrow at london I
