Australian Trade with Japan. Mr. E. W. Cole, of Melbourne, who has recently returned from a tour in Japan, says manufactures of all kinds are being developed in that country. To kio has rapidly increased its population to 1,700.000, ; and in other cases the towns bave trebled their populations within a few yoars. With tho spread of Western ideas the 46,000,000 of people in Japan, Mr. Cole considers, must rapidly develop production and find improved outlets for both theoiselves and their goods. So far aa Australian trade with Japan is concerned, Mr. Cole, who believes that a ' whito Australia' is impossible, cannot help dwelling at length upon what be considers to bo tho iniustico of tho present means of restricting Japanese and other immigration. That legislation, he Bays, must chock interchange between tbe two countries. Nevertheless, ho thinks, that there aro great possibilities in the direction of an increased export of meats, butter and jam to Japan. Cattlo and Bhoep aro raised thero with great difficulty, and the demand for meat is steadily growing. Returns bave shown that those fed on meat diet in the navy havo increased in weight and height, and as tho Japanese are very anxious to grow to a larger stature meat is highly favoured. American, Dutch, French and Danish butter is to be obtained in Japan as well as a little Australian. Tho local product is very in ferior, and Australia, Mr. Colo thinks, should bo able to find a good market, always providing, of course, that she can compete with other oxporting countries in tho mutter of price.
