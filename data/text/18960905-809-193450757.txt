WHAT is DISEASE? and by what means can It ho cured 1 Many people profess to know both, and even those who have had a long life trainiug in education and experience in thvsu matters are still In a fog about them as to what aro tho real cause of disease and how it should be treated. Why is this the cane? This question we think Is easily answered. A person may continue his education from the time he Is 6 yoars of age till lie 'is 25 years old, take his degrees and get a certain amount of ex)>erience, and then what does lie find bur. that he is : wanting in judgment in diagnosing disease, simply he- cnusu ho wn never intended by nature for his calling; he 1 makes no success, but failure. It really requires a - person uaturally gifted to treat human and other uiiseaHvs before ho can achiovc success, us n high standard of eduentinn does not cure. It is purely judg ment »s to what the disease is and what treatment should bo adopted, and we venture to think, taking tLo whole population of the world, that uot uioro thau ; one in 10,900 is naturally suited W treat human disease j and to cure it.' j For instance, take Mentipl&y; ami Son, 188 Bourke- - street, how they have suWucd disease by their treatment after all other sources of treatment have failed, and tho simple reason is answered above. Naturo has gifted us, | for we succeed in curiug all curable diseases, and have I saved hundreds frotu an early grave. We cure Hydatids I no operation being required., Liver and Kidney Com- 1 plaints, Marasmus, Bright's Disease, Eczema, Weakness arising from atfy cause, and in fact all other diseases. We challenge tho world to compete with us, aud the fol lowing testimonials arc pruof of our success. W. MEXTIPLAY and SON, 1E8 BOURKE-STHbET, Melbourne. COPY TESTIMONIAL. Some time back, when I was engaged on the s.s. Despatch, I was a good deal troublun now and then with severe pains in tny kidneys, and ultimately I got so bad that I could not stand upright. After describing the symptoms to our chief officer bo told me that he at one time had been suffering from the same complnluc,' but had been restored to health by taking some of Menti- play's Pills, lie strongly advised mo to get some and give them a trial. Accordingly I called ut Mr. Menti-- play's establishment, in Bourke- strcet. lie (Mr. Menti- play) told me that if 1 carefully followed out his instruc- tions he would soon mako mo all right. I purchased a couplo of boxes of his Liver and Kidney Pills, and by the time I had taken the contents 1 felt considerably re lieved Knowing I was on the right track I obtained two more boxes, and before I had finished the second lot 1 was completely cured, and this without having becu off my duties for :t single hour. It was a lucky day for mo when I wcnFco Mr. Mentiplay, for during the timo I was taking his pills 1 shifted from the Despatch to tho ft.?. Alert, and if my kidneys had not been in good order when the latter vessel foundered I am certain that It would have bran impossible for mc to have endured the exposuro 1 experienced during the long time 1 was in the water.
