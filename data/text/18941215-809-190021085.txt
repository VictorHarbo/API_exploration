A lady, rather ahovo a medium position, who shortly after marriage became sickly nnd every day complained of romo kind of complaint until her young husband became tired of hearing her troubles, aud, after trying many doctors and specialists— which was, after ail, tho different medicines she had taken to no good pur pose— and, after five years' suffering ami trying every new remedy advertised without success, at last gave up ail thoughts of ever recovering her health, being very unhappy, with h«r husband apparently getting tired of her, until she said to her husband, " I am sorry I ever married you, seeing I have brought you so much misery, and I wish I was dead and save you further misery." "My dear," said thn husband, "I have to admit you have brought, me much unhappi- iicsB, and 1 thought when I married ou would add to tny comfort and make mo happy, hut now, after trying so many skilled doctors and specialists, all to no purpose, it seems useless to try any other treatment." " Yes, 1 think you arc right," she said, "It will only bo spending more money and such bad times wo cannot afford to try any more, aB I feel sure I am declining fast and thero will soon bo an cud to both of our miseries." " My dear,' said the husband, " do not glvo up, so long as thero is life there Is hope. I met a gentleman tho other day who asked for you, and after telling of yonr bad state of health ho strongly recommended me to try a herbalist who has a shop iu Bourke-street; Menliplny nnd Son is tho nainchotclis me. II a has been very successful in curing runny diseases after all other treatment had failed. Siipposo you give him ft trial as tho Inst resource ; ho may cure you." "No, iny dear husband, it nocms very kind of you, hut I fuel sure I will never be cured." " Well, suppose 1 call on him and see what ho has to say. If It does not seem right wo have nothing to pay for advice; only for nicdicino if 1 tnko It for you. There can be no harm done in that case. I will let you know what they thiuk of your case before taking any medicine." The gentleman called, explained Ids wife's sufferings, nnd in a very short tirno Mcntiniay nnd Bon, of 190 JJourke-Btreet, told him that his wife only suffered from di ot all her trouble, and she could be cured in less than two months and restored to perfect health. With this assurance he consulted his wife, and she agreed to try his treatment, llerciae being an uuuflunlly had one, it took 12 boxes of our Liver nnd Kidney. Fills to cure her, tho cost of which was tfiirty shillings (30j.). The husband told us that it must hare cost him for advice nnd ni'-dicinu not less than two hundred pounds (£200). His wife now enjoys the best of health, and has given birth to ft lino strong son, the first of her family, and that is how she became happy. Iler husband now goes home to meet a happy looking face, and a loving wife; and how many hundreds nre there w)io suffer from tho same, nnd nthvr corr.phiiutfl, and livo unhappy because of disease, and spend their money with out deriving aoy benefit, and afterwards have to consult W. Montlplay nnd Son before finding any relief. I cite this case, being only one out of hundreds under much the same circumstances. Our Liver nnd Kidney Fills are the most beneficial and reliable medicine under the Run for tuuio or female adults, and children or infnnts of any ago. They do not purge the bowels, therefore act on the liver nnd kidneys, and 1 must here assert that any medicine that purges the bowels docu not cure the liver. . I have lately offered to cure tho worst case of hydatids gratis. All I require is that the person suffering from that complaint shall get a medical man to certify to the fact that (tin patient suffers from that complaint, and ulso to certify ns to results of treatment. The doctors Any there is no cure, only by operation. I am in a posi tion to prove that I have cured a lady who had been operated upon seven times for hydntids previous to my treatment without success, and for 14 years 1 have treated that complaint without having one failure to my knowledge without operation. We hove also removed and cured hundreds of people suffering from worms of all kinds, both in adults nnd .children, when all other treatments had fniied. And for weakness from any cause our treatment has not »n equal in the world. There is too much puff and deception, nnd that is the reason why a genuine article in not appreciated. Remember, no matter what you suffer from, we aro prepared to treat you moro successful than any other person, and therefore much cheaper.
