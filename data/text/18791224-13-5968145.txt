It was passed by the Legialative Council vv ith a special protcat ag unat the claubea which related to futuro stamp duties In the opinion of Sir Charles Sladen, the practice laid down by the Imperial l'arha meut in 1870 ot separating duties from man atement clauses, ought to bo followed here, and, indeed, he contended that it had hitherto been followed in the case of Cuatoma duties which had alwajs been separated from Customs regulation billa He brought forward evidence to show that the House of Lorda had never abandoned ita right to amend monej bills, but in this colony the Council was restricted by statute law from amending them The present was an in opportune time for raising a question of privilege, and therefore the com mittco had not recommended the House to hu aside the bill 'I ho report of the committee was adopted, and the bill passed under protest, as airead} stated During the debate on the second reading Mr Lorimer and Mr Anderson took strong ex ception to the form of the duties, which the} ailirmed would be harassing to the com munitj On the other hand, they were ap proved of by Mr Campbell who said stamp duties were easy of collection and were m force both in the mother countrj and in the colonies But where, he inquired, could a precedent be found tor the land tax which Mr AnderBon voted for in 1877' All mein bera united in contending that at the present time what we wanted waa rather decreased expenditure than increased taxation It was I ointed out b} Mr Campbell and Mr Wilson that if Isew South \\\ ales resumed the collec tion of stamp duties our Riverine trade would be leaa Berioualy aflected by our own duties than had been anticipated After the bill had been passed Borne amendments were made in it on the recom mendation of Ilia 1 vcellcncy the Governor the message suggested that the date of the bill should be altered from 1st December to 18th December, 187) and that an amendment should bo mado so aa to provide that an association of

outside of Victoria This laat amendment was ogreed to by the Assembly when it w is submitted, but was accidentally omitted from the bill Sir John OShanaasy pointed out that this message waa an abuse of the powers conferred by the Constitution Act, mas much as the intention vvaB simply to givo power for the correction of verbal errors and inadvertences, and now it was proposed to make amendments which had been urged, discusaed, and dealt with before Bejond calling attention to the careless legislation of the Government, this point was not pressed Mr Bent proposed to liter the date to 31st December and a discussion en aued the Government opposing the suggestion on the ground that it waa necessary to collect revenue at once, and Mr Munro Mr Harper, and other membera contending that it was unfair that novel legislation should receive the Rojal assent on the Wednesday, and be brought into operation oi\ the Thurs day, and that complications were sure to arise Ultimately Mr Bent threw the re eponsibilit} of tlie procedure upon the Go v eminent and withdrew Ina amendment A desultory discussion ensued in consequence cf the commercial membera declaring that Sir Brj an Ù Loghlen w as making an error, and was in a fog about the relative position of ' billa of exchange and promissory notes, but the alter itiona suggested in the Governors message were hnally a0reed to rmviixcE The Assembly was occupied on Thura da} last with a discussion raised by Mr Donald Cameron, member for Weat Bourke, with regard to a letter signed 1 John Dawson which appeared in The An/us of that day Mr Cameron gave a denial to the statement contained in the letter that he had received £2 for introducing a conatituent to a Minister He described Dawson as a man for whom ho and Mr Miroms had in vam solicited employment Mr Cameron left Ina case in the banda of the leaders of the House Mr Mason was anxious that everyone concerned in tho publication Bhould be brought to the bar and punished offhand, but Sir Brvan 0 Loghlen who was m charge in the absence of Mr Berry, was not prepared to say that the letter, even if untrue, amounted to a breach of privilege, and ho sugsestcd that the matter should aland over until the nouso resumed business when ho would be pre pared to mention it again Both Mr Gillies and Air, Kerferd weie with Sir Bryan O Loghlen m questioning whether the charge

supply the remainder in Mel bo une, the total capacity being estimated at COO quarters of beef and 200 sheep In con- séquence of tho length of time occupied in freezing the beef, it waa found necessary to take in mutton at S}dney in preforenco. and then the requisite quantity could only bo prepared by freezing part of it on ahore Some delay was occasioned through these difhcul ties, and as

approximately, except at the end of each j ear, but the milling sunejors and registrars have alwajs been able to approach a near estimato as tho j ear progressed and their reports for tho quarter
