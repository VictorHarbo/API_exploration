SUMMARY FOR EUROPE POLITICAL. The Land Bill has given way to the Loans Redemption Bill Ministers have long, been impressed with the importance of the former measure, and have more than once brought it to the front during the session The second reading was moved in May, and the Premier then desired that it should be discussed alternately with the Railway Construction Bill but the House resolved to do one thing at a time After the Railway Bill was sent to the Legislative Council, the Government proposed that the land Hill and the Loans Redemption Bill which had been standing too long " abeyance should receive equal prominence This course did not commend itself to a number of the members sitting in the Ministerial side of the House, who regard the latter as the more urgent Lismore and at a meeting held last V wednesday a resolution was passed to question the Government to give precedence to the onus Redemption Bill Mr Francis submitted the views of the moon in to the Premier, doing so in a friendly spirit, and use! going any idea of the team to Ministers The suggestion has been Acted on, and the Land Bill stands sHade for the present In another portion of the summary we gave an abridgement of the Loans Re- demption Bill, together with a short account of the discussion which took place last week, when the second reading was moved The Minis tenal plan is to invite the holders of the six per cent debentures falling due in October next to accept a new issue of four per cent debentures at par in exchange Arrangements will be made, through the financial institutions which the Government may employ, to pay off holders who prefer to receive cash, new debentures being afterwards sold to recoup the advances The second part of their scheme is to provide for the subsequent conversion of the four per cent debentures into H per cent in scribed stock, in conformity with the provisions of the Colonial Stock Act of 1877 A different course is recommended by Mr Berry, the leader of the Opposition, who suggests that a sufficient number of debentures should be sold in London to pay off the whole of the six per cents maturing next October It is also urged that there will be more competition for the new issue if the Government give tenderers the privilege of taking in scribed stock it I per cent. The views of Sir Julius "V Gogol, who is at present in Tarleton and Mr Langton, the Treasurer of the Francis Government of 1872, have been placed before the public through our columns Neither approves of the Ministerial scheme It will be observed from our Parliamentary report that the second reading of the bill was carried yesterday, but with the intimation from various quarters that modifications would be expected at the hands of the Government. The correspondence between the Government and the Associated Banks re garding the £1,000,000 kin his been presented to Parliament the banks do timed to entertain a proposal that they should buy at par the ii 000 000 of debentures, and sell them in the London market on their own account They advised the Government not to dispose of the form In this way to any contractor as the debentures might be pressed upon the market at some juncture when it was advisable to keep up the price of Victorian stock On the 6th April last the banks wrote that the present time being in their opinion favourable for the no gotiation of the loan, it ought, in the interests of the colony, to be placed upon the market as soon as possible In closing the correspondence after the agreement had been arrived at, the 1 airman (Mr John M Mullen) in forms the Treasurer that the London committee are unanimously of opinion of it it will be very desirable to make arrangements for inscribing the stock as aithousedby clause 12 of the Act No ii" The loan, as previously announced, 13 to be floated next January Last week the Assembly passed a bill appropriating £891,000 of the £1,000 000 loan for various public works.

It was found that there was not much marine (growth on her bosom Some alterations are to be effected in her rudder It is a skeleton framework of forged iron filled in with wood, and, like the ram prove it weighs 10 tons At present it is sheathed with me but it is proposed to remove this and substituted iron plating a quarter of an inch in thickness line it is thought will prevent the rudder from being shaken or loosened in its structure by the peculiar action of the twin screws The zinc sheathing, after being cleaned, will be coated with two preparations of paint, and will then receive an application of Sims patent anti-fouling composition All the material is on board, and the work will be done by the crew The arrangements for docking the vessel were made by Mr A Wilson officer in charge of ports and harbours and Commodore Erskine afterwards congratulated the Commissioner of Customs on the effective way in which the work had been done, and the interest taken in the matter Great interest has been evinced in the vessel here. It is expected that after a further stay of about three weeks she will go to Adelaide her Majesty's sloop of war, Miranda is also here, having arrived from Sydney on the Mth ult the French war steamer, the Bruat, is also in Hobson's Bay She is a gunboat very much after the pattern of the Cerf and Success and other vessels of the French navy which have been here The Bruat has cruised from France to Madagascar, thence to Bourbon, and now to Melbourne She proceeds hence to Brisbane to pick up some escapes from New Caledonia, and will then go on to Noumea with them At Noumea the Bruat will 'join the French naval force stationed at New Caledonia She carries four guns of not very heavy calibre, and there is also a supply of arms of precision on board The compliment of officers and men is 87 all told the Tariff Commission has been taking further evidence with respect to the duties on furniture and articles of woodwork Mr H U Alcock, a very successful billiard table manufacturer, of Melbourne, stated that he wanted no import duties so far as Ina bear name was concerned One furniture manufacturer and importer spoke of the tariff as having benefited him as an importer, because it had had the effect of reducing the competition As to his manufacturing business the import duties did not affect him, as the articles he made would he produced here under any circumstances Another furniture manufacturer suggested a reduction from 24 to 20 per cent ad valorem, and alleged that colonial workmen did not become OF expert Of the old hands who learned their trade in the old country This witness how ever, was contradicted by a delegate from the Cabinetmakers Trade Society, who was in favour of an increase of the duties, and who declared that many of the colonial bred workmen were really first class men His trade had suffered much from the competition of Chinese workmen in Melbourne A chairmaker said that the tariff had greatly benefited his business, and that the duties ought to be raised to 3 or 40 per cent At the same time, he admitted that his chairs were gradually supplanting American tea portations A Ships clockmaker, of Williamstown, deposed that the tariff acted prejudicially as he had to pay duty on nearly everything he required as raw material Another witness, a bellows maker, asked for an increase of 5 per cent on Btmtha bellows, but wanted the duty taken off some of the materials he uses A picture framer, carver, and glider intimated that he desired that all mouldings should be admitted free, but that 90 per cent should be levied on finished or unfinished frames, while another witness in the same line, but who also makes mould nigs, suggested that the tariff as to them should be reversed, that is to say, that finished mouldings should be dutiable, in stead of free, as at present and that he finished mouldings should be free The Education Commission is still examining head teachers of State schools, whose evidence on many points is conflicting Some of them declare that the attendance of children is ICBB regular now than under the old system, when parents paid fees and others maintain that the regularity of attend ance has increased Some are in favour of the continuance of the results system, under which portion of the teacher's income depends upon the number of passes obtained at examinations and others oppose it on the ground that it promotes " cramming ' Most of them advocate an increase in the statutory number of attendances In the report of the Minister of Education for the year 1881 2, the salient points in the results of the operation of the Education Act for the year 1881 2 are summarised as follows -(1 ) The number of children under instruc- tion in day schools increased by 4,870, and the average attendance by 3,921 (2) Seventy two new buildings were erected, and additional accommodation provided for 3,113 children (3) The cost of instruction per child decreased slightly, both in day and in night schools (4) The number of certificated teachers increased by 102 while that of merely licensed teachers decreased by three 6 ) the percentage of marks obtained at the result examinations rose from 77 76 to 79 98 (G) Out of a population ascertained by the census to number 802,340 persons In April, 1881\. 230 503 children, or 2s 7 per cent of the whole, where under instruction in that year either in state or private schools (7) Out of a school population of 194,410, as shown by the census, 182,130, or 91 0 per cent, were on the rolls of mate or of private schools the balance of 6 a percent representing not merely children who were under no instruc son, but also those who were taught at their own homes, and others who had finally left school on being educated up to the standard. Great activity is being manifested by various j P'rBoriB desirous to promote religious instruc- tion in state schools On the 3rd mat, a meeting was held at the Temperance hall, Melbourne, for the purpose of inaugurating an contribution to be called the " Bible in State Schools League " 'i he Right Rev. the Bishop of Melbourne presided, and there were present most of the leading clergy of the various denominations The hall was filled by an exceedingly large audience 'The Bishop, in the course of a long and very earnest address, explained the attitude which the new league proposed to take with regard to the Education Act. It was, he said, in favour of a national system of education and of the present act in all its essential features But calculating from the latest census returns, he assumed that '5 per cent of the entire population desired that religious instruction should be given in some form, and it was not right that the remnant of 5 per cent should prevent such instruction being given The bishop concluded by stating that what the league desired was a clear definition of the term "secular," as applied to education, and that provision should be made in the school time table for religious instruction 'The league was formally constituted, and office bearers and a working committee were appointed At the last meeting of the Melbourne Presbytery the subject of introducing the Bible into the State School was brought forward by the Rev. A Hardie in the form of an overture to the general assembly Mr Hardie supported the overture in a speech of some length, and after some discussion it was carried The overture was as follows -" 1 That the assembly declare that for God a glory and the welfare of the state, the Bible ought to be read with un- denominational explanations in the state schools and in ordinary school hours, with a conscience clause, and that greater efforts should he made to bring the neglected children under regular instruction. 2 That the assembly instruct its religious instruction committee to be prepared to represent the views of the church on these subjects before the Royal Commission on education, and to seek an opportunity of doing so 3 That the assembly recommend all its ministers to use every effort to arouse the church to united and earnest action in relation to the religious instruction of the young The Roman Catholic Bishop of Ballarat, Dr O Connor, has returned to that city after having been absent for nearly two years on a visit to Europe The bishop was welcomed on his return to Ballarat by a large gathering of people Special services were held at the cathedral, and addresses from the Catholic bodies of Ballarat were presented to him Bishop O'Connor availed himself of the opportunity to deliver a long address, which dealt principals with the education question, and recommended the adoption in this colony of the system in force in Canada, which, it was stated, met the Catholic views by apply- ing the money obtained from Catholics to the education of their children. The results of the triennial poll taken in August last in the various municipalities throughout the colon) (with the exception of Melbourne and Geelong to determine whether or not the number of licensed houses should be increased, have been pub- lished The number of votes set forth as recorded against the increase of publicans' licences is 38,017, and in favour of the increase 10 537 In the cities 5-101 votes were given against the increase and 882 for. In ballarat no result is given In Collingwood so little interest was taken in the matter that under 500 votes were polled in the towns 2,803 votes were recorded against the in- crease and 750 for in the boroughs 7,895 votes were given against the increase and 2 007 for, and in the Shires the numbers were 21,833 against and 0,892 for Subsequently the poll was taken in Melbourne and Geelong in the metropolis, very little in street was manifested in the matter, only 380 votes being recorded, of which 26 were rjgainBt an increase At Geelong the proportion was about the same. A trade platform in connexion with the approaching elections for the Legislative Council has been prepared by the Licensed Victuallers' Association. It condemns the local option movement, but, at the same time, states that in certain localities there are too many licensed houses If it is to be resolved that an absolute majority of the voters on the rolls should be authorised to define the number of such houses that are to be closed, the association thinks that the greatest decrease in a locality should not exceed 10 per cent of the whole, and that the owners and licensees of the closed houses should receive compensation, to be paid by the municipalities As to Sunday trading it is recommended that instead of compelling hotels to be closed all day, as at present, the supply of liquors should not be prohibited between the hours of 1 and 3 and 8 and 11 o clock p.m. It was further agreed that it was desirable that the Commissioner of Customs should cause to be tested and analysed samples of all spirits, ales, wines, Le , imported or locally manufactured It is alleged by the association that since the late International exhibition in Melbourne many new brands of spirits, Le have been introduced, the age and quality of which require investigation in the interests of public health and morality Prosecutions of publicans under the Trade Marks Statute for selling inferior spirits in bottles bearing the labels of well known dia tilleneB continue, and heavy penalties are being imposed where the offence is proved Much energy is being displayed by persons interested in promoting the use of the electric light The Australian Electric Com- pan), which supplies the Swan incandescent lamp and Brush arc light, is taking active steps to extend the system, and purpose asking the public to subscribe more capital. The Opera house, Eastern Market, and many other large buildings are already, or are to be lighted with their lamps The City Corporation is practically testing electric light- ing for the purposes of street illumination, two lamps, each of 3,000 candle power, having been placed in the centre of Bourke Street Great interest has also been displayed by the public in the Ellson system, which is being exhibited in operation in a large furnishing establishment in Collins street The Cafe Gunsler was lighted with 50 Edison burners last Monday evening, when a dinner was given by Major T Hood Page, the general manager of the Edison Indian and Colonial Electric Company. Mr. Richard Grice, senior partner in the Dim of Messrs Grice, Sumner, and Co, merchants, of Melbourne, died on the HE inst from paralysis He was born at Bootle, Cumberland, England, on October 30, 1843, and arrived here in 1858, where be at once began business as a merchant in partnership with the late Mr Benjamin Heape In 1831 that partnership was dissolved, and the firm of Grice, Sumner, and Co was formed That firm attained a very eminent position in the mercantile world, and it ranked amongst the foremost houses in the Australian colonies The deceased leaves a widow, three sons, and four daughters. A communication was a day or two ago received from Geelong by the Commissioner of Customs to the effect that a youth named Andrew Rice, 10 years of age, who lives at Horseshoe Bend, hear Connewarre, was walk- ing along the beach, half a mile to the west of Bream Creek, at 3 p.m., when he found a black man bottle, tightly corked, inside of which was a piece of the Licensed Victuallers' Gazette, and on one side was written the following words "Loch Garry Bunk off Otway November 2, 1882, all hands lost John Erskine, captain." On the other side were the following words -" Captain on Blue till last moment. Who finds report to Strachan, Murray, Shannon, and Co. The writing is not that of Captain Erskine, but bears a close resemblance to that of the chief officer. The Loch Garry left Corio Bay on Wednesday last with a cargo of wool, for London, under the command of Captain John Erskine. She is a ship of 1,493 tons. There is every reason to believe that the affair is a hoax. The telegraph operator at Cape Otway states that the line repairer walked from Apollo Bay to Cape Otway on Saturday, and saw no sign of any wreckage. At the Theatre Royal " Youth " has been drawing crowds during the late racing carnival. "The Strategist" was withdrawn from the board at the Princess's Theatre last Saturday night after a long and successful run, and "Sam of Posen," another American piece, in which the popular Mr. and Mrs. Polk appear, was substituted for it, and seems likely to prove a great attraction. At the Bijou Theatre, " No Mercy," an Australian drama by a little ateur well known here under the name of " The Vagabond," was withdrawn after a few nights to allow of the reproduction of "The Green Lanes of England." Mr. Maccabe is giving his monologue entertainment" Begone Dull Care" at the new Victoria- hall, Bourke street, and is being well patronised. The net proceeds of the testimonial performance lately given to Mr. W. E. Sheridan amounted to £133. Mr. Frederick Marshall has left Melbourne without waiting for the testimonial performance which some of the numerous admirers of his Professional talents were talking of giving to him. Some members of his company felt aggrieved at the premature termination of their engagement with him, and hearing that he was about to leave the colony, determined to apply for write of cases requiring him to give security to answer their actions. In the meantime, however, it was ascertained that he had left Melbourne for Adelaide overland A writ against him was granted on behalf of Miss Km m a Fischer, one of the actresses of his company. Mr G S Titheradge, who has made a favourable impression here in light comedy, was one of the members of the company, and is about to leave for the United States It was in tended, as he is deservedly popular, to arrange for him to take his first leave of Melbourne at a special entertainment, but no theatre seems to have been available for that purpose in the period preceding his departure He has, however, secured one of the leading theatres in Sydney for a weeks performances. Mr T H Guenett, the founder and director of the Melbourne Popular Concerts, had an extra concert given for his benefit in the Melbourne Athenum, on Wednesday, 25th October. Mendelssohn a Quartet, op 12, and the grand senator, op 74, by Hum men, were finely rendered Madame Carlotta Tasca and Herr Max Vogrich were the solo pianiste, and Miss Alice Rees and Mrs Cutter the vocalists there was a large attendance, which brought the second season of these entertainments to a successful close They will be resumed again in April, 188% A series of eight promenade entertainments, commencing on Monday night, October 14th, has been given in the Town-hall, under the direction of Mr E S Smythe Miss Alice Rees, Miss Christian (supported by Mr Alfred Mond as accompanist and Mr David Lee, the city organist, have supplied the musical portion of the entertainment with distinguished success" A new and additional attraction was found in the literary readings and dramatic illustrations given by the highly popular tragedian Mr W E Sheridan the public have crowded the Town hall nightly to witness these excellent entertainments, to which low prices of admission were charged. "Boccaccio" still continues to run at the Opera house, but it will be withdrawn in a few nights in favour of the " King's Dragoons," by Crook. THE LOANS REDEMPTION BILL. The bill to authorise the redemption of public loans falling due in 1883 r, IB now before the Legislative Assembly.

By the adoption of the provisions of the Colonial Stock Act of 1877 (an Imperial statute) facilities will be afforded (where desired) for the transfer of stock from hand to hand, through the medium of certificates This act is described by the Treasurer as being a very convenient and useful measure. A person in whose name stock stands inscribed may wish to deal with it as he would deal with debentures which are payable to bearer He can obtain a certificate as to his being the holder of so much stock, and such certificate may be passed round like a debenture At the option of the holder of the certificate, the security may at any time be reconverted into ' in scribed stock In converting debentures at 4 percent into Block at 35 per cent, the Governor in Council may (live stock of the nominal value of any sum not exceeding 100 for each 1100 debentures It may not be necessary to go up to the maximum, the rate depending on the state of the money market Where the maximum is reached, the interest payable on 1105 will be equivalent to Li Hi Od on £100 Vie give the clause in full " 20 The several debt area lessees under the authority of this act or of the Railway Loan Act 1931, was let. may be converted into stock in London shall be BO a coverlet in the manner hereafter appearing (that is to Day-the Governor in Council may from time to time fix the amount of stock that will be "Ucn In ox can arise for £100 of such debentures not cxeocdlnN £100 In stock for each 100 of debentures and the holder of any such debentures may exchange Such debentures for the e velveteens la at. ck as fixe 1 for the timberman) the Governor in Council as aforesaid, and at every Such exchange all debentures HO exchanged, and all coupons not then payable shall!! be delivered up to the Treasurer, who shall thereupon cauBo Block to an amount equivalent to such de con times to be credited in the stock ledger kept by the Bank of England, or such other bank as the case may be, to such person as the bearer of such dele iturea shall in writing direct and the nominal amount of the Victorian Government Inscribed Stock shall be from time to time by notice In the Government Gazette' Increased by every amount of Bulli a ock so credited to any one In exchange for debentures By clause 27, the Treasurer is authorised to increase the amount of Victorian Government stock to £107,0 - '27 The Treasurer not) increase the amount of the Victorian Government stock by the sum of £167 003, subject to the conditions of redemption contained in 6ccllon28of Act he 408 and shall under roguish ma and conditions to be submitted to and approved by the Governor in Council from time to time, cause to be sold for ready money) the Bald Stock in parcels or amounts of £10 or some multiple of 3, and apply the proceeds thereof to refund and pay back into the consolidated revenue or The Railway Loan Account 1878" the sums of £60,000 and ot £20,000 advanced out of the Bald accounts for the payment respectively of Bendigo waterworks debentures, and of railway I purchase del lectures, and to the payment on maturity of £87 200 of railway purchase debentures coming due I between the 31st day of December, 1882, and the 2nd day of January, ISaO The remaining provisions of the bill are formal. Sir Bryan O'Loghlen in moving (on Thurs day, the 2nd met ) the second reading of the bill, explained the provisions set forth above, and referred to the fact that the mode of redemption he proposed had been in operation in England for a century by the regard to the first sum mentioned P7 817 220 in U per cent debentures £3,82 1100 of it would come due in Oct, 1883, £812 300 in Oct , 1884, and J S 180,020 in Oct, 1883 Of the Hobson's Bay) debentures, which were also 6 per cents , £20,000 of them had been already paid by means of a temporary advance from the Treasury. Their total amount was £107,000, and he proposed to convert them into Victorian stock, payable in Melbourne. He intended that the treasurer should issue the stock from time to time when funds were required to recoup the consolidated revenue or an) other account out of which money might be taken to meet the first class 6 per cent debentures But the question which the House had to deal with at present was the redemption of the £3,82 000 falling due in October next, and the proposal of the Government was to issue debentures in the usual form, bearing 4 per cent interest, and to exchange them for the present 6 per cent debentures As to the latter, they would expire on the 1st of October next, and it would not be within the power of the holder to get in the open market as good terms as the Government offered The conversion was not intended to be the floating of a new loan or anything which would disturb the market with reference to existing loans It would be simply a voluntary readjustment between the parties to the contract Only those who dissented would have to be paid in cash The operation would be performed directly between the two parties concerned-the holders and the Government. It was a very simple process, and one which had been carried out successfully by every country of good credit which had tried it, and there was not the slightest doubt that in our case it would be successful also Provision had been made that on or before the 1st of May any person wishing to exchange or convert the debentures must make application in Melbourne to the Treasurer, or in London to the agent general This was provided simply because it was necessary to fix a particular day in order that the Government might be able to calculate within a reasonable margin what would be the amount of the debentures which they would have to meet in cash The Treasurer was empowered to take the cash required either from the £1,000,000 loan or from the consolidated revenue Power was also taken to issue new debentures to the amount of those which were refused There would be no difficulty in making arrangements with any financial institution to meet the debentures falling due out of a sum deposited with it for that purpose Section 23 of the bill gave the Treasurer power to make a declaration on behalf of the colony, and provision had been made by the Legislature here in accordance with the Imperial " Colonial Stock Act, for the inscription of the stock and its transfer ence from time to time the interest on the inscribed stock had been fixed at 5 per cent If these loans were dealt with on purely financial principles, the proper course would have been to float a 3 per cent loan at a discount but the colony did not want to incur indebtedness beyond the sum which it had to spend The proposed conversion would be merely the precedent of transactions which would have to be carried out from time to time, and if there could be established in London a marketable stock of high value, bearing 3 per cent, the Government would have formed a good precedent Mr Berry said he could not help thinking that the Treasurer had made the bill in necessarily complex Matters were included in it which would have been well left out the conversion, for instance, of the Hobson's Bay and Bendigo Waterworks debentures 1 ina was the last transaction Victoria had had of this kind, and for that reason the bill should have been a plain and simple measure setting forth on the face of it our intention of meeting the debentures when due It should have been a bill authorising the floating of a new loan equal to that which we had to redeem making the schedule of the bill the various debentures The preamble included debentures which had already been met-a circumstance that was likely to be miss understood There was further no good reason why there should be any portion of the loan set apart for inscribed stock, and when he remembered the inconvenience which arose in connexion with the one million and a half loan which was originally intended to be all Victorian in scribed stock, he quite failed to see the wisdom of this part of the Government pro- poser He also thought that the proposed mode of surrendering or tendering and ex- changing debentures was unnecessarily complex It would be better to treat the debentures as a bank did a £100 note presented at the counter. By one clause the Governor in Council was to fix the terms, and by another the holders were to tender, but it was also provided that the agent general might decide upon the acceptance or the new acceptance of the tender The tenour of the provisions went to show that a premium was expected, and no provision was made for exchanging the debentures at par or at a discount The Governor in Council ought to fix the terms, and not the holders of stock, hncauBB no attempt should be made to trap people into giving a few shillings more than the Government were prepared to accept The Treasurer spoke of the advantage which would be derived by holders who accepted the terms which he was prepared to give them, but why should this aspect of the question be considered Why not float the new loan at the very best price obtainable, irrespective of giving advantage to anyone' (Hear, hear) The due debentures ought to be taken as cash, and the holders allowed to compete with new men for new stock. The state should keep to its bargain, and pay the amount which it had agreed to pay. Sir Bryan O'Loghlen -It would not be easy to do that Mr Berry -It could be done by floating the £7,000,000 loan in instalments, as this to meet the demands of debenture holders as their stock became due, or by floating it all at once Either course would so raise the credit of the colony that it could afterwards get a loan of three times £7 000,000 if required The Treasurer had made a mistake in altering the interest on inscribed stock, which was really no more valuable than debenture stock. It was. only more convenient to certain persons, such as trustees, who desired their stock to be registered Why, therefore, should they be compelled to pay a penalty for it' If the price of both Blocks was the same, the circle of investors would be widened, besides which the Treasurer would ascertain the real popularity of inscribed stock Recent experience had shown that much more money was offered than was asked for, so that if purchasers were allowed the option of taking which stock they chose, competition must be in creased. Sir John O Shanassy concurred with the hon. member for Geelong (Mr Berry) in saying that the bill was a clumsy, complex measure the plan of advertising that the bondholders at home should individually send in offers was unworkable It would be far better to authorise the agent general or the associated banks to advertise that it was desired to exchange the six per cent debentures for four percent and that the six per cent would be received on such and such terms The agent general would he placed in a very false position if he was called on to make a bargain with every individual bondholder Agents should be appointed in London with power to sign and make due inquiry as to the value of the stock and debentures offered before their time When he read the negotiation between the banks and the Treasurer he was struck with the fact that no attempt was made to dovetail the loan with the conversion, because as surely as night followed day the floating of the loan in January would determine the entire value of the stock which was to re- deem the £1 SOO 000 debentures in October Both transactions would be dealt with as if they were one, and he was sure that the banks were too well versed in the interests of the country to make any objection to such an arrangement being made now The Government should make certain that the credit of the colony would be established and that no pettifogging risk should be run in exchanging the debentures Mr Francis said that the Treasurer displayed a sanguine expectation which he (Mr Francis) could hardly entertain He also thought the bill complex, and that it should be simplified He, however, trusted that the House would show by their proceedings that on a question of this kind party lines were by them disregarded, and the interests of the colony alone considered He hoped to see the bill amended in some particulars in committee, but he would take care any vote he gave would not be calculated to damage the character of the colony in the financial world. (Hear, hear.) The debate was continued yesterday and the bill read a second time GOLD AND THE GOLDFIELDS According to the reports received from the leading goldfields of the colony, the gold mining industry continues in a very satisfactory state The gold yields which the principal alluvial and quartz mines have returned during the last five or six months are well maintained, and active prospecting work is carried on in large numbers of cases where it is considered probable the valuable metal is interred In last fortnight's summary it was stated that a good deal of interest had been excited in mining circles from a report which had been circulated that golden quartz? had been discovered in Mr Lansell No 180 mine at Sandhurst, at a depth of about 700ft, and that Mr Dyason, manager for Mr Lansell, had been requested by the Mining department to state if the report was correct Mr Dyason has since replied to the effect that a quartz reef was met with at a depth of 175ft. in the shaft, and that it was from 12in to 18in thick Gold was perceptible in Burne of the quartz, but it was not known whether it would prove payable or not He (Mr Dyason), however, promised that if it did prove payable, on being opened out, he would at once inform the department of the fact It is sincerely hoped that the lode will prove a valuable one, because the finding of payable quartz at such a depth on Sandhurst would be considered equal to the discovery of a new gold field, as other companies which have hitherto found gold in their mines at various depths up to 1200ft may, if the report be correct, naturally expect to obtain it at lower depths. A highly interesting ceremony took place on the 27th alt at the claim of the Hepburn Rocky Lead Company, in the south eastern portion of the Creswick mining direct This company has been formed for the purpose of developing the Rocky Lead, which is one of the gutter in the rapidly advancing Smeaton gold field, and the ceremony referred to was the starting of its new machinery. About the course of the lead, as about others in the district, many theories have been propounded. Several years ago it was worked through a number repayable claims, and up to within a few hundred feet of the southern boundary of the Hepburn Rocky Lead Company's ground The Lennon's Paddock Company, which followed the lead to that spot, was a co-operative association of working miners Their appliances were rude compared with the ordinary mining plant of the present day, and their means were limited Still it is stated that when they left off work they were in payable wash and, in the opinion of many, the direction of the lead could, to a great extent, be gathered from the results of their labours The claim of the Rocky Lead Company in 545 acres in extent exclusive of roads within its boundaries The promoters of the company believe that the Rocky Lead traverses their property from south to north or north west, their belief being based on the knowledge actually gained so far of its course, and on discoveries of shallow ground on the east and west They and the other shareholders have evinced such belief by associating; to g her and incurring a very heavy expenditure for the purpose of develop- ing what auriferous resources there are in the ground. The outlay is, so far, upwards of £0 000, and the plant and buildings can only be spoken of in terms of unqualified praise Some idea of the courage of the company may be gathered from the fact that there is notnowanothor company even working within seven miles of this claim If the expectations of the company are realised the effect on the district will be most important, as a very large field will be opened up to mining operations AGRICULTURE Previous to the heavy rainfall reported 111 our last fortnightly summary, many farmers in the early districts had commenced, and others were about to commence, cutting their wheat crops for hay, in order to save the total loBB that then appeared imminent The rains occurred just in time to prevent any large amount of such cutting, and the weather has since been genial enough to carry the crops forward in a seasonable manner Some of the crops in the earliest districts were too far gone to be saved many who, line, upon the whole, the return is expected to range from a moderate average to a good one, according to the district. The late districts are generally estimated to have the best prospects Shearing, which in Victoria has been prolonged by the showery weather, is now virtually over Where the drought was severe, and feed and water consequently short, the effects of these hardships are visible in the staple and also in the weight of fleece There is, however, not a great deal of wool, Victorian grown, to which this will apply, the larger clips from well managed private estates are all satisfactory. Amongst the important events of the fortnight are three sales of live stock, represent- ing Shorthorn cattle, draught horses, and merino sheep, respectively The annual show of the National Agricultural Society of Victoria has also taken place. The attendance on the three days B-November 1 to 3 inclusive-was much larger than at the show of the previous year. The takings at the gates amounted to £027, exclusive of the returns from the Omnibus Company The champion prize for the best Shorthorn bull was won by Mr Robert McDougall a imported Booth bull, Sir Roderick (14,010) The champion in the female classes was the Hon. W J Clarke's Oxford Summerton, bred by the late Mr Richard Morton The sales were held as usual on the last day of the show, but no great number of animals changed bands. Amongst the best prices mode were the following -On account of Mr. JOB Teasdale Grand Duke of Derrimut 2nd, Mr, Ferguson, 130gs , Roan Duke of Derrimut 2nd, Mr L Dugdale, Pentland hills, 1898 11th Duchess of Derrimut, Mr. C Lynott, 130gs , Red Duchess of Derrimut, Mr C Lynott, 120ga Several cows of this herd went from Eggs. downwards Lady Chrystal was sold, on account of Mr. James Rennick, at 1258 A few high bred Tasmanian stud rams were also sold at moderate prices, the figures were one at fiOgs. and one at uOgs , three at lOgs , one at 39s and thence downwards, SALE OF MR, C, B FISHER'S STUD SHORTHORNS This event came off on the 20th and 27th October, at Maribyrnong. Comparing; the prices realised for the most fancied animals with those now current at English sales, it is impossible to arrive at any other conclusion than that the industry of beef producing is regarded by Australian capitalists as one particularly worthy of their notice The sale, which was conducted jointly by Messrs Richard Gibson and Co and Powers, Rutherford, and Co commenced with the cows. Of these about 170 head of the Quest shorthorns ever brought together in the colonies, consisting of imported and colonial, bred sows. and heifers. were disposed of the majority of the animals going to Queensland buyers. There was a good attendance, but competition was confined to a few stock breeders, Messrs C Young, Rowe, G Elliott, and Cleve, Fink, and Co., of Queensland, Mr S Gardiner, of Bundoora park, Mr D Gorman of Beveridge, and the executors of the late Mr Niel Black, of Mount Noorat Estate, appropriating between them almost the whole of the stock sent into the ring The highest price for the day was obtained for the handsome Oxford a Dowager (imported), by Oxford a King, which fell to the bid of Mr S Gardiner at 750 guineas This cow, a symmetrical and massive man, was one of three imported by Mr. Fisher, and is undoubtedly one of the finest specimens of a shorthorn female ever brought under the hammer in Australia Oxford's Rose 12th another imported cow by the 5th Duke of Wetherby, went in a few bids to 310 guineas , buyers the executors of the late Niel Black Among the colonial bred stock offered, the progeny of that fine bull Agamemnon, when possessing anything like shape or substance, were eagerly) sought after, and a few symmetrical, well conditioned cows realised handsome prices Agamemnon a Duchess 8lb and Countess lib both went to Mr George Elliott at 400 guineas each while Mr S Gardiner secured Agamemnon a Lady 4th at the same price Mr Elliott also acquired two splendid cows in Agamemnon'B Lady 0th and Baroness 6th, each at 300 guineas? Among the progeny of other sires Maribyrnong a Princess and Countess 3rd, both sold to Mr G Maiden, of New South Wales brought the highest prices the former going for 300 guineas, and the latter for 300 guineas The majority of the cows offered on the first day were in calf to the 8th Duke of Tregunter imported by Mr Fisher, and one of the only two pure Duchess bulls in the colony final fact, in addition to the merits of the animals, was an inducement to purchase The proceeds of the first day's sale amounted to nearly 15 000 guineas, or on average of about 100 guineas per head On the second day, high prices still ruled for an) thing showing good breeding and quality), while in one or two instances something like sensational bids were recorded Operations were commenced with the bulls, the first animal sent into the ring being the grand sire 8th Duke of Tregunter, bred by Colonel Gunter of Uetberb) grange, and imported by Mr Fisher This bull having the advantage of a double strain of the famous Duchess blood through his dam Duchess 113 th, and his sire the 3rd Duke of Collingham, was the object of keen competition among the stock breeders present He was started at 1000 guineas, and advanced rapidly by 100 guinea bids to 4,000 guineas, at which sum he was knocked down amid cheers to Mr Samuel Gardiner, of Bundoora park This is by far the highest price ever paid for a shorthorn bull in the southern hemisphere A number of the Agamemnon bulls also sold well several of them falling to the bid of Mr G Elliott, of Queensland, at prices ranging from 400 guineas down to 200 guineas One of the same train was also purchased by Mr John Lee, of Bathurst N S W at 420 guineas and another by Mr C Rowe, of Queensland, at TOO guineas After the high figure obtained for the sire, nearly all of Tregunter a stock Bold well Tregunter Prince, from Pink 16th, the dam of a large number of prize winners, going to Mr C D Rowe at 430 guineas As the animals of this strain offered were nearly all calveS the prices obtained were very satisfactory Farewell a beautiful red and-whitecal£ by 8th Duke of Tregunter, with a dash of the famed frederica blood on the dam s side, went to Mr Gardiner at 400 guineas, while tregunter s Baroness, from an Agamemnon dam, became the property of Mr John Lea at 140 guineas Oxford a Dowager 2nd-with the Duchess blood on the sire a aide-being a calf from the cow sold to Mr Gardiner at 700 guineas Boon ran to 400 guineas, the executors of the late Hon Niel Black being the purchasers A number of the other calves submitted also sold extremely well, the) amount realised by the two days Bale being 31 741 guineas ANNUAL SALE OF THE ERCILDOUNE MERINOES. The annual sale of high class merinos from the flocks of Sir Samuel Wilson took place on the 20th October at Ercildoune, under the conduct of Messrs. 1 Fisken and Gibson There was a good attendance of buyers, especially from River me That district was well represented both by stockowners and agents the Ercildoune stock having made for themselves a reputa- tion which induces the same buyers to return year after year Of direct buyers, Messrs. McFarlane Bros operated to the largest extent of the high class stud rams, Mr T. Shaw bought Goldwmnerat 300 guineas , also one each at 50 guineas 28 guineas 44 guineas, and 22 guineas, and two at 20 guineas ; Messrs. Landale Bros, one each at 35 guineas and 20 guineas and two at 11 guineas and 21 guineas Mr J Baillie, three at 20 guineas, one at 37 guineas, two at 17 guineas 12 guineas, 15 guineas, and BO os. The stud ewes sold at 17 guineas downwards. A large number of flock ewes were disposed of and a few flock rams, making altogether about 4,000 head, and realising upwards of £8,000 S ILE 01 MR HENRY MILLER'S DRAUGHT HORSES'. 1 be fine stud of draught horses bred by Mr. H Miller was disposed of by auction by Messrs Campbell, Pratt, and Co , at Kirk's Bazaar on November 1 There was a good attendance of buyers, and the prices realised for some of the more fancied lots were very high The highest priced animal in the list was Princess of Wales 5th foaled 1877, by Pride of Scotland (imp Princess of Wales, who was purchased by Mr R Mitchell for 25 guineas Smiler, the imported Lincoln- shire mare was also secured by Mr K. Mitchell for 190 guineas The old mare's daughter Smilers Pride, by Nugget, was bought by Mr T Bear for 300 guineas Mr. T Bear also bought Darling 2nd, by Drew's Prince of Wales from Darling (imp ) for 300 guineas The highest priced yearling filly was Blossom 2nd, by Roderick Dhu from T. IC. BlOBBom, bought by Mr Grant for 150 guineas. The sireS Scotland a Pride and Nugget were passed in, the prices not reaching the owner a limit A number of young geldings bred in the stud were sold after the stud stock, and fetched excellent prices THE LABOUR MARKET The past fortnight has been a broken one, owing to the annual Spring Meeting of the Victoria Racing Club The Cup Day) is a general holiday and a very large number of the employees who are paid piece work take a weeks holiday, often occasioning great annoyance and inconvenience to their employers. This is particularly the case with regard to the boot and clothing factories, where large orders for the inland towns or the adjacent colonies are in progress, and their completion delayed Business is pretty brisk, and as usual the supply of good workmen far short of trade requirements In the tailors order shops this has been particularly the case, and in some of the beat shops, notwithstanding the high rate of wages paid, dozens of orders have recently been refused, employers finding it impossible to obtain the requisite number of hands to carry out the wishes of their customers The building trade continues brisk, and promises to improve, as a large number of building sites have recently been sold in the suburbs, and in many places building has already commenced With regard to female domestic servants, we learn from the leading registry offices that it is simply an impossibility. to meet the demand the supply not being in the market Wages are quite a secondary consideration with many ladies, so long as they obtain good and suitable servants In one office alone there are orders waiting execution for nearly 20 female cooks for all parts of the colony at wages varying from £10 to 252 per annum, and in a few exceptional cases as high as 200 per annum would be given House and parlour maids, laundresses, and general servants are equally scarce, whilst the demand for girls from 10 to 20 years of age as general servants is rapidly increasing _ VICTORIA RACING CLUB SPRING MEETING The great racing season of the year-the V R C Spring Meeting terminated on Saturday, the 4th Inst Regarded from a sports- man s point of view, it was most successful throughout, the racing being of a high order, and the competing horses being the best which the colonies can produce In other respects, however, the holiday makers had reason to be somewhat dissatisfied, the chief ground of complaint being the unpropitious weather prevailing during the Cup Day, which is thecentralfoatureofthewhole sporting) ear. The morning was dull and cloudy, but in spite of the threatening sky, and the rain which was foretold in the weather forecast, thousands of people went to Fleming ton race course clad in garments fitted only to be worn in the dry heat of summer The consequence was that when a persistent downpour deluged the course the spectacle presented was anything but what Victorians have been accustomed to witness on these occasions The dresses displayed by the ladies in the Grand Stand and on the lawn were equal in brilliancy and costliness to those of former years, but their beauty was sadly marred by the weather A large proportion of the visitors left as soon as the principal race was run, though shortly afterwards the rain cleared off, and a dull but dry afternoon succeeded The attractions of Cup Day having been so greatly interfered with, they were in great measure transferred to the Steeplechase day, which terminated the meeting, when the weather was all that could be desired The attendance on the latter occasion exceeded that recorded at any previous Steeplechase or Derby Day, and the appearance of the various reserves set apart for the use of the public was of an animated and brilliant character, and such as to strongly call up memories of the past glories of Cup Day In consequence of a domestic bereavement, His Excellency the Governor was not present during the meeting The various colonies, however, were very numerously represented, most of the leading sportsmen of New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania being present. The meeting commenced on Saturday, October 28, the first race being the Melbourne Stakes Ten horses started, and an additional interest was given to the event, as New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria were all represented Darebin, the winner of the previous year's Derby, was the favourite at even money Jessie, Sting and Cunnamulla being fancied and backed by large numbers The race was an uneventful one, the favourite taking the lead from the start, and maintain- ing it easily until the winning post was passed. Belmont was second, and Larpent third. After this victory Darebin was backed to win some thousands in the Melbourne Cup j at outside odds The next race, the Hotham Handicap, found 13 starters First Water was a strong favourite at 7 to 2, Odd Trick being also heavily backed, and Commotion and I Sardonyx receiving considerable support The pace was made very hot throughout, a circumstance which just suited Odd Trick, who came out at the distance and won pretty easily Surdons x and Commotion being second and third respectively The winner is descended from King of Clubs, and has on two or three previous occasions performed in a very creditable manner The Maribyrnong Plate, for two year olds, brought out 28 fine juveniles, representing the coming equine federation Of the whole number Victoria has six entries and New South Wales 11 Nurina was first favourite, having an excellent record both at Randwick and Flemington, and many of the other horses found supporters Nanua, passing Kingsdale and Lady Jervois, gained the lead and won by about half a length, Kingsdale second, and Lady Jervois third The winner was bred by the Hon E K Cox, at Fernhill, New South Wales, and is by the defunct sire Yattendon, by Atholino This was her first appearance in public She is entered in numerous engagements in the VRC and A J C programme, and her performances will be looked forward to with interest The usual amount of excitement surrounded the Derby, for which ten horses started, several of them being heavily supported. Navigator was backed freely at level money, Segenhoe, Guesswork, Boolka, and Fryingpan being fancied by large numbers Aide-de-Camp Standard Bearer, Transferred, Carma, and King of the Vale were not regarded with much favour The start was a splendid one, and Guesswork, pushing to the front, made the pace a furious one Segenhoe lost several lengths by a stumble which was within an ace of being a serious accident Transferred joined Segenhoe in the van, and the two raced together several lengths ahead of the others until they had gone a considerable distance At this time the favourite was last but one, something having interfered with him, but his jockey, Wales, when coming into the straight, called upon his colt, which responded gamely, and won easily, to the evident gratification of the spectators, who cheered lustily as the jockey was weighed in. Navigator was bred by Mr De Mestre at Terrara, and has proved himself to be the finest colt of the year. His colour is a handsome black, and he has a dashing action Trying I pan finished second, in front of all that he had beaten in the Caulfield Guineas. Segenhoe obtained third place, his chances having been interfered with by the stumble which occurred at the commencement of the race Only three put in an appearance for the Essendon stakes, and odds on SylvanUB were freely laid, the colt winning easily The Coburg Stakes brought out 25 starters Wizard won easily, with Master Avenel second, and Verdure third This concluded the first day's racing On the second or Cup Day the first race was the Maiden Plate, for which seven numbers were hoisted Belmont was a strong favourite with odds upon him, and he won from Carma and Gostwyck, which were second and third, without difficulty Six started for the Railway Stakes, Boolka, Larpent, and Prometheus being backed at short odds. The favourite came in an easy winner in front of Colstoun and Larpent Lady Jervois was made the favourite for the Kensington Stakes, for which 16 started, the only other horses backed being Halifax and Off Colour, the three horses finished in the order named The race for the Melbourne Cup was run in pouring rain, this fact no doubt accounting largely for the unexpected termination which was witnessed. Sweet William was the favourite at 4 to out of a held of 25, Mistaken, Little Jack, and Odd Trick being well supported Just before the start Cunnamulla kicked the favourite bd verely in the thigh, and no doubt considerably interfered with his chances of success It lying Jib took up the running, but he was de I need of the lead by Stockwell as the turn was readied Shortly afterwards The Assyrian, Darebin, Gudarz and Segenhoe looked dangerous, but the leader was only collared when inside the distance, by The Assyrian, who struggled with him a moment, missed him, and finally won by a short length, Stockwell being second, and Gudarz third The other horses finished in the following order -Darebin, Lord Burghley, Savanaka, First Water, Cunnamulla, The Drummer, Polho, Segenhoe, Odd Trick, Sweet William Santa Claus, Lord Lisgar, Jessie, Sting, by lv anua, Little Jack, Angle eey, Standard Bearer, Flying Jib, Mistaken, King of the Vale, and Brunette This victory was not a popular one, as the horse was not supported after his recent defeat at Caulfield, the odds against him being 33 to 1 There were very few winners on the event, Mr. James Allan, one of the owners of the three, being the largest he landing about £1,000 The Assuan is by the imported horse Countryman, from Tinfiuder, and was bred by the late Mr R Holland, of South Australia. The Darling Stakes found But starters. Essex was made favourite and won in a leisurely manner by a couple of lengths ahead of Sinking Fund and Tamworth Tyropean was the favourite out of the 17 starters for the final event, the Yan Yean Stakes. Bagot won without do all culty, Colewort and Verdure being second and third The third days racing-the Oaks Day took place on the following Thursday The Hurdle Race called out a field of 13 of which Lothair retained first position from first to last, and won easily, Discount and BaBaliBk obtaining second and third places. Great interest was manifested in the Royal Park Stakes, as was expected that Navigator would be opposed to Darebin. The former, however, did not start, and Darebin, on whom odds were freely laid, won easily, amidst great acclamation For the Flying Stakes there was a splendid field of 23 starters Kingsdale, the favourite, won cleverly by half a length from St Lawrence and Larpent, who occupied second and third positions, Nineteen faced the starter for the Spring Handicap Verdure, Bagot, and Colstoun were most in demand, but the South Australians supported Standard Bearer strongly, and this fine colt won by the splendid jockey ing of Cracknell, Lesbia and The Czar obtaining situations Previous to the start, Master Avenel commenced to kick, and his violence resulted in breaking the leg of Opie, who was riding Brunette Odds were laid on Solitude in the Oaks for which there were six starters. Vaucluse, however, won by three parts of a length, Solitude being second, and Eva third. The Veteran Stakes was the last item on the programme. Eighteen horses went to the post, Commotion winning rather easily. The AsBynun and First Water were next in order, Stockdale, the favourite being nowhere in the final or Steeplechase Day the first event was the Flemington Stakes, which brought out 25 two year olds Middle march won, a length and a half in front of Duenua, Too Too being third. Of the 16 starters for the Mares' Produce Stokes Segenhoe was made favourite, Frying- pan being next in demand The result was a surprise to many, Boolka, who led half way up the straight, being collared by Canna, who beat him in the last few strides by nearly a neck Segenhoe, by a fast rate, ran a dead heat with Boolka for second place, and the general opinion was that he would have won outright had his jockey called upon him earlier For the V R C Handicap there were 11 starters, the Czar being the favourite, and First Water, Lord Burghley, and Gudarz being well supported Hales, who rode the last named horse, won cleverly by a head in front of Gipsy Cooper, Lord Burghley being third. The Steeplechase found 11 competitors. Left Bower was made favourite at 6 to 4, Alhambra at 0 to 1, and Hieroglyph at 8 to 1 being well supported The race was won by Mr R. Howie s Kanaka by a length in advance of Sailor. Left Bower finished gamely, but was only able to secure third place, his heavy weight telling upon him severely. Five horses faced the starter for the Canterbury Plate, and the race resulted in a match between Darebin and Commo- tion, not one of the others having the slightest chance. The two horses kept well together during the major part of the race, each taking the lead alternately. Finally, Commotion made a grand effort, and won by three lengths Sweet William was third, and The Assyrian fourth. The Free Handicap terminated the proceedings of the day and of the meeting There were 18 starters and the pace was a fast one through out The Plunger, who was the favourite, won comfortably by a couple of lengths, Anglesey and Flying Jib filling the situation > SPORTING Jtc.

Company. The Marine Board, after deliberation, found that the Woniora was lost in consequence of having been deeply laden, and from having probably been driven too fast to contend with the exceptionally heavy weather she encountered, and that as her master, who was lost in her, had discretionary power in loading her, the board could only attribute the fatal accident to the weather and other perils of the Ben Under these circumstances they considered that there was no evidence on which to found a charge against the owners of the vessel A largely attended meeting has been held to make arrangements for a memorial to perpetuate the memory of the late Dr Lang A resolution was passed in favour of erecting a memorial, and also affirming the desirability of founding a scholarship in connexion with the Technical College Over £300 was subscribed at the meeting There has been throughout most parts of the colony a splendid rainfall of over 3in and the rain came SO steadily, and at such convenient intervals, that none of it was wasted.

Mr Bryce, the Native Minister, has made final and definite proposals to Tawhiao, the Maori King, to abandon his kingship and submit absolutely to the Queen's law. The Government would then give back about 20,000 acres of unsold confiscated land, but would BBk the Mariposa chiefs to provide land for the Waikato tribe, their former partners in evil The Government would also build and furnish a house for Tawhiao, allow him a pension of £100 a year for life, make him assessor: under the resident magistrates and native lands acts, and a justice of the peace for the colony, and would call him to the Legislative Council Tawhiao has refused the offers made by Mr Bryce He objects to resign his position BE Maori King Arrangements are being completed for the direct steam service between New Zealand and England The agent general will fix terms and conditions the choice of New Zealand ports is to be left entirely to the contractor, who is limited only to the four chief ports and may call only at one each time beat Auckland, Wellington, Lyttelton, or Port Chalmers) or may visit all four both ways at every trip Sir F Dillon Bell is to have the tenders in by the end of December or beginning of January if possible, as it is intended to strain every nerve to get the line started by the time named , April next On October 21 a railway accident occurred near Blueskin to the 4 12 p.m. train from Dunedin to Oamaru like train comprised a six wheeled coupled ' r engine, five passenger carriages, one roadside waggon, and the usual break-van All the passenger carriages were crowded, and there must have been fully 80 persons on board The engine, from some unknown cause, jumped off the line, and after running a short distance on the sleepers it was brought up by the left bank of a cutting The result waspeculmr and showed the extreme violence of the concussion the waggon next to the engine was thrown off the line and fell on its side lying at right angles to the engine, and completely blocking the opening on one side of the en Mine cab The couplings of the first two carriages were snapped to pieces. The first carriage did not capsize, but it also went across the line, the front platform striking the cab of the engine with great violence The second carriage was also very materially damaged, its fore part broken in the collision with the second, and its windows shattered The other two carriages and the van left the line, but were not damaged, and beyond a little rough jolting nothing unusual was experienced by their occupants Those who saw the wreck agreed that the escape of the passengers was astounding Those only who were in the two front carriages were injured, and of these only two at all seriously Other passengers sustained slight cuts and bruises WESTERN AUSTRALIA Chief Justice W Wrenfordsley has been promoted to the chief justiceship of Fire, and is expected to proceed there shortly.

The schooner Roderick Dhu, engaged in the labour trade, has arrived at Maryborough, Queensland, from Polynesia. While the Roderick Dhu was recruiting islanders the boats were of frequently fired upon from the shore Rifles have become so plentiful in the island generally resorted to for labour that recruiting has become exceedingly difficult and dangerous Some of the Roderick Dhu return boys were landed at Paris, and immediately seized and murdered, and afterwards eaten by the inhabitants. The Roderick Dhu spoke the schooner Helena, also home Maryborough, which vessel reported that three boys were landed at Apia, and immediately murdered by the people there Two of the bodies, which were left on the beach, were recovered by a boat's crew from the Helena, and bailed at sea. The Helena further reported that while the boats were away recruiting a number of islanders boarded the schooner and incited, the recruits to seize the vessel! When the boats returned a serious conflict ensued, and the mutiny was quelled, but not before three of the islanders had been killed The City of Melbourne, from Noumea, brings intelligence of another massacre in the New Hebrides at a place named Vanikoro, a Riche de mer station.

vineyard company, with a capital of £50 000 to buy and prepare for market colonial wines Since the departure of the last mail, trains actions in the import market have not been of much consequence , but the fact of several holidays intervening has, no doubt, to some extent had the effect of making business of a more quiet nature Inquiries, however, are of a more promising character, and traders now look for increased activity after such a long period of dulness Moreover, nothing has occurred to shake confidence III business circles The reports from the country are encouraging and from nearly all sides we hear that fair average crops are anticipated Ales and Stouts are in very good demand, and BorcelarfcelineBhavechanged banda For jute goods there is not much inquiry, but the market will probably be stimulated by the addition of two cargoes of Calcutta goods, which have just arrived Cornsacks have had slight attention, but only in small parcels for immediate requirements Wool packs have hardly been noticed Candles have been in moderate request, but no parcels of any importance have been disposed of Tor fruits there has been a more active demand, and owing to the short shipments from home to the other colonies, as well as to this port, a speculative movement net in, which resulted in all available parcels on the spot and to arrive being taken up at an improvement on prices lately ruling Holders are now very firm, and very full prices are required Russians have also been noticed to some extent, Sultana and Eleme especially being in favour New Valencias have also been sold at an improvement on late quotations The breadstuffs market continues quiet and the few transactions reported are only of a limited character The rains which have been ex- perience latterly have been of great benefit to the country, and reports from most districts give a satisfactory account of the probable crop to be harvested this year in the face of these accounts holders of wheat are anxious to clear out all surplus stocks, and we hear in consequence of some good lines being offered freely, but buyers are very cautions and will only purchase for their immediate wants We learn, however, of one or two fair parcels having changed hands The arrivals from the country continue on a very fair scale The receipts at Melbourne and Sandridge for the week ending 4th November are 1,803 bags of flour and 2 302 bags of wheat, while the shipments for the same period amount to 3 202 bags of flour The total arrivals for the year now reach 233 992 bags of flour, and 888,131 bags of wheat,

the average will not be under six bushels per acre, which is far better than could have been hoped for a fortnight back , also that wheat reaping has begun in the district of Hawker, in the far north and is turning out fairly, and that average parcels of new wheat have been sold, for delivery before November 13, at 4s 11d Feeding grains have not been in such good demand Since we last wrote, though this week has opened with a better inquiry Stocks of Victorian oats are very light, and as the first crop cannot come in till towards the close of the month, and the trade are almost cleared out, prices will most probably slightly recover themselves Bonded oats are in large supply, but the actual cost leaves a very heavy IOBB if sold at present prices Holders are therefore very firm, and not anxious to quote The latest advices from New Zealand quote an advance there in price and also state that stocks are very light, and large lines unobtainable Reports from Tasmania have also been received to the same effect. Hops continue in active demand, but little remains to operate upon Imported malt has had moderate attention. The sugar market has been considerably stimulated by the arrival of two cargoes of new season's sugars from Mauritius The first cargo, ex Golden Fleece, was put up to auction, but little was sold Privately, however, good lines continue to move I off at full rates The Brunette"s cargo was nearly all disposed of under the hammer, but the prices realised showed a slight decline, after the sale, however, better prices were obtained Teas have not been noticed, pending the sales to be held to-morrow and next week, when some large lines both of Foochow was India will be offered Timber continues to sell a fair quantities, but prices are barely ena famed For tobaccoes there is not much demand, stocks both here and in the adjoining colonies being very heavy. Wines are moving off freely in fair sized parcels spirits are also in moderate request but no special lines have changed hands During the past fortnight the wool sales of Melbourne and Geelong have become of considerable importance, and large Bales of important Riverina and Western district clips have been effected The highest price paid for greasy Riverina wool has been lid which was obtained on Friday last for 45 bales of very light conditioned merino from near Corowa Other light conditioned merino wools have ranged from 2d to HJd , while a number of clips from Western and Central Riverina not so light in condition, have ranged from 10 to 11 ,d In greasy crossbreds, too, a considerable business has been done, buyers having shown an especial preference for those of light condition, and quality approximating as nearly as possible to merino wools Riverina crossbreds have ranged, according to character and condition, for fine qualities, from 10d to 12d for medium qualities 5d to 10d and for the coarser descriptions from 7d to Id As far as the character, condition, and probable quantity of the new clip is concerned, there is now no doubt that Riverina proper will show some falling off in the quantity, and a decided deterioration in the character of the wool produced. A tenderness of staple is noticeable in most of the clips from Western, Southern, a id Central Riverina, a tendomeBS which fis, however, occasionally, though not always compensated for by an increased light ness in condition. Considering their defects these wools have sold extremely well, for they are certainly much less suitable for comb- ing purposes than usual, but then their high quality and light condition have doubtless attracted buyers The Western district wools are, upon the whole, superior to those of last year, and are generally sound and well (grown We anticipate a slight increase in the production of the wool in the Western district, as the past Benson has been favourable to pastoral pursuits. Since the commencement of the season to date, 31,9.8 bales have been offered in the Melbourne and Geelong markets, and 20,553 bales have been sold Station properties continue to be in fair request Messrs.
