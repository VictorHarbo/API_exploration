Hay Market. —Mr. James Renton reports; This market has been abundantly supplied ydfh new hay, a great quantity of which has been so green that it was scareely saleable; green fodder, also, is very plentiful, limiting* the demand for hay, consequently a number of loads were left unsold. Brices range from £3 10s. to £8 10s. ; straw* £3. Horse Market- —Messrs Purcell and Keigh- ran report: There has been a good supply of fresh horses brought forward this week, and pi ices, on the whole, were good, considering the quality of the stock. There is. a demand for horses adapted for coaching, and young colts fit for waggon work. Weeds are perfectly unsale able, and uny class of stock out of condition, ex cept at very low prices.

For ‘‘Tar rone*' station, with 2000 head of cattle, there was no offer. ' Labor Market.— Mr. Elder ton reports that the same clulness prevails in the labor market for farming men and few mowers or haymakers are asked for. Married couples are in tolerable - de mand at good wages. Male domestic servants are 1 , scarcely »sked for. Boys are now used generally where men formerly were. Female servants are inquired after for the country, but to a very litni*ed extent for this season of the year. For town, really efficient servants possessing good re ferences, meet with engagements at good wages, but the secondary class find it difficult to obtain: employment. Mechanics and skilled laborers, though willing to go out at reduced wages, are still put of employment in large numbers. Wages ju?t now are firm, and may be quoted as followsMarried couples* without fsmiilieg, £65 to £76 per annum; with families, £60 to £70 do*? gardeners, £62 to £w ; grooms, 29s. to 30& per week; shepherds, £35 to £4O per year ; hut keepers, £2O to £25 do.; general farm servants* 20s. per week ; ploughmen, 20s. per week ; bul lock drivers, on road, 255. do.; on farms and sta tions, 20s. do.; mowers, 4s. 6d. per acre; hay makers, 20s, a-week ; men cook# for farms orzUi uone, 20s. to2&>. do.; cooks, for hotels, from £2 to £4 per week; general servants, £3O to £35 per year: nursemaids, £l6 to £25 do.; laundresses, £35 do,; housemaids, £2O to £3O do.; parlormaids, £25 to £3O do.; carpenters* 1 Is. to 12s. a day; masons, bricklayers, blacksmiths, lls. to 13». do*; pick and shovel men, 7s. 6d. do.; carters and store laborers, 40s, to 60s. a week; quarrymen, 10s. to 12s. per day ; fencers, 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d- a rod; splitting posts and rails, 20s, to 30s. per 100. ■ Flour, Grain, &c.;— (Review for the month ending 24th November, IB6o.)—Mr- W. Law fence reports The corn market since the depar ture of the last English mall has been marked by some changes, important in their nature, and giving a vivid illustration of the consequences produced by rushing up the prices of breadstuff* at certain seasons, inducing speculators to esti mate a deficiency and import probably in excess of our requirements ; though no such excess can be said to exist. Three large ships from Cali fornia and two from Chili have arrived in our port within a week ; the cargoes previously to hand have yielded handsome profits, and right that it should be so, yet it Is certainly a mis-cal culation, having the bulk of these import* coming to hand at the commencement of our , harvest, while it is also true that the know ledge of foreign breads tuffs being expected has kept speculation at bay, and withthe exception of a few slight panics, and equally sudden re actions, the market has generally maintained a steady and even position, .with fair and compa ratively remunerative prices, and it is to be hoped that no restrictive or protectlve fiscal enactment will ever come into existence to interfere with the enterprise of the merchant who thus risks such a speculation; had not foreign supplies reached this market as they have done, we should have had extreme rates ruling, heavy speculations afloat, and, as has frequently been the case, losses sustained. The weather has continued changeable; rain has fallen; a few hot days have been followed by cold and rather chib ling winds | the. cipps have not, however, suffered, accounts from all quarters testifying as j to the good prospects. The reaping of cereals will be later than was at one time anticipated; while we are reaping hay here, In South Austra lia barley, oats* and wheat are being cut down and in the market; but although the harvest has thus coramenced on the Plains of that colony, in the other districts it will not be general for some weeks yet, therefore stocks of breadstuff* will likely be well absorbed before any heavy sup plies reach us. The new Land Bill came into operation on the Ist instant; nothing can as yet be said as to its working or operation, but with the many defects pointed out by its opponents the measure is initiatory of a better, and if fairly dealt with by the Government Who sees its out set, it will be a great boon to the colony, not only in facilitating the cultivation of a portion of the wastelands, but in inducing immigration—the greatest desideratum felt at the present moment/ Fiour.—lmports in September being light, have been made up by what has come to hand during this and past month, the quantity from S nith Australia being considerable, and shoving the stocks as held there’, anticipating a rise, as being large. The approximation of imports for the current month is as follows: - Tasmanian* 55 tons; South Australian, 1500 tons; Cali fornian, 100 tons; Chilian, 300 tons. At commencement of the monthpricei ranged higher for colonial sorts, but now close from £ I to 4l I Os. lower, with the turn still in. favor of the Buyer, at the following quotations:—Chilian, Tasmsmen* £l9; Adelaide sorts, £l9; Magarey's and Hart’s superfine, £2O per ton of £2OOO lbs. Wheat—lmports are con siderable* and consist as follow* '.—500 bushels Tasmanian; 9500 bushels South, Australian 55.000 bushels Californian ; 9000 bushels Chilian, High prices have been.paid, but a reaction las njw set in, new wheat has changed hands m Adelaide at 65., and for delivery in December ss. per bushel; closing quotations are nominally about Bs. per bushel of 601b. Oats—lm ports for October are about the same in ex tent as the previous month, while for the current, they are in excess of either *, for some time past supplies have been drawn from Tas mania ; however, considerable parcels have come forward from Cal utta, California, &o;, and the receipts stand thus :-From Tasmania, 30,000 bushels; from South Australia, 350 bushels ; from Now South Wales, 600 bu&heU; ; from California, 31.000 bushels ; Calcutta, 6,000 bushels ; and from the iJni'ed Kingdom, 14.000 ushels. The heavy stocks of Scotch, Irish, and some other sorts, accumulated here, to * great extent Jay un? touched, and show no signs of their about to ” suffer a recovery/’ the consumption being confined to colonial, Californian, Danish, and Dutch ; some parcels of Calcutta have been ex ported to Mauritius. With the heavy stocks remain ing on hand, and the large amount of capital lying locked up in them, might it not be worth the consideration of parties interested, while they find them a slow sale for horse feed, to introduce them for working up in distillation ? British gin, and some sorts of French brandy sent here, are distilled principally from oats while a distiller m the Uni ted Kingdom has obtained a pa ent for pro ducing whiskey from oats, which is said to be equal in quality to some descriptions made from Malt. Closing quotations are as follows : Irish and Scotch 3s. to 3s. Bd. ; Uussian and Calcutta, 3s. 6d. to 3s- 8d: Dutch, 3s. 6d.; Danish, 3s. lOd.; Californian, 3s, Bd, to 45.; colonial. 3s. I Id. to 4s- Id. par bushel of 40 lb. Barley;— There.are ho transactions to report. The harvest has commenced. Barley can be grown here un equalled anywhere Farmers will do well to give it mote attention, as developing another of our 41 resources/ 1 Maize.—lmports are heavy, yet the consumption is equal. Prices ore steady, ranging from 3s- 7jd. to 3s. 9d. per bushel of 56 lb. for maize the growth of Hew Sjuth Wales. Gram.—Two parcels are to hand from Calcutta. Sales are bein£ made at £l4 to £l6 per ton of 2240 lb. Bran.—lmports have been con siderable, and price* are lower, ranging about Is. 4d. to Is. 4jd. per bushel of 20 lb. Oatmeal.— Imports are rather on the increase. Irish and Scotch sell at £l3 to £24; Bon craft’s colonial, 625 per ton of 22401b, Malt.—lmports are on the increase, but speculators are said to be oper ating largely. Prices have-run up to 12s. 6d. and 13s. per btt/hel of 40 lb., prices which will no doubt tempt English exporters to ship, as the mal ing season will not commence here again for five months. Potatoes. —There has been a steady and active business done in potatoes at prices varying from £l3 to £l4 per ton. The new crop is in the mark?t* and is reported good, the quality proving excellent.
