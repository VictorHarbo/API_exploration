" ,^. THE GENUINE DR. JAMES' POWDER Tnthis changeable climate, COUGHS and COLDS, if neglected, too often prove fatal. Influenza invades oui- Cities, Towns, and Vil- lages, and corrys off thousands yearly. These are modified types of Fever of every kind; all are caused by checked perspiration. A Medicine which, by acting on the skin, will restore the natural flow of that secretion, is therefore what is needed in those diseases, and all kinds of Fever. NEWBEBY'S JAMES' POWDEB possesses the properties to produce this.and does it effectually and speedily. The experience of 115 years has but increased its reputation and enhanced its value in the estimation of the profession, who largely pre- scribe it. This signal success has caused many base imitations ot it, but Medical Practitioners .Save found and acknowledged that no other preparation is so sale and so efficacious ns that manufactured by Messrs. Newbery. Even in Rheumatism, Astluna, and Ague, it will be found to give great r?lief, and generally pro- duce a perfect cm e. By following the directions given with every Packet and Bottle, it can be acftninistered with perfect safety as a FAMILY MEDICINE. AS a guarantee, the original ead genuine bears the words, "F.

This preparation is one of the bene- fits which the science of modern chemistry has conferred upon mankind; for during the first twenty years ol' the present scntury to speak of a cure for the Gout was considered a romance ; but now the efficacy and safety of this medi- cine is so fully demonstrated, by unsolicited testimonials from persons in every rank of life, that public opinion proclaims thiB as one of the most important discoveries of the present age. These pills require no restraint of diet or con- finement during their use, and ai e certain to prevent the disease attacking any vital port. They can be relied upon as the most safe and effectual remedy ever offered the public, and havo been universally used in Em-ope and America for many years for the above com- plaints.
