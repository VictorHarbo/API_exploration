GILBEY'S O.E. Dit* GIN.-Defies Com- petition. OLD-AGE PENSIONS. \- TO -THE EDITOR. Sir,-Some time slice, through your courtesy, I was able lo place before the public my views on thi «.hove subject. As it is a matter of vital iwportance to many of us-indeed, H.R.H. i\<, 'Prince of Wales has declared It to be " The greatest ques- tion of the day"-I ertve your permission to recur to It again. All rfght-minded people desire the de- liverance of the aged peor from the miseries of poverty, and howden deliverance can be secured Is no longer a problem of ap- parently Insuperable cifficulty to the Now Zealand Government. "But some people may say, " Oh, the Austral;'.«! Federal Govern- ment will deal- with the matter, as the British Government Js now trying to do." But the, old age pension question is one for domestic legislation, for each Australian State will have the potter to deal with its own affairs. It is not so In England, for the British Parliament .deals with .the do- mestic legislation of Great Britain and Ire- land, hence all the botaer, and the differ- ence between a corporate union like Gieat Britain and Ireland una a Federal union like the proposed union of the Australian colonies. It would be oncroaching on the privileges of a State if the Federal Govern- ment were to take out of the hands of a State Government the matter of how to deal with Its own poor peopie. It Is .therefore a mere excuse to put the matter off for the Federal Government to deal with. If New Zealand can si easily overcome the difficulty, why cannot Queensland also do so ?-*-I ora, sir, &c;, CHARLES CASTLES South Brisbane, 24th May. Woods' Great Pepeni.lnt.
