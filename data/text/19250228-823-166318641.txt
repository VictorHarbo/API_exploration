FOREIGN MIGRATION. SOME FACTS AND FIGURES. ' 'The impression Is widespread that persons of foreign birth are entering Australia in numbers so large as to menace the preservation cf the preponderant Dritisft element Of eiir population. On this subject the Prime Minister's Department in Melbourne reports as fellows:— . The Present Position. j For the three and a half years ended; September, 1924, the average annual ex- [ cess of arrivals in, over departures from; Australia, of British, peoples was 29,120.' During the same period, the average an- j riual excess of arrivals over departures of persons of foreign birth was" 4,610, and j average annual increase in the population i by excess of births over deaths was 82,000. Assuming that only 20,000 Britons (a de crease of 9,120 on the above figure) come • here each year during the next decade, and that 20,000 aliens (an increase of 15,390 on the figure above given) are ad mitted annually during the same period; also assuming that the natural increase, in the population "remained stationary, the British population of Australia at the; end of 10 years would represent 96 per cent. of the total—a dilution of the pre sent British preponderance to the extent j . of only 2 per cent. In all probability,; however, the British assisted migrants will I (when the new agreement about to be! entered into by the British and Common- \ wealth Governments and the Governments of the six States is in operation) show an ; increase over the number who arrived during the period above stated. The num ber of unassisted Britisli migrants is un likely to decrease. It is safe to assume 'that the gain by natural increase, which ; is generally cumulative, will also be j greater ip the future. From present iu- , dications, in view of the agreements be tween the Commonwealth and certain j foreign Governments to restrict the issue of passports or the granting of visas, it is likely to be some years before ihe number of foreign arrivals readies 20,000 a year. I The Italian Government has agreed to | limit the granting of passports to persons nominated by persons in Australia, and who possess £40 each. In the case of Greeks, Jugo-Slavs, and Albaniaus, the British authorities, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, are limiting the granting of visas to passports to 100 a month in each case, and visas will not lie granted to persons unless they are in dividually in possession of £40. The Foreign Element. Tl>c census of April, 1921, showed per sons in Australia not born liere, or in the Jlritish Isles or Nov Zealand, numbered 139.073 (slightly over per cent.). The number owning allegiance to foreign Gov ernments was 48,529 (or .08 per cent.), liming the last few years, and particu larly since July, 1924 (when the latest Immigration Restriction Act (U.S.A.) came into operation) there has been a quicker movement of peoples from south ern Europe to Australia. During the three ; and a half years ended September last, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign-born immigrants numbered 16,148 (equal to 11.6 per cent, of the total foreign-born persons in Australia at the 1921 census). Tbe following table par lieularizc-s this migration:— Excess of arrivals over Nationality. Departures. Males. Females. Persons.

The action of the United States in adopt ing the quota system to restrict the flow of immigration to that country has diverted immigrants from certain Euro pean countries to Australia. In the light of this fact, the following table of excess of arrivals over departures of persons of various European nationalities, July 1, 1924, to November 30, 1924 (five months), is interesting:— Nationalities.

During the three and a half years ended September last, j excess arrivals over departures of foreign ] persons was 16,148 (4,614 a year). The above table shows they are arriving at the rate of over 10,000 a year—a large per centage increase, but not a very large actual increase. The following table shows the position in regard to the movement of Italian and Greek people to Australia, and the increase since previous census in each instance:— Totals for five months:—Finns, 230; Greeks, 924; Italians, 1,932: Jugo-Slavs, G93; Mal tese. 221; Serbs, 107; Albanians (separately recorded for only October and November), *06. Grand total, 4,213. Italians. Number at 1891 census, 3,890; increase —. Number at 1901 census, 5,057; increase 1,788. Number at 1911 census, G,718; increase 1,041.

Number at 1921 census, 3,054; increase 1,860. Thus, during the three and a half years, and particularly in the five months ended November last, the migration of Italians and Greeks has been greater than at any 1 period during 40 years. If tlie rate of tbeir incoming during the. five months period. is maintained, 6,584 will have ar rived in the year ending April next. Italian and Greek migrants to Australia averaged 150 yearly during the 30 years prior to 1901. Their present rate of arrival, 6,854 yearly, represents only .083: of tiie natural increase in our population, j According to the 1021 census the distri bution of Italians and Greeks in Australia] was:—Italians— Metropolitan, 34.5; pro-j vincial, 10.8; rural, 46.1; migratory, 8.6: Greeks—Respectively 57.3, 21.7, 18.7, audi 2.3. The majority of the people of both ' these nationalities "were married, and! could read and write the English language. United States Act. j In May, 1921, the first Immigration Re striction 21 ct was passed by the United, States Congress. This introduced the' system which limited the quota to 3 per! cent.-of the number of nationals of each country who were domiciled" in the, United -ates, .according .to the 1910 cen sus. This Act operated for a year, and was replaced by the Act which came -into: force on July 1 last. This later Act re duced the quota to 2 per cent, of the num- j her of nationals domiciled in the United j States, as determined by the census of. 1890\. The reason for this is significant.) The groat stream of so-called Nordic im-: i migration flowed to the United States .be fore 1890; the "new," or southern Euro pean immigration, came later. The striking figures in the. following table show thei great reductions effected by the new Act' m the quotas of such countries as Czeclio- ■ Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Greece, Russia, Rouniania, and Jugo-Slavjii:— J 3 p.e. 2 p.c.

I The Congress committee in reporting on | this matter said:—"The most troublesome j administrative difficulty encountered since! the enactment of the 3 per cent, law has 1 been the enforcement of the numerical j limitation. 'The actual physical counting 1 of human be'ings arriving by sbip and train lias been a task of magnitude. Mistakes have been made. Steamships have raced to port in efforts to land passengers within time limits. Delays' and disappointments have brought hardships. Distressing' ap peals for relief in individual cases have assailed the officers charged with enforce- j ment of the law. Senators and represen tatives have been besought to aid either! in nullifying the statue or in mitigating its force. All these troublesome obstacles are confidently expected to be eliminated in the event of the enactment of the new Bill. The Bill contains provision for en forcement of the numerical limitation, not by counting immigrants upon their arrival, but by counting "immigration certificates" issuable at American consulates overseas. The plan, briefly, is to issue for each nationality a number of immigration certi ficates to be placed in the hands of intend ing migrants as they obtain American visas upon their passports. Each certi ficate has a validity of two months to the time of taking ship. Therefore, the in tending migrant, having obtained his pasE port, his migration certificate, and his visa, is at liberty to proceed to the United States in the full knowledge that he will not be debarred solely by a quota limi tation. He must, however, undergo fur ther examination at port of entry, and be able to pass under the 1917 Act. Jt is expected that the number who cannot pass will be greatly reduced by the preliminary investigation. There should be no arrival of "excess-quota" cases, and there need be no racing of steamships. Australia's Position. It seems to be impracticable for Aus tralia, Which has no foreign service, to en force a quota law. Another significant passage in the report of the United States Congressional Committee is:'9—"Decisions by the committee to limit admissions of quota immigrants to 2 per cent, based on census figures of 1890, instead of 3 per cent, on census of 1910, was reached after long and careful consideration of every element. An impelling reason for the change is that it is desired to slow down the streams of types of immigrants not easily assimilated. Naturalization does not necessarily mean assimilation. The naturalization _ process cannot work well with the continued arrival in large num bers of the so-called new immigration. The new type crowds in the larger cities; it is exploited; it gains but a slight knowledge of America and American institutions. It has grown to be a great undigested mass of alien thought, alien sympathy, and alien purpose; it is a menaee to the social, political, and economic life of the country; it creates alarm aud apprehension; it breeds^ racial hatreds which should not exist in the United States, and which need not exist when the balance shaH have been restored."
