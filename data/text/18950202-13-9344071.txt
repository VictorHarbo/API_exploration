H OW DID SHE BECOME HAPPY I A lady, ratbor abovo n medium position, who shortly after marriage became sickly and every day complained of some kind of compinia until hcryotine; . husband becamo tired of hearing her troubles, and alter trying many doctors and specialists-which was, after all,'the different medicines she lind taken ta vo good purpose-aud, after ilvo years' suffering and trying ever)' nott* remedy advertised without success, atlast gavoup all thoughts of ctcr recovering her health, being very unhappy, with her husband apparently getting tired of her, until she said to her husband, "lam sorry I ever married )ou, seeing I nava brought you BO much misery, and I wish I it asdrad and savo you rurtherniisery." " Mydoar/'satd the husband, I " I have to admit you have brought mo much unhappl ncss, and I thought when I married) ou w ould add to my comfort and moko mo happy, but now, after trying so many skilled doctora and specialists, all to no pur. pose, It seems useless to try any other treatment." "Yes, I think you aro right." she said, "It will only bo spending moro money, and suoh bad times tt o can- not afford to try any moro, as I feel euro I am de- clining fast and there will soon bo an end to both of our miseries." " My dear," said tho husband, "do nob give up, so long as there is life thero Is hopo. 1 meb a gentleman tho other day tt ho asked for yon, and > after telling of your lind ututo of health he strongly recommended me to try a herbalist who has a shop in Bourko-stroot i Mentlplay and Son is tho name ho tells me. Ho has been very successful in curing many diseases after all other treatment had failed. Supposa you givo him a trial as the last resource ; be may eura you." " No, my dear husband, It seems very kind of you, but I feel sure I will never bo cured." " Well, aupposo I call on him and ace what he has to say, If it doca nat seem right ne havo nothing to pay for advice-only for medicine if I toko It for you. Thero can bo no hatrn done in that case. I will lot vott know what ibey think of your case beforo taking any medicine." Tho gentleman called, explained hia wife's Buffer- ings, and in a tcry short tinto Mentlplay and Son, of 100 Bourkc-strcet, told him that his wife only Buf- fered from disorders of both liver and kidneys, which was the cause of all her trouble, nnd she could ba cured lu less than two months and restored to per- > feet health, «'ith this assurance he consulted his ' wife, and she agreed to try our treatment. Herrase . beinir an unusually bad one, it look 12 boxes of our Liver and Kidney Pills to cure her, the cost of which was thirty shillings (30s.). The husband told us than It must hat o cost him foradticoand medicine nob less than two hundred pounds (£200). His wit o nott* enjoys the beat of health, nnd has given birth to n fino strong Bon, the first of her family, and that is how she becamo happy, ncr hus- band now goes homo to meot a happy- looking face and a loving wife; and how many hundreds aro thora who Buffer from the same and other oomnlaintu and live unhappy becauso of dlseaso, and spend their money without dcrlt Ing anv benefit, and afterwards havo to consult W. Mentlplay and Son before Boding; any relief. I cito this case, being only ono out of hundrcdi tinder much tho same circumstances. Our Liver and Kidney Pills are tho most honcflcial and rcllahlo medicino tindor the ann for male or female ndiiltu and children or infants of any ago. They do nob purge the bowels, Iherctoro act on tho liver and kidneys, and I must hero assort that anv medicinu that purges tho bowels does not cure the liver. I bato lately offered to euro tho worst case ot hydatlds gratis. All I require Is that the person sufTcring from that complaint shall get a medical mau to certify to the fact that the patient suffers from that complaint, and aiao to certify as to the re suits of treatment. The doctors say thero is no [ cure only by operation. 1 am In a position to provo that I havo cured a lady who had been operated upon seven times for h)datids previous to niy treatment tt ¡thout success, and for 14 years I havo treated that complaint without having ono failure to my knottledgo without oporatlon. We havo also re- moved and cured hundreds of pcoplo suffering from norms of all kinds, both In adults and ohildrcn, when all other treatments had failed. And for weak- ness from any causo our treatment has not an equal in the world, Thero is too much puffnod deception, and that ia the reason why a genuine article is non appreciated. Remember, no matter what you suffer from, tt o aro prepared to treat you more successful than any other person, and thercforo much ohcaper.
