A brig arrived yesterday afternoon, but in con Keiiuence of the acciilent detailed elsewhere the shipping reporter landed without boarding. Ihe Omeo, schooner. Reid, master, arrived from Yucke's Peninsula on Thursday afternoon, and w.:s spoken by the Shipping Reporter in the (Julf. lie reported that fragments of wreck, evidently portions of the missing schooner Omeo, had been picked up off f.'orney Point, so that the question of her loss i3 now positively determined. The Ernestine, immigrant vessel, still remains at the anchorage, and is likely to do so until the ensuing springs; but in the meantime her draught of water lias been somewhat reduced by the people leaving her. The single females, under Dr. Dun can's orders, were brought to the Port yesterday by the Eleanor and the Young Australian. About a hundred passengers thus went in search of friends and relatives, while others took passages in the bo.it3 to the Semaphore Jetty. The evident good feeling existing towards the master was unmis takably shown, as the crowds in passing him voci ferously cheered as if he had been a most popular character. The ALEXANDRA, brigantine, from Newcastle. ha* made a lengthy passage on account of head winds which have prevailed throughout She is very deeply laden with coal for Captain Simpson, .and having a slant of wind sailed ito the wharf without detention.
