ROCKHAMPTON. WEDNESDAY, MARCH IG, J898. TBE DAIRY PRODUCE TRADE. An influential and trusted agri- cultural journal in tlic United King- dom lias recently been calculating whether the food products of the British Empire are equal to the main- tenance of the population without foreign aid, and the conclusion to which it lias come is that, in thc event of serious international disturbances, thc Empire could rely on its own resources for food stud's. Population lias been increasing much more rapidly in the United Kingdom than home produce. The numbers of people go on multi- plying, but there is no increase in the number of acres from which they may be fed. Improved methods of farm management and land cultivation may lead to an increase of produce, but any augmentation of the land is impossible. In the colonies a different state of matters prevails. People are not numerous in proportion to the vast areas of land avail- able for the production of all the means of life. While tho limits lo the increase of live stock may be regarded as having been reached in the United Kingdom, thc time must be far distant when that eau be said to be thc case in thc colonies. In Australasia the increase of population since about 18G0, including that from immigration, has been going on at the rate of a little j over two per cent per annum ; while the increase of cattle has been proceeding at. the rate of nearly three per cent. Under the stimulus of improved export facilities, leading to a demand for the latter, thc increase in production is I likely to be still greater. And so, with regard to other things, it may be calcu- lated that the produce of the colonies may be enlarged to an almost unlimited extent. In some quarters doubts have been entertained as to the capacity of the old country to utilise the surplus of colonial products. Let it be I horne in mind that population in it I is increasing rapidly, while its utmost capabilities of production have been nearly reached without thc land being able to meet thc demands upon it. Among the proofs of this is the rapid increase of imports into it of colonial food stuffs, of which those of dairy pro- duce form an interesting illustration.

It is noticeable, moreover, that within the period referred to the in- crease has been, in all the products with one exception, to which reference will presently be mode. Within the period embraced tbe imports have risen from 6,704,906 cwt. to 6,757,952 cwt.; and the value from £21,569,655 to £24,288,827-an increase in four years of more than a million hundredweight in bulk, and upwards of £2,700,000 in value. The expansion of the butter trade has been most notable. In four years the imports have increased by 890,327 cwt. in quantity, and £3,163,318 in value. The largest supplier of butter to Eng land is Denmark, which last year sent 1,334,726 cwt., or 41-5 per cent of tho imports. Within the four years there has been a steady increase in the Danish trade. The trade with France, (he next greatest supplier, shows syrup*. toms ot decline, having fallen off within the last three years. It still amounts to .448,128 cwt., or 13 per cent of the whole. France is a populous country, and there the demand is grow- ing more rapidly probably than the pro- duction. Sweden, with 299,214 cwt., supplies '9-3 per cent; Holland, with 278,631 cwt., 8-7 per cent.; Austral-! asia, with 269,432cwt., 8'4 per cent; the United States, with 154,196 cwt., 4-8 per cent; Canada, with 109,402 cwt., 3*4 per cent ; Germany, with 51,761 cwt., 1-6 percent; and other countries, with 272,311 cwt, 8-4 per cent. From Sweden and Germany'as well as in France less butter was received than formerly. The Australasian imports show an increase on last year ; but a decrease on those of 1894 and 1895, owing to tho drought in the southern colonies. In the years just named Australasia supplied upwards of ll per cent of the butter products. Be it noted that populous countries with limited means of supply show a falling off, while Canada, Australasia, and the United States each show an increase. Holland is steadily increasing her butter trade with the United Kingdom; it rose from 165,157 cwt. in 1894 to 278,631 cwt. in 1897. Whether this was due to an increased production of butter or to what was passed oil' os butter there is some doubt. In the cheese trade, Denmark, Sweden, and Germany have no part, and the Dominion of Canada stauds at tho top of the list of suppliers, having sent half the cheese imported into the United Kingdom. Its supplies have varied within the four years, but last year was the best with Í,52C,564 cwt., or 58-G per cent of the whole. The United States supplied 24-3; Holland, 11-4; Australasia, 2-7 ; France, , 1*4 ; and other countries, l-6. The value of the cheese is not stated, but though not in . creasing her exporte in this article recently, Australia continues to hold her place among importers. The imports from Australasia last year amounted to 69,090 cwt. Here we would direct the attention of our readers to the table given above. There it will be seen that imports of margarine in . 1893 amounted to 1,299,970 cwt., valued at £3.655,344 : and they had fallen in 1897 to 936,543 cwt., valued at £2,485,370. Holland, France, and Norway were the countries which sent margarine in the following respective proportions-93-2 per cent; 3-3; and l-l. Practically Holland is the great margarine country. It is suspected that much of the butter sent from Holland is manipulated with margarine. It is to be noted that while the quantity sent to England last year, 930,543 cwt., was a small increase on that of the preced- ing year, there was a decline in value of £13,055. The deep milking cows of the Low Countries give milk poor in butter fat, but the Dutchmen seem to have acquired the art of enrolling it artificially, and preparing a marketable commodity. The uso of the article will disappear before supplies of good cheap wholesome butter from the colonies.
