The party consisted of the followin" -Captain Henry Charles Everill, leader, formerly com mander of an East Indiaman and once a to bacco planter in Sumatra, Dr J M Haacke, scientist who has had charge of museums in New Zealand and South Australia; Dr S. M. Bernays of Melbourne, Mr Goeffrey Hainsworth, of Brisbane, nautical sub-leader, Mr R. Gethin Creagh of New South Wales, sub-leader on land , Mr James H. Shaw, an enthusiastic explorer, who had formerly been in New Guinea; Mr Walter W. Frog gatt of Victoria, zoological collector; Mr Wilhelm Banerlen of New South Wales botanical collector, Mr A. H. W. Senior, of New South Wales survejor, Mr A J Vogan of New Zealand; a scientific super- numerary, and Mr William McGochan, engi- neer. The council of the society decided that if possible the party should make the Aird River, the mouth of which is about two de grees above that of the Fly River, the basis of operations. It was instructed to proceed up the river to a certain point and thence to explore the hilly country. In the event of the route by the Aird River proving imprac ticable the leader waa to choose the first available estuary to the eastward thereof, and thence to ascend the high land. In either case communication was to be kept open with the steamer chartered for the party. Very strict rules were laid down as to the use of firearms. One cardinal point to be insisted upon was that a native must never be fired upon unless the life of a member of the party was in danger. The party however, was well armed. The steamer engaged was a launch called the Bonito. Information as to the movements of the party up to a certain point was received. It was stated that they found the ascent of the Aird River to be impracticable, in consequence of the danger in crossing the Gulf of Papua from Thursday Island during the south-east monsoon season. Captain Everill resolved on his own responsibility, to ascend the Fly River, and the party entered it on Juyj 17. The natives on that river are said to be the most treacherous of cannibals. Mr. J. Douglas, the Queensland Government re sident at Thursday Island and the Rev. S. Macfarlane, who has charge, of the London Missionary Socicty's stations in the islands in the Gulf of Papua, accompanied the party about 30 miles up the river, and then re turned. On the 10th inst., a message was re ceived from Mr Douglas, then at Thurasday Island, to the effect that "reports had found currency there to the effect that Captain Everill's party had been attacked and killed and that " the only grounds for anxiety arise from the fact that two natives who went with Everill's party had returned in a canoe to Samioot and their statement was that the party was going to be attacked. This is assigned as the reason for their return." On the 11th inst, however, the Rev. S. Macfarlane arrived at Thursday Island from New Guinea with very bad news. He stated that at the mouth of the Fly River he met Karossa, the chief of Samioot, who was one of three natives who accompanied the expe dition up the river. Karossa told Mr Macfarlane that three or four weeks before he left the expedition was at the highest navigable point of the river, that the paryj was then short of provisions that it had sent him and the other Samioot men back and that it had had a brush with the natives and killed several. Mr Macfar lane could not visit Samioot, on account of unfavourable weather but he went to Brampton Island, where he heard a second story related to one of the native teachers by a Samioot woman. This second story was to the effect that Karossa undertook to pilot the Bonito up the river, that he grounded her several times, and that Captain Lverill, enraged, threw him overboard. He swam ashore, and was joined by his companions, and they stole the Bonito's boat, cutting her adrift when all hands on board the launch were asleep. In the boat they returned to Samioot, and then mustered the fighting men from four villages, procccded up the river in a big fleet of canoes, surprised the Bonito's party by night and killed all hands, taking away their skulls, excepting that of Captain Everill, whose body was brought to Samioot and there decapitated. Mr Macfarlane mentioned further that some natives in the locality had been seen with new knives, and that the exploring party had not sent down the river for mails or to him, as had been arranged. Mr Douglas sent a message, in which he stated that Mr Macfarlane distrusted Karossa's statement, and feared there was some truth in the Samioot womans story, adn that some Brampton islanders had heard Samioot men boasting that they had killed the exploring party. It is recollected also that Signor d'Albertis was several times attickcd in the Fly River, and that he dis covered that surprises formed one of the features of the tactics of the natives there. coxiLicr in mi i N aiir awo HOI M ?> 01 PARLIAMLM.
