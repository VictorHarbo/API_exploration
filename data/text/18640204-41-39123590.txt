TheTHRAClAX is a deeply-laden vessel, whicl arrived from London on Wednesday inorninfz after a passage of 124 days. To account for this i must be noticed that the vesse! is out of ordinar sailing trim; indeed, in anything like bad weathei it has been necessary to batten over the poop sky lights. In addition to this unfavourable circuin stance she was 24 days at the commencement o the voyage before passing south of (Jape Finnis terre— a point usually reached iu five or six days and a similar case of detention occurred at it conclusion; for from the Leuwin to Kanganx Island 14 days of light variables were very annoy ing. She has on board a full cargo of genera merchandise, and on deck is stowed avaluabli selection of imported stock, which has arrived ii fair condition.
