Gentlemen— I feel highly honored by com plying with your requisition, and, if elected, shall De perfectly willing to devote my best services to the business of legislation. I am, Gentlemen, Yours, obediently, JOHN CROZIER. To George Green, Esq., John Hodg- kiss, Esq., and the other Gentle men signing the Requisition. TO THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen— Having been requested to come forward as a Candidate for one of the vacancies of the Legislative Council at the forthcoming Elections, it is necessary, as I am not known to many of the Electors, to place before yon my opinions, and the measures I would support in the event of their coming before the T-tyUla. tive Council. I have been in the colonies for twenty-eight years. Although residing in New South Wales and Victoria as a squatter, I have for the last seventeen years done business here, and have now come to reside permanently in this colony for the purpose of educating my family, and am in no way connected with trade or business to infln9ii'« me from giving an impartial support to any measure that would be for the benefit of all WfaqyMi »nA the advancement of the country. Land Systems. — Desirous of encouraging bona fide settlement, I would carefully consider any plan that could be devised to render agriculture more remunerative, and to enable this colony to compete with the liberal land systems of New South Wales and Victoria. Mining.— I consider that to encourage the development of our mineral resources more liberal regulations are necessary. That measures should be devised to protect the actual dis coverer in the enjoyment of bis rights, and that a small royalty might be preferable to rent. Squatting. -|-I am in favor of a riasnifi«iatinn of runs, and liberal terms in the dry country. In favor of the principle of an assessment at per head actually depastured, the cate varying according to the value of the run. Railways. — The great want of the country is improved means of intercommunication, and cheaper carriage for its produce. Whilst sup porting liberal outlay in ordinary roads I would support railway extension on a cheap scale; also a system of tramways for horse traction. Am in favor of guaranteeing private capitalists in the execution of reproductive works. The Tariff. — I believe the taxes should inter fere aa little as possible with bade ; I am op posed to the imposition of protective dnties, as these increase the cost of living, and «ih''^ the charges upon raising produce, thereby dis abling our miners, and farmers, and others from competing in the markets of the world; but I should not object to admit, free of duty, such raw material as can be worked op into manu factured articles in the colony, and would favor a bonus to any positively new industry bene ficial to the colony. Insolvent and other Laws. — I consider they need amendment so as more effectually to pro tect the public against reckless extravagance and fraud, and at the same time better to seen re the honest but really unfortunate debtor; I also consider that a revision and simplification of many of the laws would be beneficial, as from their intricate and complex forms they as often create a crime as prevent it. Education. — I am in favor of Government aid to Education, if wholly unsectariani would sup port the extension of Education to the outlying districts, and generally assist the establishing of schools in thinly- populated localities. Constitution Act. — I am in favor of amending it in several particulars, such as T'«J'^g the office of Attorney-General not necessarily poli tical ; preventing Government contractors get ting into Parliament ; and giving the Govern ment power, as in Victoria, to remove a Judge on the address of both Houses. Immigration.— At present none is needed, but I should favor introducing suitable labor when wanted. ' Public Expenditure. — I am opposed to the multiplication of offices, and would advocate strict economy in the Government departments; supporting the appropriation of a larger share of the public revenue to opening up the country districts, and for the convenience of country settlers generally. Intercolonial Affairs.— I am in favor of fede ration, or mutual agreement for certain defi nite objects, such as the free interchange of oolonial produce, co-operation in schemes of coast defences, postal and telegraph arrange On all the various questions that may from tune to time arise, and which I have not touched upon, my best endeavors will be put forth to advance the interests of my fellow colonists, without respect to dass or party; should I be returned.

Gentlemen— I have much pleasure in acced ing to your request that I should allow myself to be nominated for one of the vacant seats in tie Legislative Council In accepting this invi tation I desire to express my sense of the re sponsibility that devolves on members of the Upper House to conserve its constitutional privileges. As members of the Legislative Council are elected for a lengthened period, more depends on their general character than on an expression of opinion cm the Ingoing topics of the day. xefer to si few of tie prominent questions now before tie public. I am in favor of borrowing English capital to a reasonable amount, to be expended in reproduc tive worire and works calculated to open np the resources of the colony. I deeply regret the temporary distxess which prevails amongst the working classes at the present time, but I trust that the dark cloud which for some months has hung over the colony will speedily pass away and better times will dawn for all classes in the community. The trade with fie Riverina districts requires the careful consideration of the Legislature, and any measure *'»'ft'g to develop that trade and remove obstructions from this important branch of its progress will have my earnest support. I shall oppose any impost or restriction calcu lated to fetter or embarrass the development of the resources of our pastoral, minoml or agricultural interests. I am, Gentlemen, yours faithfully, W.

PERRY, } Hon. Secs. ELECTORS OF THE PROVINCE. Gentlemen— The following is a brief out line of my viewB upon the laaiiing political questions of the day : — In tie present depressed condition of tie labor market, I am of opinion that immigration should be discontinued, and that Southerland's Act should be repealed. I would advocate the immediate expenditure, in public works of the large sum now at the credit of the Immigration Fund, for the purpose of affording relief to tie numerous unemployed. . I would encourage native industries by an alteration of our tariff, to admit, free of duty, all raw material, piece-goods, and paper ; and by giving bonuses to tie successful establish ment of any new and useful industry. I would advocate a very liberal alteration of our Land Act, to enable bona fide settlers to obtain land on such terms as would enable them to compete successfully with tie neighboring colonies. I consider it essential to the prosperity of the agriculturist, that he should have a cheap means of conveying his produce to tie nearest outlet, and to that end would advocate cheap tramways throughout the various agricultural and ™i«iwg districts wherever practicable. I would seek to encourage the development of our mineral wealth, by a more liberal code of regulations. I am in favor of a fair.dassincation of 'squat ters' runs, and would grant liberal terms to the lessees of the Far North country. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, JAMES C. VERCO. North Adelaide. ? thstfm5x2 MR.
