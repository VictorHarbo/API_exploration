COMMERCIAL. . Age Office, Saturday Evening. There were no export entries passed for gold nt the Customs to -da}'. Tlie attention of Engisli companies is constantly being attracted to Victoria as a promising field of operation. Amongst the latest additions to our now ample list of Insuranco Companies wo observe tho Colonial Lifo Assurance Company, which, as its name indicates, deals solely in lifo assurances. By the company's advertisement, which appenrs else where, wo observe that an influential local directory has been secured, and that Mr John Watson has boon appointed resident secretary. From tlio last published report (May, 18C2) tlie company's opera tions are shown to be upon an extensive scale. Tho assurances accepted during tho preceding twelve month amounted to £439,565, and tho annual re venue had increased to £126,719. Tho insurers havo the guarantee of a subscribed capital of ono million sterling, and an accumulated fund at that date amonnting to £-149,767. Another quiet and dull week has been passed in tlio import market ; though at auction largo quan tities of various descriptions of goods havo been disposed of, at, in many instances, ratker low rates ; this is, however, an improvement on the previous week, when no desire at all was evinced to operate at any price. Privately, it is found very difficult to effect sales, tho only speculativo trans action reported being that of three'hundred cases ham3 and bacon, on which article a considerable advance in England is advised. About six thousand boxes of candlcs liavo been disposod of under tho hammer. On the Colonial Company's and on Scotch ale a reduction lias been submitted to. Bynss's stout has improved slightly. Corn sacks havo given way. Cement and American plaster aro again lowor. Breadstuffs aro firm, though sales havo been limited. Hops are easier. Malt is in fluenced unfavorably by English advices. Salt is un changed. Sugar is languid — tho market, however, has not been unduly pressed. Rico receives no attention. Tea is inactive. Tho finer descriptions of tobacco look healthy, inferior sorts are difficult to quit. Therois no improvement on wines and spirits. Tho Bombay, with tho European mails and dates to 27th July ; arrived in tho Bay on Thursday afternoon 10th instant, the lettors wero delivered in most in stances that evening. Tho shipments for the month amount to £529,838, and show a decline on tho pro vious ono of May- Juno, of £77,273. From Calcutta we are advised of tho departuro for this port during the month of tho Mary AnDe with 5000 bags, tlie Gaspard with 11,176, the Aurifera with 8299, and the Alfred the Great with 13,000 bags rice. Tho Elizaboth for Melbourne, and tho Prodo for Sydney, wero left loading. Advices from Chiua intimato tho sailing of tho Congo and Emma Matilda for Sydnoy, the Energia from Whampoa for Molbourne, the Alert from Foo Choo for Adelaido, tho Caroline and tho Charlotte for Molbourne ; tho Ariel and Meander were loading likowiso for Melbourno. Sufficient timo has not yet elapsed to ascertain tho tendency of advices on tho markets ; we fear, how over, that any hopes of an improvement from that source will be disappointed. The British and foreign arrivals comprise only four vessels from England besides tho mail steamer. Ale and Stout. — Tho cold wenther prevailing prevents any increased demand for bulk ale ; sales, therefore, continuo on a limited scale. Prices, however, seem to have reached their lowest, as, notwithstanding tho stocks hold, importers, savo iu ono or two instances, do not feel inclined to accept lower rates. Bass's No. 3 is placed in small lots, nt £7 to £7 5s. Allsopp's finds buyers at £6 15s to £7. Joules' realises £7 15s. Carlisle Co's. brings £7 12s Gd to £7 15s. Marriau's has been sold at £7 Gs to 7s 12s 6d. Sales of Colonial Co's. havo been offered at £6, showing a de cline on former prices. Be3t brands of Scotch ale sell for £G — but some descriptions have been quitted at less money. 100 hlids were placed to-day, the price was not stated. There is no change to report on bulk stout, for which tho inquiry is very slack, Taylor, Walker nud Co.'s is offered at £7 ; Whit bread's, nt £6 15s ; and Allsopp's, at £6 10s. Bot tled nle is only in request for trade purposes, at 93 6d to 9s 9d, for Bass's and Allsopp's ; 9s 6d for Joules' ; 8s Cd for Colonial Co.'s ; and 8s 9d to 9s 3d for other brands. The speculative purchases, last week, in Bynss's stout, having re sulted in clearing off tho market most of recant arrivals, holders have assumed a firmer attitudo ; and though a salo at 8s Cd is still reported, 8s 9d has, in several instances, been refused, 9s being asked. Dunpliy's is offered freely at 9s. Burke's lias been sold at 9s 6d. Blood's is held by some at 10s, but the brand can bo bought at less. Jlachen's cannot be obtained under 9s Od to 10s ; and Henry White and Co.'s at 10s to 10s 3d, but at these rates sales aro. of courso, unimportant. Tho shipments udvised by tlio mail just in show a con siderable decrease upon bulk, but glass is not so favorable ; the former is equal .to 2293 hhda., and tho latter to 10,093 cases. Bagoi.vo. — Calcutta corn sacks are sold at 13s ; for Dundee 14s is asked. No sales of woolpacks havo lutoly como under our notice, we quote prices at 5s IJd to 5s 3d. The shipments of sacks for the month aro valued at £7303, and nearly equal in ex tent the previous five months.

On Tuesday, UOOO boxes renlised, for full weights, 9d to 9§d, aiul7d to 7§d for light weights ; 1280 boxes full weights, likewise faulty, wero also disposed of at ' markot rates.'

Previous to re ceipt of English advices quotations ranged from 8s 3d to 8s 6d — tho latter liguro having been ob tained for a Bmall bin ; but since, parcels could hardly be placod at those ratos.
