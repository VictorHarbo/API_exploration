' A S T L E 31 A I N E ELECT I ON. To the ELECTORS of CASTLEMAINE. Gentlemen, — At the urgent roquest of a large number of tho electors of Castlemaine, I ofl'or myself as a candidate for your suffrages. I maintain that tho Legislative Assembly, as re presenting the mass of the people, ought to possess the entire control of the country's finances, aud am prepared to support tho Tariff passed by tho late Assembly, although 1 believe several unimportant items may require to bo modified hereafter. I am in favor of a liberal administration of tho Land Act, 1865, believing that tho settlement of a yeoman class on the lands will be conducive to tho permanent prosperity and happiness of tho country. T am iu /rtvor or xne total nuuiuion or the export duty on gold, as I consider it to bo a tax on the labor of tlie miner, who, in toiling, very often for a maintenance, has to undergo risks and privations unequalled by r.»y other class of the community. With tho view to a reform of the constitution of the Legislative Council, I am prepared to support any measure, having for its objcct tho extension of tho franchise, by reducing the qualification of both electors and members, so that that branch of the Legislature may become a fairer representation of tho intelligence and wealth of the country than as at proscnt constituted. With regard to tho questions of Protection and Free Trade, 1 would decidedly tax such articles as we are in a position is produco or manufacture hero for revenue purposes ; whilst 1 would admit those arti cles of every day consumption, such as sugar and tea, duty free. I believe that a moderate amount of protection to industrial enterprises would very soon place us in the position of being exporters instead of importers ; and the means thereby afforded for constant employment to the laborer would do more for the country than any system of free or assisted immigration. I shall endeavor, so far as tho short time at my disposal before the day of election will permit, to seo you personally and explain my views moro fully ; and if you do me the honor of electing mo as one of your representatives, my best endeavors will be used to promote the interests of Castlemaine, in an industrial as well as a political point of view. J have'the honor to be, Faithfully yours, \Y. G. BAILLIE. [ Melbourne, 20th January, 1866. 45 04 0LLTN6W00D ELKCTION.- UNITED COM .MITTEE for the return of 3re£srs EDWARDS, EMBLING and REEVES.

Welsh. 5/ 026 j mo tlio ELECTORS of EAST &ELEOURNE.; s gentlemen, — Having beeft sc\icited by a large ? ' section of the elcctorB of #Kst Melbourne to offer j , myself as a candidate for, ?ts representation in Par- j 'lament, and feeling, ftS I do, that the present iit portent political sitmtffdn of tho country affords tine 1 an opportunity of giving effect tofconvictions Wiich I have held for ma'ny years on the subject of en- | souraging local -iudustrie« and mamifac'Siros, I 1 readily place my services at tho dispowl of tho eleotors of t:lfe district. Fourteen .years' experience as a mftiufacturer in - Melbourne his produced on my mind the conviction that onlv with suoli a tariff as will afford encourage ment to ''local manufactures can tho mechanical skill of 'Oitr operative classcs bo dcvoloped, provision n.xia 'far tho proper training and future employment j of e)l-r:youth, nativo industries established, and the ' material interests of tho c-o'.onv permanently se cured. I shall, therefore, oarnestly support the - fiscal changes contemplated by the presout Adminis brstion. J The conduct of tho Ministry in the defence of tho privileges of tho Assembly against tho oncroach- - ments of tho Council 4ias my warmost approval ; and I would, if elected, offer them my strenuous advocacy and support in their determination to v preservo to tho people, through their representa tives, tho timo-honored right to control tho taxa tion of tlio country, which is in fact the only true safeguard of the nghts and liborties of tlie people. Without a thorough reform of the Upper House, I , feel convincod there can never bo that accord » and good feeling between tho two Chambers j of Legislature, which it is necessary should exist, in order to secure practical imd pro gressive legislation and a full representation of all interests of the community in both chambers. I shall therefore support tho proposition for reducing tho prosent extravagant qualification for both mem bore and oloctors, and also tho giving the Governor power to -dissolve the Council when any bill shall have , twice passed tho Assembly and been twice rejected £ by tho Upper House. I have tho honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, 48 -05 WILLIAM WILLIAMS. J* Election Notices. fJIO THE ELECTORS OF EAST MELBOURNE. GENTLEMEN, — For tlio third time, I offer myself for re-election r.s ono cf your representatives' in the ' Commons' of Victoria. The present political feud lias arisen out of an in disposition on the part of tho 31anchester class of importers and middlemen's refusal to pay a very small sliaro of taxation. Those traders make this country their home but for a few years, after which they tako their departuro for other climes, and with overflowing pockets, and with coarse jibes and sarcastic sneers on their tonguos at colonial society, they libel our institutions and dofamo our social condition. They also, through their organised subsidies, havo mado a cat's paw of tho Council Chamber. They have, by the samo moans, won the favor of a portion of tho press ; and have immortalised themselves by repeatedly in sulting our most gracious Qneen, in tho person of our impartial and independent Governor. Tho aim of this class is to fix the burthen of tho taxation on other shoulders than tlioir own, to dis courage all manufactures, to subvert the Land Act ; and above all, and worso than all, to rob ,u; of tlio suffrage. Aye, to rob us of the eternal, unalienable birth right of all freo men. Think of that, you bank clerk, you shop assistant., you artisan. You aro to be disfranchised, together with him who follows tho plough or wields tho pick — as witness Wilberforco Stephen at Brighton, and Murray Smith at Williamstown, tho nominees of this precious elique, on the question of tho manhood suffrage. And remomber, my countrymen, we have growing up amongst us that dotcstablo class 'slioneen,' who will strive to get tho upper hand, which, ploise God, they never will, so long as we ? have the power of voting, and voting by ballot. On offering mj'self for re-olection last time, I did so independent of all classes ; but when tho timo ar rived for discussing tho question of protection, I found the Government wore honest in thoir profes sions. I found that, not only in their valuable Land Act, but in tho rovision of tho tariff, they studied tho welfare of tho peoplo. Then it was I supported them with my heart and soul, and shall continue to do so until tho solo and entiro right of raising and spending tho rovenuo of this country be conceded, without equivocation or reservation, to tho people's representatives in the Assembly Chamber. When a prudent timo shall havo arrived, I will dun for another instalment of protection ; and ns soon as possible I hope to havo tho pleasure of assisting to shape tho Council Chamber, so that it shall be really a representative institution. Should I bo honorod again by your re-electing mo, I promise to bring you back that honor unsullied, as I havo hitherto done ; and I trust I shall never be found amongst the ranks of a small-minded clique of ob structionists, but that I may uver bo in the van, where tho welfare of the country demands. ( In conjlnsion, I bog of you to wipo out of your eyes tho dust which tricksters aro using when they quote you the ' Constitution.' For centuries, jurists and ? fiolitica! economists of the highest order of intellect iavo disagreed, and will continue to disagree, as to tho construction of a sentence or the philosophy of financial economy. And if I am not prosumiug, I would say it is for you to do that necessary and common sense act, of helping to build up for all classes of our population employment suitable to their varied physical developments. , 1 am, faithfully yours, 43 93 ?
