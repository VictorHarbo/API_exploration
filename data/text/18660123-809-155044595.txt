QASTLE MAINE ELECTION. To tho ELECTORS of CASTLEMAINE. Gentlemen, — At the urgent request of a largo number of tho electors of Castlemaino, I offer myself as a candidate for your suffragos. I maintain that tho Legislative Assembly, as re presenting the mass of tho peoplo, ought to possess tho entire control of the country's finances, and am propared to support tho Tariff passed by tho lato Assembly, although 1 believe several unimportant items may requiro to be modified hereafter. I am in favor of a liboral administration of tho Land Act, 1S65, believing that tho settlement of a yeoman class on the lands will bo conducivo to tho permanent prosperity and happiness of tho country. I am in favor of tho total abolition of tho export duty on gold, as I consider it to bo a tax on tho labor of the minor, who, in toiling, very often for a maintenance, has to undergo risk's aad privations unequalled by fny othor class of tho community. With tho view to a reform of tho constitution of tho Legislative Council, I am prcparod to support any measure, having for its object the extension of tho franchise, by reducing tho qualification of both electors and members, so that that branch of tho Legislature maybecomo a fairer representation of the intolligeneo ond wealth of the country than as at present constituted. With regard to tho questions of Protection and Froo Trade, 1 would decidedly tax such articles as wo aro in a position to produco or manufacturo hero for I'ovonuo purposes ; whilst 1 would admit thoso arti cles of overy day consumption, such as sugar aud tea, duty free. I beliovo that a moderato amouut of protection to industrial enterprises would vory socu placo '.is in tho position of being exporters instead of importers ; and tho mean3 thoroby afforded for constant employment to tho laborer would do moro for tho oountry than any system of freo or assisted immigration. I shall ondeaver, so far ns the short timo at my disposal beforo the day of election will permit, to seo you personally and oxplain my views moro fully ; and if you do mo tho honor of electing mo as one of your ropresontatives, my best endeavors will bo usod to promote tho intorosts of Castlemaino, in an industrial as well as a political point of view. I havo tho honor to bo, Faithfullv yoivs, ' \V. G. BAILLTE. Molbourro, 20th January, 1SC6. 45 04 ('NOLLINGWOOD ELECTION.- UNITED COM J M ITTEE for the return of Messrs EDWARDS, EMBLING and REEVES.

BUTLER, Secretary. rj\0 THE ELECTORS OF EAST MELBOURNE. Gentlemen, — For tho third time, I offor myself for 1 e-olection as one of your ropreeontativos in tho ' Commons' of Victoria. Tho present political feud has arison out of an in disposition on the part of tho Manchester class of importers and middlemen's refusal to pay a very small sliaro of taxation. Thoso traders mako this country their homo but for a few years, aftor which they tako thoir departuro for other climes, and with overflowing pockcts, and with coarso jibes and sarcastic sneers on their tongues at colonial society, they libel our institutions and defamo our social condition. Thoy also, through their organised subsidies, havo mado a cat's paw of the Council Chamber. They havo, by tho same means, won tho favor of a portion of tho press ; aud havo immortalised theinsclvcB by repeatedly in sulting our most gracious Queen, in tho person of our impartial aud independent Governor. Tho aim of this class is to fix the burthen of tho taxation ou other shoulders than their own, to dis courage all manufactures, to subvert tho Land Act ; and abovo all, and worse than all, to rob .us of tho suffrage. Ave, to rob us of tho oternnl, unalienable birth right Of all free men. Think of that, you bank clerk, you shop assistant, you artisan. You aro to bo disfranchised, together with him who follows the plough or wields tho pick — as witness Wilberforeo Stephen at Brighton, and Murray Smith at Williamstown, tho nominees of this precious eliquo, on tho quostion of tho manhood suffrage. And rcmembor, my countrymen, wo have growing up amongst us that dotostablo class 'shoneen,' who will strive to get tho upper hand, which, please God, tlioy novcr will, so long as wo have the power of voting, and voting by ballot. On offering myself for ro-eloction last time, I did ro independent of all classos ; but when tho timo ar rived for discussing tho question of protection, I found tho Government wore honest in thoir profes sions. 1 found that, not only in their valuablo Land Act, but in tho revision of tho tariff, thoy studied tho welfare of tho people. Then it was I supported them with my heart and soul, and shall continue to do so until tho solo and entiro right of raising and spending tho rovonuo of this oountry bo conceded, without equivocation or reservation, to tho poople's representatives in the Assembly Chamber. When a prudent time shall havo arrived, I will dun for another instalment of protection; and as soon as possiblo I hope to have tho pleasuro of assisting to shape tho Council Chambor, so that it shall be really a representative institution. Should I bo honored again by your ro-elccting 1110, I promise to bring you back that honor unsullied, as I havo hitherto done ; and I trust I shall nevor bo found amongst tho ranks of a small-mindod clique of ob structionists, but that I may ever bo in tho van, where the welfare of the country demands. In conclusion, I beg of you to wipo out of your oyos tho dust whioh tricksters aro using when thoy quoto you tho ' Constitution.' For centuries, jurists and political economists of tho highost order of intollect have disagreed, and will eontiuuo to disagroo, as to tho construction of a sentence or the philosophy of financial economy. And if I am not presuming, I would say it is for you to do that necessary and common sense act, of helping to build up for all classes of our population employment suitable to their varied physical developments. 1 am, faithfully yours, 43 03 AMBROSE KYTE.
