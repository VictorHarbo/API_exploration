IMMIGRATION. EUROPEAN INTEREST. Mr Haylen's Comments. SYDNEY, Dec 14.-- Hunmdreds of thousands of the stoutest resistance fighters in Europe hoped to migrate to Australia, said Mr L. C. Haylen, M.H.., today on his return from Europe. Mr Haylen is chairman of a committee of eight representing the Government, unions and em ployers which has been in Europe investigating aspects of possible migration to Australia. Mr Haylen said that the men were of the fine, venturesome type which had come to Australia in the nine ties. Throughout Europe and Bri tain there was intense interest in Australia, which was highest esteemed of all the countries willing to take migrants. Australla's re quirements could be filled on the spot from Nordics alone. Nor wegians. Dutch and Swiss were ex tremely keen to come to Australia and so were Swedes and Danes, although the condition of Danish social services and the fact that Germany had treated Danes more moderately, slightly limited the desire of Danish youth to leave their homes. Many. young men and women throughout Europe were determined to leave and make their lives in a new country, and many had their eyes fixed on Australia. They ad mired Australia because she was 98 per cent British and because of her war record in hard, jungle battles of which they had heard a great deal. Most of the people who wanted to come to Australia already spoke English. Some of them had money but the majority did not. That would be of little disadvantage, be cause they were good, hard workers, and investigations had shown most of the hardest fighters in the resist ance movements were now the poorest. Enthusiasm for Australia was so high everywhere, that the immediate job would be to keep it dampered down for another twelve months while Australians themselves got back to work. Mr Haylen's committee was pro vided by the British Government with a plane in which it toured Europe on its investigations.
