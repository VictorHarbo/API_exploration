FOR THE LAND. VICTORIA SECURES IMMIGRANTS. At _the banquet given by Victorian residents in London to Messrs. M'Kenzie and Mead, the Victorian Immigration Delegation, Viscount Goschen, who presided, said that Great Britain welcomed the delegation, and did not grudge any immigrants which- Victoria might obtain, since they would foster the Imperial spirit among all classes in Australia.

That alone justified the delega tion.

He emphasised the importance of fostering small holdings, and in .this connection he instanced the large yield of .'crops of lucerne, the grower of which in Aus tralia torday would be the banker of Australia in the next generation.
