From the Melbourne wholesale prices current, published in the chorus of the 7th instant, we gain the following particulars respecting the state of the import market: In the import market there has not been much doing during the week. Transactions have been of very limited extent, and business generally has continued dull. Country orders have come forward slowly, and for small parcels only, and the markets have continued in a languid condition, which the heavy arrivals of the week are unlikely to change for the better. Fifteen vessels from extracolonial ports have arrived since our last weekly report, of an aggregate register tonnage of 9,100 tons, viz., four from the United Kingdom, two from China, two from Calcutta, one from Mauritius, one from United States, one from Amsterdam, one from Gottenburg, one from Hannersund, one from Soderham, and one from Bordeaux. From the same source we subjoin what follows respecting the flour and grain markets : There has been a fair steady business doing in flour throughout the week. Supplies have come freely to hand, but previous stocks being light, arrivals have been purchased as soon as to hand ; a few lots of United States barrel flour have arrived, sufficient to supply the demand for that description, and prices are tolerably firm, ranging from 15. to 189 per ton for Adelaide, 38s per barrel for Haxall and Gallego, and 17. 10s to 18s. per ton for Tasmanian ; the latter sort being somewhat scarce, arrivals from that quarter having been exceedingly light. Wheat is in less demand, and the mills being sufficiently supplied, prices are rather lower; good samples of South Australian are worth 7s 6d to 7s 8d; Victorian grown, 7s to 7s 6d per bushel. Oats are very dull or sale, buyers purchasing only for immediate requirements; and with the excessive stock on hand, and continually arriving supplies, no early improvement in prices can be looked for Quotations are Irish and Scotch, 4s 8d to 5s ; California, 5s ; Danish, 4s6dto4s8d; Calcutta, 4s 10d ; colonial, 5s 3d to 5s 6d per bushel. Barley continues without inquiry ; Californian is offering at 3s 8d per bushel ; no transactions having occurred in either English or Cape, quotations cannot be supplied. Maize is in tolerably fair demand, and brings from 5s 6d to 5s 8d per bushel for good samples of New South Wales growth. Grain continues to move off steadily, without material alteration in value. A parcel per Queen of the Seas, consisting of about 200 tons, was placed by auction, the bulk at 11?. Is per ton, a small portion of the lot realizing ill. 7s 6d. Bran is in fair request ; Adelaide sells readily on the Wharf at from 2s to 2s 6d ; mill prices ruling at the same rates. Subjoined are the latest quotations for says-The supply continues excessive, and chiefly of inferior class. 450 loads have been brought to market, many of which have been taken back, or left over for next week's market. Prices of best hay rule from 3. to 91 ; stained and inferior, from 5. 10s to "4. Straw, 3. to it. per ton. TASMANIA. Papers from Launceston and Hobart Town respectively to the 2nd and 3rd instant The following is fromthcZaaMces/on Examiner of the latter date: The late heavy shipments of oats to Melbourne are likely to receive a check, as ruling prices in Melbourne do not leave any chance for profit to shippers after deducting prices given here and freight. Tasmanian oats are preferred in the Melbourne market, but the recent heavy shipments from California keep down the figure. Buyers here are not willing to give more than 58 to-day. Wheat may be quoted at 6s sd ; several large parcels are being delivered at that figure Potatoes are rather on the decline; disease and the grub are rather seriously affecting the crops, and most of the quantities brought to market at present are more or less touched. Grain and Flour Week ending February 26. Exported at Hobart Town, 150 bushels oats. Imported at Launceston, 91 bushels barley, 100 bushels maize. Exported, flour, 9 tons; oats, 345 bushels. " The Hobart Town Mercury of the 2nd inst. has the sub- joined market report: Sales of wheat were made to-day at previous quotations, 7s 9d to 8s per bushel, but no quantity of the new crop has yet come forward. Colonial oats are quoted at 4s to 4s 6d, but the enquiry is very trifling. Cape barley, 48 to 4s 3d. There is abundance of hay in the market, and prices have a wide range, varying from 3/. 15s to 6/ per ton, according to quality. Potatoes remain as previously given, but not much is doing at present, supplies coming forward very slowly. I A fair amount of business is doing in the flour market for local purposes, but there is no demand for exportation. Prices are steady, fine flour selling at 186. to 196. 10s per ton, according to quality. Bran remains at 3s 6d to is 8d per bushel. NEW ZEALAND. By way of Sydney, the Argus acknowledges dates to the 15th of February from Auckland, and to the 3rd of that month from Taranaki. Subjoined are the only items of in- terest:- 2 The total Customs revenue at the several ports of New Zealand during the quarter ended the 30th September, 1858, amounted to 40, 419/. 18s 4d, being an increase of 2368. 12s 8d as compared with the same quarter of 1857.

INDIA. The Argus has received Calcutta papers to January 12. The following market report is taken from the Englishman : - Sugar.- Scarcely anything is doing for Great Britain. The demand for Bombay continues brisk, and the market is firm at our last quotations. New date sugar will be soon brought to market, and the production is said to be large. Benares has been sold at 9 rupees 8 annas to 15 rupees. Date 7 rupees 12 annas to 8 rupees 2 annas. Exports for December. 1858. To Great Britain, 31,564 mds ; North America, 5,516 mds ; Bombay, 76,401 mds. Rice The great demand which has arisen for Ceylon has raised the price of this article beyond the limits for Great Britain. When this demand subsides we may look for lower rates, as the new crop is said to be large and promising well. The best Seeta table rice is quoted at 4 rs per and. Exports as above To Great Britain, 19,326 mds ; France, 7,820 mds ; Mauritius, 02,478 mds ; Bourbon, 46,050 mds ; Bombay, 64,552 mds; Ceylon, 137,326 ends; Australia, 91,171 mds.
