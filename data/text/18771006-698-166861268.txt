The ChimUoraKO arrived on 1st instant, having left Port Phillip Heads at 7 p.m. on the 29th ultimo. This, vessel is in everyjre spect the counterpart of the Lusitania, but has been most unfor tunate in the weather encountered, her run from Plymouth having been « succession of head winds. Canvas was a thing unknown ; as a rule, of course, this continuous steaming has been a sad drag on the machinery, out the excellent manner in which it has been constructed has proved equal to so great a strain, having worked smoothly throughout, although only stopped for seven hours. The Chimboraeo was built in 1870, by the celebrated firm of Messrs. J. Elder and Co., ot Glasgow, and cost 491,000. Captain J. V. Hall, who was an officer in the Panama and New Zealand Co.'s service, is in command. She left Melbourne on the 29th ultimo, at 7 p.m., and has experienced head winds throughout, arriving at Sydney Heads at 4 p.m. on the 1st instant, thus making the passage from Heads to Heads in forty- five hours. The passage to Melbourne may be quoted as follows : — The Chimborazo left Plymouth shortly before midnight on the 13th August, arrived at St. Vincent on the 81st August at 7 a,m. ; left at 1 p.m. on the 22nd August, and arrived at Cape Bordo, Adelaide, at S a.m. on the 25th September, making the run of 11,980 miles in 41-|f days, including all stoppages, but de ducting, as is usual, for difference of longitude 135*. nine hours. The stoppages were thirty hours at St. Vincent, and seven hours at sea to tighten up the engines and make small adjustments. The average speed throughout was a fraction over 12 knots, and the engines were only stopped twice ; the con sumption of coal about 47 tons, and the ship arrived in Adelaide with sufficient coal in the bunkers to bring her on to Sydney. The Chimborazo was eighteen hours at Adelaide and thirty-six hours at Melbourne. During the passage tor the greater part of the time she encountered headwinds, and for 20 days strong head winds and seas, during which she averaged 270 mlies a day ; her greatest run was 330 miles, and her least run 252 miles; she had but nine days' westerly winds in all, and scarcely set a sail for the first 27 days of the passage. In fact, the entire run was an effort of hard steaming, and had the ship been favoured with ordinary favourable weather, she would without doubt have made the voyage in two days' less time. The Chim borazo ran down her casting in latitude 42 degrees south, but carried easterly winds right up to Adelaide. The names of her officers are: Chief officer, Mr. H. Brown; second, J. VallerJ; third, B. lies-; fourth, B. Day ; purser, B. T. Ditehfield ; surgeon, H. Walker ; chief engineer, George Shearer. Whalino m the South Seas.— News has reached Auckland that the whaling vessel Alaska was at Vavau on the 14th August, with two humpbacks, trying out. The Splendid, of Dunedin, had taken four humpbacks. The James Arnold was at Hepeka Ilapai on 22nd August. She had 360 barrels of humpback, and a large quantity of sperm oil. She caught three whales while the Active was there. The Magellan Cloud, of Auckland, was at Tongatabu on 27th August, having captured five fish, giving -00 barrels. On the 26th she made fast to a cow and a calf, but the second mate in lancing accidentally cut the line, and the fish escaped. The Isabella, of Wellington, had been unfortunate through defective equipment. The boats had fastened to fourteen whales, and all escaped but two. At one time the crew ran short of provisions, and had not money to bay, but, capturing a fish, friends and money arrived in plenty. Burning of tbk Ship Ada. Tbkadlb.— Captain Rose, of the Belle Brandon, which arrived at Auckland from Savage Islands, reports that the iron ship Ada Treadle, which left Ardrossan with coal for San Francisco on 15th June, 1876, was abandoned in flames, the crew suffering great hardships for twenty-six days. The ship was towed into Possettee Harbour, Tahiti, on 20th June of this year, still burning. After eight months' tossing about, during which she had drifted 600 miles, she was picked up close to land by a French frigate. Wbkck of the Bakqub Julia Beitz.— A telegram has been received, reporting the wreck of the abovenamed vessel on the coast of Java, while on her passage from China to Adelaide with a cargo of tea. She is owned by Mr. Ellis, of Newcastle, and is insured for £2050. The barque Vicuna left Mauritius .on lOtb. August, with heavy S.E. winds, during continuance of which a portion of her bulwarks was carried away. This weather was followed by 8.W. and werterly breezes to Cape Otway, which was passed on the 19th instant, and since then light easterly winds have prevailed. Messrs. Metcalfe and Co. hsre received a cablegram advising the arrival of the Kent (s.) at St. Vincent early on the 2 nil ultimo, 47 days out from Melbourne. Ivspxcnm of Ships.— At the adjourned meeting of the Local Marine Board, held last week, for the purpose of appointing an inspector and surveyor of ships leaving the port of Newcastle, whether overladen 'or unseaworthy from any other cause, the application of Captain Augustus Bertram was favourably con sidered out of the thirty-one received, and the Board were unanimous in favour of his appointment. The secretary, Captain Weatherill, was instructed to write to Sydney stating upon whom the choice of the Board had fallen, and to recommend that pro vision be made for him to have a boat, and that a man under him should be employed. Captain Bertram commanded a vessel from England to the colony, but he has not had a command since his arrival here. His duties commenced yesterday. Every member of the Board was present at bis appointment. The necessary stops are being taken to prevent any 6hip having a clearance at the port, should he report against them.— A'etncastle Pilot, October 2. The Steam Navigation Board of Victoria on Wednesday com pleted the investigation into the charge against Captain Matthias, of the ship Duchess of Argyle, of neglecting to take proper pre cautions in saving the life of the seaman William Burgess, who fell overboard on the voyage out. Captain Payne was in the chair. Mr. Emerson, on behalf of Captain Matthias, called William Patterson, boatswain of the vessel, and the Board also heard the captain's version of what took place on the night in question. The boatswain contradicted the assertion made by several witnesses on the previous day, that the wreckage did not prevent the lowering ot the lifeboat. The cap-* tain's statement, as Mr. Read, the opposing counsel, observed, mode out that he did all that the master of a vessel coutd do on such an occasion, and the decision of the Board showed that that body considered the charges ref nted. Their decision was ' That the charge broughtagainst Captain Matthias had not been sus tained.' The Board fully exonerated the master from all blame, and desired to express their approval of the conduct of Mr. Japha (second mate), and the seamen Morna, Hansen, and Stewart, who manned the boat, and endeavoured to save the life of their shipmate.— Age. The ship Carlisle Castle, from London for this port, was spoken by the Loch Garry on August 21, in latitude 32- 8. and longitude 86*20 W., so that her arrival may be expected now every hour. The Loch Garry; on August 20, also spoke the ship Roxburgh shire, from Glasgow to Brisbane, with immigrants, in latitude 28-43 S. and longitude 29-41 W. ; and on August 24, the ship Jessie Beadman, from London to Otago, in latitude 37'30 S. and longitude 18-80 W.— Argus, September27.
