Jakyl, TO THE ELECTORS OF CENTRAL CUMBERLAND, GENTLEMEN.—Born and having passed the greater part of my life in Central Cumberland, I feel that I am no stranger among most of, you, and not altogether un- acquainted with your requirements. In the first place it is absolutely necessary that suffi- cient sums of money should be granted for the forma- tion and repair of roads for internal communication, in this as well as other districts ; and handed over for economical expenditure to the various road trusts, where such exist ; and where there are none, they should be speedily formed, and commence at once to put and keep all the principal thoroughfares, in as per- fect a state as the means at command will admit of; there should be moreover, a reduction in the rate of tolls. Then, with respect to Education, there should be but one comprehensive system, supported by the state, which would be the means of preventing for the future all heartburnings on the subject. Efficient masters, comprising persons of all creeds should be provided, which would bring the blessings of education through the length and breadth of the land within the reach of all, free of charge. And with regard to State Aid, I am in favour of volun- taryism, but with no intention of being harsh or unjust to the Clergy. With respect to the land, my opinion is, that any land not worth £1 per acre is, in reality, not worth having, as the timber alone where it could be made available is worth considerably more ; and on plains where there is no timber, it must be either good for pastoral or agricul- tural purposes; and, being ready cleared, the above sum must be a reasonable price, as no person will undertake to clear land for less than from two to five pounds per acre, and where barren it is to a certain extent worth- less. Of such land I am sorry to say, are composed the greater parts of the Parishes of Holdsworthy, Eckersley, Wedderburn, Southend, Bulgo and Heathcote, in Cen- tral Cumberland. I will advocate free selection in certain localities that had been surveyed, and from which the necessary pre- serves for villages, water, and other desirable purposes, had been first selected. In 30 acre farms to each party applying. On navigable rivers the frontages should abut upon a public road, one chain wide, and should be small, otherwise the interests of the multitude will be overlooked. In fact, every farm surveyed in future should abut upon a road one chin [sic] wide. With regard to Railwys.[sic] I shall support Railway enter- prize on an extensive scale, through the length and breadth of the land, with greatly reduced fares. As I consider that the present generations are as much enti- tled to the comforts and privileges of this life as those that will succeed them. The principle lines should be completed as soon as possible, leaving future generations to bear their fair share of the expense consequent thereon. And with respect to Telegraphic communications: it must be promoted, but never can be relied on until split post of iron bark, blood tree, or other durable timber are substituted for saplings, which like so many cabbage storks, must soon rot, no matter how charred or tarred. I would further advocate free selection, in the outly- ing districts, to enable parties, at present in the country, wishing to select for themselves a small homestead of 30 acres of rich land (such as the Darling Downs con- tains for instance) which would tend to people and im- prove, through time, every available tract of country ; but also might have the tendency to encourage by that means, when properly authenticated, a healthy and con- tinuous stream of immigration from all parts of Europe. Which might be preferable to pay £100,000 per annum for the introduction of persons (for the most part) unsuited to our wants ; which money could in future be turned to better advantage, I disapprove of any large sums of public money being sent out of the colony, unless found to be absolutely necessary for the furtherance of designs that must in the end prove bene- ficial. Should you do me the honour of returning me as one of the representatives of my native country, I shall zea- lously endeavour to discharge my duty (having the necessary spare time at my disposal) to the constituency of Central Cumberland, and to the colony generally, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, your obedient servant.

Upon our choice of Representatives de penda in a grèut moasure the future .misory or oorofort.. of ourselves and children. Within the lust twenty years ' many efforts have been made to retard the progress of-, this colony. The rich possessed power without patriot- :. ism; they used that power for their own aggrandise- . ment and the opprossion of tba poor. Twenty years ago . those who sought to relieve the working man from the 1 grasp of his employer by demanding vote by ballot, in ' the event of a constitution being granted to this colony, were called *' Cut-throats," Yes, strange aa it may . seem, vote by ballot was then designated a ont-throat ; system, but, thank God, we have it-let us uso.it with '.' discretion and determination. Let those wbo would i still tyrannize over the working man, ,if they dare, be ? sent to tho right-about. . ? . ? . * :-, Follow olootom wo hove au ? important chargo com-i miite.d to -.us^he^wolfore - of tho, rising generation. * Therefore,';bb nóT" carrie'd^ away' then'.with tho name fcfj *, man, his oreed, or bis country. .. Letyour inquiry;be,j are hi9 political principles" stich ashore calculated to advance tho best interests of this my;adoptéd^,or. .nntivé ' land ; and if the candidate has been in the' councils of, the country, yonr inquiry should be, bas his political career been suoh as to warrant tho belief that I may' safely trust my interests to his care ? If the past answers this question in' affirmative,' elevate the man, raiso I'ira to the highest honors your votes can bestow ; but if, on the contrary, thu past hisrory of tho man, answers distinotly, No, then rejeot the man, no matter, how exalted his station-no matter hbw long ho may have held ofßoo-no mutter what his country or oreed-', I say rejeot such a ono.
