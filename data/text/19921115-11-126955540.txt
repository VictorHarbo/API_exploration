Author rejecting Holocaust is deported NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario: A British author who says the Holocaust was exaggerated has been ordered de- ported from Canada. David Irving, pictured right, who al- so claims the Auschwitz gas chambers were built after World War II as a tourist attraction, has been heckled at immigration hearings and lectures by protesters calling him a nazi. As the ruling was issued on Friday, Irving jumped to his feet and requested a judicial review of the decision. "This is a time when the real courts can take over," Irving said before he was led out of the hearing room. "The kangaroo court has had its say." As immigration adjudicator Ken Thompson read the decision, Irving twice interrupted to challenge state- ments. He was warned to keep quiet or risk being sent back to a holding cell. Irving, 56, had been free on bail while the hearings were held over the past two weeks to determine whether he violated an order to leave Canada. It was issued while he was on a speak- ing tour of the country. Irving ran afoul of Canadian immi- gration authorities in October when they arrested him in British Columbia, where he .pleaded guilty to misrepre- senting himself. - AP British author David Irving is led away in handcuffs from an immigration hearing in Niagara Falls, Ontario.
