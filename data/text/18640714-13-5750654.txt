COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Wednesday Evening. The delivery of the English and foreign letters by the Madras mail, which took place early in the afternoon, somewhat interfered with business in the import market. In Eastern produce, however, there was some animation. Considerable parcels of Patna rice changed hands, and as high a rate as £24 per ton is reported as having been obtained. The telegraphic re- ports given yesterday are confirmed by the journals and advices to hand. At Calcutta, as the Hurkaru of the 6th June reports, the rise in the price of rice in the bBzatr had put an end for the time to charter engage- meats. From Hong Kong we learn that a fourth ship, the BenNeviB-of no great SIZE, however-was on the berth for the Australian ports with tea. Prices, it is stated, were "txpecttd"to rule high. It would appear, therefore, that few Bales had been made, and poBbilly samples were not to hand. We are not likely, in that case, to receive any of the new season's produce before the end of October, cr perhaps November. The auction sale of sugars resulted favourably for importers, Some 4,000 bags of Mauritius having been disposed of at well sustained injures. Transactions in the flour market were limited to I bade parcels, and prices, although firm at present, show no adv ance. The markets in Sydney and Adelaide at the telegraph informs us are in much the same state, the tendency, perhaps, being downwards. 11 c large shipments of goods from England to some of the neighbouring colonies, the experts to which have for some time past kept our traders busy, will be felt seriously and pt ndently of the probability of over sup- pute to those markets being reshipped to this port for realization. The Shipments announced, although in some degree reduced, are quite ample for all requirement?, and, added to present stocks, are sufficient to destroy any prospect of amendment in prices. The amount of candles shipped, mentioned In yesterday's issue, includes the shipments from foreign as well as from British ports. For the extent of shipments from the home markets, we refer our readers to Messrs. Stables and Co.'s report, published in another court n. The gold brought down by the Government escorts amounts to 13,43302, from the under named districts: Beechworth .. Yackandandah ,, Chiltern .. Morse's Creek. Wood's Point ..

The stock and share market continues very active. Bank stocks have been rather neglected. Colonial and Alliance Insurance have buyers in excess of the number of sellers. Australasian are rather easier, but holders are not likely to accept less than the prices obtained in recent sales. in mining The Enterprize, Maldon, expect to accumulate about 500oz. amalgam for the month. The Golden Stream having improved returns, a fifty-five ounce nugget having been obtained yesterday, has created a stronger demand for Scarsdale Great Extended; buyers have offered £30 to-day. Eaglehawk Association, and Eaglehawk Union, have both been sought for, but few shares are offered. Messrs.

The following are the reports of the auctioneers: Messrs. Fraser and Co., at their rooms, offered the residue of the cargoes of the Formosa and Sarah, from Mauritius, and sold all but 400 bags rations, which are held for an advance, say 1,000 bags at from £30 to £30 163, (or rations ; £35 for medium counters ; £38 10s. to £37 5s. for good, and £33 for Uno do. ; £80 to £41 10s. for yellow and grey crystals. These prices fully support previous currency, cape clearly considering the fact that they were sold under peculiar conditions the buyers being obliged to take delivery of the sugar as it stands, no allowance for variation in quality or otherwise being given. Messrs. Greig and Murray sold, at the Victorian Railways Soda ash (as per bulk), 18 to £8 15s. per ton ; Scotch whiskey, in hhds. and quarter-casks, 2s. 6d. per gallon ; English ale (all faults), 30s. per head. We have our Auckland files to the 2nd inst, We observe from them that the new Bank of Auckland has commenced business. The following gentlemen were elected directors : Messrs James O'Neill, Edward King, G. M. O'Rorke, U. Isaacs, and A. K. Taylor. A line of regular traders has commenced to run between Leith and Auckland, for which the firm of Bucholz and Co. are agents. The barque Ellen Lewis had sailed for San Francisco, and the Forces would follow on the 6th instant. The New Zealand Herald denounces in very strong language what it calls deep laid and hitherto successful scheme of rigging the flour market," which it attributes to Melbourne and other Australian speculators in grain and flour. The following resolutions, on the subject of steam communication with Melbourne, were adopted at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce on the 28th ult. : " That this chamber recognizes the importance of direct mail steam communication between Victoria and the Province of Auckland. " That with a view to carrying out the foregoing resolution this chamber recommends "1. the substitution of the port of Melbourne for the port of Sydney, and the port of Manukau for the port of Auckland. " 2. That the mail steamers leave Melbourne on or about the 10th of each mouth, and return in time to meet the homeward mail, which leaves Melbourne on the 16th of the same month. " 3 That) B4 the advantage will be mutual, this chamber recommends that the amount of subsidy be paid in equal proportions by the General Government of Victoria, and the Government of the Province of Auckland. " 4. That a copy of the foregoing resolutions be tra Mitittcdto the hon. the l'ostinister-Uoneral of New Zealand, and to the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, Melbourne." 1 Le Southern Cross has the following report, dated the 1st inst, of the grain and share markets : " A steady buslnonslias been done during the week and there is no change to note in the state of trade, except that the flour u market is easier, and that there is not the same degree of excitement as regards it that there has been. Fine Adelaide flour maintains its price at 23 per ton. The now commissariat contract c announced today, the contract price being iii i 8s. The share market opened this week with evident signs of depression, the down ward movement of prices being considerably assisted by the determina- tion of the book to check any appearance of rain speculation. A considerable fall has taken place in Bank of New Zealand has. s since the arrival of the Lord Ashley ; some large parcels from the Southern) provinces having been suddenly thrown on the market, and the departure of the English mail rather tightened monetary matters. Sellers have had to submit to a reduction from £12 fis. to £11 10s. per share, a large number having changed hands at the latter quotation, and many offering at a lower figure." We have the Sydney Empire of the 9th last. Pressure on our space compels us to hold over the commercial Inldligooce recovering. The dates by the MidraVd mail are to the 26th May by letter, and by telegram to the 4th June, from London. Of the extraordinary move ments in the money market, the minimum price forditoount having been at one time eight per cent, at the Ben of England, full particulars are given in the commercial letter of our London correspondent. Towards the close of the mail month money had become somewhat easier. The Evening Express of the 26th May says : "The directors of the Bank of England, at their weekly meeting today, have reduced the minimum rate of discount from eight to seven per cent., in making a total reduction of two percent, within a fortnight. To-day's measure had been generally anticipated:!, in consequence of the fall in the value of money in the general market, and of the accumulation of gold here. The movement at the Bank gave a momentary impulse to prices in the Stock Exchange this morning ; but, business being very languid, most classes of securities, including the English funds, home railways, and foreign stocks, areuowquitol much the same as yesterday afternoon. Midland Railway stock is exceptionally better. Notwithstand- ing the reduction in the Bank rate to day, the discount market continues very quiet, and the quotation for choice bills Is fractionally below the reduced minimum of that establishment. In the Stock Exchange there is a good demand for short loans on Government securities, but the supply is very large. The rate is four to five percent. At Paris to-day, according to Mr. Reuter's telegram, the Three per Cent. Kontos opened at 60ft. EOc, showing no change." The Times, writing on the 25th, remarkable Its city article : " The funds this morning opened at a further Im- provement of an eighth, but it was not fully maintained, the first price of Consols for delivery being Old for and the last or to j. For the account the final bargains were at 100 to J; ex dividend. Bank Stock left off at 237 to 239, Reduced and New Three per Cents , 801 to 4 ; India Stock, 217 to 210 ; India Five per Cents., 105 to J; Kxchociuor Bills, March, 13s. to 8s. dies, and ditto, Juno, 7s. to 3 -. dis. There was scarcely any demand at the Bank to-day for discount, and in the open market as well as in the Stock Exchange the supply of money was comparatively abundant. Foreign securities have been quiet, the only exception being the Confederate loan, which on the first vague report as to the nature of the two days' later news received this morning suddenly declined from 50 to 69. Immediately on the publication of the particulars a rally commenced, and the closing price was 63 to 65, the impression being that the only feature of the Intelligence disastrous to the Confederates consists in the state of exhaustion to which they must be reduced, even if their present resistance should prove entirely successful.

The Economist, of the 21st May, comments on the action of the Bank directors as follows: "The Bank directors have reduced their rate of discount, and perhaps they could hardly have done otherwise ; but we own that we cannot look at tho state of the Bank accounts with that unqualified approval and exultation which we have elsewhere seen expressed. The figures stand Public deposits.£7,660,001 I'll vate deposits .12,002,402 seven-day and other bills J. J. 4937 £21,022,8SO and the reserve of notes and coin £7,007,011, which in only just one-third of the liabilities'. We confess we cannot consider this proportion as a perfect result of the operations in which the Bank are engaged. They are endeavouring to attract capital from abroad by a high rate of interest, and they should not cease till their reserve is at least nearer to a half than a third of their liabilities, as we believe the third to be the minimum proportion, below which the reserve should never be reduced without apprehension the part of the public, and action on the part of the Bank. If we cease our efforts to augment the reserve just when we have attained the bore minimum we can do with, we shall have very soon to recommence them, for some circumstance will be sure to lessen that minimum, and then we must go to work and augment the rate again, it is better to finish, the task while we are about it, and not to lower the rate much till the reserve is really ample." Messrs. Stables, Straker, and Co. report on the exports to this colony as follows, under date the 16th of May : " The extreme moderation in shipments which has characterised the Australian trade generally from the commencement of the present year, and which it has hitherto been our gratifying province to record month by a month, continues to be observed with regard to most items of interest. The present month usually brings a considerable augmentation in the various articles of fine season goods and although we now show no exception to the general rule, the gross returns, as a whole, are of a very encouraging nature. During the past month the total declared value of British goods exported amounts to £031,110, whilst for the preceding month of March-April they were £U78,8DÖ, being a present decrease of £2,25). For the corresponding month of 1803 our gross returns were £8s3,040, Showing a considerable comparative reduction in the present year, in addition to the di cruise which we previously recorded for the first three months. Subjoined we give the constituent elements of the above aggregated figures, premising that in nearly all instances season goods are at a moderate advance upon last month, most other Heirn being lower, vis.: "Melbourne and Geelong.

''It is, however, proper to remark that several TCCSCIS included in our Circular ' cleared very closely upon our date of publication, and that, in those instances, our present figures are liable to be swelled by additional entries yet to be received. Sufficient evidence is,- nevertheless, afforded of a continued wholesale caution in shipments ; and although this fact may be in some degree attributable to the stringency of the money market, the relief to be ultimately imparted to the colonial markets will be none the less effectual.

The first case of importance for this year commenced on the 6th of May, and the attendance of buyers both home and foreign was as large as we over recollect seeing; biddings very spirited and competition most animated for all descriptions, til) choice clips from all the colonies commanding the greatest attention, the fine combing; from Port Phillip bring the greatest favourite, and the prices paid for which have been very high 2s. 7d. to 2s. 11d. for prime and noted brands ; 2s. 4d. to 2s. 6d. for good and line and 1s. 10d. to 2s. 3d. for fair medium flocks. Extra clips from Sydney likewise were eagerly taken at long prices, 2s. 11d. to 3s. 8d. Points paid for one noted brand of fleece. The sales have continued with remarkable uniformity in price, and there is not the slightest cessation in demand. Comparing prices with March sales we quote Port Phillip 12d, to 2d. better for the choicest, 6d. to 9d. for average to One; on Sydney, Cape, and other descriptions, about Id. Up to date more than half the total quantity has passed the hammer. Bradford and France have taken the lead in purchases, competition on the port of our own spinners being greater than we recollect for many years.

Our latest information as to the state of the wool market is contained in the circular of Messrs. Buxton and Metcalf,' dated London, 26th May, which reports as follows: " The colonial wool soles, which opened on the 5th inst., have proceeded thus far with undiminished vigour and a full attendance of buyers. We confirm our report at the opening that fully lost sale's prices were realized for all varieties of Australian wool, and have to add that not only have these rates been sustained, but that if anything, the turn is against the buyer. Cape wools have realized any advance of fully 1d. per lb. on all sorts except 'seedy' I clues, which have seceded from the value obtained for them at the latter part of last sales. The quantities already passed the hammer consist of 0 205 bales Sydney, 31,210 bales Victoria. 1,421 boles Tasmania, 0,007 bales Adelaide, 1,260 bales New Zealand, 117 bales Swan River, £1,000 bales Cape; total, 00,011 bales, and there are still about 40,000 bales to come forward. The sales will close on the 6th June, The Vietoiiacllplstho best we have over seen, especially as to length and strength of staple, the condition being also excellent hence the high prices obtained from the numbers, both the Bradford a .d foreign combing trade being very flourishing at present. in sydney clip shows also a tendency to greater length of staple, and One short grown clothing from both colonies are scarce. The Adelaide and Tasmanian clips present little variation from last year. Of New Zealand, it will be observed that only a small proportion has yet come on. The follow ing are the ruling quotations : " Sydney and Moreton Bay.

On the state of the money market at Bombay, we find the following observations in the Times of India of the 28th May : - " We have not the slightest change to note from the general feature of Improvement which characterized our market a fortnight ago. Money is abundant, and the demand very moderate. Bombay, as usual, has taken the initiative to cheapen accommodation by a reduction during the fortnight of four percent, by the Bank of Bombay on its rates for loans. The Bank of Bengal has not yet followed suit, although it was generally anticipated the directors would have done to. The position of the European money market is undoubtedly such as to excite caution; but the tentative measures adopted by the Bank of England arise, it would appear, more from precaution than actual necessity, They will, however, tend to diminish the specie movement eastward for a time. We are again undoubtedly approaching the period when extreme caution will be needed in our money market, but for a time it is generally felt that the position of the Bank of Bengal admits of our rates of interest and discount being cheapened. The directors, on Saturday last, reduced the roles of interest and discount one per cent.. It is now generally felt that the question of an extension of our currency depends, for any practical resolution, on England. 'The late advices indicate that some measures will shortly be taken. It is only hoped by commercial men here that these may not be delayed." The Hurkaru (Calcutta) of the 8th Jane rerortB m follows: " Freights and Rice. Little change has taken place in this market ; shipments continue moderate, and our last quotations are hardly maintained The last steamer from China brought rather more favourable accounts, and there was for a time a good demand for tonnage, but a serious advance in the price of rice in the bazaar prevents any further engagements being entered into." The Calcutta Englishman of the 22nd May says: "Money has been in more demand during the past week, but the reported greater ease at Bombay has prevented any lightness being felt here. In bank shares there has been some excitement, Agra Bank having risen considerably. Sales are reported at 1,800s. Bank of Banger at 14,503." Freight to London had advanced 5s. per ton for sag M but the business doing in freights was very limited. The Bombay Gazette of the 8th ult. says: Two more new banks, the Alliance and the Bom boy City Bank, have been started at Bombay in the last week. The Alliance calls for a capital of on million sterling. Speculation has been as active a ever in the Bombay shorn market since the depart of the last overland mail; and now that the product market is closed for the reason, it is likely to confine at form of heat for the next three months." The latest information concerning the Persian Gulf telegraphic cable contained in the following paragraph from the Scindian (Kurmchet) of the 21st May : "Today the Cospatrick begins to discharge the spare cable she has on board into the tank prepared for that purpose at ii more. On the following morning the Coromandel proceeded to Bombay with several of the artificers, on their return to England." At Singapore a commercial crisis was occurred. The Free Press of the 17th May reports on the state of matters as follows: The crisis which began some months ago appear to have now reached its height. The failure or two firms with Uti Littles of over a million of dollars, in largely indebted to Cb nose traders of all kinds, has naturally reacted upon the latter,' an I they are now almost daily suspending payment. No flour j some are taking a i vantage of the opportunity t effect a composition with their creditors, when there is probably no necessity that they should do to, but the greater part have been bona find ' cleaned out.' This is not the first crisis of the kind we have had in Singapore, although it is probably the most severe owing to the greater facilities which not exist for obtaining discount, and which has naturally led to over-trading amongst the native dealers. Th system on which business is conducted hore-the sal of goods on three months'' credit has been frequently blamed as the cause of these disasters, but we think the system is not so much to blame as the manner 1 which it is applied." Messrs. Faucher and Co., Hong Kong, i their freight circular and market report dated the 29th May, make the following report as to teas and exchange :-. " Canton reasons very fair amount of business has been done in the class of teas at present offering Scented teas have been freely operated in at Increase prices over last year's at the same time, say is. 3 to 3.

The prices ruling at the dep: ture of the last mail for Java ports have again e tained from 5. to 5. At Shanghai, rates for all ports have declined, owing to scarcity of cotton. .

But native shows a very different result. The deficiency on that kind is twice the sum of the excess in the case of plantation, and the result is a total deficiency of 20,000 cwt. A much greater deficiency than this was anticipated, and in the direction of plantation kinds. The actual result will take a good many by surprise, and lead to the supposition that a still larger quantity than usual of native had been prepared and sent home as plantation." The same journal gave the following market quotations : " Plantation coffee is getting scarce ; unpicked and sundries may be quoted from 48s. to 40s. 6d. ; and picked and dried from 53s. to 54s. 6d.

Since our last Issue, the return of the import and export trades of Shanghai for 1803 has made its appearance. The following figures will best speak for themselves Aggregate trade of the port, £41,038,723. The silk trade of hibits a falling-off of fifty per cent., being only 35,000 piculs exported, against 08,300 in 1802. Raw silk exported also showed a difference in value of £0,000,000; all this, however, has been nearly made up by the increased export of c tion and black tea. Re-exports have increased from 11,000,000 to 18,000,000 (Including treasure). Amongst the Imports, rice shows the principal increase, amounting to 6,703,134 is., being on excess of 2,000,270 tins. over the previous year. Commercial Becorcl, May 21, From Batavia our dates are to the 31st May. The coffee cultivation was going on favourably. The New York Herald of the 10th May reports as to the petroleum market as follows: "Receipts, 853 bales. The market was dull and nominal for both crude and refined, the former at about Saturday's prices, and the latter at a further decline of le. to 2d. a gallon. Crude was freely offered at 376., but 30c. would have bought any amount.
