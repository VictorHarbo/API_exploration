From a speech by Lloyd Genrge :— Last year Lancashire alone aold to the world £110,000,000 worth of cotton f afitict, an increase on the previous year ot 11 percent. (Cheers.) The United States, with raw material on the spot- and protective wall* round her, sold £5,700,080, with a decrease in the trade over previous years -of 46 per cant. Germany, the paradise of Protectioa, where wages were lower than oats by 40 per cent., and the cost of living higher by another 20 per cent., sold last year very nearly one-fifth of what we aold, ? decreaee over the previous year of five per cent.; and France sold last year a tenth of what we sold.
