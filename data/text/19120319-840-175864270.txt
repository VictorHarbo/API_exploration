They had praised him (Captain Amundsen) for , being the first tu reach the South Pole, but they did not kiinw yet. He thought they hud better wait a little, and hear what- Captain Scott i had to say. Captain Scot.t might have i another story to tell. He might have I been there before him, without their see- j ing his murks. If Captain Seott had not- been there lie was sure he would return with good results. At the conclusion, Cap tain Amundsen wished the Mawson ex- ! pedition every success.
