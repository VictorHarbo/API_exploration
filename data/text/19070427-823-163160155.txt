REVIEW OP THE WJ3EK. The Observer Office, Wednesday, April 24. -The Season. More seasonable ?weather than has been experienced during the past week coutd not have been wished for. Over the whole of the agricultural areas there hare been fur ther mowers of rain, which, if not exactly heavy in all parts, have at least kept the ground moist, and, together with the pe riods of Bunshine which have intervened, have caused the young wheat plant to show above the ground where crops wero cot in early. It is said that along the broad-gauge line of railway the wheat is m places covering the ground nioely, and if Present weather, conditions last there can be no doubt that the crops will have had an excellent atari. Temj)eraturfcs, though lower, have not been such as to retard growth, in fact the opposite has been the case. From a etockowneiV point of view j the weather conditions have been equally I propitious, and there seems to be an assur ance of early feed for tile young lambs. Altogether a more favourable opening to the season could not have been imagined, : and the effect is sure to be felt later. The I immediate effect has been to strengthen I the feeling of confidence in the future. No I thing is so calculated to engender confi ! dence and to cause investment, and, inci I dentally, to encourage immigration, than a | succession of good seasons such as are be ing experienced. If at the same time les I sons are drawn from the past, and tlie con ditions of general farming improved, there will be much less reason to fear unfavour | able years when they come. There is not I a great deal to report from a commercial I point of view. Trade in general is brisk. 1 and the fact that most business houses and manufacturing establishments are full of ! orders is an excellent sign. As far as ex j ports are concerned not a great deal I is passing. Wheat is' moving extremely ] slowly in the country, and apart from the J fleet already engaged merchants are in no i hurry to add to their commitments. At ! the same time. a very fair qiiAntity of ; i breadstuff's continues 'to go. out -of the State in 6ne way and another. The exis tent'# of greater facilities for- export in cer tain directions could be wished, but mer chants and millers have in the past, by their own unaided efforts, surmounted dif ficulties, and they can be safely left to do the same again. The experience of the past lias been that as soon as sufficient induce ment exists tonnage is not lacking to move the goods. The apple season, as far as European markets are conc. rned, has about .ended, though shipments will continue to South Africa and the Far East. The total exports to date amount to 31,814 cases, compared with 74,491 cases in the_ corre sponding period of last year. There is next to nothing doing in wo~;l. The firn n?ss of the situation was evidenced last week, when a small pale of oddments took place locally, and the linej offered were readily cleared at full rates. -World's Wheat. Our cable messages this week clearly indicate the cause ot the firmness of the market during the jjast week. There have been rumours of reported crop damage, and it i.s now definitely stated that the pmspecis oi the American winter wheat are unfavour able, tliat spring wheat conditions in Kus sia are doubtful, and that the outlook m other European countries is not reassuring. This is causing active demands for cargoes, more particularly on the part of Continen tal operators. Our messages agjee with pri vate advices that 30/9 is to "be obtained, and in fact this price has been paid for a South Australian cargo now loading. Whe ther demand will subside (or a while de-1 pends largely upon further reports from ? growing centres, but negotiations for sales ? are still being conducted. In the following a list is given of Australian cargoes which have been advised the pasi weak through. The llegister to have changed hands: Qr. B.tj. 1'rice.

Vegetation ireneiully, liowewr, is bacv uaiu, particular,}' in the case ci pasture lands, Will a doatinuanee of nice "growing1 weather is desirable. In Vrajux: one hears very few cjm plainU recardinu the condition of the growing wheat, alllioueh it is recygnisod lliat some win ter killinc lias taken place, the extent not yet. bein? easily discernible; spring sowings have .' made pood process. In Gonnany last w<ci j the weatlur was untrtniaj, with frost, snow, ,'Ui J rain, and ik± in (avour df the crops. A good j deal of reploushinif of the wheat crop is u- I ported. and it is expected that the land viU { lie resovn with oats, which are at a more at- i tiaolive level of price than wheat. In Hu'i- ' Kary, according to an official report ieaued this i week, there wire complaints of' damage to ;he autunn: sown crops by frost, storms, mice, 1 and rood wi-atJuj conditions in the spring .it* . nectssnry to restore the outlook to a- nonrul <Mie. In Austria the crop conditions arc sonif <vlut similar to those in Hungary. From Spain j we learn that the prolonged droueht. following , an unusual winter, is seriously impairing the ; crop outlook In the most favourable ivlieat-pr)- ; ducinir psirts of the countty. In Italy, however, - tlie pro?pnc(s remain normally si tisfa clary. From j liucsia but few complaints refardine the autumi sown crops are now heard; bot ft is reported tlui j the continuance of wintry conditions rendered ? It probable that sprinc sowings luiplit be de layed. as is hIso the case in Roumania. From India the wpather reports this weHc liavc been variable. Yesterday's reports advised better o'.vi dltiora. In Bomljay and Calcutta, but rains were cenerni in the Kurradiee district*. It is feared that the Calcutta crop, like last year, may a?mn be more or 1m of a failure, but PO far prospects in tlie Punjab and the United Provinces, where the area has been- increased by about 1,200 000 acres ctmjatm! uith last year, are regarded 38 favourable. Our latest cables reRardintr the Ame rican wheat crop .are summed up as follow: Kansas, favourable: Oklahoma, less favourable, although difficult to gauge extent of deteriora tion: Texas, crop conrfderaWy Injured; Indiana, favourable; St. Louis district, scattered repo'ts Of damnee, but outlook, on the whole, not un favourable; Michigan, frost did some'damage. A month ego the feature of the foreign wheat markets was that shipments of wheat from Argoitina continued on an an precedentedly large scale, the total for the present week (to March 22) being given at 538,000 qr. for Europe and 40,000 qr. for non-European countries; the total for -all icoiintries since January 1 was 4,685,000 qr., against 3,630,000 qr. in the corresponding! Period last year and 4,010,000 qr. in 1905. The visible Bupply wae given at about 500,000 qr., against 800,000 qr. at the same time last year. The exports were ^expected to be maintained on a very liberal scale well into this month. fonariaW final fiafiirriB of~lhe last wheat crop compare aa follows .'with -Ihe previous year's yields MOMIJ. 1905-06.

Of course should the winter wheat turn out a comparative failure it t^ay be possible to increase the spring Bowings. It must be borne in mind tliat in the (States there is a vast area to be reported upon, and conflict ing interests are often responsible for the circulation of coloured reports. In Russia it is the spring wheat crop which is more important, and unfavourable reports there fore assume importance, especially when they are accompanied by reports from other countries which suggest that the European wheatfields have been adversely, affected by frost. 'At the present Juncture a good deal of light is thrown upon the situation by tho following summary of conditions by Beerbohra on March 15: The weather In this country during lUe past week liaa been showery but not unseasonable. Good proeress h$a been made, with spring field work, and the autumn sown wheat is generally regarded as being in excellent condition, and showing cood colour. In France the weather bps also favoured sorinK eowiwr operations, which, nlthouch still in arroar, have made pood progress. With regard to the condition of the autumn sown cron the reports are somewhat conflicting-, but on tho whole more favourable. In Germany there continue to be more or lea serious complaints reenrdintr the autumn sown crops in several im oortant districts, but it iB too early to form [ a really triable opinion. In Austria-Hungary <omrarattvelv wild, seasonable weather his been experienced, and the opinions expressed witli re card to tlie eron-injr wheat and rye crops are mostlv favourable as a whole. In Italy the out- ; look for the wheat crop remains favourable, but In Soain the prospects have been impaired-by' unfavourable weather. . and our Barcelona corre- ; spondeiit writes that rather serious damage to I the crons is feared. From Row mania favourable I pecountu regarding the crops are received, the dainuat! done bv the extraordinarily. 6evere frosts this winter bcice believed to be only slight. In j IlUfsia the cron conditions am»ear to be irrcRU- ; lar: our Odessa correspondent reports that in Kherson and Bessarabia the outlook was unsatis factory. and there arc also complaints from parts of the East. The British Viee-Oonsul ct Nico laieff in a reoeut . report savfl that in his dis trict the condition of the miturun sown croosis cood. hut in the famine districts it was feared Uiat tlie;-? would be another crop failure, be cause the seed grain was provided too late, and beiner of inferior quality was not likely to. suc ceed in tlie rieorous climate of the Volga co veriiments. In America, according lo tbi? week's cables, the winter wheat crop Js decidedly' leaj favourably suoken of; the conservative Cincinnati I'ike Current of yesterday says that there is little chanire in the position, but that there are drawbacks renorted from Ohio, Indiana, and Michiran, and tliut-.the neverjl jyoBition is less favourable than ut this time last year. -Commonwealth Shipments. Shipments of breadstuffs from ins Com lnomvealth oversea last week otlvj- jban to j llie Far East amounted to 531,297 bushels | of wheat and 345 tons of flour. Expressed in terms of wheat, exports were ma le ihi:s: i -To U.K. (for orders), 443,049 bush *!s; London, 59.253 bushels; Liverpool. 4(il'51 i bushels.

The cold weather is causing a further shrinkage In butter supplies, and cata logues show an appreeiab'e diminu-' lion. As is to be expected, quality and condition are (satisfactory. The shortness of supplies, combined with a firm ing in _both Melbourne and Sydney, from hoth of which places quantities of bulk but ter are being imported to make good this .State's deficiency, has been responsible for values rulinc fully aa high as earlier in the week: in fact, the market may be given as about id. better all round. This ia large ly due to advance in rates in eastern States, particularly in Victoria. Considerable quan tities of butter are being introduced jusfc now. It is interesting to note that during March imports came to 194,580 lb., of which 187.635 lb. was from Victoria and 5,600 lb..; from New South Wales. A portion of .this;' went on to Broken Hill, hut as our total, exppi Is during the same period amounted. to only.25,872 lb., it will be seen that for all requirements which this State is accus tomed to supply present quantities of local. butter are not nearly sufficient. It is worth" noting that while Australian markets ara advancing just now, London values are de clining. Large quantities of Siberian'butter 1 arc being received, and these are being dia-1 poped ol at a low price, and -ire affecting the sale of Australian. In the following ara shown prices ruling tliia week, and at tb< corresponding date last year; April 18, April 10, 1997\. 1000.

Mills & Sparrow write from Lon don, March lo, thus: Butter.-The volume of business passing this week , has been considerably less than last. This lug been mainly causcd by holders getting more con fidence in flic position and firming up their prices, \ihidi tip lo now lias not l>ecn responded tu by buyers aa was hoped. Quotations generally are unchanged. Sibwian.-Pnccs continue on a very reasonable luais for this description, and current . make is being offered from Siberia at 79/ to 87/ delivered I/indon, so that it is evidently antlcf pa ted there tliat a low range of prices .will ha**e to be taken to absorb the increased production . which is now gglnf on.

Ail best factories have met a ready sale at an occa sional 11 advance on last week's rate for ealted, ' with unsulted runruner up to 100/, which is 2/ bet-. ter I ban last week." Secondary butter does not . share in this improvement, and it certainly i» not lowing good value when compared with beat ? grades The same conditions rule with reference*' (o eggs, and the market on Tuesday expe rienced a sharp advance. Catalogues were , cleared at 1/4, or lid. in advance of Friday last. At this time a year ago eggs were ruling at 1/2. -General Merchandise. Branbags on spot have sold at 5-10, "while . cornsacks have had exchange at "7/0 net, . equal to 7/8 usual terms. With regard to dried fruits The Melbourne Argus reports that the demand for currants is running , almost entirely on Mildura, which are d-s Iributing at 5Jd. to 5Jd ^Practically all the ounants have now left MjJdura, and nearly all have turned out either sne or. choice grade.. Mildura sultanas are selling freelv The crop, including Renmark, w > now "estimated at 2,600 tons, and, as the Commonwealth consumption is placed at 1 800 tons, a surplus of SCO tons remains to be dealt with by exportation. ' Under the existing arrangement 400 tons are des tined for New Zealand, leaving 400 tons for other places, but it is doubted ?whether New Zealand will absorb the quantity pro posed. and it is probable thatjthe matter will require reconsideration. ~A steady ' business is being done in both sultanas and, lexiae for New Zealand, where the excel-,, lent quality of this season's fruit it much appreciated. New Zealand buyers are ac customed to seedless raisins, but the sales of Australian in that colony include both seeded and bulk. In purchasing, however, New Zealand buyers are unwilling to ope rate too far ahead, seeing that new Smyrna fruit will be a\ailable about six months hence. Mildura growers are now beginning to have their export proportion sent to London and other places, and in the pre sent position of supplies abroad-pricei . bc'Pjr unusually high, and fruit Vcith quality scarce-the prospect is for a more ready sale being obtained than would be possible in ordinarv circumstances in England, - .
