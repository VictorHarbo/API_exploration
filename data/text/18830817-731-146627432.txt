[ADVERTISEMENT ] ! TO THB ELECTORS. BEWARE of Candidate* iriio are trimming in their views to catch your rotes. Mr. Sheridan comes before you aa tba high- jouled opponent of Kanakas and Oooliea. But what are tbe facte ? Where is his consistency ? As a fact, Mr. Sheridan 'was the first man to intro* duced colored laborers to Maryborough. Bead tbe following extracts from the minutes of tbe Maryborough Sugar Company's pro* ceedings, concerning tbe very Jtrst introduction of Indian Coolies and kanakas to this place ; — I860. Minutes of meeting of directors of Sugar Com pany Mr. Sheridan, one of those directors, being present Resolved that the Indian Coolies brought from Mauritius asd bow be longing to Mr. T, de Seating, be transferred to the Company's service, at Alpha Plantation.' 1867. Directors present t— R. Travis, W. M. David son, and B. & Sheridan ; — ' Resolved that Oladwell and Qreathead's offer to bring 40 Island laborers at £7. per head be accepted.' Electors : These few Mauri tins coolies were brought here, and the 40 kanakas (the first in the district) were brought here bj the schooner 11 Mary Smith,' and Mr. Sheridan was one of the threejwho brought them. ? ? Ay ELECTOR. [ADVERTISBMBirr.] {To the Editor of the Chronicle.) YOUR leader of this 'morning oontains a statement respecting which 'tbe truth tbe whole trutb, and nothing but the truth' should be told ; whereas your supressio veri would lead your readers to infer that the Get* man vote bad been offered to Mr. Moreton by a German. It was an Englishman who made the offer to which you refer, and the consequence of his action was that he was bought out and his con* nection with the Gtirpian newspaper severed at once, I said that an Englishmen had made this offer, but I believe he must have been ' from the Border*' as the selvage is always the .worst part of tbe cloth, and on both sides of the border cattle lifting was formerly so pre valent that name-lifting may bave been in* herited b^ some of their decendants. At any rate, it is pretty generally known that the Englishman's signature had a very German ap pearance. ' Extraordinary and untrue' as it may suit you to nronouuce our assertion that Mr. Jaes chke come here at our, (the Germans) request, still we most emphatically repeat that Mr. Jaeschke did come at the desire of the German electors s m we wished to hear from ^-'xm how and why tbe present .government found them selves in a political predicament; what tbeir mistakes had been ; what future course we . ought to adopt to secure our being properly re presented ; and, in short, to hear tbe viva voce statement of a man on whose word we could rely, of whose policy we could judge, from whom we could ask explanations, and who oould dispel tbe clouds in which newspaper reports are so often enveloped. Mr. Jaeschke did this, and returned to Bris bane without ever having presumed to dictate to us for whom we should vote : without preaching ' Queen-street liberalism' or M'll wraithian swagger'; but he asked us, (st yon do in your very objectionable and misleading leader) to vote ' as our own individual minds thought fit.' If you do not think our signatures a sufficient proof of our assertions, we are prepared to pro cure the signatures of ninety per cent of the Germans*of Maryborough to confirm the truth of' what is now stated by Your obedient servants, H, AHLBRAND, FRITZ EINNE. Maryborough, August 16th, 1883. [ADVftRTISBMEZfT.] the election. six polling day b close st band when your actions ih*ll decide, Who ibftll be victorious and who will stand aside, tie candidates are all good men, as you'll just see at a Stance, Hi l yoa Jadge the matter fairly and give each of them (j * .a chance.

Then to wtthold your votes, I think twou'd be absurd : With these few remarks, I think he'll do, so HI leave him to his fate. Farther comment upon him, I think is ont of date. Tbe next to draw attention, is that enterprising man, In many worthy movements, has been letter of the van. He's a friend to every workiogman, then master all your foroe And place him In the foremost ranks, and cheer him till your hoane. q He brought the working bouts to eight Instead of . nine, o, He'll hurl your claims before the noose, their objec tions undermine.
