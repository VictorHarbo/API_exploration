SUM MA R Y FOR EUROPE.' POLITICAL. Very little of importance has occurred in connection with politics during the past fortnight, excepting the second reading of the Railway Construction Bill But even that event is only important relatives), since it in no way determined the fate of the measure That his to be decided later on Members who spoke on the second reading dealt generally with all phases of the question, but the tendency in favour of requiring municipal councils to construct lines was shown to be increasing in strength The present bill is complained of by one section because it is too small, and by another because it is too large It 13 the latter section who are making the most of the Gaumont for municipal as distinguished from state lines But the most serious inspector the it bore matter in regard to the proposal for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the cost of lines The advocates for increased railage contend that their wishes can be met for the same money as is proposed to be expended on the lines now included in the bill. The Government, on the other hand, assert that this is impossible, and justify themselves by quoting the engineers' estimates Still, in or der that the question may be settled, the Premier proposes that a select committee should take evidence on the question of cost. He has declined to propose that the committee should also have power to inquire into the " merits " of the lines in the bill, but an amendment to that effect has been given notice of by Mr Officer, and will be dealt with this week The doctor mutation of this question will practically decide the fate of the bill, because if Mr Officer's amendment is agreed to it is doubtful if the measure can become law this session Another change has occurred in the Cabinet Mr Derham, Postmaster General, found it necessary to resign his portfolio bee use of the, pressure of priv into business His place has not yet been supplied, but it is understood that Mr Patterson, Commissioner of Customs and Commissioner of Public Works, will relinquish the last mentioned department, and assume the administration of the Post office, and that Mr Anderson, member for Villiers and Ile. tesbury, will join the Government as Commissioner of Public Works The police court pro ctedingsagunstMr Dow, ex Minister of lands, in connection with the Premier Permanent Building Society prosecutions, man. resulted in his acquittal, it is in tended that he shall resume his position in the Government SOCIAL AND GENERAL The strike in the shipping trade which has been threatening, for some time past, as twill commenced a week ago, when the marine officers engaged in the intercolonial trade begun to leave their vessels as soon as practicable after the 24 hours' notice to their owners matured i lie Seamen's Union which had made demands, the consideration of which was still pending lost no time in ordering a general strike to support the officers and the wharf labourers followed and thus virtually bringing the maritime traffic between the colonies to a standstill The main ground upon which the owners have taken their stand is that they will not recognise a Marine Officers' Association which through the trades hall unabated with the Seamen's Union, comprising the. men whom the officers are supposed to command such a state of things lit: owners in return would be subversive of discipline Prior to the commencement of the strike, a conference between owners and alice was arranged through the mediation of Mr. Service, MLC, and Mr Ilnncoclt, ex president of the 1 rules for li Council, but fight, fell through at the last moment, owing to what the owners considered an attempt to secure indirect!) their recognition of the officers' iidHOumioti Since then the conflict has been begun and continued with indications both of determination and acrimony, and the outlook at present is decidedly gloomy A conference of Australian ship owners was held at Albury on Saturday liist,u«oni'result of which a letter was addressed to the president of the Federated Seamen's Union, at Sydney, reviewing the present position, and stating; the causes which have led up to it, which in brief, are that one demand after another has been made upon the owners until it would increase the expenses of the companies to the extent £200,000 a year to comply with them, and as the only other alternative the owners wind up the ships The objection of the owners to the affiliation of the officers' union with any trades and labour body is reiterated. It is stated, however, that a committee has been appointed to draw up amended shipping articles, in which the whole question of wages and hours of labour is reviewed. In this way it would appear that a means has been opened up for renewed negotiations between the parties which may lead to a settlement His Excellency the Governor and the Hon vessel Hopetoun have just returned from a visit of a few days to Adelaide, during which time they were the guests of the Earl of Kintore, Governor of South Australia, 'The barque Carlisle, which was totally wrecked in Bass's Straits on (1st August, up pears to have struck upon a submerged rock unmarked upon the chart An investigation held last week before the Court of Marine Inquiry served to show that the position of the vessel at the time of the disaster was well removed from the Crocodile Islands and other known dangers to navigation Under these circumstances the Court fully exonerated the captain and officers from blame, and it is probable that a Government steamer will be sent to make a survey of the locality in order to fix the exact position of this rack. The question as to whether the Attorney General should pro- to Ents and to conduct, before the Privy Council, the appeal! case of Ah Toy t Mwgroic, which involves the whole question of the power of the Government to restrict Chinese Immigration, has been engaging the attention of the Govern- meat during the last few weeks The refusal of Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney-General of England, to conduct the case for this colony, as it involved international con- siderations on which he might subsequently have to advise the Imperial Government, was placed before the Cabinet, and there was a very strong feeling that Mr Wrixon would have to proceed to London in order to conduct the case for the Crown, Sir. Musgrove, the defendant, being the collector of Customs, This course has now been definitely decided upon, and Mr Wrixon is to proceed to England by the Britannia on the 30th mat Prior to his departure he is to be entertained at luncheon in Parliament house by the members of the Legislature as a mark of the esteem in which he is held. In answer to an inquiry as to w whether Victoria could, in cases of emergency, draw on Ilium for a supply of military stores, a reply has been received in which their Government of India expresses its willingness to assist the Victorian Government in that direction as far as may lay in its power. It is stated, in way er, that at prestent India could not furnish this colony with any guns, gun carriages, or rifles should they be required, but it is able to supply it with ammunition for both guns and rifles, and also with tents, harness, A-c, It is also suggested that it this colony thought purchasing an extensive supply of stores, it should appoint a small commission of experts in India to inspect them before their despatch from that country. The Minister of Defence has written a letter of thanks to the Governor General of India, at the same time intimating that, as it would only be in a case of extreme urgency that this colony would draw supplies from India, it was not considered advisable to appoint a commission to inspect the stores before ship- ment A letter from Sir Thomas Killer was read at the last meeting of the Victorian branch of the Royal Geographical Society offering to furnish the- names fur ii final land. exploration of Australia, providing a scheme were formulated and submitted for his approval the letter was received with prolonged applause, and the secretary (Mr A C Mac -Donald) announced that he had sent the communication to the geographic ii societies it New South Wales, Queensland, and south Australia, asking for their co-opera- tion. -he San Francisco mail service appears to be doomed. The New Zealand Government have received a cable message from their agent in America, stating that the 'I annage and Subsidy Hill has not passed, but that the United States Government are willing to give a BUliattly of ii-,000 for the continuance of the service for, another year This i fier, however, was considered too small To been detained, so that, there is every likelihood of the service being discontinued after the expiry of the contract in November. The s.entry Postmaster General states that Victoria will not be effected in a postal sense by the discontinuance of the service, as all the American correspondence will then come via the United Kingdom, and the Postal Depart ment will be the game to some extent monetarily speaking The long drawn out investigation in the Police Court into the affairs of the Premier Permanent Building Association (in liquidation) has been brought to a close, and resulted in the committal for trial on a charge of conspiracy of Mr. John Nimmo, MLA, Mr John 11 Gourlay, Mr John Stewart, and Mr Thomas Ferguson (directors) Mr James Mirams ex-secretary Mr At William Doherty (ex accountant) Mr Philip Corkhill Mr Patrick John Murphy, Mr Robert Murphy, and Mr Bernard J.

The revival of public interest in South Polar exploration was commented on with pleasure, and the chief cause of that revival was recognised to be the offer of Baron A 1. Nordenskiold, the well known explorer, to take command of an expedition to the South Polar regions on condition that the Australian colonies contributed a sum of £5 000 towards the expenses. The offer was cordially accepted by the society, and the council was authorised to head a subscription list with £200 Two gentlemen at the meeting promised to subscribe £100 each, and the project has also been warmly taken up by the Royal Society of Victoria At the (Grand National Steeplechase Meeting held by the Victoria Amateur Turf Club at Caulfield on the 16th that the racing was of an interesting kind, and the programme was gone through without any mishap more serious than the lull over a fence of the favourite in the Steeplechase This race, which is the only four miles steeplechase run its) race meetings in the colonies, brought out a held of 12 competitors, and the New Zealand bred horse Titokowaru was a warm favourite He, however, tell over a fence after he had gone nearly three miles, and Sir Wilfrid, a fine stump of a steeplechase horse, sent over from Tasmania, won I lit. race The winner, who showed the possession of superior powers both as a jumper and stayer, was ridden by the popular jockey Corrigan, His 3-Xcellpnty the Governor and Lady Hopetoun were present at the meeting, The fourteenth annual show of the Victorian Poultry and Dog Society was opened in the Exhibition building on the 13th ltisL, and the attendance on that and the succeed- ing days exceeded all anticipations In the dog classes there was a large increase in entries, and the quality of the exiles was higher than in previous years The receipts for the show were over 2000, being nearly 100 in excess of those of last j ear Some notable prices were paid for prize stock, is being given for a pair of ducks, and £25 for a St Bernard puppy MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL The Argus Office, Monday Evening The money market has shown little animation since our last fortnightly summary, but an easy tone prevails, and accumulation, especially by building societies and other institutions transacting mortgage business, still continues. The principal reason for the comparatively slack demand for capital is the difficulty of finding outlets on a sufficiently remunerative scale The shrinkage in stock exchange values occasioned partly by the reaction from over speculation and partly by the existing labour troubles has also had some effect in lessening the extent of the accommodation sought for Real property business shows no signs of expansion, sales made being strictly for business or residential requirements The Melbourne Clearing house returns for the fortnight ended 18th List, show a total clearance of £10 757 806, against £10 8G0,S_:' for the previous fortnight, and against Í10,02_,115 for the corresponding fortnight last year Bank rates for discounts and overdrafts are raised The commerce of the port has been disorganised and placed in a state of partial blockade by the strikes which commenced a few days ago, and the markets are not therefore in a normal condition. 'As it is not possible to ship to the other colonies, and as the disturbed conditions render it risky to under- take business far U.K. and foreign countries, values of export "apples are adversely affected, while those of imports tend to rise. The strikes have not, however, lasted long enough to make it clear what articles will be must effected and to what extent. Notwithstanding the advance in the English and foreign wheat markets, and the likelihood of the advance being maintained, the local market has been dull, with a slight tendency to recede, at (say) 3s. 10d. for prime quality. The hindrance to their intercolonial trade has caused millers to look to England for an outlet for some of their surplus flour, and shipments per steamer for the fortnight and additional engagements present a total of 1,500 tons. The mills are; however, running short of coal, and it is expected that, if the strikes continue, they will have to close. Tile import houses have been moderately active, so far as home requirement, are concerned, but they have been obliged to largely cancel their intercolonial orders. Sugar hits hardened up to a basis of say £25 for fine whites, but the large output of the local refinery gives its controlling position, so that unless it raises its prices (finest No. 1 now being sold at £23 10s.) the prospect of a large rise in the market is uncertain. No Queensland sugars can, however, come into the market for the present, while the supplies of Mauritius in first hands are not large, and include a considerable proportion of low whites and brewing crystals. American granulated sugar has been selling steadily, and has advanced to £25 for trade lots. A considerable business has been done in yellow sugars, and at the auction held on the 18th inst. nearly 6000 packages were sold at £20 to £21 12s. 6d, Browns and rations are in steady demand at slightly improved rates. In the market in tea little of consequence has I been done since the sale of importations per Chingtu reported a fortnight ago. Some of the lots but then disposed of have since been quitted. A considerable quantity of old Benson common congous, covering about 5,000 half-chests, has been cleared out Ceylons have been selling steadily, at fair prices.

Concerning European man of getting centres, our last mail advices, dated London, 18th ult, report a much-improved tone, and In general greater confidence than has prevailed for some months. In Bradford the outlook was distinctly more hop of ill, while at the third series of London sales, when in progress, the market had recovered the opening fall, and prices ruled equal to the rate of the preceding series, a level which was maintained until the close. By cable we are informed that at the Antwerp sales, which closed on the 'shed that. prices ruled fully on a par with these rates-, and that prospects are good for the September series in London. The outlook, therefore, for the ensuing colonial season continues to improve, and a large addition to the buying strength is expected, attracted by the superiority of the selection of wools now sold in the colonies. American and Continental demand will, It is anticipated, be particularly st runs, the former stimulant, d by the tariff question, which has practically annihilated their importation of Bradford worsted goods, and must extend the demand for raw 1 wool; and it is of importance to note the inaugura- tion of a direct steamship service between colonial! ports and New York.

Large stocks are still held in several of the country j districts, but owing to the interior condition of a considerable quantity of this season's wheat the actual available surplus fit for export is difficult to arrive at, the prospects of the forthcoming season are present satisfactory, seasonable rains having fallen throughout the colony, and with a larger area under crop a good surplus should be available for export.

DE BEER and Co. report c-The (general dulness which pervaded our freight market at date of our last Issue of 20th ult has continued with but FIght alteration, though it must be borne in mind that this is generally the most inactive period of the year, being just in advance of the arrival of the new season's clip, which is, however, beginning to come forward in small lot., in expectation of which rates have somewhat improved, and for the new season's wool have opened at 3d. and is).. as quoted below. For steamers we expect rates will improve as deliveries become funeral, but it is not expected that said ing rates will advance, as the supply of steam ton as ere will be ample for all requirements during the early part of the season. For some time past there has been much trouble between the local steamship owners and there employees, which, was reg it, has at last reached a crisis, The officers have gone out on strike, in some instances followed by the crown, who are (supporting the former in their demands. As the owners have succeeded in replacing some of the crews, the wharf labourers (stevedores) have joined in the strike. Unita a compromise is shortly t elected the intercolonial trade will be suspended ; already nevers! steamer are laid up. At present this does not interfere with foreign vessel-, as it is only a local dispute, but it is impossible to say how far it may extend as all the Australian ports are acting in unison, The clearances for London during the past four weeks are embraced in the four regular mail steamers, with 1.938 bales wool, se, and the. s.s. Echuca, 1.730 tons, with 1,220 bales wool; besides which the 'old. steamer Yarra, 2,670. has sailed for Marseilles ; the ss. Elberfeld, 1.712, for Hamburg; and the N.D.L. ft earner Nurnberg, 1,025. for Bremen ; leaving the home loading berth occupied by the four regular mail steamers and the ship Loch Vennachar, 1485 tons. Bates for London are now quoted as follow : Per Steamer Wool, ld. and 2d per lb. for greasy and scoured respectively ; tkln^'OOs.; leather, 60s. ; tallow, nominal basis, ground, 25s.; chopped, SO: tin, copper, and ores, 359, all per ton of 20 w t.; and preserved meats. 40s. per ton of 40 cubic feet.

For Mauritius, the berth is now occupied by the Drills., barque Earl's but I, 300, a full cargo being' engaged. The engagements during the period under review have been on a limited scale, and are embraced In the following The colonial owned barques Coorong, 344, to load at Port Adelaide a cargo of breadstuffs, for Mauritius at 26s. the True Blue, 447, to load at Port Augusta, on private terms, for Cape Town, a cargo of breadstuffs; and the otago, 340, to load a cargo of manures at Sydney for Mauritius at 30...
