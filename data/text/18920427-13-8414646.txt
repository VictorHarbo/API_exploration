The following remarks upon silver and the adjustment of American foreign trade are taken from the March circular of the well known ' banking and financial house of Messrs. Henry Clews and Co., of New York:? " There is one other factor which is again become his influential 12 Wall- street, and that is the silver question. Already it is producing; Important effects which had not been expected to appear at this early stage in the outworking of the Silver Act of 1890. The renewals of the export of gold has proved an eye opener. During the year 1891 our exports of goods and specie exceeded our imports of the like items by 185,000,000dol., and for the first two months of 1892 fully the same rate of excess has been maintained. It might have been expected that, under such circumstances, ' we should now he importing; large amounts of gold to settle this large apparent trade balance' in our favour. The fact is, however, that we are called upon to export gold, now are we to account for this extraordinary movement? After setting off against this creditor balance of some 215 millions for the last 14 months all that may have accrued against us in Europe on account of Interest, freight on imports, undervaluation, &c.;, there ought to be a balance in our favour of something like 16 millions for an average of the last decade about Sir millions surplus of exports over imports has sufficed to liquidate these debtor items. There arises from these facts the strongest possible presumption that, since the beginning of ISfll considerably over 100 millions of our securities have been returned from Europe, for the credit balance has unquestionably been settled, and there is no other way in which it could have been done except by the return of stocks, bonds, c. Thin reflux of our securities dates from the period of the enactment of the last silver law, which doubled the Government purchases of silver." It may be added to the foregoing that a marked disinclination is shown in all the European financial circles to part with gold to the United States. On the contrary the exchangeslhavc latterly operated against the United States to the extent of drawing gold from the country despite the apparent balance of trade in its favour. We question the accuracy, of Messrs. Henry Clews and Co.'s statement that 100 million dollars will cover the freight earned by British and continental ship-owners on the American trade, and the large amount of interest payable on American securities held in Europe, not to speak of the money taken by travellers from the States and the remittances made by immigrants to their friends in Europe. In fact we doubt whether, when the question is thoroughly sifted, there is any real surplus due to the United States from other countries. Imports and exports form only one factor in the calculation. Upon the recent decline in silver and its consequences the money article of The Times of March 24 comments as follows: The further fall in the price of silver to 40¡¡d. re gives the interest which was excited some time back. when the activity of the bimetnllists was greater than it has been of late among those concerned In re mittances to and from India. suggestions are again being made that the Government of India should take the silver currency into its own hands, and issue the silver us token money. This proposal need not at present be discussed, and is not likely to be adopted, but unless silver recovers in price its advocates will no doubt continue to ask for some measure of the kind. Some of those who study this particular question closely are of opinion that the present, depression in the price of the metal is due largely to the temporary decline in the general exports from India, and that when these revive silver will also recover to some tent. This is probable, and it must also be remembered that the fall in the Indian exchange will Itself help to produce an increase in the exports and a decrease in the imports of India, but there can he no permanent recovery in the value of silver until the production of silver is diminished or its consump- tion increased. It is hardly possible to estimate the harm that has been done to the silver market by the artificial stimulus to silver- mining by the American legislation of the last 14 years. If silver had been left to find its own level many mines which only just pay expenses would probably have long ceased working, instead of which they are being kept going in the vain hope that some effective international ngrcoincntwlU become to by which the price of the metal will he raised." According to Messrs. Stables, Straker, and Co.'s Australian circular, the exports from the United Kingdom to Melbourne for the first twelve weeks of the present year were of less value than for the corresponding period of many years past. The total was £1,450,000, against £1,714,100 for 1891, £1,707,400 for 1860, and £2,30G,200.for 1880. But the total exports to the Australasian colonies are well maintained, amounting to £5,721,700 for the twelve weeks, against £5,732,200 for the corresponding period of 1891. The ship-ownersïathomc appear to be convinced that they have had quite enough of the competition with the Tyser line for Australian freight, and their representatives, the brokers, are now parleying with Messrs. Tyser. Doubtless both sides will hail a cessation of hostilities, and it will not surprise if the ring is reconstituted, the Tyser line being admitted. In that case freights to the colonies will inevitably be raised again to their old level, a. movement which would i benefit the holders of existing stocks of heavy merchandise. The transhipments at the port of Melbourne for the first three months of the year amounted to £-143,758 against £434,533 for the corresponding three months of 1801. Particulars of the shipments of cereals, from the port of Melbourne for the first three months of the year, according to the Customs returns (centals being converted into other weights) are as follows: Total. Wheat Peas .. Oats .. Bushels. 1,354,100 40,005 12,552 Tons. Tons. 1,183 filled Bushels. Bushels. 30,770 1,300,012 10 40,015 1,003 14,454 The exportation of peas is noteworthy, and it is understood that relatively to local prices the shipments to London have given a fair return. If the cultivation pays farmers,' there is no reason why this article of export should not grow. In 1891 England imported - no less than 4,10,17 bushels of peas of the declared value of £802,427.' There should certainly be room for a considerable supply from this colony. The local wheat market continues to show firmness, with buyers at 4s. Business reported includes 1,000 bugs for milling purposes at 4s., and about 500 bags, principally for shipment, at 4s. 4d.
