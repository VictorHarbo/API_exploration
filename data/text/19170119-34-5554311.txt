Foreign spies are plotting to fore« the King of Zeta to abdicate the "throne. The King is in love with Princess Sophia, but the laws of the country will not permit him to marry her. Terence receives a message from the Prime Minister of Zeta, and sets out to help the King. The Princess learns of the plot against the King, and sets off, disguised, to warn him. She meets Terence and the two proceed to the palace. On ac- count of the remarkable likeness between him and the King, Terence is able to deceive the foreign representatives when they come for the King's signature to the abdication, and not till he has signed it with his own name do fhcy discover that the King has escaped. He returns, however, to save Terence. He signs the paper, abdicating the throne, but congratulates himself on being now free to wed the Princess. , "POTTS BUNGLES AGAIN" ".Nestor Comedy.
