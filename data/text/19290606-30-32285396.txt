The Capitol is in very truth Perth's 'Community . Tiieatre.' A place of Civic pride for the reason Hhat Woat Australians built it. It keeps lhouey in the State, and ils object- is to. give a. ''fair deal' to its own Citizens. Hence the determination of its Directors to present a scale of prices as meets the spirit ot the times.
