AUSTRALIAN PRODUCE IN ENGLAND. LONDON NOTES. -fFItOM oun CORRESPONDENT.) BUTTER. LONDON, February 2. — The butter market shows little change from last week, and to day's prices aro practically tho same as those ruling last Flddnv. Tlomniul -I «= tin! i for buyers do not like paying the present high prices, and are hoping against hope that in the near fuLuro there will be a reduction in values. But, even though mauy buyers are abstaining as much as possible, there is still a fair in quiry, und the arrival this week of more than 100,000 boxes from Australia and Now Zealand! lias not caused any fall in prices. People are beginning to recognise that there is ft serious shortage in supplies, and that the cold stores, both here aud on the Continent, are practically empty of butter, whereas at this time last year j they all contained a considerable .quantity. The "boar" crusade in the newspapers has failed j ignominiously, and we have heard nothing about j the "butter corner" for a week or so. ! The reason of the present strength of tho ! market is well explained by tho butter manager of one of the principal provision Arms in the I West of England, who says:— r"The past sum- I tner's drought throughout Eugland and the Con- tinent is without doubt the cause of tho present | high prices, and, with only moderate arrivals j in view, high prices are bound to continue until! tbe shortage is relieved by new season's buttor | from Ireland and the butter- producing countries j of Europe, which cannot be expected in any j quantities before May next. From the English farmer little can be expected, as the demand for inilk in Its raw state for daily consumption is sufficient to prohibit its being made iuto but ter. The present prlco paid to English farmers and dairymen is 10d to la per gallon; this la equal to 2s Gd per lb. for butter, on tho same basis of return to tho farmer." Present quotations:— Danish, 131/ to 136/; Victorian and New South Wales, choicest 120/ lo 128/, occasionally 130/, srconiiury 122/ to 121/; Queensland, choicest 126/ to 125/, secondary 122/ to 124/; Few Zealand, choicest 130/ to 132/; Argen tine, choicest 120/ tu 128/, occasionally 130/, Importers aro again complaining about tho quulity of Australian butters, and inquiry proves that tho complaints are justified. Many brands, both from Victoria and New South Wales, are not of good flavor. Tho fault is generally attri buted to the heat which was prevalent in these ; two States at tho time of manufacture. This poorness of quality has had its effect on prices, and most agents think that they would have been nble to gut a shilling or two more than they have done for their butters this week tt the quulity had been all right. FROZEN MEAT. Prices of Australian and Now Zealand frozen meat aro well maintained,. not on account of any brisk demand, but simply because supplies of all sorts are unusually restricted. Canterbury mutton is unobtainable, and the only New Zea land sheep on the market aro North Islands, whlfth noil nt .4/1 tn 4 1'jil fnr wethnrfl nnd 2a£rl for owes. Good Australlau sheep havo been scarce, aud are now worth 3Ud tp 3J/£d, but fair quantities have arrived this week, so prices are likely to give way somewhat. Lambs are scarce, and the few good New Zealnnds avail able make 6d per lb., while Australians range from 4d to 4%d. Australian beef is in very limited supply, and Ui selling readily at 8%d to 3%d for hinds and 3d to 3d for fores, AUSTRALIAN MEAT ON THE CONTINENT. A Smithtield meat importer vrtio has just returned from Italy, speaks very favorably of tho growing popularity of Australian meat on the Continent. In Italy, especially, he says, Australian meat is greatly preferred to Argen tine for several reasons. The first and chief ouo is that the quality of much of tho Argen tine meat sent to Italy has been very indif ferent, and the second reason is tbe friction which exists between Argentine and Italy ow ing to the immigration regulations. Argen tina, just now, is very unpopular with Ita lians, und a good opportunity thercforo presents itself for pushing Australian meat. Sir George Roid, during a brief holiday In Switzerland, has discussed with the Minister for Agriculture nt Berne, the regulations relating to tho admis sion of Australian meat into the Confederation, and he is hopeful that the interview will havo satisfactory results. TALLOW. Business has bqon very dull this week, and the spot demand is poor. At the auctions on Wednesday only 3C3 casks were sold out of an offering of 724. at an average decline of 3d per cwt.
