NEW SOCIETY IN DENMARK COPENHAGEN: A Society for Danish Jewish History was recently established here. This follows centuries of Jewish presence in Den mark. Sephardi Jews from Holland were the first to settle in Denmark in the sixteenth century. They were followed by Jews from Germany and Eastern Europe. By the nineteenth cen tury, Jews played a prominent role in the in tellectual and financial life of Denmark. They were granted most civil rights by King Frederick the sixth in 1814. Around the turn of the century, there was a new wave of Jewish im migration from Russia and Eastern Europe. Jews fitted into Danish society without tension and this proved its value during the German occupation of Denmark, when nearly all Jews escaped to Sweden with the help of the Danish people. Among board members of the new society are the chief rabbi of Copenhagen Bent Melchior and chief librarian of the Danish parliament and head of the Judaica book collection at the Royal â€¢ Library in Copenhagen. Dr Kristian Hvidt.
