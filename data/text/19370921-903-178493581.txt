Primary Products The Question of Markets In the recent remarks of the Gen eral Pr°=irtent. of t.hp Prirran' Produc er-.' Union mr. Dud'td. M.r.n.l. sm othpr indication is given of declining markets pir-npH for our nnipuT pro ducer.?. Mr. Dunlop stated th^ im ports of bi'tt^r into Hip Ur;*eH King dom, for 193'? bad fallen 20.950 tons corpmre1! w'th the orpvtous b-'!i«R months, end this y^ar'i fi^iirpc ,vil] be . lower Run. He aUo ad^ed that the phnirrily low nrices of butter in Groc-t , Britain resulted from competition by . mprqrat-:ne. ' Another authority. Mr. Rursell Kin', a iv»mter nf the Cii^r^^n ?wpqlth Dflirv Pr'rinre Eouaiv^ation Oonrmitte0. al^n believeq that the*' is fionqr^r from rbe same source sbould | butter nrfie11. be inrrea^ed in Enslfind. ' In AuHraHa butter costs irany iwro a 1b. more t-inn in Great, B'i tiin where wastf' are not, .cn eood and j the purchasing nower of t^e een»val | noinmun'.tv is. th^^fore. lower tban i here. In most European countries t.'ie position is wor.se: and in Dnnpiark. dairymen are too poor to eat their [ own product, consuming. instead. i n^arearine. It would seem that the i be.=t chance for an extensive and well i paid market for Australian butter I producers lies within the Common wealth. Every effort .should be made to increase our ipopulat-on. At pre sent the Australian customers of our dairymen include 500,000 factory workers. With their wives and chil dren they probably number well over 2,000,000 persons. They, and other members of the cornmunity, do not object to paying more than the Eng lish consumer for their butter so that the dairyman here may not have to ' live like the Danish producer 6ce*. ] No objection, either, is raised to the exchange rale, set at its present, level entirely to aid the primary producer. It result;, however, in 25 per cent, ex tra being paid by the community for every article imported; and costs the taxpayers many millions more per an num in the settling of our overseas in terest bill. It also gives the dairyman another 25 per cent, more for his ex ports, thus bringing into line with Australia the prices of British sales. Customers, not compstitors with the farmers already established here, are required in Australia. Our secondary industries offer the best means ot providing for new arrivals who would 1 be customers, not comjx-titore, of the ! farmer. Population in Great Britain | is declining and a world authority re cently stated tliat if British immi grant* were not secured now it would be impossible to do so later. — Paul Cheyne.
