It originated through Mr. Cankett closing his premises, and declaring that it should not be open any longer as a public thoroughfare. I erected the Bridge at my sole expense for the accommodation of the public. Therefore it is not probable that I should have closed the Bridge, unless compelled so to do by Mr. Cankett.
