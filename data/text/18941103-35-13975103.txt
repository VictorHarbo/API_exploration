Thus was for years the Imperial household dwelt in the midst of alarms, which broke down the Czarina's health, and caused the Czar those periodical outbursts of mad anger which his Bulto dreaded That tremendous struggle is the most prominent thing of his reign Never was a political cause so prodigal of martyrs, and it is impossible that it has not had a vast moral effect What that moral effect has been he only can do claim to whom the secret i relieves of Russia during the last half of the nineteenth century have been disclosed In resisting the Czar was also impelled by a Bingulancrrudosronco of national feeling, which, animated by a Moscow journalist, the well-known leather, aimed at the restoration in its integrity of the ancient Muscovite civilisation of the period of Peter, and upon ling that consummation n union of all Slav peoples in opposition to German and Western nations and tendencies The Czar was the more inclined to follow in this path from his strong Slav temperament and his belief in the unity of the Slav onto nations under the protection and guidance of the Great White Czar For several years this movement had great success, and perhaps we may also say that it was not without its effect as J. counterpoise to Nihilism In a still strong but modified form this sentiment exists yet, but with the death of Katkoff it lost a magnetic personality and ceased to be openly a power behind the throne Next in importance was the breach with Germany, followed by the entente with France Gallo- phile sympathies were cultivated in Alexander by reaction from his father's German alliances, by the military circles about the young prince, and then, it in said, by the resentment of his Danish bride against the despoilers of Schleswig Holstein But between Slav and Teuton is the memory of a secular conflict The fortification of the frontier between Russia and Germany, and its defence by further and further aggregations of troops, were more significant for Germany The suppression of German language and Lutheran religion in the Baltic Provinces, the Russification of German immigrants in other parts, the difficulties of commercial treaties, have all borne witness to the strength of the anti-German feel Eng, which, however, more recently has somewhat moderated Other racial conflicts marked the Czar's rule Part of his crusade for homogeneity consisted in the subversal of institutions peculiar to Finland, though guaranted by many Sovereigns of Russia But overshadowing this has been the persecution of the Jews Whether this was due to religious or social economic reasons it would be hard to say Under the influence of M Pobiedonostzeff, who is a Slavophile of a fanatic type, it is asserted that the Czar was impelled by religious bigotry to order the expulsion of the Jews With more probability it is hold that the Czar found himself rather the instrument of a popular feeling, The Jew, as money-lender, liquor-seller middleman, and rural providence to the improvident Russian, drew to himself the traffic of the country, and his pitiless extortions aroused against even the innocent of the Hebrew race a w ave of irresistible popular feeling such as closed to the Chinese the ports of Australia and the United States Whatever the reason, the expulsion of the Jews was a dark chapter in Russia's record under Czar Alexander III The expatriation-for such it was of thousands of men and women and children, ruined in fortune, often broken with ill-usage and hard- ship, and loaded with insults and injuries, is a measure of extremity but it did not seem that the Autocrat had first exhausted his powers of administration to lessen the influence of the Jews Disasters fell thick upon the empire in the Czar's reign If war was avoided, SO were not plague, pestilence, and famine In regard to sanitation Russia is still primitive Few cities possess a sewerage system The common recept able for waste is the snow around the people's doors, in spring, when thaw sets in and decom- position is rapid, the result can be imagined Always subject to typhus, smallpox, and similar diseases, now plagues visited the unhappy country in the closing eighties and the opening nineties Influenza was a destructive scourge, and passed on undiminished in virulence to Europe, America, and Australia Next came the famine To scientific ngucultnrotbo Russianfarmor is quite indifferent Diminishing harvests are not uncommon, but the crop of 1891 entirely failed in many govern- ments The people, loaded with debts, could not help themselves Their cattle perished, seed corn was consumed, grass and the bark of trees and leaves eked out their miserable provision, whole villages were depopulated by the desperate peasants seeking work or subsistence, and soon the mortality of human beings from starvation grew considerable The Czar long resisted a serious view of this calamity, and even refused offers of supplies from Germany At last, when Central and Eastern Russia lay supine in famine, tardy energy was shown Aided by liberal con- tributions from foreign parts, among them England and America, the committees in Russia did good work, but several disclose some painful phases of character dis- close themselves. The direst distress of the people was made an opportunity for dishonesty and rapacity perished and fraudulent provisions were sold, contributions of money and grain were made away with, and inefficiency paralysed much of the work in the wake of the great famine carne lesser local ones, and upon the miserable people already so much afflicted there fell cholera from Asia black box, spotted typhus, and other diseases The loss of human life was lamentable, notably among children, the mortality of adults and the young rising to thousands per diem Innumerable agriculturists were live tolerably ruined and debts had been incurred and losses suffered which threatened to be for years a drag upon the population Besides the German misunderstanding, the Czar's foreign policy led to events in the Balkans and in Central Asia in 1839, by reason of a collision between Afghan and Russian outposts at Penjdeh, a dangerous strain occurred in the Czar's relations with Great Britain, but delimitation was agreed upon, and that port passed More serious, because more directly menacing India, was the Russian advance upon the Pamirs in 1892, which led to remonstrances from China, and to the strengthening of the British-Indian frontier from Gilgit In Aein, with these exceptions, the policy of the Czar has rather been development than annexation In Siberia the Czar's rule witnessed the commencement of a vast work, not likely soon to be completed, the construction of a transcontinental railway to Vladivostock The sun was not only to strengthen the eastern stations of Siberia against foreign attack, but also to open up Southern Siberia, where already many inducements have been held out to agriculturists, and whose settlement is rapidly proceeding It is a region, travellers concur in saying, suited to a large and prosperous population, and far different from the Siberia of popular imagination In the finances of the Empire, a vast and intricate subject, the chief event of the reign was the conversion of the public debt at a lower interest Deficits here of nearly annual occurrence, and the fluctuations of the rouble and the home our lency rendered an equilibrium almost unattainable Money was freely raided by foreign loans, chiefly issued in Paris, the destination of this money being strategic railways, fortifications, ships, and armaments The exposes of government were largely met with the liquor duties, under which the demoralisation of the people by drunkenness was the price of the maintenance of the State. The Czar's keenest interest was the army From his training he had a thorough, knowledge of the state of the forces and the ever-growing necessities of the European situation Like the German Kaiser, the Russian Czar cannot afford to forget that he is before all things a soldier, and that at bottom his realm is a military machine Alexander III was a martinet, but he introduced many reforms tending to the scientific training of young officers, and to increasing the personal responsibility and influence of officers for and among their mon Under his reign, too, the Russian navy, both in ships, and mercantile and the volunteer fleet, which combines both characters, has undergone great improvement and extension Busied in these projects and in the prodigious detail of an administration which brings the government of all Russia to the foot of the throne such an exacting and painstaking monarch was Alexander III he had little time, and apparently little inclination, for imperial progresses abroad Any such events in his own dominions were apt to be perilous While travelling in Russia the Czar and the Imperial family had the narrowest escape from destruction This was at Bourke, on the Trans-Caspian line, in September, 1888 Many servants lost their lives, but the Imperial family were unhurt The accident was attributed to the high speed of the Czar's train along a defective hue Emperor Nicholas once declared that he was the only honest man in Russia It was a current saying that Alexander III was the only faithful husband in his Empire At Gatsluna and everywhere else when possible the Czar lived a simple home life among his children, in whom he was absorbed when the duties of government did not claim him He had some taste in art and music he even practised the corner piston for diversion Melancholy, stern, hardworking, and difficult of access, the recreations of the autocrat were those which he shared with his younger sons and daughters, music and dancing, or walking together about the grounds Even within that devoted circle the Czar and sorrows The strain of the Nihilist period wore out the Czarina, and an attack of influenza left her health a source of anxiety to others and suffering to herself Their second son, the Grand Duke George (born in 1871), developed signs of lavuhdisra, and sowing to consumption, has just been compelled to abandon his claim to the throne The third Prince, Michael (born in 1878 was not strong either, and about the OarowitehNioholas (born in 1868) even alarmist rumours were sometimes heard In 1892 this Punto made a grand tour, and when in India to < owed every hospitality and respect Whilst in Japan he was attacked by an insane noticing, but by the intervention of his cousin, who accompanied him upon his tour, the Prince sustained no injury The Czarewitch returned through Siberia, where at Vladivostock he turned the first sod of the railway In Russia the Czarewitch resumed his military duties, and paid some visits to foreign courts, where he made a good impression The features of his character were rather negative than positive, and it did not then appear that he had matured into a distinct individuality Tho the daughters of the Czar are the Grand Duchess Xenia (born in 1875 and Olga (born in 1882) During the Czar's reign he did much to stimu- late and encourage national art Thus, he dises- tablished the Italian opera and substituted Russian artists and works by Russian composers The Czar himself was fond of music, and richly rewarded such artists as were summoned to perform at the Imperial Court In paint- ing he also strove to establish a Russian school, but not very much was the outcome of In music there was a much more distinct success, and several distinguished composers, if they did not positively begin their careers under Alexander III , produced some masterpieces in his reign The grand period of national literature seemed to have declined before Alexander came to the throne, and no names occur in his annals worthy of the company of Tolstoi, Tur"e ni"lï, or Dostoievsky He was punctilious in religious rites, and no doubt sincere, since the liturgy of the Russian orthodox Church is not for easy going observances The services are very long, the ceremonial requirements street and numerous, and without some measure of sincere holiday they would wear out the patience of the ordinary man This orthodoxy much endeared the Czar both to the common people and the hierarchy One of the annual in action, almost sacerdotal, of the Russian Emperor, is the blessing of the waters of the Neva in spring, when the ice is about to break up for half an hour or more the Czar was wont to stand bareheaded in a temperature of arctic severity, and as he was said it was believed by his people that heaven pi otected him from the weather in return for his piety Alexander III was by turns described in extremes It was said that, robust in health and herculean in size, he was a coward who shrank from peril Others insinuated that his was more than the melancholy of the Romanoffs, and that the access of rage to which he was subject indicated that dread mental visitation which has overtaken so many of his dynasty in the 300 years of its rule Others who did not doubt his courage and his sanity, asserted that his intellect was narrow, his obstinacy profound, his belief in the divine right of the autocrat almost a mania But the sources of much that reached Western Europe about the Czar were doubtful The best informed seldom ventured upon direct assertions, knowing the Czar's shrinking from publicity and the strictness of the press laws in Russia In Western Europe those who made most free with the Czar were precisely those who had political or racial grudges against him An expelled agitator is seldom a just cause of the regime which would not tolerate him The verdict of history upon the Czar will be less extreme than that of his detractors like Lenin, his apologists like Madame Plashkoff A man of narrow mind, deficient in tact, nor fine, and sympathy, he probably was but he was personally upright, temperate, laborious, sincere, and loved to have men about him of similar type He was ever a man of peace, from principle as well as policy Not once but several times the Empire was on the verge of war, caused by indiscreet Generals-KomarofE at Penjdeh Kaulbars in Bulgaria, not to speak of breaches with Turkey, China, and Germany , but it was always found that the Czar was open to diplomatic approach and favoured peaceful remedies He was a p states Apart from the political emancipation (and it must be remembered that Russian thoughts are not our thoughts, nor their ways our was), Alexander III uniformly set before him the Teuton and welfare of his people When the famine could no longer be denied all that even autocracy could do to help the victims was done, and the Czar's private purse supplied many a need If the circumstances of the first exodus of the Jews were indelibly disgraceful, it seems that it was the Czar who by the exertion of his authority so far ameliorated the condition of the exiles that they were saved from much of the former popular and official abuse In all the functions of administration Alexander III shrank from no toil and no responsibility he devolved upon none beside himself the cares of State , indeed, it has been said that he demanded too great a load of the merely routine drudgery of government Throughout the Civil Service and the Army he studied to pro mute efficient and honest service, if not very much change is to be seen, the fault is not 1791 Alexander's, but that of circumstances His Ministers have seldom been men whose names have carried with them a sense of reason is worthy of the Empire, and few of them are more than names outside of Russia In M de Giers the Czar had a faithful administrator, and if not a really great Ch mellor, the fault may have been his master's As has been said, Alexander III wits or strict, almost austere, morality , his court was never disgraced by his example or his tolerance of et ii All this is no trifling praise Let us remember that this man, at the age of 20, was forced out of seclusion into the highest pro mercury in a gay, luxurious, and careless court, that for many years more he was the owner of almost irresistible power, and at the same time the object of a relentless attack, when every moment might expose him and all he held dearest to assassination, yet he never varied in his devotion to what he held to be his duty , he served his country's interests as far as he knew them , he led a blameless life Not now can any man write what his reign did for Russia Human societies are difficult to mould, and only in the perspective of history can extender III's place be truly dia corned, but at least his contemporaries may say that with his whole heart he did the thing which seemed to be duty
