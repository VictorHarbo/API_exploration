CURE OF TUBERCULOSIS'has;ñdwi been X successfully practised for a great number of years., by. Mr. Carl Olsen, at 12, Capper-street, Kent Town, S.A. It is the only cure . known. Surgical ; operations never cure, because the disease tuberculosis is a constitutional one. All forms of tuberculosis have been absolutely cures by Mr. Olson's remedy, r Pulmonary,' 'Hip. Neck, Foot, Arm, Leg, and Spinal Tuberculosis have had to yield; Kidneys, Peritoneum, Bladder, Fistula in Arms, Tuberculosis of the ovaries and also that' most disfiguring under distressing face or tuberculosis -lupus,"- together with Scalp Tuberculosis; in fact, all Tuberculosis- swellings or ulcers, no matter what part of the body they occur, have been absolutely and permanently cured. Two years ago our little son contracted Tuberculosis in -his right ankle; He was operated upon in the North Adelaide Hospital to no use. and was in danger of losing his foot. We beg to thank Mr. C.
