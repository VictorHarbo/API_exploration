COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE The Argus Office, Wednesday Evening. Export entries were passed at the Customs, to-day for 9,451 ounces of gold, of which 9,421 ounces were for shipment in the Vic- toria for Suez; the remainder being for small parcels in the hands of passengers. The same activity noticeable in the gold market at the commencement of the month, still prevails, the demand for shipment being considerable. The banks have beenn buying at prices calculated on the basis of 3l. 13s. 3d. per ounce for standard, which brings the cost delivered in England. to from £3 17s. 5½d. to 3l. 17s. 8¼d., according to the route by which it is conveyed, and taking into account the chances of saving of interest by the shorter one. At Melbourne the brokers quote 3l.15s. to 3l. 15s. 6d. for Castlemaine and Sandhurst ; SI. 15s. 6d, to 8?. 15s. 9d. for Mount Korong; SI. 16s. Od. to 87.17s. for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Creole, and Avoca ; SI. 10s. Cd. to SI. 17s. 9d. for Ararat and Pleasant Creek ; SI. 17s. tb 37.17s. 9d. for the Ovens ; and 87. 18s. to i 37.18s. Od. for Ballaarat. The Norfolk sailed on the 1st instant with 82,570 ounces, and the Royal Charter on the 11th instant, with 93,732 ounces. These are the largest ship- ments that have been made since that by the Suffolk, in October last, of 112,446 ounces. The escort 'returns have fully~maintainoi the increase which followed the "termination of the long period of drought which provailed during the summer. The quantities from "all tho districts will bear comparison with those of last year. The total of last week's returns is abovo tho average of the past three months, although still below that of tho year 1857.

The departure of the European and Australian Itoyal Mail Company's steam- ship Victoria, leads to our publication of our monthly summary of commercial news. Wo have again to complain of irregu- larities of the mail sorvico. The English mail of the 16th _ ohruary, duo on tho 7 th inst., has not yet made her appcaiance, and all tho Australian colonies aio deprived of the opportunity of replying to their corre- spondence. The inconveniences arising from ' the laches of the Company aro becoming too serious to bo quietly endured. Yesterday evening the matter was biought under the consideration of the Legislative Assembly. when_tho following lesolutions were unani- mously adopted :-First. " That, in tho opi- nion of this House, tho impeifcct manner in which tho contract for the conveyance of Her Majesty's mails between Austialia and Eng- land 1ms beon carried out by the Australian and European Steam Navigation Company has been such as to call for the most decidod expression of dissatisfaction on the part of this House." Second. " That, inasmuch as the conditions of the contract have been so palpably violated in spirit and in fact, this House deems it expedient that stops be taken suggesting to the Imperial Government the expediency of annulling the present con- ti act." Whether this will havo the effect of hastening the actiou of the Homo Govern- ment, with regard to somo really reliablo service or not, it will at any rate convey homo a strong expression of the public mind of tho colony on the matter. Since our last summary there have boen some important movements in the monoy market. The revenue returns, for the year and quarter ended the 81st "March, havo heen published. The total revenuo for tho year amounted to 3,402,0497.16s. 8d., against 2,982,8327. 5s. 5d. for the year ending the 81st March, 1857, and for the quarter to 712,2927. 9s. 3d., against 080,3117. 12s. lid. for the coriesponding quarter of 1857, giving a not increase of 419,2177. 11s. 3d. on tho year, and of 25,9807. 10s. 4d. on the quartor. In the Customs revenue theie is an increase on the year in every impoit except wine, on which there is a decreaso amounting to 22,0067.11s. 9d. Theie is a falling off in tho export duty on gold of 18,1797.10s. 8d. on tho year, and of 3,9977. 5s. Id. on the quartor. The gold-fields revenue exhibits a falling off of 9,0707.15s. Id. on tho year, and an increaso of 1,9677. 10s. 9d. on tho quaiter. In the proceeds of the salo of lands there is an in- creaso of 260,6887. Is. Od. on the year, and a decreaso of 16,7627. 7s. 9d. on the quartor. In the revenue derived from licences there is an increase of 142,8267. 7s. 5d. on the year, and of 7,0567. Is. 4d. on the quarter. Tho Post Office has increased to the extent of 12,3797. 18s. 8d. on tho yoar, and 2,4197. 12s 7d. on the quarter. Tho publication of these returns has exercised a considerable effect in keeping up the buoyant feeling in the money market. The determination of the Go- vernment on tho subject of tho railway tenders is however anxiously looked for, as the mode in which the payments for tho woiks aro to bo made must exerciso au immense influence on the comsc. of commerce and of oxchango for some years to come. The items of the revenue tables for the year and quaiter ended the 81st Maich, are looked upon as highly satisfactory, separately as woll as collectively. In a timo of depressed trade, with the commercial interests of the colony ernbarraSBeil by a continued lnpouring ot British goods and manufactures far beyond the absorbing power of tho population, tho revenues have been maintained, andoxccssiro as the quantity of goods imported has been, the resources of the colony have kept paco in value. The consumption has not kopt pace with tho incrcaso in the population, but tho ratio per head is still far in advance of any other country in the world. Tho Cus- toms revenue, which is generally admitted to be a test by which the power of consuming luxuries may bo tried and the condition of tho people inferred, has been maintained to the full extent of the corresponding period ending March 31st, 1867, but has not in- creased with an increasing population. In all branches tho values collected indicate no falling off in consumption. In the Cus- toms department thcroisovidence of an iii creased consumption in spirits, beer, and sugar, and of a decrcaso in that of wino Tobacco, cigars, tea, and coffee have not ex- hibited cithor increase or decrease. This, it must bo remembered, is in the face of tho present condition of the import market, with stocks so heavy in first hands as to prevent the second houses from doing moro business than simply supplying tho wants of the day from the day's transactions. We subjoin a table showing the rovonuo for years ended tho 31st of March of this and the previous year, sido by side : 5» i r> I Hoad of. . Receipts.

Tenders had been advertised for the whole or for any soparate poition of "tho works. On the 29th March, the tenders wore opened by the Commis- sioner of Land and Works, in the presence of the Governor and Executive Council. There were threo tenders for the whole \\\ oiks : one from Messrs. Eandle and Holmes, for 7,010,S24Z., payment to be made in cash ; ano fiom Mossie. John Musson and Co., for tí,826,22&7., payment to ho ruado in ensh, or in G per cent, debentures nt par ; and another from Messrs Cornish and Co., for 6,449,202z,, payment to he mado in cash, or in C per cent debentures at par. The whole of the tenders weie subsequently handed over to a com- mittee composed of the professional hoad of tho Public Works Department, the Engineer in-Chief, and tho professional head of the Survey Depaitmont, to be analysed previously to the Government being called on to decide on their reception or rejection. Mr.Gabriclli pave in a tender in conjunction with Sir S. Moiton Peto, but in consequence of infor- mality it was not received. In the local monoy market there is little call for remark. Capital is plentiful, and it believed that the power to absorb tho Government debentures for tho Ballway Loan, has been under .estimated. Largo sums ure continually offering for mortgage on good ptopoity, but in commercial circles the con- tinued check given to the credit systom is rausing some tightness. The hanks charge, for hills under 95 days' currency, 8 por cent. ; fiom 95 to 125 days', 9 per cent; over 125 days', 10 per cent. ; and on overdrawn accounts, 10 por cent. Exchange on England is, at all the banks, at,l per cent, for 00 days' sight ; for amounts under 601., at 1} per cent, premium for 30 days' sight. Froight on gold, by direct steamers or sailing vessels, 8d. per ounce, de- liverable in London ; insurance, 1J per cent.; hy the overland route, J per cent.-that is. 7d. per ounce, OB nearly as possible-in- surance, li to lj} per cent. The annual general meeting of the Cham- ber of Commerce was held in the early part of the month, ,whon the following gentlemen were elected office bearers for the current year:-r-President, Mr. H. W. Farrar; Vice Picsident, Mr, F. J. Bligh; Committee, Messrs. E. L. Montefiore, J. Heapo, R. M'Micking, A. H. Newell, D. S. Campbell, S. P. Lord, .Thomas Sumner, W. W. Tickle, Thomas Drysdale, I. G.

Tickle," acted as scrutineers. The members assembled at 2_o'clock, in tolerable numbers and tho" routing president, Mr. J. G. Fraucis, delivered his parting address, which, as it would.sa.yo the repetition of the oft-oxpiessed views of this journal on the condition of commerce, we would gladly transfer in its entirety to our columns would space pormit.

Tho improved facili- ties of communication with othor countries has undoubtedly had much to do with tho failure of a groat many vontures, by limiting tho margin of time botwoon demand and supply, and tho Incroasod ruomiB of internal trafile has dissipated the theory of " busy soasons," which did so much mlschlot In former years. Tho rulo used to bo to oxpoot an "active doinnnd" boforo and aftor winter, and our correspondents woro delayed, with hopes doferrod, do pondent on tho condition of tho roads ; but now that access to the country ¡s available at all times, country traitors, instead of laying in stocks in spoon latlvo quantities, supply tbomsolves from woek to week ; so that tho town dealers and the merchants can nvu of which bus been the oxtindtion of a class of mlddlo men, who, though thry ran up prices in timo of do niand to favor tbomsolves, and to the apparent bonollt of importera, woro no boon to the community, asthoy could noltlior hold through a gluttod market or stand a reaction in líricos ; and the merchants, therefore, too oilon (to tholr own los«), tuado good roturns to shippers, or woro thomsolvi s foreod Into Insolvency. It may appear to many an ungrateful conclusion, but undoubtedly the foaling prevailed hero in tho months of January and February that the commercial embairasamonts of America and Europe would prava of service to tho interests of the colonies, hi restraining the reckless spéculations which had for so long coti tlnuod to be mado to this markot, and a fooling akin to rogrot was folt at tho spoody rocovory from ths crisis roportcd by tho January mail, aecompaniod as it was by tho information of a rapid return to an la- crease In the oxportB to this place ; and wo aro now rcducod to tho hope that the advices from this of Novombor and January may sorvo to show how a persistence In suoh unlimited shipments may pre clpitato a return to a crisis of a loss temporary cha- racter. Though vory fow among tho mombors of this Chum bor can class tho past year as among tho most suc- cessful lu their caroor, it has not boon altogether ouo of dlscouragomont. The condition of tho colony m»y bo termed prosperous, though partios at a distança will do wrong to baso tholr calculations with regard to shipments on the moro report of tho progressiv» improvement of tho colon}', without regard to tho Bggrogato olomonts which conttltuto that prosperity. AB a rulo, thoso ongagod in commorco have bad no reason to bo satisfied with tho past yoar : In nearly ovory caao tholr fortunes havo olthor gone baokward or only romainod stationary. Tho casos of individual Buccoss havo boon vory fow, and nolthor prudonco nor foresight vero of avail against tho many difficulties which tho latter half of 1857 prcsontod. In the export trado there has been a fair amount of business for the season. Several small parcols of wool havo changed hands at former rates,-greasy, from 9d. to Is. por lb. ; greasy lamb's, from Is. to Is. 5Jd. ; scoured lamb's, 2s. ljd. The chief sorts offering havo heen fellmongers' wool. Tallow has been in steady demand for shipment. Sales of boef at S8L to 392., and of mutton at 42,1. to àSL, und of mixed, at 402. per ton, have boon effected. There has boon more inquiry for hides. The import trade is as dull as it can well ho, and tiansactions arc, in the main, un- profitable. In this matter wo can, without hésitation, support Mr. Francis's statements. Stocks are increasing, while consumption and immigration aro falling off. If cheap money in England induce increased ship- ments, tlie result is as certain as the fact that a commercial crisis has already oc cun ed from the same causo, We havo given in another column a detailed report of tho stato of the market. It will be found to contain the report of as many absolute transactions as can be well obtained. The prices aflixod to the ai tides not specially named must bo taken as mere nominal quotations.

' Tho import markot genorally has exhibited but little activity during the past month, and although largo I quantities of goods, collectively, havo boon forwarded to the Interior, tho soparato purchases havo not boon extensivo. Although 60cond houses havo boon actively engaged, importers bavo not felt tho benefit of the business dono. There have boon no speculative pur- chases wbatovor made, and this naturally causes a dullness in the import market, which Is increased by the total lgnomnco which prevails as to coming sup- plies. Holders aro fearful that the overdue advices may bring unfavorable Intelligence on this head, mid aro disposed to accopt low prices, without forcing the markets. Trade is In a healthy condition. Ino stocks on hands of second hotisos aro compara- tively BUiall ; and should tho Columbian bring adyloos of moro moderate Bupplios only bolng on tho way out, s istalnod, if not improvod, prices may fairly bo rec- koned on ; should, howovor, the reverso bo the oaso, Vorj low rates will rulo during tho winter months. Liquors.-The domand for sound alo and portor con- tinues briBk. It Is conflnod, howovor, to the moat approvod brands. The late scarcity of thoso sortB having howevor beon mot by anlvals, prlcos havo slightly declined, and not over 91.10s. can be quoted for Bass's No. 3 Bul ton, and othor brands In propor- tion. Porter!tilly maintains the lato advance, and Is In {rood inquiry, at about li. per hlid. for favorite marks. She large quantities orbeoroutof condition and unsound aro In no degree nfloctodby the Improved valuo of sound, and are quitted, whare practicable, at almost any pro- curable price. Tho market for bottled boor Is by no means active, sales aro chtofly conflnod to brands un- doubtedly gonulne. Brass's alo alono Is saleable at from 10s. to 10s. 3d., and in oqual proportions of ale and portor at from 9s. Od. to 10s., and othor of good shlppors at proportionate ratos; tho stooks on hand of inferior and unknown brands are vory heavy, and rendered moro difficult of sale by tho largo quantities of Bpurious and local bottlod, capsuled, and labelled in close Imitation of gonulno importod. Largo pro- portions of arriving parcels are bolng storer], and no speedy aincndmout In prico appoars probable. Splrns.-There Is no Improvement in this markot to report, most sorts, brandy especially, having steadily docllned In price. Tho stocks of in- ferior spirits aro exceedingly heavy, and vory difficult of sale, regardless of price. Tho best brandies only aro saleablo, and those in lots of very limited amount. Martou's cannot bo quoted abovo 18s. 3d., and othor brands in proportion. Of Otard's (which is much Improving in estimation) considerable salos ha\ e beon olFcotod by auction, at 11s. Od. to 12s. Case brandy having boon supplied loss heavily, has not suflorod equal depression, U.V.Co.'s being Btlll worth 96s. to 80s. per dozon. Of Inferior sorts the supply is \ciy heavy, and prlcos proportionately low. Bum has docllnod in value less than other (pirlta, but Is difficult of sale in any but very small lots. Qonova of best brandB movoi whiskey are nearly unsaleable, except bright colorless samples of host qualities, and those only In small lots, and at low figures. The imports of spirits have been excosslvc, as the following copy of rotura shows, viz. : 184,277 gallons brandy, 38,070 of gin. 20,412 of rum, 16,427 of whlikoy, and 12,086 of undescrlbod spirit», during tho first quartor of tho present year ; against 165,148brandy,8O,808gin, 15,760 rum, 12,427 whlskoy, and 8,214 gallons ofundoBorlbed.durlng tho correspond- ing porlod of tho provious yoar. With thosoflgurcsbofora us, a dull markot, and large oxpoctcd arrivais, Im- proved ratos cannot reasonably bo oxpectod. Wines.-The domand isllmitod to good medium and superior class ahorrlca and ports, both dOEcrlptlon« of which aro of tolerably ready Bale, at fall prices. A parcol of One Amontillado sherry was yosterday dis. SDEod of by auction at £116 por butt, in bond ; and ould Campbell's port at £90 por pipe, dnty paid, which affords a fair quotation of market values. Low, modlum, and inferior wnes are, bewevor, difficult of sale, and bring poor prlcos. lu light winos there is nothing doing, and as the season when thOBO descriptions are usually saleable has patscd, prices for somo time to como will be nominal, or nearly so. < Flour, Grain, ic-Tho flour market has boon in an unsettled condition for somowooks, and owing in some degree to the uncertainty as to tho oxtont of forolgn supplies coming forward, continues ina vory huotlva stale. Tho wlioat crop throughout thoso colonies ii Bpokon of as doflolont In yield, aB woll as inforior In quality. Tho Bupply. howevor, at the Iowost calcula- tion, will bo BUoh as to leavo but littlo room for Im- ported Btocka, As yot no important quantity ha> hoon received from South Australia, owing in some measuro to a considerable domand for whoat for thal market, coupled with a strong feeling on the part ol growers thoro to hold ou under advances, in hopei of ultimately realising higher rates In tlili or other markets, and experimental shipments1 o flour were mado to India and the Gape, whlcl resulted In serious loss, and will doter future venture to those parts. Tho Imports of Tasmanian flour hav also beon light, prices there ruling at proient so clos to the value In this markot as to offer no Inducoman to shippers. As, howovor, from both thoso markot largo supplies may now shortly bo looked for, proion rates are Bcareoly likely to be excoodod. AdoUId flour sells at from 162. 10s. for old of country milli and 102. to 172. 10s. for new town and country ; bul in tho nbsonco ot all spéculation, thero is no amour of business doing. Haxall, 37s. to 38s. per barre Wheat has also a downward tendoncy, tho state < the flour market bolng unfavorable to this artlcli and prlcos cannot bo quotod over 0s. 8d. to 69. 6i per bushel. Barley: Cape has docllned in valui owing to tho drynesi of the season preventing ii toning, aud Is dull c1 salo at 6s. toOs. 8d, Englls is in fair demand for malting, and sells at 7s. t 7s. 0d. per bushol. Oats, on rocelpt of ai VICCB by the last mail- of further shlpmom and low prlcos In the United Kngdom, di tiined In value ; low prices having, however, ii duced Improved domand, prloes havo ralllod, an m.y now bo quoted at 5s. Od. to 6s. for Scotch, and 6 too>. 3d. for Irish; colonial grown, 7s. to 7s. 3d, ni bushel. Tho Imports of the quarter havo been heav* being 251,260 bushels against 185,031 in the corra ponding period of 1857 ; and as considerable shlpmea are understood to bo on the way, but little further In provement In value can bo expected. Bran has Hw «uated much In price, heavy shipments in the a»rl (art of last month, and reduction of prices at tho mill cauaed prices to decline to Is. 8d. to Is. 9d. In- creased a"omand, conacquont in some measure on tho inijimentof horses for India, and a speculative de- mand has again raised prlcos, and sates have beau mudo at from 2s. Od. to 2a 8d. per bushel. Gram hu also improved in domand, and prices have beoomi Inga andSackahavo declined in valuo ; consldorabla fuppliea have boon received In tho nelghborlns colonies, and aalho season for the purohase of thoio ntticloa ia passing» the .demand is llghtor. 8 buihil coin-sacks cannot bo quotod abovo 16s.

Second class, of whioh the bettor portion of the Cork buttor in the markot consists, movos off heavily, at about lOd. to Hld, while tho luforlor kinds, which comprise the greator portion of the stock, is saleable only at price of grease. Tho importa of this artlclo oxhlbit a considerable reduction, tho quantity Bhowlng a do creoBO of 0081 tons on the corresponding quarter of 1857. Tish : The Imports havo beon yory heavy, 440 tons havo boon rocoivod during the prosont year, againat Î64 in tho same poriod last yoar ; sound swoot Un* ia of fair Balo, at from 4d. to 4Jd. per lb., but the season of ohlof domand has pasBcd, and with prosont stocks no improvement ÍB hkoly; woll-ourod rod herrings are still scarco, and worth 8a. Od. por two doz. tin ; salt herrings aro ibundant, and of vory trilling valuo, being In by no meana good condition. Crecerlos.-Tho largo quantltloa of low teaa, as woll aB tho damagod pareóla which havo lately boon sold by auction, havo fully supplied tho trade with low pricid «rticloB, and thOBO descriptions aro but in llttlo demand. Good teas, howovor, fully maintain thair position, and show no inclination to vary in prloo. Of good souchongs the markot is bare. First quality congous aro worth 92.10s. to 102. por chost. Good groon teas also sustain prlcos ; gunpowder, 2s. Od. to 3s. per lb, Coffoos continuo In very stoady domand, without alteration In prices ; nnd aB the season advancoa, and consumption increases, should no unexpected arrivals come to hand, thero ia llttlo probability of docline on present rates. Sugars : Tho domand for moat de- scriptions, fine grocery sorts moro especially, ia stoadtly increasing, with an accompanying upward tendonoy in prlcos; and as purchasos aro to vory limited oxtont (being mado for diroct use only), stocks aro light in second bands, and thero Is overy prospoct of prosont ratos being sustained. Cossiporos aro firmly hold at quotations of 02!. to 01!. Fine yellow Mauritius worth 42!, and fino crystals 48!. to 50!. per ton. English refined Bugara aro dull of Balo, indeed, tho flnor crystals and Cossiporos have nearly auporaedod tholr uso, and prices cannot bo quotod above 7d. to 7 jd. por lb. Bico baa boon In stoady domand, chiefly for country supplloa. Arrivals have boon moderato, 1,397 tona only having boon landed this yoar, against 8,808 during tho first throo months of 1867 ,' prices have continued steady, and havo rathor an upward Inclination: Good Patnais worth 182. and 192. por ton ; a parcel of English dreSBod Patna was yesterday placed, by auction, at 182.15a. and 212. 68. por ton. Candles havo boon un- usually dull for tho poriod ol tho year,andaaloa eon fined to small parcels fordiroctuso : holders havo, how- ever, gonorally been firm, and thus preventod decline in prlcos, which continuo noarly unchanged ; Bolmonts ruling at from lid. and 14Jd. por lb.

Con- siderable quantities of old hops, willoh aro abundant, and bring vory low prlcos, have boon taken for ship- ment to tho nolghborlug colonlos, tho Imports of tho prosont year amount to 184,114 lb. Salt : Tho domand for Liverpool coarso continuos; salos hare beon effected at 42. 10s. for tilla description, aud holdors aro to-day asking 52. Fino salt in tho moan tmio ia worth loss money, and oan bo purchased at Si. 15s. lo 42. The arrivals of tho prosont year ! mount only to 1,240 tons, and until Increased sup plica como to hand, as consumption is largo, prlcos are likely to bo sustained. Oilmen's Btoros have exhibited scarcely any varia- tion in valuo during tho past month. Salos havo con- tinued vory stoady, and for host brands of fruits, jami, mustards, and pickles thero is tolerable domand. By auction, Column's mustard, 1 lb., has brought 12a.

Prices aro, howovor, firm. Importa continuo to bo light ; and as the stock in bond Is reduced to 482,000 lb., no docline on presont ratea can be oxpectod. Timber.-Stocks of all descriptions aro large ; but Ino demand continuos vory brisk, and prlcos are un- changed, Mótala aro still largely overstocked, and, although consumption, moro particularly for the sorts suited ior building purposes, la vory brl8k, prices aro unliu 1 roved. Tho aomrasneomont of the railways in con- templation will doubtless create a largo domand, and incrcasod prlcos must onsuo, unless, indeed, tho re- quirements aro alroady contomplntcd by orders having been forwarded.

The supply of female servants has been, upon the whole, very good; but considerable difficulty has, notwithstanding, been experienced in making selections, the inquiry being almost entirely for English girls.
