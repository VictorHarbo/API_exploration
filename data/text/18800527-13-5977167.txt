INTRODUCTION. The principal event of the fortnight in the political world has been the introduc- tion of the new Reform Bill, winch was introduced into the Assembly and circu- lated on Thursday, May 20. The measure is strictly in accordance with the pro- gramme adopted by the then Opposition in the last Parliament, and which was put before the country by Mr. Service at the general election. It is proposed to reduce the franchise of the Council ; to subdivide the provinces ; to in- crease the number of members ; to provide for the dissolution of both Houses in cases of dispute, and for a joint sitting in case the dispute should continue. The franchise for the Council is the all-important matter of detail which was not disclosed until the bill was submitted. The proposition is that all owners of froohold propoity of the annual y aluo of £10 shall bo doctors and also all occupiers of houses rated at £20 per annum This yviII givo the Cairn eil a constituency of 110,000 electors as against its picseut constituency of 30,000 Tho Council, says Mi Sorvico, yviII ccaso to represent wealth, and will repre- sent pioperty m its goncral diffusion Every other elector of tho Assembly will bo an elector for tho Uppor Houso Tho provinces will bo 14 in number, rotuming 42 members, thus restoring tho Oouncü and tho Assombly to their original pi o portion of numbers, namely two to ono, fixed by the Constitution Act To avoid deadlocks, Bays Mr Sorvico, thero aro two courses, either to put the Council under the hool of authority, or to entrust it Yvith a suspensive veto, making it an Bworablo to tho country for the oxerciso of that poYver Tho country has pronounced against tho former, and the Government have taken tho latter courso Thoy pro poso that tho Council, by a two thirds voto, shall have the powor of sending down a message to the Assembly asking that in item of public policy may be removod from tho Estimates , tins item is then to go to the Counod m a separate bill, and the Council for its part ra not to reject tho Appropriation Bill, which ia to pass as a matter of courso Thus there can bo no tacking on the one hand, and no ro jection of an appropriation bill on tho other The country, Mr Sorvico points out, has rejected every pioposition of reform put befoio it tending to make the Assembly despotic and uncontrolled in finance, and tho lion gentleman behoves that it yviII rally in support of tho presont moderate but oflicient scheme Mr SorYico spoko Yvitli marked oflt,ct, and íeceiYcd liberal applause from his own party It is not usual to debate a measuio at this stage, but Mr Service was followed first by Sir John 0 Shanassy, and then by Messrs Berry, Vale, and Mirams The first gentleman cot tends that reform is unnecessary, and Mr Berry and his followers submit that the truo course is to bring the Council under the hool of authority In consequence of tho defection of the member for Belfast, the Houso is sup pOBed to bo moro equally dividod than is convenient for Ministers, who have to obtain absoluto majorities of the whole in order to pass their measure, and a great deal will depend upon thotonoof the constituencies So far as can bo gathered, tho bill has been inoBt favourably received in the country, and this is the best possible assurance that it will bo accepted by the Houso The second reading is appointed foi Tues day, Juno 1 Some sensation has been caused in the political world by the position takon by Sir John O Shanassy, who, from the Go vernment side of the Houso, has an nounced hiniBolf as an opponent of tho Ministry The complaint of tho hon gentleman is that while ho assisted to swell tho majority against the Berry GoYornment, his "claims' have been overlooked in the formation of tho Ser nee Government These claims aio that tho Education Act should bo amended in the inteiests of the Roman Catholics, and the Government ia com posed of the men who mtroducod and earned tho act, under which no stato aid is given to sectarian schools Mr Sei vico and Mi Francis, and their colleagues, decline to raise the educational issue at this juncture, and Sir John O Shanassy haB gone off at a tangent In one unf or tunato scene Sir John O Shanassy de clared that before tho elections ho had a distinct understanding with tho National Registration Association that the education question should be dealt Yvith The Ministers Yvho were present said they could not behevo such a statement, and at a spec.al meeting of the society called the next day tho idea of any such combination was disavowed TJnd"r its rules the society is stuctly for bidden to aim at moio than to keep the rolls pin o, and to maintaui tho principle of goY eminent by tit o Houses Sir John O Shanassy named tho gentleman whom ho communicated yy ith, but tho society deny that this gentleman was authorised to _o outside the iules and ho himself aflums that ho novel did so Howovei, the net result is that Sir John O Shanassy is m Opposition Tho debate on the address was biou¿ht to a conclusion on Tuesday, May l8, without an amendment being nun ed Tho Opposition did not discuss tho Go vernment programmo, but insisted that Munsters had actod inconstitutionally in not meeting tho House immediately aftei the elections, then piopei course, it was argued, bom to tal c tho opinion of tho Houso on then pe o?

sound man of buBinesa that he was best known in Victoria rather than as a politician Half a century ago considerable interest waa taken by men of means in the prospecta of Australia bb a country adapted to the pro duction of wool Several Scottish gentlemen agreed to put together a moderate amount of capital and placo it in the handB of Mr Black for Investment in the colonies in land and stock They wero the Right Hon W E Gladstone, Mr Finlay, and Mr Stewart A partnership arrangement was entered into for five years, and Mr Black, in addition to possessing hiB own share of the undertaking bad the entire responsibility of managing the joint interesta cast on bia shoulders Port Phillip pleased him best, so, in 1810, ho took up a run of 13,700 acres m whit was then known aa »he Portland Bay

This reduction of the franchise, it ia eati mated, will increaao tho number of votera from30 000 to 110 000 The Central Provmco (Melbourne and suburbs except Brighton) is to return nine members each

House ia to retiro every alternate j ear DEI) VTF OS Till MU, Mr Service moved for leave to introduce the bill on Maj 20, in a Bpcech two hours and a half long He gave a rapid sketch of tho growth of the constitution, and showed how tho Assembly had become a democratic House, while little change had taken placo in the Council '1 he franchise of the ABsem I bly had been lowered to manhood suf- frage, and tho members increased from GO to 80, hut no important alterations had been made in the Council, and tho number of membera Btill stood at 30 1 very idult male had a voto for the Lower House, but only one in seventeen bad a vote for the Council And ho argued that the I change m the circumstances of the colony demanded a corresponding chango in the constitution He recounted tho great and beneficial meaBurca which hal been passed under the constitution and said that, on tho whole, there had been no more quarrels between tho two Houses here than occurred mother countries, with tho exception of tho deplorable disputes with regard to the tariff tack, the Darling tack, and the payment of members dispute '1 he original idea of tho Ujper House waa that it Bhould represent propertj, and the beat reform waa that which would make it represent property asa whole At present tho Council represented tho wealth of tho country, but not its pro perty Thofranchiao of the Council ßbould, therefore, bo extended so as to embrace all classes of landed propertj Then he would shorten the tenure of office so as to keep tho members en larport with their constituents Lastlj, he would reduce tho size of the provinces, and would increase tho number of members to the original propor- tion of the constitution-namely, two mem- bers in the Assembly to one m tho Couucil 1 beso reforms had been accepted bo far by the Legislative Council, and there was, there fore, every reason to Buppose that they would readily become law It might bo said that the reduction of the Council franchise, so aa to prov ide that House with a constituency of 110,000 voters, would do away with all difli culties between the two Houses, but the Bcheme of finality had been adopted to put an end to notation Ho believed that the proBpect of a double dissolution would have a moderating effect upon the Legislature The Lower House would recognise the gravity of tho Bituation and would well weigh whot it put into its moasurea And the Council would hesitate before it took tho responsibility of rejecting measures bo matured aud with auch con sequences before them The doublo dis solution actually existed in the Britisb colony of the Capo of Good Hope There the Governor was empowered to ihssolve both Houses m cases of necessity And tins power was continued under the new constitution granted to the Cape of Good Hope in 1871 Having had the experience of tho aystom for 21 years, our fellow countrjmen at the Capo re enacted the provision under local self government And the double dissolution waa recommended to Victoria by Sir Michael Hicks Beach in his reply to tho embassy mission He did not behevo that tho double dissolution would bo resorted to once in a decade, but in case it took Slace, and in case tho two Houses still iffered, it was provided that the dispute should be decided by the two Houses meeting and voting together The number of the two Houses would be 128 A majority of that number would be C5 And at the time of tho Darling grant, when the Council waa prae tically a close body, six members, or one fifth of the number, took the popular view Sup posing that m the new Council onlj the samo proportion was secured, then nine members would be obtained, and only 50 membera would be required in the Assembly, and DO membera was not two thirds of the Lower House A two thirds voto of tho Lower Houae, after a dissolution, would alwajs carry anj measure And ¡n many other countries a two thirds majority was often required Ab regarded the provisions for preventing deadlocks, he stated that the Government desired to follow the lines of the British Constitution, and while providing that tho Council should not reject the Appropriation Bill, also proposed that nothing in the nature of a tack would be allowed Ihero was to be no tacking on the ono part and no rejection on the other There were two definite and dis tinct modes of ceasing deadlocks Ho referred to many instances in which tho House of Lords had sent messages about particular items to tho House of Commoua, and the Houae of Commons had put each item into a separate bill Such items aa the Majnooth grant, as tho grants to Sir Rowland Hill and to Queen s College, were all put m separate bills A communication from the Lords was alwajs acted upon The question waa how in like manner to enabio the Council to declare ita desire that it Bhould have an opportunity of considering any item of policy in a separata bill And appljiug tho rnblish precedents tho hill provided that the annual Appropriation Bill should not contain anj thing not cont lined in the estimates, and also that the Council by a two thirds vote Bhould have the power of requesting tho Assembly to remove items of policj from the estimates, that request to bo complied with There was nothing in tbe interests of this country that demanded that one branch of the Legislature should have tho unchecked control of monej tauen from tho people s pockets On the contrarj everything demanded that a check should bo imposed, at all events until tho will of tho people wua ascertained (Cheers) The fact that this bill provided a suspensory veto for a timo would not prevent the Assembly from putting anj thin., in an appropriation bill or from im posing whatever taxation they pleased But what burt could result to tho country from a provision that whilst tho representatives had the power of imposing taxation, in caso a corrupt House Bhould happen to exist there might be a suspensory check to bo ap plied for a time in order that the people out Bide might saj wh it thej wanted ' 1 bis povv er was not likelj to be abused by a reformed Council 1 von as it was the Council waa growing more liberal, and, under the now franchise, its hberiliBm would probably not differ from the Asscmblj, and it would not act without duo cause This was the fourth scheme before tho Houce Did anj ono want a fifth' And where yv is the fifth to come from' The countr} had declared agaiust an Assembly absolute m finance , it bad deel ired nf,amst the scheme of tho late Government it demanded a check , and he knew of no better means of providing the check which the countr} demanded th in that contained in tho Government bill And tho bill coul 1 be procured m peace If the House consented to it, it could become law by Christmas Sir John O Shanassy followed Mr Service but Ins remarks were directed rather againHt MmiBters than aguinat their scheme no opposed the bill aa unnecessirj, maintaining that what waa wanted was moderation ami forbearance on the part of each House-desi derata which could not be obtained by meana of any legislative enactment The present Government did not represent the uart) which put it into office, and had failed to effect an understanding with the Council, which he believed would reject its mea eurea After a few words from Mr Francis, m reply to the personal portion of Sir John O bbannBBj a remar! p, Mr Berrj, the leader of the Opposition said that tho proposed bill was a triumph of tho view s of Mr Murray Smith, Mr feerviee Mr Kerferd, and Mr Gillies, who bad been strong opponents of the Liberal party during the time Mr Higmbotbam was in Parha ment For the first time an attempt waa being made to Bottle the question of reform on the baaia which the Legislative Council had alwajs laid down, and the fact was con coaled from public view by simultaneous pro posais to liberaliBO that body Tho liberal lsmg of the Council might have the effect of preventing some of the difficulties expon enced in the past, but it would create otliors of a moro startling nature It would bo better to do nothing than to accept tho Government proposals What did tho lato Government propose' They brought for ward a bill to make the constitution of this country work like the one of England The liberal party hero were just trjing to do here what tho same party Lad dono successfully in England when they fought against their sovereigns Thoy were hero fighting for the same thing na their fore fathers-to mako the representativo Chamber as supreme in matters of finance aa were tho CommonB of England The debate closed with Bhort speeches from Mr Vale and Mr Mirams against tho Go- vernment scheme Tho bill was then brought in and road a first time, the second reading being fixed for Juno 1 THE CHINESE

On tho 17th inst the Pretmor was asked by Mr Billson, in the Legislative Aasembly, if it was tho intention of tho Government to take any immedi ito steps to stop the linuu gration of Chinese Mr Service, inrepljing Bald there wero not two opinionB aa to the undesirubility of a large influx of Chinese, but it had to bo borne in mind that questions of this sort bad tobo dealt with not only from a colonial but also from an internation vi point of view 'lho question could not be aettled by any sudden outburst of indignation or by a mere dash of the pen In the mean time, however, he had given instructions for obtaining particulars as to tho preciso Ilux and influx of Chinese during the last few jeare, as to tho numbera actually in tho colony, na to their distribution in tho various centres of population and as to tho various occupations in which they are en gaged, for the information of the Government and of the public generally On receipt of that information the Government w onlvl bo prepared to consider what courso should bo adopted During tho fortnight the political agitators have been keeping tue question of Chinese labour simmering but nothing baa boon produced to contradict the fact that instead of being on the increase tho ChmcBO aro decreasing m number in tins colony, or to jUBtify the attempt which is being made to malte the question a political weapon Mr \X M K Vale, ML A, tho arch agitator whostirredthiBChineaoquestionup by endeav ounng to restrict tho tendering foi the 3 xlubition chairs to Victorian manufacturers, exclusivo of the Chinese cabinetmakers, has been taken to task for his inconsistency in importing his own furnituro from England Ho tried in the first place to explain the fact away bj stating that the furnituro he brought with lum from London waa all secondhand, mid that it only amounted in value to £50 The Custom house bill of entry, however, was looked up and waa found to repre sent about ¿200 worth of articles Mr Vale then called a meeting of hiB constituents at 1 lt/roy on the 17th inst to mako further explanations Tho defence he now offered waa that he brought not £50 worth of furniture into tho colonj, as he Boid at tho Town hall, nor £200 worth, aa he declared m Ina hill of entry , but £100 worth The distinction Mr Vale draws does not exist in reality He puts woodenwaro m the £50 liBt, and iron and glass ware m the other, or non competitivo list, and iron and glaBB ware are made in the colony, under heavj protective duties, the payment of winch Mr Vale contrived to evade And this ia tho real point In 1 ebruary last, Mr Vale was eloquent at 1 ítproy in defence of tho duty on secondhand furniture He had noticed that I he Times had written on tho subject in London, and he delicately intimated that 'Ihe 'Innes was making itself ridiculous at home in consequence of garbled nifor mation supplied Irom the colony. The duty of the immigrant according to Mr Vale, was to buj bia furnituro in Vic tona-or how were colonial industries to prosper' And if tho new arrival pro ferred to bring his household goods with him, he ou(,bt to poj according And the idea of a colonist brillant, foreign gooda back with lum was stigmatised aa tlio i rime that capa the edifice According to Mr Vale there should be no English goods in a protectionist colonj on which duty has not been paid, and we are still confronted bj tho fact that there are such goods here and, alas ! that tho pro pnetor is Mr Vale Of the £200, according to Mr Vale, £90 must be credited to effecta which he took to Lngland and brought back again, but the balance of £101 remains.

GOLD AND THE GOLD TIELDS. Gold mining has progressed during the past fortnight in a satisfactory manner on moat of the gold fields of tho colony. In the Ballarat district, several large claims which have hitherto been only m the prospecting stage, have either entered the list of dividend paying mines or have met with such encouraging prospects that dividends may confidently bo expected from them before long. At Sandhurst, tho tone of tho sharo market lias been bo good aB to indicate that the diatnct is on the eve of groat prospentj m mining affaira The im- proved tone is duo to the fine prospecta exhi- bited m Bomo of the minea and the good jields m otherB For several j cara past tho general share market baa not been m Buch an excited state, the transactions in scrip having been exteuBivc, varied, and very satisfactory Muli few exceptions the advances m value wero well maintained, and tho stocks on the three main hues of roof were in hvelj re quest, whether the mines to which thoj referred were prospective or productive 'Hie mineral statistics of Victoria for the year 1879 havo just been issued from the Government Mining department, and the following information is extracted from them - lho estimates of gold exported, received at the Mint, raised in tho colony, or purchased in tho years 1871 to 1870 wero respectively in ounces as follows - Exported, according to CuBtoms returns, 901,154, 709,934, COO 354, 508,093, 340,25'), 211,197, received at the Mint, 251,817,385,852, 427,878, 290,919, 122,009, 493,002, raised, ac cording to estimates made bj mining regis trarB, 1,097,014, 1,008,118, 903,700, 809,053, 758,040, 758,947 , purchaaed, according to re turns made by managers of banks and others, 110r)115, 1,077,270, 919,1GS, 790,147, 772,302, 730 253 For the first time during the last 11 years the estimated jicld of gold from alluvial mines showB an increase on that of the pro ceding year, duo principally to a hotter water supply for sluicing operations and to tho opening up of deep mining ground near Beaufort, but owing to the exhauation of the ounferouB drifts in tho older workings of the gold fields, it is hardly to bo expected that jieldB from this class of mining will show any lasting improvement The numbera of miners emplojod in each of tho years 1871 to 1879 inclusivo wore us follow -45,141, 11,717, 41,010, 38,005, 30,030, and 37,553.
