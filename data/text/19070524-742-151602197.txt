ARGENTINE IMMIGRATION . A recent Buenos Ayres despatch to the London 'Tunes' &ays; : 'Immigra- tion into Argentine during 1906 total led nearly 260,000, the highest figures yet reached in the history of the coun try, the year which runs this figure closest being 1889, with 218,744, and this was due to the existence then of subsidised lines granting free passages. According to estimates of the .National Immigration office, 1907 should surpass last year, as i t is calculated that over 100,000 immigrants are due to arrive up to March 31. The year 1906 was an exceptional one for. the enormous amount of business transacted in real estate, which amounted monthly to tens of millions of dollars, and during the past couple of years land rose in value all over the republic an average of 3-5 per cent. The limit, hosverer, appears to have been practically reach ed, as for some time back there has been noticeable a certain falling off in the volume of sales, and prices arÂ® more or less at a standstill.' [ That brilliant young Australian pianist Mr Percy Grainger has opened his musical season this year remarkably well. On March 6 he appeared at the London Philharmonic Concert, and his playing met with universal apprecia tion, the papers commending its virility, its insight, and its charm. Already he has played at an Oxford recital, and at the Queen's Hall, while a Danish tour and a concert with the Albert Hall orchestra are in store for him .
