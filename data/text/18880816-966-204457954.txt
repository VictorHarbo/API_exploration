The wonderful and realiEtic delineation of the sad effects of drink so ably portrayed by Mr. CHARLES WARNER in his impersonation of the character of COUPEAU once more causes us to think of the sad effects of drink and all its concomitants. It is a rarity very seldom met with in the higher walks of life, although drinking to excess is indulged in by all classes of sodety, but with vastly different resnlts, according to the pecuniary position of the parties so offending, which we will endeavour to classify thus : —Firstly, our aristocracy purchases only thoroughly prime and matured wines, with a freedom from fusil oil—a speciality for specialities; secondly, the choicest of the choice is for those with means to enable them to consume the very primest of all comestibles, thus saving them from the unfortunate position of poor Coupeau. It is for that poor indi* vitiual and thousands of others who have racked their constitutions and are seeking an early grave that we come forward as the true benetactors of those who have not tbe means to purchase costly wines and beeis. You need not fear tbe Satanic influence when you court the drowsy god of Morpheus—no bad dreams, no snakes to chase, nothing to bide from, no bewilderment or bewilder, ing influences, but the veTy elysium as felt by Aladdin when be discovered his lamp, by all who purchase WABE'S FAMOUS LAGER BEER and CRYSTAL ALE, sold at ail respectable Hotels at 6d per bottle, the acme of purity.
