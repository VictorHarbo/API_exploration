A'BECKETT, J.I'., Returning Officer for Southern Province. Itilghlon, May 5, 1863 To the ELECTORS of the SOUTH PROVINCE. Gentlemen, Having announced my intention of becoming a candidate for tire vacancy in the representation of your province caused by-law resignation of the Hon. J. B. Bennett, I have the honour to submit the following an my opinions on- the subjects which at the present time, most prominent!) occupy public attention. I am in favour of the sale of Crown lands by auction, behaving, importance-, as that system may be, it is desirable to curious abuse than any other which can be devised, whilst it ensures to the State something like a fair value for the property limited. A', however, there can be no doubt that it is most desirable for the permanent interests of the colony that agricultural settlement should be encouraged, I would support any amendment of the Land Act which, will effectually preventing the s orifice of the public estate, by fraudulent combinations, va lil afford those who give protor guarantees of the sincerity of their internal len of bec. ming actual cultivators of the soil an opportunity of duty g soaalthout compound with the more wealthy classes. I look upon immigration as absolutely essential to our welfare, and to a wide- spread publication of our many advantages as the readiest means of encourag- ing 3. The proposed alteration in the Electoral Law will, I think, be of advantage I am in favour of a reduction being made in the tenure of office of the members of the Upper House. Till District Councils Bill will be a valuable enact- ment, as tending to decentralization and to the encou raueinoiitof au lntoro.tlu]o"l self- government. It is to be regretted that the Real Property Act has not been effective in attaining the design of l-sfiaoiors. I hope sion to see It so amended as to make it a work- able and useful measure. To the attainment of this object I will render zealous assistance. The Education Act should, I consider, be worked in the spirit in which it was framed, without regard to Ecoiarfoii or class jealousy and any defects which are obstacles to its proper bed-linen allow should at once be amended. In meeting to become one of your representatives I must assure you that my only object is to 'o of the benefit of that experience to the conduct of public affairs which a residence of 22 years in the colony has afforded me. I shall be prepared generally to give my independent support to all measures, from whatever quarter they may emanate, calculated to promote our prosrJe . city. I look upon class-leiilslation as most destructive of the general good and I regard those who, in order to gain popular favour, attempt to set one class of against another, as amongst the worst enemies to the progress of our adopted country. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, J. P. 11KAK. Lectures and Sermons.

After the meeting the THE uniting loans may be advantageously soon.
