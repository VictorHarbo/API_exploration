Koan have terminated their farewell engagement at the Princess's, not to re-appear in London till they ; havo returned from tho Australian colonies. In tho i short time of their sojourn among us, how much has ; been done ! ' Hamlet,' ' Othello,' ' Tho Mcr- ; chant of Venice,' which are three of the principal plays bequeathed to us by Shakspeare ; the portion of ' Henry tho Eighth ' in which tho genius of our great tragedian is most prominently shown ; ' Louis ? XI,' naturalised upon our stage by Mr Iiean's excel lent acting : and Coleman's pleasant comedy of ' Tho J ealous Wife, ' ' represented with such exuberant h umor that it is almost impossible to identify poor .2/r Oakley ; and his tyrannical spouse with tho Danish princo and his conscience-stricken mother. These pieces, wo say, represent no small amount of mental or physical labor to bo performed within eleven days. Every one of tho principal characters severally put forward on the list belongs to the highest depart ment of art. Mr and Mrs Koan have left us amid acclamations and hearty wishes of success in a new and untried region, fairly earned by many years' toil endured in the best of causes, the maintenance of tho national drama ; and their admirable por formanco during tho last engagement at the Princess's, newly impressing so many vivid images on our minds, renders jus more painfully aware of the magnitudo of our loss.
