P. Gillam, Fyan's Street, Marnock Vale, Geelong, Vic. "For a number of years I suffered very much from my kidneys and liver. The first symptoms were excruciating pain in the back and under the shoulder blades, heaviness in the stomach, irregularity of the bowels, and oftentimes great distress after eating. My urine was of an un- natural colour, and at times avoided with great pain. I tried many medicines with very little benefit. Then Warner's Safe Cure was brought under my notice. I commenced to take it, and felt decidedly better. I continued to take it, getting better each day, and the Improvement continued until I was once more in good health." From Mrs. Esther Louisa Connelly, 71 Foucart Street, Rozelle, Sydney, N.S.W. "For ten years I suffered from kidney trouble, and the pain was so bad that I had to stop work until It went. My appetite left me and I lost my sleep, keeping awake hours through the pain. I have been a resident of Rozelle for 21 years, and am well known. All my neighbours can tell you how I used to Buller. One day I saw one of your pamphlets and decided, to try Warner's Safe Cure. After taking about six bottleful I got completely well. My appetite returned, and I was able to get refresh- ing sleep which I had not had for years. I am now like another woman, with none of the distressing pains or symptoms left. I cannot recommend Warner's Safe Cure too highly." Warner's Safe Cure is sold by them hts and storekeepers everywhere, both ; in the original (5/-) bottles and in the cheaper (2/6) non-alcoholic (Concentrated) form. Government Advertisements.
