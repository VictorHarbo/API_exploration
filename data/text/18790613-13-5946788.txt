But the condition of the latter is so necessitous at the com- mencement of a winter which pro- mises to be a very trying one, as to appeal irresistibly to the compassionate syimoathies of all who are above tuo reach of want. Mr. TURNBULL tells US that " there is great and increasing " poverty and distress, an unusual [»« " city of work for women as well aa " men, and very numerous applications " for aid., which it is scarcely possible « to refuse at this inclement penoa "of the year." lu the po«ec suburbs of this city the provaihng dearth of employment, which has been aggravated, if not occasioned, by our political troubles, and by tho feeling of distrust and insecurity which they havo engendcied, is telling most disastrously upon tho ?»miÜKhopkeepeis, and upon all, m fict, who benefit by tho expenditure of the wage earning classes And the area of destitution is gfftjitiíííly widening, m pioportion is the prolongation of oui social discord, finan cial discredit, and industrial stagnation, mvolv es a still gre itoi number of per sons m its calamitous consequences At tins very time, too, as our corre spondent remarks, when additional funds are íequired by the committee of the Melbourne Ladies' Benevolent So cietj to defiay tho cost of the blankets and 11 liinel which it is found necessaiy to distnbuto amoila t the pom, "sub " scnptions avc moic difhcult to obtain "than heietofore, md in in my case-.

When he spoke of " bridging tho ocean," ho did not refer at least so ho tells UB-" to tho stupid 11 " and wicked system of assisted imniigra " tion, vvliich took tho monoy of tho " labourer to spend in bringing out "another labourer to compete with " liirn," but to some fancy plan of taxing tho farmers and freo selectors in order to provide cheap passages for men well able to pay full rates, who would tako to agricultural pursuits in op- position to their benefactors. Mr. WOODS did not put tho matter epiite in this way, but that is what his words amount to. Now, WO venture to think that a moro impudent demand was never mado by a sober man on tho credulity of his hearers. 'The audacity of the attompt to oxplain away an inconvenient utterance is evident at a glance, if wo refer to the actual ex- pressions used. Towards tho end of his speech on tho occasion in question, Mr. ' WOODS said "He (Mr. Woods) thought they could scarcely regard even the remains of the sumptuous repast which they had been en- joying without thinking with a tinge of sad- ness upon the want whioh existed at the pre- sent time amongst tens and hundreds of thousands of their brothers and Bisters in England.

A set of rules for the governance of the associa- tion was submitted to the meeting, and after some conversational discussion, they were adopted without alteration. In these rules the objects of the association were set forth as follow: -"1. To obtain an alteration in the laws relating to the administration of the affairs of medical charities. 2. To estab- lish provident dispensaries in large centres of population. 3. To suppress illegal practice. 4\. To obtain adequate remuneration for medical services from Government, muni- cipal and sanitary authorities and from benefit societies. 5. To effect a satisfactory mode of election of medical officers to charitable institutions. 6. To create a better understanding between members of the medical profession in their various relations with each other. 7. To establish an equi- table scale of fees as a guide in private prac- tice. 8. And for other purposes having refer- ence to the interests of the medical profession."
