More Ships Seized TOTAL NOW 70 Washington, March 31.â€” Four Danish ships in Philippine waters ; were taken into protective custody; by the United States navy to-day. These four brought to 70 the total of Axis-controlled ships seized by* the United States. An omciai statement shows that GQ, not 65 as at first stated, were taken yesterday on the Atlantic and . Pacific coasts and in the Panama Canal zone. The dramatic descent iby the coast guard, which acted on Treasury in structions, because of the evidence of sabotage by Italian crews, has come to the Americans as one of the biggest sensations of the war, even tending to rival the thrill caused by the British naval triumph in the Mediterranean. ?Germany and Italy lodged formal protests to Washington to-day. ? There are indications from Presi dent Roosevelt and the Secretary; of State, Mr. Cordell Hull, that thd . protests will be firmly rejected. There were sequels in neighbour ing territories to-day. The Cuban Government seized an Italian freighter at Havana and a German freighter and an Italian freighter anchored at iPunta Areas. Costa Rica, adjoining the Panama to the north, were set on fire, by their crews. The Department of Justice began deportation proceedings to-day against 875 officers and men re moved from the Axis vessels. Simul taneously the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investiga tion into the sabotage on the Italian craft with a view to prosecutions. It is believed that as a result of deportation proceedings the crews will be interned for the duration of the war. At Boston, 43 German and Italian mariners began a non-sleep and hunger strike last night while they awaited action by the immigration service on their status as a result of the seizure of their ships. The ' district director of immigration, Mr. John Mulcahey, said that the men, of whom 16 were 'Germans and 27 Italians, refused to go to bed last night and would not eat breakfast to-day. ^
