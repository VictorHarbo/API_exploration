MURRAY, 1 Retufning-Officer, . ,' Darling Downs. Warwick, loth November, 1881. to the electors of the darling 1 ; downs. .. f*i ENTLEMEN,— Although in the opinion V3T of some of your number I acted im prudently in resigning my seat; in' the Assembly as one of your representatives, yet I beg to asauro you, one and all, that I was actuated by the highest motives of public policy. I value, as I think every member ought to value, the good opinion of my con stituents, and when a number of my consti tuents banded thomselvos together as a representative deputation, and waited on Ministers and stated that I did not represent the feelings of my constituents on a question which had already received the sanction of the representative branch of the Legislature, I felt that an indignity had been cast upon me, and an attempt made to discredit my Parliamentary. utterances as your representa tive. Moreover, I found that, natsatisfied with the deputationising business, the same parties were using the Press and other avenues of publicity' to degrade me in the eyes of the. electors. Conscious that what I had advocated in the Assembly in the pur chase of the Canning Downs estate was the outcome of conscientious conviction, and an honest desire to serve my adopted country, I felt that it would be better for me to resign my seat than be made tho victim of studied and continuous miRrepresentation, instigated by certain membors of the Government. Having waited some days for a candidate to offer himself to you who would possess your undivided confidence, and finding that no such candidate was forthcoming, and having received urgent requests and splicita ' tions from all parts of the electorate to offer myself again to the constituency, I have con sented to do bo, and now appeal to you for re-election, and ask you to let me know through the ballot box, whether I still enjoy the confidence you have twice during the past three years generously reposed in me. 1 need hardly tell you that 1 am a decided supporter ot the Hon. S. W. Griffith, tho Leader of the Opposition, and am still pre pared to assist him in his gallant struggle against tyranny and corruption. No Queenslander with any patriotic feeling cau have the slightest faith in a Government kept in power by 'a solid phalanx'. of ser vile followers, many of whom cling to the Ministry from puroly selfish motives, and aro supporting the Government because the Go vernment support then}. The payment of £550 to Mr F. A. Cooper, in direct violation of a resolution of tho Assembly, for, revising statutes which are now found to be all but valueless, and have to be recalled for amend ment, illustrates the corrupting influences at work to obtain support. The financial polioy of tho present Gpvern mont must, before long, land Queensland into a boghole or quagmire, from which it will be difficult to extricate it. During the last three years they have increased tbe public debt from ten millions to fourteen millions, chiefly expended upon nonrepro ductive works; while, during the same period, British and German immigration was stopped, and tho burden of interest of this largo debt, consequently falls upon a sparse population. They are now ajionating tho best portions of the public estate on Penk Downs and elsewhere to their friends and supporters at from 10s to 15s the acre, in very largo blocks ; while, at the same'tinfc, they are charging men of small moiinsj and cultivators of the soil, £4 and £5 the aorefor eighty-acre blooks. The interest- on onr public -debt is now nearly £700,000'' a year, or more than one third of our annual revenue, and the colony is drained of this enormous sum annually to bo sent to'Loiidoh to pay the interest on our debentures. In the fnce' of these faots the public money is frequently frittered away. For instance £20.0,0.. was voted to Mr Landsboronghfor hisexploration of tho WeBtern country, while tha claim mado by Mr P. O'Sullivan for tho, grant of £500 to the widow and orphan of a public officer, who was murdered in, the performance of his duty, was scornfully rejeotod. To prevent a serious crisis, they .will have to go on, year after year, borrowing not only tomeot tho payments of the intorost, but, to carry on useless works beyond tho re quirements of our small, and, I am sorry to say, decreasing European population. Gentlemen, do not bo led away by ths Premier's boasted prosperity of tho colony. 'The lavish expenditure 6f the borrowed mil lioua among- our small population musb of necessity oronto a kind of fictitious pros perity ; but the re-action which is inevitable will fall most heavily upon, the taxpayers in tho settled distriota, and particularly upon those who have made Queensland their per manont home. My political opinions on all tho great ques tions of the day. are pretty well known to you, and I shall not trouble you with a recapitulation of thorn here. - I leave myself confidently in your hands, feoling assured from your past treatment of mu, I qhoU receive justioe.
