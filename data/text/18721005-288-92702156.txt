A s^ublic meeting- was held xn ; Mr. ?Lawtoa's; schoolroom,- Bowden, on Tuesday^ .evening^ to establish1^ new Land and Building0 ?Society, j Me. E.

He was in favor of Terminating Building Societies, as the working of them ^as not so complicated as Permaneat. Societies, ; and was therefore better un derstood : by the majority of those per sons: for \ whose benefit they were first ?established. L He hoped the Society about to be formed would be as beneficial to its members as -the old one had been, whose termi nation would be exactly six years and a half from commencement. Resolutions were carried that a new Society be formed, and a Committee appointed; to name the Society and revise the laws, and their report to be laid before the shareholders -in a fortnight for confirmation. TVJe'are informed that one of the Banks has reduced the selling rate ot exchange on London to h percent, premium, but we learn t.iat this 'is not a general arrangement among .the banking institutions. : : According to the Pleasant Creek Chronicle, there is at the present -ime 'a shepherd on the Richardson who is the next heir to one of the -most ancient' English baronetcies. He was the youngest of five, and ?when he left the old country, many years ogo, did not seem to have the most remote chance of ever occupying the ancestri! hall as master ; bat death ha*' been busy in the family, and the present bearer of the title is old and childless. The heir is unmarried, quiet and retiring, and does not seem anxious to quit his humble occu pation.' The cause of temperance is progressing in the locality of the Prince Alfred Mine, several 'meetings having been held lately, and the cause advocated by the Rev. H. Pope, Capt. Besancb, Mr. W. Miller, Mr. H. Bower, and r.i ? others. A Juvenile Branch of the Rechabite Tent was opened . on Monday, September 23, by . Mr. VT. Miller, P.C-B., ana the ofEcers of ihe Adult Tent. The officers elected to the Juvenile Branch, which is No. 17 of the Albert District^ are as follow:— Brothers Alfred Cottrell, O.K.; Bennett Treloar, D.K. ; and Charles Dreyer, Secretary; Messrs. W. Miller, P.O. R., and J. Tippett being appointed Superintendents. ' ^ The Hon. J. Cumming (remarks the Geelong Advertiser) is pureuine & plan on his station, Terrinallum, which is 'worthy of imita tion by all owning treeless plains. Every seaso he haa 200. or 300 acres of land, plbughred, 5 . inches deep, in various parts of the run, and sown broadcast for trees. His feas'on 'f or having seeds sown instead of trees planted, is because ~-# it is his intentioato preserve imported game, ' ^ and trees growing from seed sown in such a manner afford the. best shelter. He has now about 600 acres sown, Some of the trees being already 'some 10 or 12 feet high, and he does not purpose discontinuing the work until he has 2;000-acres of .preserves. - . . There are flying rumors aboutrespecting a discovery made of copper ore, likely to prove of considerable value, on' the Parara Sun of Messrs. Bowman & Co., down the Peninsula. A, number of sections were secured by tele graph, a Bank telegram acknowledging the receipt . of the money being also forwarded — much to theanhoy ance of some speculators, who telegraphed to their friends in Adelaide to do .the- business for them. We have authority. ' that certainly seems to be of the very best de- ' scriptibn,: for saying thab the discovery is a; genuine one, and will, almost certainly, be of : importance. In the first instance it was made by a shepherd. — Wallaroo Times* . A correspondent /sends -us. the follow ing :— ^The ordinary half -yearly meeting .of the Benevolent Dramatic Society was* held in. the Society ?s Rooms^ King Wilfiam -street, on. the 2ud of October. There was. a numerous atten dance of ' members,' and Mr. Newitt occupied ' . . the chair. The hon; Secretary reported, the progress made by the Society during the past half- year, which was considered highly satisfac tory. A lengthy discussion, relative to the future management of the Society, was followed by various alterations in the code of ruloe. ^T Officers,' were appointed for the . ensuing six months; and the usual votes of thanks to the ' retiring officers and Chairman brought; the 4^ meeting to a close. ; ? : A . correspondent informs us that the selectors on thie Brought on Area are busy plough ing, in readiness for next liarvest ; also, preparing dams and sinking wells to hold water. He reports the grass to be very strong and healthy, although some 20,000 sheep were recently driven over it, until the selector? ordered them off. The crops on the Broughton Area 'are looking very luxuriant, and unless unforeseen disas ters arise, the farmers will have; a splendid harvest. A gentleman from Wallaroo -who baa- ' recently been to Port Pirie and through the areas r tells us that he was astonished at the fertility of the country he passed over, the immense area under crop, the luxuriance and abundance .of the feed, and the splendid and promising appearance. of the crops. Our corres pondent alludes to the report that a proportion of the areas has been dummied. — Wallaroo Times.

' \- The Age Bays :— Those persons in Mel- ., ?bourae' who are 'acquainted with Mr. Fraser, the managing. Director of . the Netherlands Steam Naviga-tion Company at Batavii, ate in ' daily expectation of hearing that a steamer, «eut by him,; has reached Port Darwin, from Batavia. \ By this time Mr. Fraser is probably in /possession ' of thb news that nothing was done, ^ ; to ;1lhe time -of the1 marl leaving on the ltth of September,, in the way of providing a steamer to run between B&ngoewangi; and Port (Darwin. ! 'It is thought that Mr.J Frasfer, on SSarjiilsag ithat noihiBghad been done, would very likely start a vessel at once to bring on European and Indian news.' Should this surmise . net-prove correct, the Lizzie, now at Port Darwin, and- -sooar-to leave for Bafavia, will eonvsy to Mr. Fraser- fhe news that Victoria, South- Australia, New South Wales, and Tas mania have agreed to join in bearing the ex oenee of a steam express from ^sia to Aus t alia^ If -the news by thisibute^ that which .

Hill's entertainment at White's Rooms on Thursday evening was well attended, for although the back seats weje but sparsely occupied, there was a large attendance in the front, including His Excellency the Governor and suite, in addition to several mem bers of the Legislature, a number of the clergy of Adelaide, and others. The Rev. J. Davidson presided, and, in introducing Mts. Hill, spoke of the excellence of such entertainments as that lady was about to afford them, as they tended- to encourage and foster the higher and. more intellectual tastes of the people. The programme was then proceeded with, the chief share in it being of course taken- by Mrs. Hill, who has a great .capability for expressing a variety of emotions. Her rendering of ' The V Confederate Flag,' ?' Maud Mueller,' 'The African Chief,' and ' Q leen Mab' evoked much applause, and. indeed, all her recitals were well received.. The comical sketches, most of which k were of her own CDmposition, were very humorous, and very effectively influenced the ' risible faculties of the audience. Her 'rendering of some of the mar tial pieces was excellent, ard the mournful and tender pathos thrown into the extract from Dickens's 'Tale of Two Cities' was admirable. Mrs. Hill was assisted by Mr. J. W. Daniel, Miss Daniel, and Mr. W. R. Pybus, who con tributed the musical portion --f the eniertaio ment. Mr. Daniel and his daughter have already been referred to in these columns, ami it is needless to say that on Thursday night they fully sustained the excellent reputation which they have gained for musical talent.

' Fasco'e^ Drs. tjTyld^Snd' Pascoe, and Mr. W. Haekett (Hon. Sed).' Mr. . Pascoe moved that By-law 15be -.considered, with a view to allowing exhibitors to stage more than one exhibit in class new- or rare, or in classes where only one exhibit was called for. He remarked that when the original motion was brought forward he supported it as a matter of expediency, because he thought they might very well curtail the number of exhibits. He, ho w- ewr,saw the necessity for recensidering the niat ter, btciuseof the difficulty in meeting the taste of the judges, for, although an exhibitor migat have two exhibits of equal merit, yet, in conse quence of not knowing the taste of the judges, he might «end in the wrong «zhibit. Mr. Ingleby seconded the motion, observing that the CpmmietejB on the former eccasion were in fluenced by a desire ioJiinit the number of ex hibits in one class, iu order -to -prevent persons staging a large number of inferior exhibits, and .also because the judges might have a less amount of trouble before them., .The by-law, bad worked admirably,' he thought, for he never remem bered seeing so large a, number of. exhibits of such even merit and.* excellent quality. --. He| however, thought the balance 'of testimony was in favor of altering the by-law to the extent jprpppsed by.

I desire to point out that the ' mixed -emigration of Norwegians and Danes is a mistake, in consequencB :of the.'existeiica:,of-a very bitter national feeling of animosity between them, which prevents^their co-operating in any thing, however much it might be to their mutual advantage to work together.' The services attendant upon the open ing of the new hall connected with Stow Church, ' Flinders-street, were commenced on Moiiday evening by a meeting of a devotional character. The pastor of Stow Church (the Rev. C. B. Symes, B. A.) presided. Portions of Scrip, ture were read^and prayer offered by members of the Church. The services were continued i oh Tuesday evening, when tea and public meet ings were held, and on both occasions the large, hall was crowded.- ' Mr. A. Hay, J.P., who pre- : eided at the public meeting, traced the pro gresMye steps which that t3hurch had ta!ken since its first establishment in the colony to the present time. He commented upon the great use'of Sabbath schools, and expressed pleasure in the fact that these schools were increasing on the Continent of E -rope. It was not for him to advise the teachers cf their? schpbl^buli he must say that they should not endeavor to instil into the minds of the children entrusted to their nare any pesuliar ideas that they might hold on debateable religious7 sub j ects. They' shbuld'-take th»i ' Bible 4 a their guide; and be most careful not to introduce, any Sling foreign to the WJord of God. '? If a 'motto were required, lie could sug gest no better ones than these — ' God so loved the wo ld;that He gave his 6nly-:begotten Son that whosoever be]ieved on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life,' or 'God sent not His Son' into the World to condemn the wbrld, hn.1: that the World through Him might be saved.' ,H»: bad hbpedithat he could have tblflthem the baildinglha4 beeii- paid* for 5' but he was sorry, to-aay that fhere ie'naa&ed; £671 still to be paid. ' The amount subscribed to ^j-dsthe^uildinig had been £718 17s. 2i. The 'old building had been sold for £1,050 ; but, as there was a mortgage debt on the Church of atfouVSi.SfW.Sitfwais 'deemed advisable 'fo pay off a, portion of , that amount, and accordingly £500 had; been ?appropriated 'for that purpose. He hoped JJiat during ihe.comiag.year an effort would be 'made to wipe off the balance. Tke Key.Fi Wi -Gex congratulated the Stow Church on ''the ^ completion of the schoolroom, and ex pressed a hope that much good would be done in it. He reierred to tbe Cathedral at Milan, where Sunday-schools . feael originated, and, to give an idea of- its dimensions, stated that the Town Hall could be conveniently put -into the corner, of the 'building wh:ch; was apportioned off for a place tb instruct the- young. He also urged that, ,ia order to ensure ? iuccess ' in Sabbath-sobool teaching, earnestness was & most essential qnaljty for a .teacher to . possess. . The fie v. Si Mead also congratulated the Ohurdron the completion. He showed how a pastor was encouraged by. obtaining. ihe sympathy of his OongtBgation', and urged the necessity 'fort co operatioa amongst: the membem of a; Char ph. Messrs; F; -31eland«nd^. Caterer ^Iso aadressed the: meetings aiad commented upon the desi rableness of. engaging the sympathies: of the children. The. Kev. O. B. Symes congratulated the .Chairman and the Deacons of the Stoir Church: ok the completion of the schoolroom. He considered that the Church would- do well to cultivate a spirit of harmony, and ioped that it would be drawn closer -together ina hond of Aalionred Christian friendship. The fiev. J. LyaU also made some congratulatory remarks, and urged that mere diligence on the part of the children in learaing lessons was not 'the point that should be aimed at, but' they should be taught to appreciate and love Jesus Christ. It was mentioned during the - evening that Mr. Ferryman, jeweller, King William- street, had generously presented the school - with a clock. A collection was made in aid of the building fund before the termination of the proceedings.
