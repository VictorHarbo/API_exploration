ALIEN IMMIGRATION. No Reason for Alarm. A "Quota" Law Impracticable. In a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Department regarding foreign immigration to Australia it is pointed out that if 20,000 British and the same number of foreign settlers arrived in Australia each year during the next decade the British population of the Commonwealth, after allowing for the normal natural increase, would represent 96 per cent, of the residents I of Australia. \ In mdel' io <<n:iiltf)iU.L lie widespread Till- | piR-i?:i inhaled, in the.

From preeeul indicatious, in view oi Hie Biueements entered into beiivften the Com mou-n-eailk a.nd certain foreign Goi^era moits to restrict the ipsup ct" passports or tie granting of \\-ieas, it is likely to be some years before the number of foreign arrivals rearh 20,009 per annum. The Italian Government have agreed to limit the granting of passports to persons who have been nominated by persons in Australia and who are in possession of £40 each. In the case of Greeks, Jugo | Slavs, and Albanians the British authori ties, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, are limiting the granting of vis?s to passports to 100 per month in each case, and visas trill not be granted to per sons unless they are individually in postes ?on of £40. Tbe Foreign Element. The census oT April, 1921. thoircd that tlu> number of persons in Australia not born here, or in the British Isles or New Zeaiand, was 139,073, or slightly over 2i per txnt. TJie number owing allegiance to foreign Governments was 48,529. or O.OS per cent. During the past lew years, and particularly since July, IS2I (Vrlien the latest immigration Eeetriction Act passed by the United States Congress came into operation), there has been a quicker move ment of peoples from Southern Europe to Australia. During the oi years ended Sep tember 30, 1921, the excess of arrivals over departures nf t'ox^eigu-boni immigrants numbered 16,148, a figure representing about 11.6 per cent, of the total foreign boi-n persons who were in Australia when the 1921 census was taken.

In the liftht of this fact the following table, which shows the excess of airivals over depar tures of |iersons of various Kuropean nationalities from Jn]y 1, 1924, to Novem ber 30. 1924, is of interest:— <= - ?

Tlie Con gress committee in reporting on this mut ter, 2said: —"The most troublesome adniinis tiative difficulty encountered since the enactment of the 3 per e-ent. law has been the enforcement of the numerical limita tion. Tile actual, physical counting of human beings arriving: by ship and ti-ain has been a. ta_k of magnitude. Mistakes have been made. Steamships have raced to port in efforts 10 land pas sengers witliin time limit*.. Delays .ud disappointments have brought hard sliips. Distressing appeals for relief in individual cases have assailed the officers charged with enforcement of the law. Senatoi-s and Representatives have been besought to aid cither in nullifying the statute or in mitigating its force. All these troublesome obstacles are confidently expected to be eliminated ia the event oi'. tbe enactment of the new Bill. The Bill' contains provision for enforcement of the! numerical limitation, not by counting im migrants upon their arrival, but by count ing "immigation certificates" issuable at American consulates oversea-. The plan, briefly, is to issue for each nationality a number of immigration certificates io he placed in the hands of intending immi grants as they obtain American visas upon their passports. Each certificate has a validity of two months, to the time of taking ship. Therefore, the intending im migrant, having obtained his pas-sport, liis immigration certificate, and his visa, is at liberty to proceed io the United States in the full knowledge that lie will not be de barred solely by a quota limitation. Re must, however, undergo further examina tion at the port of entry, aud be able io pass under the provisions of the 1937 act. It is e_pectcd that the number of those who cannot nass will be greatly re duced by reason of the preliminary inves tigation. Tliere should be no arrival of '"excess-quota" cases, and there need be no racing 01 steamships. If this Bill reduces to the minimum the number of arriving aliens that must be turned back, it will have accomplished one of its important purposes." It seems to be impracticable for Aus tralia, which has no foreign service,. to enforce a quota law. Another signii'caiit passage in the report of the United Slate? Congressional Committee is the following: ''The decision by the Committee to limit admissions of -quota immigrants* tn 2 per cent., based on census fignres of ISKI, in stead of 3 pei* cent., bart__l on the census of 1910, was reached after long and care ful consideration of every element of the entire immigration problem. An impelling reason for the chauge is that it is desited to slow down the streams of ihe types of immigrants which are not easily assimi lated. Naturalisation does not neces sarily mean assimilation. Tiie naturalisa tion process cannot work well with the continued arrival in large numbers of the so-called new immigration. Tlie new ty*>e crowds in the larger cities. It is ex ploited. It gains but a slight knowledge of America and American institutions It has grown to be a neat undigested mass of alien thought, alieut sympathy, £iid alien purpose. 11 is a menace to Hie social, political, and economic Viij of the country. It creates alarm and apprehen sion. Tt breeds racial hatreds, which should not exist in the United Slates, and which need not exist wheu the balance j
