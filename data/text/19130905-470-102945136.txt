A MONTH TO FIND HUSBANDS. Much amusement has been caused at the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, by the urgent pe tition of two pretty blue-eyed Danish girls, Alfild Anderson and Ingeborg Jansen, of Copenhagen, for permission to depart immediately for Winona (Minnesota). Xhev (the "Mail'' says) a-re the cheerful victims of an eccen tric will made by their grandfather, who bequeathed them each a half share of 600 acres of fine farm lands on the condition that tliey marry within thirty days of their arrival in New York. By the terms of the will, which the two cousins explained to an interpreter, title to the lands will not 'be finally vested with either of them until they become mothers. If at the end of five years one of the cousins has a child and the other has not, the motherless one will lose half her land to the other. If neither lias children at the end of five years the entire property is to revert to a male cousin in Denmark. Both girls de parted for Minnesota, confidently de claring in broken English that they would find good husbands within the stipulated term.
