COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Friday Evening. Export entries were passed to-day at the Customs for 5,452 ounces of gold for ship- ment in the Essex for London. The reduction in the rate of exchange on England to par was posted to-day at the banks, but the announcement has not had much effect on the gold market, as the movement had been anticipated in a great measure. The escort returns for the week amounted to 55,286 ounces, against 39,297 ounces for the corresponding week of the previous year. The quantity from Sandhurst amounted to 16,703 ounces, the largest escort from that field for the current year. The following is a detailed statement of the return, the fortnightly escorts being distinguished from the weekly by the prefix of an asterisk : Name of Gold. No. of Gold-Hold.

Among the latter were the following articles of colonial produce. Black sand, Britons; bones, 3 tons; copper, 100 tons; copper ore, 100 tons; gum, 739 tons; hay, 80 tons; live stock, horned cattle, 40; sheep, 100; skins, 104 packages ; tallow, 744 tons ; wool, 121,403 lbs.

The Immigration returns for the month of April give the number of arrivals at all ports of the colony at 3,744, and of departures as 1,762, the balance in favor of Victoria being 1,982. Of the arrivals, 3,688 landed at Melbourne, 81 at Geelong, and 25 at all other ports of the departures, 1,734 sailed from Melbourne, 21 from Geelong, and 7 from all other ports. The sexes are thus divided arrived, 3,744, of whom 2,053 were adult males, 1,183 adult females, 290 male and 26 female children. Departed 1,762, of whom 1291 were adult males, 317 adult females, 763 male and 78 female children. The transactions in the import market to-day have been very light, the effect of the reaction in the value of goods not having sufficiently subsided to give buyers confidence in purchasing. The prices produced by auction to-day have been satisfactory, although the greater portion of the goods offered for sale was withdrawn. Mr. A. CK M'Oombe sold at his rooms- j INE. matches, 4s. 6d. per gross ; bacon, 7d. to I 9d. per lb.; cheese, 3d. to 5d. per lb.; Patna rice, £25 per ton ; damaged rice, £15 per ton ; damaged pearl barley, 17s. to 19s. per cwt. ; Tasmanian oats. 10s. 6d. per bushel ; Danish oats, 9s. 9d. per bushel ; damaged French candles, 12d. to 14d. per lb. ; Hales' carriage Candles, Is. 6d. per lb.; Belmont carriage candles, 3s. 8d. per lb. ; China oil, 16s. 6d. per jar of four gallons; damaged Belgian hops, 11d. per lb. ; Pirn's butter, 2s. 5d. per lb. ; Gould's butter, 1s. 2d. per lb. ; Honan's butter (inferior), 7d. to 9d. per lb.; damaged tobacco, 11d. per lb.; salmon (2-lbs.), 10d. per lb.; Jones's starch, 5d. per lb.; lobsters (2-lbs.), 16s. per dozen ; curry powder, 12s. per dozen; mixed biscuits, 63d. per lb,; Abernethy biscuits, 4d. per lb.; damaged half-pint sauces, 9s. per dozen; damaged jellies and jams, 18s. 3d. per dozen ; damaged capers, 9s. 8d. per dozen; damaged salad oil, pints 13s., half-pints 7s. 3d., and pints 6s. per dozen ; damaged bottled fruits, 16s. 8d. per dozen ; sound bottled fruits, 16s. per dozen ; Hobart Town jams, 8d. per lb. ; damaged tea, congou £5 163, per chest ; damaged orange pekoe, 3s. 8d. per lb. ; Windsor soap, led. to 1s. per lb.

By the Wonga Wonga we have Sydney news to the 17th instant. The Sydney Morning Herald, of the 15th (Saturday), reports of the markets ; " Friday Evening. "The amount of gold coin issued by the Sydney branch of the Royal Mint during the week ended (to-day) May 14th, has been 40.000 half-sovereigns. '' The quantity of gold-dust imported into the same establishment during the week, for the purpose of coinage has been 7,919 ounces. " The share market has been quiet this week, and the transactions that have taken place have not been to any large amount. In the absence of news from England there is not much desire to operate either for a rise or a fall. The following are the prices at which sales have been effected Australian Joint Stock Bank, £11 per share; Commercial Bank, £89 per share; General Assurance Company, £9 5s. per share. i " Government Debentures are not quite so much sought after, and those due in 1863 have been sold at 97, and accrued interest added to the principal. Australian Steam debentures are firm, and have changed hands at 100, and interest added to the principal. " Wool The bidding at Messrs. Mort and Co.'s, on Thursday, for most of the lots was slack, and prices not quite so firm as last week. The following were the rates realised for the lots sold Fleece, 1s. 4d. to is. 7d.; bandwaBhed, Is. 10d. to Is. 6d,; mixed, Sid. to find. ; New Zealand greasy wool, 9d. " Sheepskins were not quite so much in demand this week, and the highest price obtained for superior skins was tOld. About 117 were sold at from 6d. to 10d. per lb. " Tallow. There was a good supply of this year's boiling down offered for sale, but holders would not accept less than £42 for lies, and £50 for mutton. Of the 183 casks catalogued, only 81 casks of beef were sold at £42, and those were bought by the town trade. For mutton tallow there was no offer at all near the price asked. Mixed and station tallow (about four casks) brought from 40s. 3d. to Mrs. per cwt. "Hides are a shade firmer than last week, and good heavy hides? have been sold at 10'. 93. each. About 600 hides were disposed of to-day from 4s. 8d. to 10s. 9d. each. A lot of horns brought from 27s. 6d. to 28s. 6d-, and si bank horses sold at £810 per ton. " Sugars have attracted considerable attention. The principal holders of Pampanga have refused to sell except in very small quantities, at an advance of £3 to £4. The market has been all but cleared of Mauritius sugars, except the cargo of the Lalla Rookh, just arrived. A large demand has existed for refined, at an advance of £2 on last quotations. The Company have since raised their rates to the following quotations Loaf, £63; snowdrop, £01; crystals, £50 to £51; pieces, £44 to £46 : treacle, £25. Pampangas are much inquired for at £38 to £35. "In groceries we have to report several heavy sales, to the trade chiefly, of Bagara, tea, and rice, at a considerable advance upon our last quotations and although the arrivals from Europe have been large, asserted invoices suitable for the market meet with a ready sale, deliverable from the ship's side. " Tea Importers of congou are holding for an advance of 5s. to 7s. 6d. per chest, and Very firm, with a good demand. L " In provisions and oilmen's stores there is, little or no alteration. " Cried fruits in better supply. " Patna rice has advanced to 25s. per bag. Several large parcels have exchanged hands at 32,) to 34?. " Liverpool Salt The arrivals of the Caroline, from Liverpool, and the Annie, from BJI inst., have brought supplies; but, In consequence of the great scarcity, buyers have bought freely at 42s. 6d. to £416?., to land. " Tobacco. There is but little change in the tobacco market, the prices here and in Melbourne being about the same. First-class brands will not fetch their cost, and inferior leave no profit. The imports of tobacco are a mere bagatelle when compared with the consumption : but as safe buyers are the Ecuico commodity, we can see but little prospect of improvement more particularly taking into consideration the perishable nature of the article. The bulk of stocks of negrohead is Ohlene'a ' Eagle,' and the only tales of the week have been a parcel of Barrett's at a considerable loss, and a shipment of ' Sherard,' realising wife. < "CIGARS- There is little demand for this cHick, very few purchasers, and no sales worth mentioning. No. 2 are offered at 40s. "Ales and Porter The arrivals of the articles during the week have neither affected prices for stocks materially. " Building materials continue dull of sale, but the progressive condition of our goldfields will cause all kinds of materials of this description to advance. There is little encouragement, however, for imported lumber at present prices. "Boots and Shoes. This market is depressed ; but a large sale will come off at Messrs. Dean and Co.'s in the ensuing week, which will test prices. Flour and Wheat No alteration has taken place of importance. "Wines and Spirits. Only first brandy brands are saleable ; inferior are not asked for. sums are improving, and gin is about the same as last week. In port and sherry little is doing. Of the former, really good wine is scarce. Drapery and Soft Goods There is a perceptible improvement in the demand for all articles under this class of goods, and greater confidence is manifested on the part of importers to trust the trade." The Select Committee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce had brought up the following report on " Brokerage": " Report of a Select Committee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, appointed on the 1st March, 1858, to consider and report upon the present system on which the Brokerage business is conducted in this city.' " Your Committee, having considered the important subject referred to them, have now the honor of submitting to the Chamber the following report. " In the opinion of your Committee the time has arrived when it is desirable to adopt a code of rules which will establish proper relations between the brokers of this city and their employers, and place them under such restrictions and regulations as may induce a well-defined and orderly system in their mode of conducting business. "It appears to your Committee that a movement in this direction should be no longer delayed, inasmuch as, with the growth and extension of our commercial transactions, the system of conducting business through the intervention of brokers will inevitably become more general than in former times, when the trade of the port was more limited, and business was almost entirely transacted between the merchant and tradesman In person. "As the first step towards the attainment of the object in view, it appears to your Committee very desirable that there should be a class of brokers in this city accredited by some competent body as men of good repute, and qualified by experience to act in the capacity of brokers. " In the city of London brokers are licenced under the authority of an Act of Parliament by the Lord Mayor and Court of Alderman, under such restrictions and limitations as they may think fit to enact. "Your Committee do not deem it necessary to seek for similar legislative action in this colony. It appears to them that it would be sufficient, at any rate for the present, in persons desiring to follow the business o: brokers in this city would submit to the Committee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, testimonials as to their character and efficiency, receiving from the Committee, It the event of approval, and upon their signing the rules laid down by the Committee from time to time for the regulation of the business; of brokerage, a certificate; the names of things , so approved to be recorded in a list which I shall be constantly exposed in the public had of the Exchange, the merchants' reading room, and the Chamber of Commerce, and to be published at stated intervals in the Government Gazette and loading journals of the city, as the list of brokers approved by the Chamber of Commerce. " Your Committee consider that the institution of such a system an that above described would have most beneficial effects, am that it would prepare the way for legislative action, if such be hereafter deemed advisable or necessary. " Your committee are fully aware that the mode of procedure would in no way prevent those who are not certificated by the Chamber of Commerce from following the business of a broker; but they believe that, in practice those only would be employed in this capacity; who had been approved of by the committee of that institution. " For a purpose of this kind it does no appear that a more competent tribunal could be selected than a body of mercantile met elected by the members of the Chamber a Commerce. "Your committee now proceed to express their views upon the second branch of th question-vie., the rules which should be established for the regulation of the brokerage business of this city. " In submitting the following as a cod which they conceive might, in the first in stance, be adopted, the Chamber reserving t itself the right, as between itself and the certificated brokers, to make such alterations therein as may from time t time be deemed expedient, your committee beg to observe that they have adopted as far as they consider them applicable to this colony, the rules, orders, and regulation established by the Lord Mayor and Alder men of London for the admission of brokers within that city, under the authority of the Act of Parliament alluded to in the commencement of this report. " They do not, however, consider the trade of this city as yet sufficiently advanced t necessitate the strict limitations which at imposed in London upon brokers, requiring them to follow a particular line of brokerage business, and to refrain from trading on their own account. CODE OF PROPOSED miss. 1\. That every person applying for a certificate as a broker, approved of by the con mittee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce shall produce, for the satisfaction of the conmittee, a certificate as to his character, the nature of his former employment, or the line of business in which he has been engaged such certificate to be signed by respectable merchants or others carrying on trade, no fewer than six in number at least. " 2. That no such certificate or recommendation be signed by a member of the com mittee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce "8. That the committee shall issue to each applicant of whom they may approve a cart 1 fleece to that effect, under the hand of the Secretary of the Sydney Chamber of Con merce. "4.

" 6. That, in the event of any broker be coming bankrupt, making composition with his creditors, or taking the benefit of an Insolvent Act, his name shall be erased from the list of certificated brokers, and shall not be restored thereto unless the committee deem it right to do so upon application made to them in that behalf. " C. That the committee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce shall have the power upon being satisfied that a broker has wilful! infringed any of these rules, or in any who acted improperly or dishonestly, to withdraw his certificate, and the broker shall, on both SO required, return to the committee h certificate; but the committee shall not will draw the certificate until they have afforded such broker an opportunity of attending before them to explain and defend the conduct which is the subject of complaint against him If the committee determine to withdraw the certificate, the broker shall be bound to return it to the Secretary of the Chamber within < hours after he has received notice to the effect. " 7. That whenever the committee and the provisions of Bale No. C, withdraw the certificate of any broker, such withdraw shall be notified by advertisement, under a bond of the Secretary of the Chamber, In the Government Gazette, and the other journals i which the list of certificated brokers is pu lished; and the name of such broker shall I erased from the lists exhibited in the place named in Rule No. 4. " 8. That every broker, shall enter over bargain or contract he may make in a box to be kept in his office or counting-house, be entitled "The Brokers Contract Book on the day of making every such bargain < contract, with a clear designation of both the buyer and seller, the quantity and quail of the articles sold or bought the price the same, and the terms of credit agreed upon and deliver a contract note to both buyer and seller, or either of them, upon being required BO to do, within twenty-four hours after such request has been made. ' ' 9. That no broker shall take or receive double brokerage-that is to say, from both buyer and seller of the same articles, but from the buyer or seller only, whichever it may happen to be that shall employ him and that no broker be employed for both buyer and seller in the same transaction, except only in regard to purchases made by brokers at public sales, and then only when the said purchases are made bona-fide and the name or names of the principal or principals are entered in the Broker's Contract Book immediately after the conclusion of the day's Bale. "10. That the committee shall have full power to rescind, alter, amend, or add to all or any of the above rules, as they may from time to time deem expedient; but it shall not be competent for them to do so until they have addressed to each certificated broker a circular stating the nature of the proposed alterations or additions, and shall have afforded him 14 clear days from the date of such. circular for stating, in reply, any objections he may entertain to the proposed alterations or additions. THOMAS WHISTLER SMITH. " Chairman of the Select Committee. " Sydney Chamber of Commerce, " 17th May, 1858." THE ADELAIDE MARKETS. (BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH FROM PORTLAND.) Adelaide, 19th May. The flour market has continued its upward tendency, and town brands are quoted at £16 10s. to £17, with increasing firmness "Wheat has advanced a shilling since last advices, and is quoted at 7s. 9d, bran, 2s. 3d. to 2s. 3d. The Admella, with Melbourne dates to the 18th, had not then arrived, hence the probability of a further advance since the above date. PORT OF MELBOURNE. IMPORTS AND EXPORTS FOR THE WEST ENDED 16TH !
