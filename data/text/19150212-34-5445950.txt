Everyone does not require great physical strength, but a strong vitality, steady nerves and mental energy-these every man and woman needs. The powers of mind and body are largely dependent upon the maintenance of a satisfactory state of the digestive organs. When those are out of order, food does not properly nourish, and the whole system suffers. Depression of spirits is usually the result of sluggish liver. Headaches and tired feelings ara among the many ill-effects of constipation. The remedy for all such irregularities is Beecham's Pills, which expel impurities, gently stimulât« the liver, regulate the bowels, restore appetite and impart a healthy tona. To be well and keep well,-to feel fresh and "fit"-at your best, in tatst, yoi! should take an occasional dose, of that reliable remedy Sold ereryw&ere; in boxes, prie« lOjti.
