The German Government appeals to wish to give to foreign States the impression that it cares much less to prevent emigration than to regulate it for the greater safety and comfort of the emigrant Nice distinctions are drawn between German agents promoting the departure of their countrymen for America or Australia, and foreign agents encouraging the same movement in once sense it is not too soon that the Government has interfered In numberless instances and for many years the German ensign and has received the most heartless treatment from agents and shippers, and by none perhaps has he been more unscrupulously abused than by his own countrymen Ample justification, therefore, for interference in his behalf has not been wanting, and it is little to the credit of the German authorities that they have so long been passive in the matter Certainly it may justly be asserted that this does not apply to the Government of the day in Germany, and it is not imputed to it Until lately, shippers and shipping agents at Hamburg and other principal ports of departure were amenable to no higher power than the local Senate and Bürgerschaft With those bodies they had probably sufficient influence to obtain exemption from effective supervision, and tacit permission to export human beings pretty much as they did other cargo that is, to got them away as expeditiously and cheaply as possible Now, however, the Berlin Government is supreme., and if its absolute power were used only for the better protection of the emigrant, both America and Australia would have reason to be glad of its rates science So applied, its effect would be to stimulate emigration by rendering it less hazardous to simple minded people, as very many emigrants are, and to spare the communities they joined much trouble and vexation It is very plain, however, that under the guise of regulating the proceedings of agents and shippers, and remedying the abuses that have been connected with them, there is an intention to hinder as much as possible the outgoing of the people The tone of the German Press -officially inspired is sufficient to prove that the Imperial Government is decidedly adverse to so many stout hearts and strong arms leaving the country Indeed, a purely military regime careful to guard its acquisitions 01 anxious to make flesh conquests could not be expected to look favorably on the exportation, of so much valuable war material Under these circumstances, it becomes a question whether it is worth while to continue an agency in that quarter at present Many of the relatives of the German colonists already there will probably strive to rejoin them, and our Agent in London will of course facilitate then doing so, if in his power There is no change in the sentiments with which the German colonist has always been regarded here, and next to men of our own race he will always be welcome, and perhaps, in some respects, even more highly prized But as there is no likelihood of our requirements being satisfied from the British labor market, and as the German source of supply is cut out for the present, it is desirable to open others if it be possible. It is satisfactory to learn that this is being attempted, and in directions likely to yield a very suitable class of emigrants, though not a very large number of them By last October mail, Mr DANTÎE was written to at length by the hon the Colonial Secretary, on the subject of emigration from Northern Italy He has been instructed to get his pamphlet on Queensland translated into Italian, and to take measures for its circulation in Lombardy and Piedmont As in the event of any number of those people wishing to come out here, they should have means supplied of coming direct, line is authorised to make all the necessary arrangements for that purpose He is empowered to offer sufficient inducements for one or two English ships to be laid on at Genoa or other suitable Italian seaport, and if proper measures are taken, his agents, with a little trouble, will, we dare say, succeed in fill ing them The Colonial Secretary is also endeavoring to obtain Danish immigrants, and with every prospect of success In seek ing emigrants from that quarter, he will, doubtless, bear in mind that Sir ARcncn's agents in the Danish ports served both him and the colony very scurvily some short time ago Good colonists we may have got from thence, but it is notorious that we got a great many bad ones Apparently, the criminal and charitable institute tions were drawn upon largely to fill the ships for, in proportion to the numbers brought out by them, they probably con- timed more worthless of vicious men and women than any vessels that have touched our shores since our immigration system was first initiated the character of the average Danish peasant 01 artizan is an excellent one, and we could hardly find better material for colonists, but it is evident that in Danish emigration schemes, as in all others it is absolutely necessary to secure trustworthy agents and to exercise careful selection As for the Piedmontese and I embark dians, there is little doubt that by enforcing the same rules as to selection, we may obtain from amongst them also a very useful class of settlers On the other hand, if we fail to exercise due precaution in that respect, the first shipload may more than satisfy it may surfeit US His locally, the Piedmontese bear a very poor chance in continental Europe , but, as a bad name once obtained is hard to he got rid of, perhaps they beat it undeservedly However that may be, if our agents confine their selections to the peasant class mainly, it is not likely that we shall have much reason to find fault with our Italian importations the Lombardians, especially, are noted for industry as agriculturists They are famous vignerons and agriculturists They are accustomed to the growth of nee, the cultivation of the olive, and the management of bees in their own way they are good dairy farmers, and though then way is not the English method, Parmesan cheese had achieved distinction amongst the good mands of Europe before Double Gloucester was heard of They are no novices in the growing of coin 01 cotton either, and though they may have much to learn from our farmers the knowledge will not be all on one side and they can give much in exchange Though cultivating some of the richest lands in Europe, and very moderate in their wants, they have not become enervated 01 indolent as is the quently the case with a people planted on an abundantly fruitful soil For this there are special reasons The climate is, for several months of the year, a severe rather than a mild one, and developes an energy of temperament and robustness of pi ii iqiiL very uncommon in the South of Italy The Lombard in peasant is also well exercised in making the most by an gation of an uncertain and irregular water supply, and in guarding, as best he can against its occasional excess For when the terrible " King of Floods comes rolling down swollen by Alpine snows the skill and strength of the whole population is fast ed to the utmost lins occurs about once a year, and every three or four years the Lombaidians get decidedly the worst of it the Po and its tributaries devoting cattle and crops But they struggle on manfully, and have done so for ages mending their flood barriers and planting their crops anew, rejoicing in their fat rich plains, and very pron 1 even of the mighty river against which they have so often to do battle Much wealth can scarcely be amassed under such conditions, but the character of the race becomes strengthened in the contest, and their best points are brought out forethought, energy, and aptitude for making the most of opportunities, become almost necessities of existence Seasoning, therefore, from what is known of the Lombaidian peasant, and the school in which Nature of runs him, it may safely be men ed that he would make in excellent colonist and would soon be very much at home on the banks of the Logan, the Mary, of the Condamine
