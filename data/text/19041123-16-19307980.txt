NATURALISATION DIFFICULTIES. Out Nanango correspondent writes:- Amongrecent arrivals in this district are many German and Danish immigrants, who have expressed a desire to be naturalised, but as in this part of the State there are no officials qualified to administer the necessary oath, they cannot take any ac- tion. Yesterday the matter was placed be- fore the Premier, who stated that the subject has been under the consideration ot the Government, and it is recognised that there are difficulties in the way of securing stipendiary or special magistrates in outside places, as required by the Com- monwealth Act. It is understood that an endeavour will be made to reduce the dif- ficulties,, and it is not improbable that in the Land Act to be brought down this session provision will be made to allow aliens of European descent to select land pending their naturalisation but not to secure the fee-simple until the naturalisa- tion has been effected.
