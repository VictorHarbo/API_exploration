Directress — „ Miss Annis Montague. COMMENCING MONDAY NEXT, OCTOBER 15. First Appearance in Adelaide of the MONTAGUE TURNER ENGLISH OPERA COMPANY. Headed by the Unrivalled Prima Donna MISS ANNIS MONTAGUE, And the Great English Tenor, MR. CHARLES TURNER, Whose enthralling performances have caused a perfect furore in the other colonies. To the music-loving public of Adelaide the Management regret their being unable to obtain the 'Theatre Royal, for which they have tried for the past two years; but as arrangements have been made for the appearance of Miss Montague and, Mr. Turner in England, and their time being so limited, they have been prevailed upon to give a Season in the above hall as the best suited place after the Theatre, where every possible attention will be given to the convenience and comfort of the public. Miss Montague desires it to be strictly understood that all that is advertised will be carried out, and that she will be supported by Artists who possess voices that she is confident have never been excelled in Adelaide in English Opera; knowing the Adelaide pnblic are fond of good music and singing, and also are good judges, she will be proud to meet them. The Melbourne Argus says:—"Mi33 Montague possesses a voice of rare beauty, soft, round, and melb'flous; it has been highly cultivated, and she manages it with accurate taste and skill; her trlUs are clear and distinct as the ringing of silver bells, and the prolonged swelling notes 'lengthened sweetness long, drawn out' they seem, indeed, the soul of melody;'both in speaking and singing her articulation is clear and sweet. It is a musical treat of no ordinary kind to listen to Miss Mon tague's vocalisation; it is not alone as a perfect vocalist that we have to speak of this lady, but a3 a lyric dramatic artist of great intelligence and such sympathetic manner as reach the hearts of all bearers; it is to her honorto be saidthat&s; an artiste she becomes greatest wherein most is expected of her.* Of Mr. Charles Turner,the Argus says;—"He is certainly the finest English tenor we have ever heard in Melbourne, with a fine commanding pre sence. His voice is as clear as a bell, and capable of giving forth sounds strong as a trumpet, or soft as the softest tones of a violin; it i3 also of great register, reaching the highest notes of the music with the greatest ease; there is no straining or effort; he is a magnificent singer. We feel certain . that there are not two artists south of the equator who can excel Miss Montague and Mr. Turner. The Sydney Morning Herald says" The success achieved by the Montagus-Turner Opera Company is of the most prononncea description, the singing of Miss Montague and Mr. Turner has created quite a furore amongst the music-loving portion of the com munity. Miss Montague's natural taste and love of music renders her singing tb oroughlysympathetic; it is no vain display of agility or tne exhibition of a superb natural organ; it is vocal ism appealing to the feelings that brings tears welling to the eyes or makes the heart joyous and glad." Of Mr. Turner, the Herald says" He is an operatic artist of the highest order, with a magnificent tenor voice." Sydney Express, June 4, says:—"We have never witnessed a more genuine triumph than was achieved by the Montague-Turner Opera Company last night. Miss Montague's singing was sublimity itself, en trancing one and all. Such a storm of bravo's, hurrahs, clapping of hands, beating of sticks and f eet; in fact everything available was used to express tbepublic'sintense gratification. We have never wit nessed a more genuine or greater success. Mr. Charles Turner's fine tenor voice airly excelled all we have heard of him. " At the conclusion of the Company's season in Brisbane, His Excellency the Governor, the late Sir Arthur Edward Kennedy, stepped upon the stage, and presented Miss Annis Montague with a valuable diamond bracelet and a eulogistic address; con cluding with, "by the unanimous voice of all who understand music, and by the acclamation of numerous and critical audiences, you have proved yourself to he in the universal kingdom of high art a veritable Queen of Song, &c.;"' Supported by the following Artists, who are second to none in the Colonies, most of whom have supported these great artists for the past two years:— f Miss Francis Saville ..ecunda Donnas « — ^ Helen Gordon Contralto Miss Carrie Hubert Primo Baritone .. .. ..
