The brighter outlook in the farming districts has inducedshop keepers to increase their stocks, although many have been holding on in anticipation of-lower prices. The only vessel arring s?ie our last review is the s.s. Indarra., which brought the usual consignments from the- Estern-.tates. Her arrival consider ably improved local stocks of sugar, which bad reached a very low level Diethylated spirits is almost unobtainable. This is due to the difficulty in getting freight, as only colliers or steamers carrying coal will ac cept spirit as cargo. The coal strike con siderably hampered the running of colliers consequently thin State ivas left whout supplies atof mthvlated spirits. kruits and Jams.-merchants. are offering at :the undermentioned prices, forward de livery, and good sales are reported: Fruits, tssorted, 9s. 7,d. per dozen; apples, 8s. 6d.; apricots, 10s. 3d.; pea=hes, 10s. 3d.

In's is based on the valua tion of fifty conrpanaes having teir head cftice in New South Wales, and compris ing among others, bancing, insurance, shipping, gas, brewing, and coal companies. Tne toeal vaLuationu of these companies was acst down at £40,114,300 in Jund, 1914, in December. 191, at ""a,-?0'ati; and s: December 1916, at £3l,tun,~uU, or a lessened value or 22 per cent. Lomment ing on the position, Thompson and son say : It cannot be expected that our investors are satisfied with the outcome of the year now closing. Disappointments have outweighed other considerations, and the prices of our investments have continued to recede- Indeed, the fall nas been prac tically as heavy in i916 as it was in 1915, and roughly prices of investments here are now 20 per cent. lower -than they were in June, 1914-just before the war started. - That, however, includes the great advance which occurred in the first half of 1914. As compared with December, 1913 (three year; ago), the average fall has only aeen about 13 per cent., which is small; and the fall in 1916 has been about 9 per cent. That is fairly heavy for a single year, though it can be more than matched elsewhere. Now for the reasons. Of course, had the great war shown indications of coming to an end, the position would have been altogether different. Many of the troubles of the year would have disappeared. But that outcome is not in sight, though the AUies in the middle of the year took the offen sive. The chief reasons for aepression pe culiar to tee Commonowealth have been our giestir increased taaation--which has threatened profits and wealth; continued high prices of commodities; labour unrest and strikes; political upheavals; the con centration of efforts on bthe War Loans, to which over £45,000,000" additional was subscribed duri ,this year; excess:ve freights and the serious collapse in the shipping of our wheat, which was har vested twelve months ago. Our exports in 1916 ought to have been £25,000,000 to £30,000,000 more than they have been. Dealings in Australia's principal asset land-have been greatly checked; issues of capital for commercial undertakings have been severely restricted; prices have been largely controlled; and the Wealth Tax and War Time Profit Tax have been night mares, even if we wake up later and find them comparatively harmless. At any rate, the War Loan will not, be taxed- that is settled. . - Fire and marine in surance continue to hold their ground.i But during 1916 bank shares have receded about 44 per cent., miscellaneous com panies 6 per cent., shipping (including ferry) and coal companies about 71 per cent., gps companies 12 per cent., and breweries about 23 per cent., the last mostly in the first half of the year. As for breweries they are nearly 44 per cent. below the level of June, 1914. and gas companies 39 per cent. below. The gas companies have been treated hardly, but their trials should not be permanent, nor those of .the breweries either. The War Loan- has fairly held its position. though there were evident signs of depres sion when Mr. Hit'es said it wou'ld be subject to the Wealth Tax. AME?tICAR 'WOOL MARKET. The American "Breeders' Gazette" recent ly reviewed the condition of the iaol mar kIt in the United States, and reported : The trade is on a war basis, although present prices are due in a large measure to a world shortage, in which the recent long Australian drought has been a factor. For two years past enormous quantities of coarseo and medium wools have been con sumed in man facturing cloth for army clothing practically all of which is waste, there being no salvage. Meanwhile, Ame rican flocks have been depleted, and" in every wool- producing country in the world the clip has been short. From now oni army requirements will diminish, but -if the war continues high prices will be im perative. In trade opinion a reasonable cc"tainty of war termination will mean lower prices. At present American weav ers are largely dependent on a deficient domestic clip, Britain having placed an embargo on the clip of her Empire, with few exceptions, such as Canada: while there is keen competition for the South American clip. Holding wool at present prices is speculative, and there is a trade axiom about overstaying good markets that deserves consideration. Trade experts be lieve that termination of ,the war would cause slight depreciation in values, and necessitate readjustment between fine and other -cools, but a world-wide production deficiency warrants expectation, of good prices for years to come, a return'to the old basis at any time in the future being improbable. _ ENGLISH WHEAT MARKET ,REPORT Messra. H. N. Bathgate and Co.. Lon don and Bristol, report under date No vember 21: The announcement that the Indian Gov ernment has arranged for the export of about 2,000,000 quarters of wheat during November and Deccmbsr is very welcome. This quantity added to what has been bought i. Australia, will be sufficient to supply the whole of our import require mento for about nine weeks. This is a fact proba- ly not realised in America, where they have not yet grasped the fact that we am leer dependent on that country than we were last year; for, with what has been bought in Argentina, Canada. and else where, it seems apparent that we may not. reqluire the whole of thebs surplus available from North America during this season. An anr-cuncente-t of graCt importance has just been made by the well-known American crop ecoert, Mr. Inglis who now staces that the U.S.A. Government has under estimated the American crop by about 4.o000,000o quarters. We always felt that this priced to find that the quantity will even' exceed that named by Mr. Inglis, and that we shall have a substantial addition to the exportable total, especially if Chicago once reali?e the frues position in regard to supplies from other countries. Then again, beford tb!s end of our current seas?s Awne ri;a will be offering and chipping winter wheat harvested next May and June, and this may provide ancther 3-4,')00,000 quar trs, provitled cnuns in that colntry he fairly good. If the Indian harvest, prove to be antsfacto-y, in. accordance with present indications. then it wilf be the duty of our Government to secure and sell large quantities of Indian wheat next .larch. April- and May, so as to I.revent any at tempts on the part of Amerncan specula tors to corner the market at the tail-end of the season. If however, these opera tiens are to be effective, all the arrange ments must be imade .not later than ners month, as the oolicy of delay and procras tination has beei. ever fatal. AMERICAN MAEKET REPORT. Mailer and Quereau, New York report. under date November 16: Our present report must very largely he a continuation of remarks in our recer:t ones, indisatiung very active btsiness condl tions in this otuitry and a constant ten dency to odvance prices. While this neans prosparity for the United States, It also n akes the export trade extremely flifficul, foe high prices, combined with high freights, make delivered cost beyond buy ers views as to value. This. we find is resulting in a de:rea;e in orders for both Australia and New Zealand, and the volume of merchandiso now going forward is much lees than we haiveln?own it for a number of years. In viec\ of existin- conditions in Australia and New Zealana, it is not s'urprising that buyers hesitate about ven turing v;ry largoly in carrying stocks, and u.tii there is an increased demand, ,r suppibes have become greatly reduced we di net anticipate any large increase in volume of trade. The United States is pass ing through a period of great prosperity, the only drawback being that our clops of cereals and cotton this year were unusually small, and while prices have advanced cdr respondingly yet this rreases much higher crst to consumers. So far as it is possible to look ahead, ,he ottlook is for coniiti. arco of activ:ty and very little probability of any reduction in prices of leading lines. Labour conditions are still very much un settled as there is gr:m. scarcity in every dry.artment.'both in manufacturing and in farmins and this adds to the cost, as well as restricts tile output. Until immigration increases minterially fromn Europe, these conditions are ilkely to conRinne. Shipping matters" In the direction of Australia wvi are still Ending lifficulty in securing ton cage mnd recently charter cost has been ahdvanced. to that all indications point to c-letinuance of a veriy srong freight mar k?., at least durin-; our coming winter eason, but we hope there will be no ad. vance ir, freight rates. Should any active demaind .ore for tonnage to load for E-irop,. we will, no doubt. see very large ad-ances in ,harter cost o" stea-nsis. DALGETY AND CO., LTD. The annual meeting of MIesass. Dalgety and Co.; Ltd.. was held in London on No vember 25 last, the chairman of directors, lIr. E. W. Parker, presiding. The directors' thirty-second annual re port showed a net profit of £18&.857 for the year, which, with the balance brought fri-ward from the previous year, gave £397,544. In fMay last an interim dividend ", as paid at the rate of 8 per cent. per an num for the half-year ended December ., 1915, amounting to £40,000, and the directors recommended that the balance of the profit and loss account for the year, viz., £1148857 12s. id., should be appro priated as follows:-£40,000 in payment of a dividend at. the rate of 8 per cent. per annum for the half-year; £20,000 in pay ment of a bonus of 2 per cent. for the year ended June 30 last; £50,000 to the reserve fund, *.thereby raising it to £650,000; £25,000 to writing down cost of premises; £10,000 to the staff benevolent fund; and "£3,857 I2s. Id. to be added to the general prolit and loss account, thereby raising it to £212,544 5s. 11d. From .the general profit and loss account the directors re commended that £15,000 should be appro priated to the further writing down of cost of premises, leaving the amount of £197,544 to be carried forward. The chairman explained the accounto at some length, and on the item income tax said it showed an increase of £41,032. (The accounts showed that the income tax in En?land amountoi to £48,709, and in Australasia to £32,921, a total of £81,627.) Speaking, on this subject, the chairman said .-"hareholdes who keep their old balance-sheets will notice, if .they will re fer to them, that in the last four years this item had quadrupled, and this, not owing to our increased profits, except to a small extent. I do not think that any of us grumble at the increased .income tax, either hero or in Australia, as we know that funds must be forthcoming to carry on the war, but what we and others simi larly, situated do resent is having to pay the tax twice over. (Hear, hear.) The bulk of our profits are earnad in Australia and New Zealand, where they already pay a severe Income Tax, and are then taxed again when brought over here for distribution to the, shareholders. This, it enems to me, is most unfair, and the re sult is that those people who have invest ed money in the colonies or in colonial companies such as this company are mulct ed in a double income tax, whereas the bulk of the community only pays one tax. Several important and influential meetings have beon held in this country to protest against this unfair treatment, but so far, I am sorry to say, with very little reoult. They have had this effect, however, that rise Chancellor of the Exchequer has ac knowledged that we have a legitimate grievance, and a certain measure' of relief has been granted in that he-has provided in the United Kingdom Finance Act for 1916 that upon proper proofs of this double taxation in respect of profits. for the financial year 'ended April 5, 1917, re payment of the colonial tax can be claim ed up to is. 6d. in the pound. He has also further promised that a committee shall be set up after the war to inquire into the working of the Income Tax Acts and the incidence of this double taxation. It, however, falls upon us very hardly, that we should have to. pay the double income tax in the meantime, and have to wait for any further relief until after the war is over. .Large as it the amount, that we are called upon to pay now, we have not yet felt the full force of the present rats of taxation, because, given that we make the same amount of profits next year, our pro vision for English taxation, without anyin crease in the present rates, will have to be at least £20,000 more, or a total of over £100,000 here and in Australasia com bined, a sum equal to 10 per cent. upon our ordinary capital." The report and accounte were adopted, after Fame strong'adverse criticism of the double tax shareholders were called upon to pay, one of the speakers observing that a man resident in this country who had investments in Australia was liable to pay the State tax. the Federal tax, the Eng lish Income Tax, and if he had the good (or bad) fortune to be liable for Super Tax, then he also had to pay the Super Tax in this country. That accumulation of taxation amounted in such a case to 13s. 6d. in the £ of that man's income. And if he was correct in his caluculation, it was, he asserted, more confiscation than taxa tion."
