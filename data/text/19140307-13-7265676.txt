Scarcely a week now passes without references in the papers to meetings of associations, a corporations, or persons interested in the public welfare, ton sidering propositions all! menus for stating the spread of the most frequent and most disastrous contagious diseases, recognising that their treatment at present is unreliable, and showing at the best a very small percentage of cures only. But a new treatment has been discovered, perfectly solving the question, and bringing the cure of such diseases into a line with that of THE MOST EASILY CURARLE AILMENTS. TheN treat incur is, unlike the other, not by injection, the effects of which are often worse than the ilLcase, but by DRY INHALATION, distributing the specific remedy, mixed with nascent oxygen, through the lungs, directly into the blood circulation, thereby' destroying and! burning up, EVERYWHERE IN THE SYSTEM, the now well-known GERM OF THE DISEASE. It has been practised willi complete success and without occurrence in any case, for over 15 years-, by- a distinguished German physician, and Mr. A. BRUNNER, Specialist, 117 Collins street (See his advertisement in this paper, Medical Column,") ' has acquired This treatment, "nil practised it here for about a year with equally gratifying results. The treatment is not only simple and harmless, but in every case (even in cases or tuberLUb SK) GREATLY BENEFICIAL to the GENERAL HEALTH. The fact that men like the Honourable E. H. CAMERON, M.I'., lind J. E. JOHNSTONE:, M.P., who both over 40 years ago were cured by Mr. "Bronner froin-nllmentsi thought to brindle. able, allow him to"mcntionrtheir names as referee' once, and continue to send 'bills patients, may be cited to give to this notice the publicity it deserves for its FAR-REACHING PUBLIC IMPORTANCE.
