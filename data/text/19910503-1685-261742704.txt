French activists break up neo-Nazi groups Paris: ABOUT 50' Jewish activists broke up a neo-Nazi celebration of Hitler’s birthday and later pub lished a challenge to the govern ment to prevent that sort of gathering. The masked youths, wearing helmets, descended on the neo- Nazis with iron bars, baseball bats and tear gas grenades, injur ing at least 11 of them. By the time police arrived, the attackers were gone. The Nazis, shouting “Zionist assassins’’ and other anti-semitic epithets, vented their anger on the police, injuring several. According to the daily Libera tion, the attack was mounted by a so-called Jewish Action Group, said to be a coalition of members of various militant Zionist'organ isations. The newspaper published a statement by the group saying, “It is out of the question to allow former SS and National Front members to meet freely in Paris. The French Ministry of Interior has the means and duty to prevent this type of gathering.” The Jewish Action Group ad ded, “We shall use all means, in cluding legal ones, to prevent this from happening.” The National Front is an ex treme right-wing political party led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, who has twice in the last month been fined by French courts for defaming Jews and is currently on trial in a Paris court for another such incid ent. The neo-Nazis were setting up bookstalls with Nazi propaganda material to honour a French col laborationist journalist of the World War II period when they were attacked. IN COPHENHAGEN police are looking for vandals who daubed swastikas on walls and monuments all over the Danish capital. So far, no one has been apprehended. The spate of graffiti is believed to be symptomatic of growing resent ment against foreigners in histor ically tolerant Denmark. It is attributed to rising unemployment and immigration from Third World countries. (JTA)
