" Mlit At Bunylp last week dairy cow so1j up to £8 a head. The management of the Western- Dig# trict Factories' Co-operative ProduCB Company has houerht an aer and a half at Jetty Flat, South Warrnambool, joining the site of their butter box ffifll tory, now in course ef erection. A Danish dairy expert (Mr 6. P, Att# derson) who is- at present in Australia states that the prospects for Australia and New Zealand produce were neVOT, better than at present. There was ft shortage of butter from Denmark, Ca ada, and Siberia, and Australian buttttt was now in great demand. There was a fine display of Huntfcf River lucerne in the show window Qfi Messrs F. H. Brunning Pty. Ltd., Eliz4£ beth street, Melbourne, during the wees. It was grown at Bamwam irrigation settlement by Mr Thomas Hilton. Thj fodder, which represents a growth of I months, indicates that the possibilities of lucerne growing in the dry districL under Irrigation have scarcely been rtf alised. s The Queensland Government Stat|Sg tician has prepared a return showifii that the number of dairy cattle in thai State last year was 357,095, the mijft produced was 71,770,148 gallons, the ter manufactured was 27,858,5851b., and cheese 8, 718,2571b. All the items showed a decrease as compared with the prop vious year. Cattle decreased by 884& milk by 15,878,174 gallons, butter b$ 3.399, 7981b., and cheese by 428,4041b. Mr Butler, of Eulga, In the Yarraiff district, who keeps a large number b| pigs running on his farm, has had uj$ wards of 100 lambs destroyed and eateft by pigs in a few days. Mr T. COOB has also lost a number of lambs in thj same manner. Mr Butler was for somg time at a loss to account for the slaug!te| ter, as foxes are not so numerota this year. He eventually discovered that pigs were responsible. | When the chairman of the Watel Commission (Mr Elwood Mead) visita j Rochester last week, there was an emf inhibition at the local office of the 'State I Rivers and Water Supply Commissiog| j of some splendid samples of lucerijl j grown on Mr Tweddle's allotment S Bamawm. There are about 12 acre of it, sowTn last September# and ljy| Mead was assured that the specime® produced was a fair sample of tbj| whole crop, which was very unifonm Mr Mead expressed himself higRlg pleased with the exhibit, especially with the fine, strong roots that ha(| developed. In reviewing the immigration polic of the Government last week Mr Hage||| thorn, M.L.C., made reference to dairy# ing. The Messrs Turnour Bros., Cohuna, he said, have cultivated lM acres of lucerne, beginning only tw® years ago, from which in the season lass than £8,000. . Another setter near Ofohuna, formerly leaded an estate flever maintained more ffian 10 head of cattle and a few sheep. y/£Ie now owns albout 53 acresof the same estate, on which, with: the aid of irrigation, he "Carries .45 dairy cows — about half the -number he formerly kept on the 960 acres. . Where one man and his family got a: living on hundreds of acres, they |iow live in greater comfort and profit on tens of acres scientifically supplied with water. On July 18 it was stated by officers of the Agricultural Department that, as -a result of- the June rains, dairying prospects were now very favorable. Toe only drawback was that crops and grass would be later than usual. A good many cows had been lost in the "Northern and North -"Eastern districts -as a result of the dry weather which prevailed until recently. However, pre sent conditions pointed to a very satis factory growth of grass during the aprlng, and cows would benefit mate rially by an abundance -of good feed. The state of affairs in the Western Dis trict and Gippsland was also satisfac tory; indeed, the conditions in South Gippsland had never been better at this time of the year than at present. It was certain that shipments of butter would not be begun until September, but, though the beginning of the export season would be much later than usual, an average production was expected. The half-yearly balance sheet of the ©evenish butter factory Company shows a profit of £604/8/9. On the ex penditure side the chief items were : Cream, £1154/17/; salaries and wages, £121/15/; butter boxes and firewood, £52/5/. On the other side, advances on export butter amounted to £1066/9/9 ; surplus on London sales, £821/12/8; sales at factory, £133/8/11; Melbourne sales. £28/2/.

Of the butter made 24,5621b. was exported, 6501b. sold in Melbourne, 24111b. sold for cash, and 4271b. sold to cream suppliers. The pay ment for cream amounted to £ 1154/17/6, being an average of 5 3-10d. per lb. of cream.
