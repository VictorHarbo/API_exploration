Should the advices by the mail, now nearly due, show a continued decrease in shipments from the home markets, prices will, in all probability, exhibit some Improve- ment ; but, as we have often reiterated, with excessive stocks on hand, and a cessation of immigration, coal derable time must elapse before the market owing cover from the over-trading of past years. Sales of ale and porter, both In bottle and bulk, have been made to moderate extent, at prices showing no change in the values of most approved brands. Holders of old Wales are disposed to accept somewhat lowering quoted prices, to clear off sticks.
