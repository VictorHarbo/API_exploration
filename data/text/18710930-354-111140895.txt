The Port of Newcastle. From the S. M. Herald. The following statistics of the port of New castle (collated and compiled from the most authentic sources) have been carefully brought up to the present time, and will be studied with interest by a large number of our readers desirous of becoming more thoroughly acquain ted with the past and present commerce of the principal northern harbour of thia colony. We begin with some particulars relative to the coal exports from Newcastle during the last sixteen years ; the figures being auch as serre to manifest the very great importance of the trade in coal — the main staple of the Hunter River district. , .The details are such as go to show that this trade has gradually increased in magnitude, notwithstanding those occasional fluctuation of prosperity, which' seem to be inevitable in all mercantile and industrial' affairs :— : COAL EXPOBTS AT THE PORT OP NEWCASTLE FBOH THE ; TSAR 1854 10 1870.

By this.it will ibe seen ithat, during the last sixteen years there bas only been a decrease — ^ — — ^— — ^__- in tho coal exports from the port of Newcastle in the years 1858, 18(51, 1867, and 1870 ; aud an increase — often a very large one — dur- ing the years 1855, 1850, 1^57, 1859, 18G0 18G2, 18G3, 18G1, 18G5, I860, 18G8, and 18G9. — To be yet more explicit, we may re mark that in 1855 the increase of the coal exported from Newcastle, over, that of the previous year, was 18,340 tons ; in 185G, the like increase was 19,179 tons ; in 1857, the like increase (still ascending) was 13,401 tons; in 1858, coal exported from Newcastle was, however, 5G13 tons less than that of the year previous. At this first decrease, recorded in our table, the coal exported was nevettbeless as much as 139.93S tons. In 1859, the in crease of the coal exported over that of the previous year amounted to 101,438 tons. In 18G0, tho like, increase (still ascending) was 42,510 tons. In 1861, there was another decrease — in respect of the high total of the previous year — the amount of decrease being 27.89G tons ; that is to ssiy, 255,940 tons, instead of 283,836 tons. During the next five years there was an annual increase of coal exports, the least increase being shown by the returns for 1865. Thus, in 1862, the increase of exported coal was 101,583 tons ; very closely approximating to that which was exported in 1859. In 1863, the increase was 12,820 tons ; in 1864, 89,617 tons; in 18G5, 2142 tons; and in 1SGG, 183,613 tons. In 1867, there was a third decrease— -the amount of that decrease being 53,582 tons; that is to say, 592,033 tons', instead of 045,615 tons. In 1868, the increase of the coal exported over that of the previous year amounted to 95,187 tons — 55G tons (in the annual increase alone) — more than was exported from the port of Newcastle altogether in tlie year 1854. In. 18C9, the increase of coal exported over that of 1868 was 18,368 tons. Last year (1S70), there was a fourth occasional decrease on the antecedent year; the amount of such decrease being 13,389 tons — 692,099 tons, instead of the 705,488 tons of coal exported in 18G9. From this it may be seen that the coal exported annually through the port of Newcastle, including the trade coastwise, intercolonial and foreign, may be fairly estimated at seven hundred thousand tons, representing, even in its present stage of imperfect development, a commercial aud in dustrial interest of which the colony may be justly proud. All these figures may be de pended upon, as they are derived from an official source. CHARGES ON VESSELS. As respects the charges on vessels at the port of Newcastle, the following statement shows the number of all vessels (inclusive of coasters) entered inwards and outwards at this port, and the charges actually paid dur ing the year 1870 : — Total number of vessels inwards, 2046 — G89,968 tons ; the amount of dues paid thereon being £6457 4a. Gd. The total of vessels outwards was 2681—703,758 tons ; the amount ot dues paid thereon to the Customs at Newcastle being X7289 3s. 8d. These figures may serve, in some degree, to shew the extent of the present commerce of Newcastle, the nature of which does not as yet seem to lie generally recognised.

All the vessels belonging to Newcastle are now1 required to be registered in the Custom house, at tho corner of Scott and Bolton streets, in that city ; the sub-collector of the port (Mr. \V. B. Logan) furnishing in every case a certificate of such registration. The number of the vessels belonging to the port of Newcastle on the 2nd September, 1871, thus registered,' with tneir tonnage, in pursuance of .Acts of Parliament, was as follows : — JVtne- teen .vessels, whose tonnage is under 50 tons, the total tonnage of which wag returned as 592 tons. Also thirty-three vessels, whose tonnage is over 50 tons, the total' tonnage' of which was returned as 7197 tons. Grand total of tonnage of the fifty-two vessels belong ing to Newcastle — seven thousand seven hun dred and eighty-nine tons. [' . From returns' compiled 'from shipping re gistrars up to the 1st of January, 1871 (completed with much care, and published in the Herald in April last,, by. Mr. Frederick C. Jarrett), it is an ascertained fact that .New castle has the. highest average tonnage; of any port of Australasia — namely, 180^.. pen vessel. Auckland, in New Zealand,- has the lowest only 50$ per vessel. The like average for Melbourne is 155J tons; and that for Sydney, 1 35 £ tons. The average tonnage of the Sydney vessels is greatly reduced by the river steamers and ferries.
