Imprisoned For 20 Years "By Mistake" -Â» I STAFF CORRESPONDENT | NEW YORK, Sept. 5.-A Danish immigrant has been kept "by mistake" in a Kansas mental institution for almost 20 years, it was disclosed to-day. Officials of the Topeka State Hospital, where the immigrant, John Crabb, now 59, was kept, said that one of the reasons'they thought he was insane was that he tried so hard to prove he was sane. At one time, they listed him as incurable. The hospital superintendent said Crabb was "the victim of cir- cumstance." He laid Crabb's long confine- ment to his lack of knowledge of the United States, his inability to speak English clearly, his hot temper, and his determination to prove he was sane. Crabb was originally confined because he threatened a man who made advances towards his girl friend. Crabb's case was brought to the attention of a group ot Danish insurance men, who took the matter up with the authori- ties. Last November he was given a final test and declared sane. Then it took almost 10 months to arrange his release. The superintendent said there was every indication that he was never out of his mind. "I'm am not resentful." Crabb said as he left the hospital. "I'm just glad to get away. I've wailed a long time for this."
