New Australians from many lands From our special representative CANBERRA, September tj. — Of more than 72,400 travellers w h o arrived in Australia from overseas during the March Quarter of this year, 51,409 were people who intended to remain here permanently, accord ing to figures released ity the Commonwealth Statis tician. Tims it will be seen that the target of 200,000 aimed at for the' whole year by the Minister/ for Im migration (Mr. Holt) seems likely to be reached. Allowing for de partures from Australia, the net permanent gain to population through migration was 46,200. BRITISH CHARACTER To what extent the migration movement is going to reduce the predominantly British character of Australia's population — it has been our boast that we are "98 per cent British"— we do not know. It depends upon how long the movement cpntinues. But of the 51,409 permanent new arrivals during the quarter ended March, 33,122 (64.4 per cent) were non- British, whilst 18,287 (35.6 per cent) were British. The dumber of males who ar rived to settle in this country totalled' 29,950 and females 21,459. Persons not "gainfully occupied" fmalnly housewives, students and children) numbered 23,197. The others were classified as follows: — Males: Craftsmen, E333; rural, fishing, hunting, 3982; operatives, 2883; laborers, 2629; commercial, clerical, 1914. Females: Operatives, 1340; commercial, clerical, 1321; professional and semi-professional, 952; domestic, etc., 926. The ; migration flow began to assume important dimensions . in 1948, when we made a iiet gain in population of 48,468. Gathering impetus, due in large measure to the energy and enthusiasm of Mr. Calwell, ' who was then Minister for Immigration, it brought us, a net gain of 149,270 in 1949— 87,855 males and 61,415 females. Of these, 46,800 arrived in the last quarter of that year. POLES AND ITALIANS Arranged according to country of last permanent residence, the largest inflow of migrants was: from Germany, but few of them were Germans— they were "dis placed persons." Tney numbered 16,612 in the quarter ended March, as compared with 13,679 from Great Britain. In the last quartx of 1949, however, there were 13,623 new permanent arrivals from Britain as against 5905 from Germany; Acording to nationality, next to the British by far the largest number of new arrivals are Polish (including "Stateless Poles"), and then come Italians. Adding the number of- British people who came from other countries to those who came from the United Kingdom, the total "British" per manent arrivals in the March quarter numbered 18,831.
