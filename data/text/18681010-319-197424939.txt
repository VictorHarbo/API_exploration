Messes Money Wigram and Son's Linee Norfolk , arrived Thursday from .London after a smart passage of seventy days from Plymouth, and in consequence of there not being a berth ' for her at:the Sandridge railway Pier, she brought up in the Bay, but will be taken alongside early this morning. From the tiirie of leaving' Plymouth on; the 29th of July until fiye weeks ago she had remarkably fine weather, . but since then a continuance of heavy westerly gales prevailed attended . by a very high . sea, but wiih the exception of her BtaTboard quarter gallery being stove in, she has suffered no damage, and is in her usual ebod order. The equator was crossed on the twenty- Bixth day out. in 17 deg. W.: and, after rounding the Cape of Good Hope, the easting was run down in 44 dog. S., the gales above-mentioned being experienced during that time. The rooks, num bering about two dozen, shipped on beard of tier at London for the Victorian Acclimatisation ' Society, died.with the exception of two. No vessels connected with the colonies were spoken on the passage. ; Murder AT Sea.— Captain Lee, of the Tyra, has handed to the Sydney Morning Herald the following statement : — 'The barque Tyra cleared the passage of Tanawa at 11 a.m. on the 7th April, with alight air, at N N.E. The Dauntless, Captain Robinson, master, in company, .bound, north. At sunset, calm, Tanawa Reef, bearing E., distance eight miles. The Dauntless in- Bhore about three miles. At 1 a.m. ori;the 8th the mate of the Dauntless came on board the Tyra and said the native crew had thrown the captain overboard. I asked the mate what, he waB doing during the time the natives were throwing the captain overboard; he said ,he hada,vory bad head, that it pained him all day,, and that he had his head', in -a' bucket of water at the time the captain was thrown overboard. I said, it was a- strange time to have his head in water. The captain was thrown over at 7 p.m. on the7th; The mate asked me to give him a navigator to take them to the island of Ebon, one of the Mulgraves, '-I tbld him there was a naviga tor at Tanawa, and as it was yet in Bight he had better go back and get him. The Dauntless was a foreand aft schooner, built at the Fijis, arid Captain Robinson .was master and owner. , ANOTHER SUPPOSED WRECK. — The New Zealand Herald of 8th September, states :— " During yesterday and the day before various rumors were afloat in Auckland city as to the alleged discovery of a quan- tity of floating wreck in the neighborhood of the North Cape. We have been' at considerable pains to ascer tain the facts of the.casa, and are now able to lay be fore, our readers the whole particulars, so far as they are at present known Tho Hannah Newton, schooner, Oapfain .Willing, which arrived at M'Lennan's, Saw Mills,' Aratapu, Kaipara, bri the 31st ult, reported having seen. about half way between Cape Marie Van . Diemen and the Three Kings a quantity of. floating wreoki consisting of1 several apara, the top of the deckhoupe of a large vessel, :painted white, and'a large' quantity of square timber. Amongst the wreokjwaB:the topmast of a large vessel,: with the cap attaohed, whioh was got on board and brought up to the Kaipara. The ' Little 'Fred,' three-masted schooner, Oaptain Davis, arrived at the samp port on that day, and also reported having seen the wreck. Captain' Davis picked up a nautical almanack .with the name of ' Rickwood' written on a piece of blot ting papar inside the book. These reports were made to. Captain James, the pilot at Kapaira, and the . al manae was delivered into his charge. The ' topmast was of Baltic pine, and the reBt of thei spars seemed , to be of the same material. From the fact of the dis covery of the square timber, it iB supposed that the voesol mast have been loaded at the Kaipara or Hokianga Mills. The Armistice barque, which arrived Sydney from Hokianga, reported the Lorenzo Sabine, barque, Captain Helden, as loading at that port on the 14th ultimo for Sydney, and she would probably sail thence about the 20th. The brig Heba had also sailed for Melbourne from Hokianga; and the Eliza Sharpe, barque, Captain Gay, sailed from Kaipara some time last month.. It is also to be feared, therefore, that the wreck is part of one of the three vessels, and the deck house seems to point to a strong suspicion of its being the Lorenzo Sabine, which left Auckland in July last Whether the unfortunate vessel has gone ashore or foundered at sea, is not at present known, and of course considerable anxiety is felt as to the safety of the crew. This is quite a separate affair from the wreck discovered at the Great Barrier, and we can not, therefore, but fear that two vessels have lately been lost on our coast."
