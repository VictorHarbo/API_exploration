The last mail was despatched in tho mids of dulness and dissatisfaction, nor are we ye in a position to point to any improvement it this respect, the past month having been om of extreme depression. It is, moreover, i matter for regret that it is also out of ou power to refer to our future prospects in < more cheerful strain than has been dono o late ; though, in the midst of so much gloom it is matter for congratulation that conlidenci has been so well maintained, and that, ha vin; as yet escaped from failures and suspensions anything like distrust has not been allowed te prevail in commercial circles. The onlj casualty to report this month is that of Messrs Woodville. Jarrett, and Co., a meeting o: whose creditors was held on the 15th instant The statement submitted showed liabilities amounting to £15,000 in round numbers, while the assets were estimated at £15,300 (the amount locked up in the Souchays stearaoi being represented at £12,000.) It was more- over elicited thut their losses, sustained in the course of twelve months' trading, amounted to £13,000 ; but notwithstanding, their pre- sent position was chiefly owing to the unusual depreciation of property held, caused by tht general depression in trade. After some dis- cussion it was agreed that the estate should be assigned to Messrs. Alfred Ross and James Service, for the benefit of all concerned. In the markets few transactions of import- ance have come .under our notice. In bag- ging, cornsacks have changed hands more ex- tensively at a decline in price. A tendency to lower rates in candles was arrested, and the market closes firm, at a slight improvement. Sales have not exceeded 9,000 boxes. In brcadstuffs a considerable reduction has been submitted to : transactions havo been unimportant. The sale of the John Eyston's cargo of Californian barley, 20,000 bushels, is the only transaction of consequence recorded in this cereal. 780 pockets of Kent and Tasmanian hops havo changed hands, and 15,000 to 10,000 bushels of malt have found buyers. The sales of kerosene oil have con- sisted mostly of damaged parcels; some 13,000 cases have been disposed of. In sugars the trade have operated to the extent of 32,000 bags. Teas, sittco the mail's ar- rival, have been very freely sold. The sales of timber, tobacco, &c;, have not been ex- tensive. In wines, one line of 2,300 quarter casks, 100 hhds., and thirty pipes, changed hands on speculation. In geneva, some 14,000 cases have been placed, and a parcel of 8,000 caiics low brandies was likewise quitted. On Thursday afternoon, the 8th instant, the arrival of the English mail was telegraphed from Adelaide. Notwithstanding the in- crease of shipments to the colonies, advices as a whole are not looked upon as altogether unsatisfactory, owing to the improved tone reported in the home markets. The aggre- gate value of the exports to 15th June, show an increase of £220,551 over tho previous month, the gross value being £1,040,057 against £825,500 in April-May, made up thus : -To Melbourne, increase, £99,308; Sydney, do., £120,198; Queensland, do., £11,070; Tasmania, do., £4,109: Adelaide, decrease, I £18,302; New Zealanel, do., £1,958. Via Panama, advices from New York to hand re- port shipments of oil as reaching to 30,000 i cases, and of tobacco to 400,0001b. Advices from Calcutta are favourable in regard to rice, and from China areequally so inregard totea. | EXCHANGE AND MONEY. i .The intercolonial rates of exchange have during the month undergone some revision, | and a much more satisfactory system has been inaugurated than that hitherto in force. The following rates are now quoted :-New South Wales, buying, jf per cent, discount ; selling, i [per cent, premium ; Queensland, buying, 1 per cent, discount ; selling, 1 per cent, premium ; South Australia, buying, 1 per cent, discount ; selling, J per cent, premium ; Tasmania, buying, if per cent, discount ; selling, i per cent, premium ; New Zealand, buying, j per cent, discount ; selling, £ per cent premium. The usance of all inter- colonial transactions to be sight on de- mand, and current rates of discount to be charged for any number of days exceeding such usance. It has also becu decided that a uniform charge of two and a half per cent, rc-exchange should be made on all inter- colonial hills returned dishonoured. The banks have likewise agreed to make a charge of one-eighth per cent, on all country bills sent in for discount or for collection. Tho discount rates on all bills at two, three, and four months' currency are maintained at seven, eight, and nine per cent, respectively. Interest is allowed on deposits lodged at seven days', three, and six months' notice of withdrawal, at the respective rates of three, four, and six per cent. Exchange on England for the present mail rules firm at one per cent, premium, but with littlo de- mand. WOOL. Last week, Messrs. Goldsbrough and Co. offered 337 bales of wool. Only seventy-six bales wetc- quitted. The larger lots wero bought in, but are expected to be sold pri- vately. Messrs. Cuningham and Macredie catalogued 300 bales, of which 100 found pur- chasers. Greasy wools brought OJd. to lOd. ; scoured, 1-lAd. to 23Ad. Shearing"in some of the earlier districts is about to commence, and there is every reason to believe the ensuing clip will be good in every respect. STOCK AND STATIONS. The accounts from the interior of stocks and stations ure of tho most favourable cha- racter. Tho Taramiah Station, in the Mur- rumbidgee district, N.S.W., having a frontage to tho Murray, with 18,500 sheep, the pro- perty of Mr. E. J. Hogg, was sold to Mr. J. C. Whitty, at a satisfactory price-one- third cash, balance on short terms. THE RIVER TRADE. Intelligence from Wentworth states that the Murray and Darling Rivers aro steadily rising, and the Wentworth in the samo ratio' subsiding. The gauge shows 10ft. oin. abovo last summer's level. How long it will take to submerge the town is now tho eiuestion. If the Muiray continues to rise, there is no doubt that the backwater will leave very little of the township dry. An instanco of the two rivers being simultaneously in flood has never been known before, and the result has always been feared. Tho Hay correspondent of the Pastoral Times writes :-" During tho last fortnight we have been visited by quite ' a fleet of steamers. The result of so many steamers bringing up loading here has buen, that the public have been enabled to buy things much cheaper ; for instance-flour, 3Gs. per bag ; best white sugar, Od. per lb. ; potatoes, 15s. per cwt. ; candles, Is. 4d. por lb. ; rice, 5d. per lb. ; and oats, 7s. Gd. per bushel. Tho persons engaged in the steam traffic say that the trade is overdone, and that thoy can do little mote than pay expenses." ' "The Murray steamers," says the Border Post, " aro rapidly getting rid of tho surplus stock of grain and breadstuff's in the Albury district. About 40,000 bushels havo already been purchased by steamboat proprietors and storekeepers for transmission to Melbourne, and it is anticipated that before tho close of the season for river navigation something like 100,000 bushels will have been conveyed to distant markets. " AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS. The Maryborouyh Advertiser says :-" The agricultural prospects of tho year aro very promising, and seem to indicate ,that the coming season will bo as prolific as the past. Indeed, .some of our farmers say that tho growth is too rank, and fear that tho plants will not be able to bear their own weight when they arrive at maturity. Tho crops aro far m oro ad vanced now than thoy were at a corres ponding period last year. The genial showers and intervals of warm sunshine with which wo have been visited, during tho past wook have been very favoufablo to vegetation, "and already the bursting of almond buds show the commencement of spring." VICTORIAN COPPER. Information reached town on Saturday morning, by telegram from the resident manager of the Thomson River Copper-mining Tribu ters'Company.at'the works on the Thom- son River, that tho first reduction of oro to regulus in tho ncwly- erccted furnaces had Decn completed with success. 'The results are merely telegraphed as "good," but more detailed information will probably reach town in the course of the week. The circumstance deserves notice, moro particularly as this is the first effort in copper-mining made in Victoria. OUR COAL-FIELDS. For some weeks past a number of experi- enced English colliers have been' employed in clearing out the old shafts in Bury's section of the Cape Paterson coal-field, and infor- mation reached town on Saturday, to the effect that the mine is now ready for Mr. 'Selvvyn's inspection, and that the shafts show tho 6eams to bo fully equal to all that Mr. Bury has consistently reported as to them for years past. It was from one of the veins here that the large sample, weighing one ton, was brought, and exhibited in the Exhi- bition of 1863. It is stated that Mr. Selwyn will probably proceed to Cape Paterson to examine the mine in the course of the week. VICTORIAN RAILWAYS.- HALT-YEARLY RETURNS. The statement of the revenue and expendi- ture on the Victorian Railways for the half year ending June 30, 1867, has been presented to Parliament. From it we leam that the total mileage run by passenger and goods trains has been 555,654 miles. The total ex- penditure was £131,908, the revenue £258,960, giving a favourable balance of £127,051. Tho items of expenditure are charged as follows : -Maintenance, permanent way, and works, £24,789 ; locomotives, £49,585 ; passenger and goods traffic, £51,444 ; general charges, £0,089. The cost per train per mile was 4s. 8'97d. Tho per-centago of cost to revenue was 50'94, of which 9'57 was for maintenance, &c.;, 19-15 locomotives, 19'87 traffic, and 2'35 general charges. Tho number of passengers was 567,898e, paying £104,056 ; the total received from this source, together with parcels, mails, horses, &c;, being £118,317. The quantity of goods conveyed was 182,257 tons, realising to the revenue £135,802, and £4,840 was received for live stock. The revenue per train per milo was 9s. 3'85d., of which 4s. 3'10d. was from passenger traffic with parcels, mails, &c;, and 5s. 0'75d. from goods and live stock. The maintenance item is made up of wages and stores ; that of locomotives includes engine drivers, cleaners, coal, repairs, &c.; ; to that of passenger traffic £4,102 is chai gea for tho Melbourne station, to that of goods traffic £10,757 on the same account, and the general , charges item includes the offices of the secre- tary, traffic auditors, and traffic superinten- dents. A NEW MONTHLY LINE OP STEAMSHIPS BETWEEN LONDON AND MELBOURNE. Mr. James Lawrence, of Lloyd's-rooms empowered by Messrs. J. H. Harrington and Co., of Billiter-square and Rother hithe, London-has placed in Mr. M'Cul loch's hands an oller to put on the line between Plymouth and Melbourne, via the Cape of Good Hope (both coming and going) a monthly line of steamships, to carry passengers, light freight, and specie, and guaranteed to perform the voyage in forty two days, for a subsidy of £60,000 per annum, with £500 per voyage additional when the run is made within contract time, an equal sum to bo forfeited when the forty-two days aro exceeded. Messrs. Harrington propose that tho contract should be for ten years ¡ and they guarantee to have the first ship of the line (the whole fleet to be built for the service) ready in twelve months from the date of the ratifica- tion of the agreement with them. They state in their letters that the improvements in steamship-building in the last three years have been so many and so great that there is now no difficulty in obtaining a high rate of speed with a small consumption of fuel. The French transatlantic packets average sixteen knots an hour on the run between Havre and New York on ten tons of coal per day. The use of surface condensers, it ap- pears, has almost revolutionised the state of things in the engine-room. We trust that -now that Parliament is unanimous on the subject of encouraging immigration-the pro- posals of Messrs. Harrington and Co. will receive consideration. Mr. Burstall, who went to England in 1803 to endeavour to form a company to place large and powerful steamships on tho route from England to this country, via the Cape, and who returned by the steamship Great Britain, has submitted to the pro- moters of the company in Melbourne a report of his labours in London. It states that he has been unable to form the company, in consequence of the money crises which had succeeded each othor, and other causes ; but that Messrs. Randolph, Elder, and Co., the well-known ship-builders of Glasgow, had offered to build a vessel capable of making the voyage from Plymouth to Melbourne in forty-six days, carrying coals for the voyage, 400 passengers, and a thousand tons of measurement goods. The vessel would cost about £95,000, and her builders would take one-fifth ot her cost in shares. There seems to be no difficulty in obtaining tho necessary capital if a fixed bubsidy per voyage is guaranteed by the Government. THE MELBOURNE AND GEELONG WOOLLEN MILLS. We leam that tho large building now being erected for the Melbourne Woollen Mill Comv pany at Footscray is progressing rapidly, and, should the weather permit, the work will be finished in about a fortnight, so far as regards masonry. The directors have made a personal inspection of the works in pro- gress, and have been thoroughly satisfied. Great progress is made in the works connected with the Victorian Woollen Cloth Manufac- turing Company at Geelong. The machinery already erected is being cleaned and fitted for service. The cylinders of the engine are about to be cased in with patent felt, with an outer covering of polished cedar. The erec- tion of the cloth-drying or tcntring machine has been commenced. A new line of pipes has been laid to the river for the supply of water to the wool-washing machines. The new building is being rapidly finished; the flooring will be laid in another week, and tho roof completed in tlnec weeks from tho pre- sent time. PAPER-MAKING. There is now something liko a certainty that the colony will soon produce its own printing-paper of newspaper and other sizes. Mr. S. Ramsden, the well- known miller, who has interested himself in the subject for some time past, has now purchased the machinery imported by the late Mr. T. Konny, from Messrs. Macfailan and CoT, and has obtained a site for the mill from the Government em- bracing about three acres of land on the Merri Creek, near the Yarra. The erection of the necessary works will be immediately pro- ceeded with. PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE BANK OF VICTORIA. The twenty-ninth half-yearly meeting of the Bank of Victoria has been held. Mr. Henry Miller was in the chair, and read tho following report of the directors and tho balance-sheet : "The board of management of the Bank of Victoria have now to submit their twenty ninth half-yearly report to tho proprietors of the bank stock, togethor with the balance sheet for tho same period, duly certified by the auditors.

The following is the directors' report of the Commercial Bank of Australia for the half, year ending 30th June last: " Tbe directors herewith submit a statement of ac counts for tholr first half- yearly period ; and although tho profit realised is naturally small, thoy venture to bay the position of the bank is decidedly oneourac ing. Notwithstanding tho reduction in the rate of" interest, and tho fact that circumstances havo been very unfavourable ifor the accumulation of deposits by a now institution, theso have steadily in. creased, and now amount to £116,000. The paid-up capital has reached £107,000 ;. and tho directors ant'eipato for tho. bank a gradual advance in public estimation, and'such an Increase of business as will soon justify and render profitable the enlargement of tho capital, by the Issuo of the second instalment of shares. The policy which the board have considered it judicious to follow has in some measure militated , .gainst immediate profit to the shareholders, as a comparatively largo cash reservo has been generally maintained during the past half-year The directors havo, infact, not attempted to extract the maximum of profit out of their resources at the outset as has been done by too many joung institutions, Hltl! disastrous consequences. Tho profits actually mado havo been partly absorbed by tho establishment of branches, not self-supporting at the commencement in addition to the sum set nsldo to cover bad or doubtful debts. Since the last meeting of shareholders a branch has been opened at Ballan (an agricultural district of some extent), and another at St. Kilda ; an agency having been established at Romsey, in connexion with the Lancefield branch. It has also been resolved to open a branch at Sandhurst, where considerable en- couragement has been held out. On the whole, thoro is reason for congratulation at tho present standing and futuro prospect of tho bank; and the result ot the past half-year is, in the opinion of tho board, as satisfactory as could have been reasonably expected.

SOUTHERN INSURANCE COMPANY. The sixth half-yearly meeting of the share- holders of the Southern Insurance Company has been held. The chair was occupied by Mr. S. G. Henty. The accounts set down in the balance-sheet (he stated) were perfectly clear and satisfactory. The secretary (Mr. David Moffat) lead the report, which reminded the shareholders that in the directors' pre- vious report the outstanding losses belonging to the account of 180G wero estimated at £18,000, which amount had subsequently been increased by other unknown losses to £23,302 2s. 5d, This sum, as well as losses on the account of 1807 to the extent of £1,354 15s. 10d., had been paid, and there yet remains to the credit of the underwriting account a balance of £20,798 7s. 7d. The ascertained outstanding losses up to tho 30th of June, and which have not heen settled, are estimated at about £10,000. The re- port congratulated tho shareholders on tho pleasing lesults contained in the balance sheet, and adverted to tho tact that, besides having been able to withstand all th« losses which occurred throughout a very critical period for marine insurance companies, the reserve fund of £35,000 had been held intact, under such favourable circumstances, the directors recommended the payment of a dividend for the half-year at the rate of ten per cent, per annum. The statement of accounts from the 1st of Januaiy to tho 30tU of June, 1S67, showed the revenue of the com- pany to have been £43,80911s. 5d., exclusive of a balance of £5,58910s. 6d. carried forward from December, 1800. The expenditure for the same period (omitting £23.302 2s. 3d. set down for marino losses in 1860) amounted to £26,09619s. 6d. The balance-sheet showed : -Liabilities-Subscribed capital, £453,400; reserve fund, £35,000 ; bills payablo, £7,507 3s.; accounts owing by tho company, £3,196 d3. lid. ; unclaimed dividends, £1018s. ; balance at the credit of revenuo and expenditure account, £20,798 7s. 7d.

On the 6th instant tho half-yearly meeting of the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company was held, the Hon. T. T. A'Bee kett in the chair. The half- yearly report stated that there had been a considerable falling off in the goods and passenger traffic, and that they had every reason to believe that the diminution was exceptional and tcm poiary. The net profits, after paying expenses and interest, were £19,398, and out of this a dividend of seven per cent, was recom- mended, carrying a small ( balance to next half-year. The report was adopted. It was alijo íesolved to send a petition to the Legis- lature, complaining of the unfair opposition of the Sandridge town pier. It was pointed out that it was unfair to support this pier by public money as against private enterprise, and the petitioners proposed that a sufficient rate should be imposed to make that pier self supporting, or that a portion of the wharfage rafes obtained from goods landed at the ratl .say pier should be given to the Hobson's Bay Ballway Company.
