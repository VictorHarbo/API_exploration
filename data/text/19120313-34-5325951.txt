There was no alteration in the price of eggs, as the properly was equal to the demand MeshO,. hills &, Sparrow, in the London area lar dated February 9, sUtc -' The extremely cold weather which we were living when we last wrote did not seem to have any effect on the trade In fact, the weather conditions now do not seem to have the effect on the market that they did a few years back A thaw, set in during the early part of the week, and the are now back again to the spring-like conditions. The market for Danish is firm, and we should not be surprised to see higher mines in the near future. A few hundred casks of Siberian, arrived this week, the quality of which is very good, but the quantity Is NO small that it has little or no effect on the market. From. Australia we have had the Osterley to hand this week, with about 4/.000 boxes, which have met with a ready sale at about the same prices as last week, but occasionally 19 or 20 more in paid for some choice unsalted, which now looks like doing a little better. This unsalted butter has been considerably overdue this season, and it has not commanded any premium whatever over salted, but as the quantities to come are considerably lighter we think it will now go ahead somewhat. Taking the quality all round of this ship- ment it shows a decided improvement on last week's arrival, but it is still below the best standard. There is no new feature in the market, and it certainly looks as if the high prices will prevail to the end of the season. New Zealanders think there has been sufficient trade this week to clear the Ivemeura butters, and agents are doing their best to lever tip prices a little for the Corinthic, which is a few days late, and is expected to dock to-morrow. Conditions of cheese are much about the same. There are still a few sellers who would rather take a little less money than hold on to their cheese for a few days. The position, however, remains strong, and we feel certain that all classes will be wanted at high prices before the reason is finished. Quotations: i- Butter Danish, finest. 134- to 136..

Chicago futures were down tfaj«--e-sixteeiirhs of a penny per cental for May. and were one-eighth of a penny for Jury. It is presumed that the weather is having some effect on future buying in the United States.
