The Aldinua.— It would he superfluous to eulogize the Aldmgaas a fast boat, for that fact is sufficiently established; baton tier late trip from Melbourne she had such severe weather that her reputation as a comfortable vessel in a heavy seaway received additional continuation, for at one period during the passage it blew so terrifically that close-reefed fore- and-aft sails were set, and the engine eased down to quarter speed, yet she made fair headway ami shipped but little water. She left Melbourne at 2 p.m. on Friday with a strong N.W. gale blowing, and at H the same night rounded Cape Otway, but had no sooner done so than the gale increased in violence, and veered from west to north-west with occasional heavy squalls of hail and rain. It is certain from observations that Captain Stewart's barometer and aneroid acted off (.'ape Otway quite in ac cordance with the instruments at our Shipping Reporter's station at Lefevre's Peninsula, where it oscillated from 2-\r- to 2!»'flf, though always with a downward tendency. Throughout Satur day the same boisterous weather predominated, and Sunday was a continuation. Passed the steamer Hayilah off Cape Button, and at !* p.m. was «ff Guichen Bay when the weather had somewhat moderated, but strong N.W. winds prevailed till Monday at midday. At 4.30 received the boarding officers from the Semaphore Jetty, and at 5.30 was in harbour. VKSSKUS IN HAItBOUK. ALDINGA (steamer), 500 tons. J. Stewart, master, from Melbourne. J. Darwent, Town; J.
