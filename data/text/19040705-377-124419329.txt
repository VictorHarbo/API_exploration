It appears that on Tuesday last the vessel struck a reef connected with the Roclkall rock off the coast of England, and, falling back in to deep water, filled. . Three boats were' smashed as they were being launched. Afterwards five others, containing wo men and children, were launched, but only two of them managed to get away from the vessel. A trawling boat re covered one of them, which contained 27 persons, who were landed at Grime by, in England. Possibly the second boat will also be found.
