The total coet, including marine Imurance and all other charges from Sydney, being considerably under one farthing per lb., and the eame in proportion from the other porta. This email cost is not worth con* Bideiation when the difference in value of the wool in hie market is taken into socount, which was fully bo me ont by the result obtained by the large number of woolgrowers who consigned to us by way of Sydney during last season. All wools consigned to us are covered under our marine policy of insurance from the date of the poet mark ot the letter or date of the telegram advising the wool having been sent or about to be sent to our care.' We will, therefore, feel obliged by advices giving us brands and number of bales of wool eent or intended to be sent. This will enable wool-growers at a very small additional expense to realise their clips ot wool in Melbourne, which has been proved to be undoubt edly the best market for growers to realise in, not even excepting London. It will be necessary to advise the Australasian Steam Navigation Company as tbe wool is despatched, in order that they may attend to it on arrival. Freights of wool from tbe other colonies have also been reduced to a minimum rate, and are as follows:— From Tasmania, 6s. per bale for washed or greasy. From South Australia, it. per bale for washed, and 5s. for greasy. Frcm New Zealand, 7s. per bale for washed, and 8a. for greasy. J. H.
