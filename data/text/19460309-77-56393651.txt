Danes Want To Immigrate COPENHAGEN, Denmark AP. Over 4000 Danes are seeking auth- ority to emigrate to the United States, Canada, Latin America and Australia, Helge Lorentzen, chief of the Danish National Emigration Service, said recently. Lorentzen said that while an effort is being made to keep young Danes in Scandinavia and that an inter-Scandinavian workers ex- change agreement has been made between Denmark and Sweden, all help is being given those who sin- cerely desire to make their homes elsewhere.
