INDIGESTION AND ITS DANGERS Indigestion is often looked upon iis a ".mere temporary discomfort, painful while it lasts, but not. sufficiently im portant to worry about. But really, this very common complaint is one of the biggest menaces to health and causes many serious ailments. When the .stomach is upset the whole body is thrown out of gear, and neglect to remedy the cause of the stomach i rouble spells danger.

BEWARE OF RHEUiIATiSSfi Every hour's delay in treating Rheu matism enables the malady to get a firmer hold upon your system. Every time you take unsuitable medicine or employ improper treatment you add to the suil'ering you will endure in the future, for Rheumatism is a progressive ailment. That first twinge of pain may not seem worth making a fuss about, but it is rheumatic pain, and rheumatic pain is a sign that uric acid is settling in your system and your kidneys need attention. It is wise to watch for and beware of the earliest symptoms and then take De Witt's Pills—the remedy that has already proved successful in many thousands of cases. KIDNEY AND BLADDER FILLS These World-Famous Pills do not purge or tjripe or cause pain, and they . contain nothing that can possibly upset the most delicate constitution. ..For tliefo reasons they can be safely given to young children and a<,'ed invalids. Tliey are particularly recommended for use in cases of Bed-wetting, Bladder [nfl- unmation, Scalding Pains, Gravel, Stiffness. Muscular Pain, Joint Pains, ltheu-mntism, Backache, Lumbago, .SV:t alica and other ailments due to Weak Kidneys or an excess of uric acid in your blood. Chemists everywhere sell De Witt's Pills at 3/6 per box, and the directions for use are that two of the pills should be taken with a drink of water just before going to.bed.^ Joseph H. Wilson,' aged 18, an immi grant from Belfast, Ireland, was drown ed while bathing in tho Mary River, near Gunala, Queensland. It is surmis ed ho dived into tho water and struck his head. INDIGESTION?
