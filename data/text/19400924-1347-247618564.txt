Mr. G. Francis (for Jensen) said he had been In Australia before, and had become engaged to an- Australian girl. "In common with the other young men, Jensen has only two months of his articles to serve. They all fear that if they return to Europe they will be Interned In Iceland," said Mr. Francis. "They believe that their service In the ship Is affecting the treatment of their relatives In their countries, which have been occupied by the epejny, and that If they cease to serve as seamen, that treatment will be less severe." The men pleaded guilty, and were sentenoed to six months' imprisonment, pending deportation..
