A Shipping Disaster: Over 700 Lives Lost London, Julv 4. The Danish emigrant steamer Norge, i 3318 tons, has been wrecked, and it is feared that upwards of 750 Scandi navians and Finns, who were aboard of her, including the captain and the bulk of the crew, have been lost. The steamer, which was bound from Copenhagen to New York, struck on Tuesday the reef connected with Rockall Rock, about 600 miles west of the Hebrides. After striking the Norge sank back into deep water in the heavy sea which prevailed, and gradually filled. Three of her boats were smashed in launch ing them. Five others were launched containing mostly women and children, who were given priority, but only two got away from the steamer. A trawl recovered one boat con taining 27 souls, and landed them at Grimsby. Possibly the second boat will be recovered.
