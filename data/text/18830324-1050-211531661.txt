The Queensland Evangelical Standard says : — The heirs of Pope Pius IX. have been unsuccessful in their attempts to obtain from the Italian Government the amount voted for His Holiness, and refused by him. When the Pope lived he, preferred to bo regarded as tlm poor prisoner of the Vatican, and to lay claim on the faithful for his support. He then refused to receive the allowance voted by those whom he regarded as tho spoilers of his temporalities, excommunicated, and called his persecutors. Since his death his heirs have looked on tho amount voted but not received as a personalty, and approached the Government of Italy with a demand for it. This has been in vain, as the representatives of the Pontiff havo been told by the law to which thoy appealed, " that the Pope is dead and the subsidy also."
