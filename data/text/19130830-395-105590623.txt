Arthur made a cutting thrust at the Government in the Houee of He presentatives yesterday. In speaking Oj{ Mr. Andrew Fisher's amendment of cen sure lie referred to the establishment of Labor newspapers at Ballarat and Ben digo, which, he said was the cause of the turning of these great electorates to the Labor Party. He said that the people had asked for the Liberal pro gramme, but were not satisfied new it was produced. The Prime Minister re plied that there was nothing in the Go vernment programme that was not in the Patramatta speech- Mr. Catt interjected that lhe rural workers' log clause was not included. Mr. Arthur, continuing, said thai the action of the Government in at tempting to remove the rural workers from the operation of the Arbitration Act was inviting indus-tiial war. The latter must occur if the worker could not secure a greater share of hie labor. The policy of the Arbitration Act was to bring the units of the industrial world into- asso ciations. so that they could he controlled. This beig so, preference to unionist? should be granted. He warned members of the opposite- side that if rural workers were excluded from the Act- it would lx; fata] to them. He referred to the scan dalous way the Government had acted in connection with the icpeal of the Sugar Excise Bill. The debate was fur ther adjourned and the House rose.
