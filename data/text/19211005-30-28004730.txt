As a result be often acquires a *"Player" being allowed full value for tho i old piano. As Buhler's Pianos have greatly appreciated in value the new instrument costs these buyers rather less than the- actual I price at the. factory. The ditfference need not be paid cash down. Buhler's liberal de ferred payments apply to Player-Pianos just the same as to their other lines. But why exchange a piano at all for a "Player"? There are 50 reasons. The first is that only about 10.000 Aunstralians can play a piano well. Four millions are vir tuosi on Buhler's Players.
