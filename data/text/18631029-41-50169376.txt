(Sugar Coated, in Bottles.) Are you sick, feeble, and complaining.' Are you out of order, with your syteni deranired and your feelings uncomfortable { These symptoms are often the prelude to serious illness. Some fit of illness is creeping upon you. and should be averted by a timely use of the right remedy. Take Ayer's Pills, anu cleanse out the disordered humours purify the Wood, and let the fluids move on un obstructed in health again. They stimulate the functions of the body into vigorous activity, purify ing the system from obstructions which make disease. A cold settles somewhere in the jkkIv, and obstructs its natural functions. These, if not relieved, react upon themselves and the surround ing organs, producing general aggravation, suffer ing, and disease. While in this condition, op pressed by the derangements, take Ayeu's Pills, and see how directly thcv.restore the natural action of the system, anil with it the buoyant feeling of health again. What is true and so apparent in tills trivial and common complaint, is also true in many of the deep-seated and dangerous dis tempers. |The same purgative effects expel them. Caused by similar' obstructions and derangement of the natural functions of the body, they are rapidly, and many of them surely, cured by the same means. None who know the virtues of these Pills will neglect to employ them when suffering from the disorders they cure, such as Bilious Diseases Rheumatism Dyspepsia Liver Complaint Headache Gout Eruptions Erysipelas Salt Rheum Jaundice CoBtiveness Worms Foul Stomach Skin Diseases Piles Neuralgia &c;, &c;, &c.; As a dinner Pill, they are both agreeable and effectual, and, being sugar-coated, are peculiarly adapted for women ami children. They are free from mercury or other mineral substance, and composed entirely of vegetable matter. AYER'S SARSAPARILLA, for Purifying the Blood. and for the speedy cure of the following com plaints:— SCROFULA and SCROFULOUS AFFECTIONS, such as TUMOURS, ULCERS, SORES. ERUPTIONS. PIMPLES, PUSTULES, BLOTCHES, BOILS, BLAINS, AND ALL SKIN DISEASES. With corrupt, disordered, or vitiated blood you must be sick all over. It may burst out in pimples, sores, or in some active disease, or it may merely keep you listless, depressed, and good for nothing. But you cannot have good health while your blood is impure. AYER'S SARSAPARILLA PURGES OUT THESE IMPURITIES, and stimulates the organs of life into vigorous action, restoring the health, and expelling disease. Hence it rapidly cures a variety of complaints which are caused by impurity of the blood, such as SCROFULA or KING'S EVIL, TUMOURS, ULCERS. SORES, ERUPTIONS, PIMPLES, BLOTCHES. BOILS, ST. ANTHONY'S FIRE, ROSE OR ERYSIPELAS, TETTER OR SALT RHEUM, SCALD HEAD, RINGWORM, CANCER. OI CANCEROUS TUMOURS. SORE EYES, FEMALE DISEASE. It is also especially useful in the cure of CHRONIC RHEUMATISM, caused by the sudden stoppage of the organs o perspiration in this variable climate, LIVER COMPLAINTS and HEART DISEASES also fur that formidable complaint ENLARGEMENT OF THE LIVER. And as the COMPOUND CONCENTRATED EXTRACT OI SARSAPARILLA, PREPARED BY DR. J. C. AYER, , contains the active principle of the celebrated ant well known specific, , PODO PH YLLIN, it is especially recommended for all Diseases of tin Liver. The Proprietors being desirous of securini the confidence of the medical men and the profes ' sion for this invaluable compound, as one of thi best alteratives in use, have instructed thei General Agent to furnish, on personal or writtei application, the formula by which it is prepared thus affording the best guarantee of its being th ? most perfect, valuable, and effectual remedy eve offered to the public AYER'S CHERRY PECTORAL, ' for the rapid Cure of COUGHS, COLDS. HOARSENESS. BRONCHITIS. WHOOPING , COUGH, ? CROUP, ASTHMA, and CONSUMPTION. This is a remedy so universally known to surpas any other for the cure of throat and lung com 1 plaints, that it is useless here to publish th ? evidence of its virtues. Its unrivalled excellenc for coughs and colds, and its truly wonderfn ? cure3 of pulmonary disease, have made it know: ? throughout the civilized nations of the earth. Fei are the communities or even families among then who have not some personal experience of it ' effects— some living trophy in their midst of it t victory over the subtle and dangerous disorders o 1 the throat and lungs. As all know the dreadfi 1 fatality of these disorders, and as they know, toe 3 the eilects of this remedy, we need not do moi than assutd them that it has now all the virtue that it did hare when making the cures whic . have won so strongly upon the confidence of mat kind.
