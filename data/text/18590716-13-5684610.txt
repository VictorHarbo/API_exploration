SUMMARY FOR ENGLAND. THE COLONY OF VICTORIA. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's steamship Nor- tham will sail early on Monday morning, with the mails for Europe and the East. The Benan?s sailed on the 18 th June, with the Australian June mails. In the present instance, as in the last, the course of post has been maintained. On both occasions the Marseilles portion of the mails has been delivered here in 50 days. Nine days have been allowed for the perusal of, and replying to, ad- vices, and, allowing 50 days for the run home, these replies will be received in 110 days. Thus a course of post has been secured occupying in time less than four months by about ten days. The punctual arrival of the Northam last month, and of the Salsette this month, has given great satisfaction to the Australian colonies, and has tended in some measure to restore confidence in the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which had been shaken by the mis- adventure of their purchased vessel, the Columbian. This steamer had been uniformly behind the time on this station under the old contract, and should not have been purchased for re- employment on it by the new con- tractors. Although an European war had been felt for some months to be inevitable, the intelligence that it had actually broken out has caused intense excitement throughout the Australian colonies The comparative defenceless condition of our ports and harbors, and the mone- tary wealth to be found in their imme- diate vicinity, point to the capitals of the Australian colonies (and to Mel- bourne more especially), as the most probable spots to be selected by an enemy as points of attack, where much might be gained by an enemy, and much damage inflicted, with very little risk. It is satisfactory that the re- sult of this excitement will be the placing of our defences on a footing which shall render them more worthy of the name than those at present ex- isting. The feeling of the colonists towards the mother country is one of the most undoubted loyalty. It is hoped, but not believed, that Great Britain will preserve the neutrality she has proclaimed. When the time shall arrive at which she must take part in the struggle, the Australian colonists will do their part, within their own boundaries, towards maintaining the integrity of the Empire. Wc resume our monthly history of the progress of the colony of Victoria. POLITICAL. Parliament lins been again prorogued until Hie 10th of August, when a dissolution is expected to take place, and a new Assembly will bo elected on the basis of manhood ¡.uffrage. Much severe comment 1ms been occasioned by a transaction in which Mr. Henry Miller, Com- missioner of Trade mid Customs, lins suitained a prominent part. The circumstance:) as do tailed by Messrs. Vaughan and Wild, money brokers and estato agent*, of this city, are these ¡-These gentlemen negotiated certain advances from tho Lank of Victoria (of which institution Mr. Miller is tlio chairman) on behalf of Messrs. Cornish and Druco, who have taken tho Government contract for the construction of the Melbourne and Murray Pivot- Railway, Messrs. Vaughan and Wild depositing with tim jlanh certain secui itics belonging to ami on be- half of then- i-lionts. The latter having made sonio fresh ¡irr.ingoiucntR for obtaining accommo- dation thiongli another chnnnol, Messrs. Vaughan and Wild mado application to ino Hank of Victoria for a restitution of tlio securities, and wero informed that thoy had boon taken possession of by Mr. Miller, and it is understood tlii't thoy had li"on deposited «dhan association recently established by that gentleman, ivliicli association would reap the benefit of tlio commission previously accruing to tlio agents nanioil above. Tho w liol j circum sLinces will be brought to light in a court of justice, and that feature of t'io case which lino »revolted general reprehension is tho complicity .of a Minister of tlio Cronn in a transaction of so equivocal a character. The intelligence of war baling broken out in Eurone gave rise to considerable excitement in this city, und throughout the colony. Tho news did not st-ii-tio ni, became the ovent liad been regarded for some timo past as imminent ; but the iiiniored oxi.itenco of a scciet treaty between Trunco and Russia, tho popular distrust in tho Hiiccrily of Louis Napoleon's professions of anxiety for the independence of Italy, and the prevalent disbelief in England's abi- lity to maintain the position of neutrality she has assumed, combined to inspire a feel ¡nç of uneasiness in the public mind which »irritated hy the knowledge that New Caledonia has very recently been mado tho chief naval station of tho French in llio South Pacific, mid has been placed under the command of a Oovcr norviho served in the Crimea. Our defenceless con- dition- a Ulomo upon which a great deal has been «ritten and spoken for many months past-once moro became tho leading topic of discussion. Let- ters calling upon the Government to tako prompt and efficient measures for the protection of Port riullip from aggression, poured in upon tlio daily papers, and a requisition calling upon tho Mayor el Melbourno to convene a public mooting re- cen ed the signatures of some of our lending citizens, and was acted upon. Tho Mechanics' Inslitute and its approaches wore so crowded that ¡t «as found necessary to adjourn the assemblage w the Exhibition Building. Considerable enthu- siasm and unusual unanimity characteiised tlio proceedings, and a Committee was ap- pointed to prepare a-idresscs to Her Majesty the Queen nn-f His Excellency tho Governor relative to the question of dofentcs, The former document implored Her Majesty to sond us without delay such assistance of .vessels of war and warlike munitions as might bo sufficient for the protection of our commerce, and for the maintenance of tho intorest, the honor, and the stability of tho empire" Tho momorial to His Excellency urged upon him " tho absolute neces- sity of calling Parliament togothor, principally for the purpose of adopting such measures as might be deemed suitable to tlio present emer- gency." A deputation wor appointed to wait upon the Governor with these documents, and the interview toole place on Thursday last, the Chief Secretary being present. After receiving tho memorials, His Excellency road the following \- "Mr. Mayor, and Gentlcmon, "Although Great Britain, by tho latest ac- counts, was at peaco with hil the world, and our Sovereign had proclaimed strict neutrality in respect to the war which had unhappily broken out in Italy, I am not sorry, to find the citizens of Melbourno roused once moro by tho tidings of that war to a senso of tho risks to which they aro constantly exposed in tlio unfortified stato of thoir port'; and, whilst deprecating needless panic, I sincerely trust that thoy will not rest satisfied this time until Parliament has voted the requisite funds, and Government expended them in the erection of proper défonces. _ "For my own part, I havo never lost sight ot this object, and no sooner was the report of tho Commission which I appointed a year ago to devise tho best mode of proceeding sent to me, than I transmitted it for the consideration of tho Imperial- Govornmont; and when afterwards a sum of nionoy granted by Parliament towards carrying out the recommendations of tho Com- missioners and a plan for the expenditure>of tho grant, drawn up by Captain Pasley, R.B., was sanctioned by my advisers, I lost not a, moment in sending home an order for half tho heavy ordnance, small arms, and ammunition recoiii monded in the report (that being all the amount remitted was estimated to cover), and by this timo I hopn the supplies thus ordered are at sea on their way to the colony. " Pending their in-rival, however, I am happy to inform you that our harbors will not be in so defenceless a condition as supposed, since, besides the small batteries erected in Hobson's Bay, tho prosonco of 1I.M.C. war steamer Vic- toria, and the aid derivable from U.M. 40th Regiment, nnd tho several Volunteer Corps, a powerful ship of war maydaily bo expected. " Long beforo the recent outbreak of hostilities in Europe, the Imperial Government-partly no doubt in deference to the continual representa- tions mado by myself and follow Governors as to tlio necessity of increased naval protection-had taken steps to reinforce the squadron on this station ; and previously to tho arrival of tho lato news I liad arranged with Commodore Loring to detach tho steam corvetto Pelorus, 21 guns, and 400-liorso power, with orders to make Port Phillip her head-quarters, tho Ministry undertaking to proposo a vote for the usual colonial allowanco to officers and men. "Sinco the mail carno in I have written to ask further that H.M. steamship Niger may be sent on hither when she roaches Sydnoy -, but even should it not bo in the power of the Com- | inodoro to comply with this latter request, I feel confidont that with tile 'force which will shortly bo at In's disposal, ho would bo able', in the event of a maritime war extending to these seas, to keep so many' vessels cruising backwards and forwards on tho homeward track of the gold ships as to protect our export trade. ' Let mo add likewiso that subsequently to the mail's ' arrival I hive, in concert with the major general commauding, taken steps for immediately increasing tho military stores, and, if possible, strengthening tho garrison, and have reappointed, under General Macarthur'« presidency, tho mili- tary and naval members or tlio formoi- Defence Commission, to consider how its recommendations may, under present circumstances, ha most speedily carried into effect. " Tlicir attention has already boen directed to the wonderful improvements introduced into the construction of artillery sinco tho date of tlicir report; whereby tho question of fortifying the entrance to Port Phillip Bay has been made to assume a new aspect, and it is probable that at their suggestion I shall forthwith bespeak a suf- ficient number of the'new Armstrong guns to render tho Heads impregnable. " Nor havo tho Commissioners overlooked tho necessity of organising and training a consider- able body of volunteers, until such timo as Par- liament can pass a permanent Militia Bill. The suggestions thoy may make on this point will bo promptly acted upon ; and as full power is given to tho Governor, -by tho l8 Viet., No. 7, not merely to enrol, regulate, and pay such a force, but, in case of imminent danger, to vender it nmanablo to tho English Mut'uiy Act and Articles of War-all that is needed can fortunately bo dono without the intervention of Parliament, which, as you aro aware, could not bo obtained till after a dissolution of tho present House of Assembly " On that point I will only say I have reason to believe that my advisers aro as fully impretflod ns myself with ' the expediency, in the present grave aspect of foreign affairs, of lotting tho several elections tako placo ¡is soon as practi- cable ; and, nieaiiwhilo, they will bo prepared to ninnie the responsibility of any outlay abso- lutely required for defensive purposes. "I will only, in conclusion, iissuro you, that should such n crisis as is anticipated arise, I shall, as head of tiio Executive Government, dihi'hurga tho duties dovolving on me to tho best of my judgment and ability ; and, whilst I trust thai, llio people of this country would unito to n man for the defence of thoir hearth* and homes, you may roly upon it thal I shall not fail, when transmitting tho address to the Queen which you have ontrusled to my care, to urgo, in ac- cordance with its prayer, that all the aid and pro- tection consistent with llio safety of the rent of the vost ompiro which Her Majesty rules may be accorded to lilis viiluablo and important portion of it." A lengthened conversation ensued, in the course of winch His Excellency stated that the Homo Government had been written to wi'li reference to tlio defences, and that an oiliccr of, tho Royal Engineers would bo sont out to superintend tho defensive works of the colony, provided the ex- penso wero borno by ourselves ; that military stores had boen ordered from Hobart Town ; tluit Major-Gcncr.il Macarthur had prepared a new plan for the dofenco of tho colony ; and that tho dangers to lie apprehended from the contiguity of thu naval.sqiiadi-ûii at New Caledonia lind boen exaggerated, the Fronen forco stationed thero being smnller than was generally supposed. His Excellency declined calling Parliament together, as that course was open to several legal objections ; moreover, ho would feel justified in taking any steps which might bo necessary at tho present juncture, willi the advice of his Ministry, and without convening Iho Lpgishitm-o. Tho Chief Secretary observed that by llio Vo- lunteer Act power was given to embody a mili! in foreo of 2,0l)0, which might, in nu extremity, be doubled ; and that tlio Government lind done all in its power to placo various parts of tlio colony in a state host calculated to repel any aggression of hostilo Powers. The statements made by His Excellency the Governer and the Chief Secretary appeared to be accpted as satisfactory by the deputa- tion, and to have been well rescued by the public. Our present meium of defence and offence consist of a couple of batteries and a block ship at the entrance of the Bay, the Victoria steam sloop, four companies of infantry, an ar- tillery and yeomanry corps, and two or three-rifle brigades, while other associations of the last- named character are in courso of organisation. The entrance to the port is of an intricate and dangerous character, and might be rendered stillonderrd still more so, if timely warning were given of the ap- proach of a hostile squadron ; while a land force, without cavalry, and without artillery, would stand very little chance of obtaining or retainmT a footing. THE GOLD FIELDS. It has been long foreseen by a few persons acquainted with the gold-/ieldn, and observant of what has taken place upon Hiern during tho last five or Bix years, that mining must bo conducted systematically, and over a great extent of auriferous country, and on tho partinlly-worltod fields on nn extensive scale, if this pursuit is to bo as profitable as it ought to be, and at tho same time to bo attended with certainty. ' This conviction has boen gradually forcing itself on tho minds of capitalists, and tho events of tho last few wcoks havo directed attention moro than ever to this subject, tho necessary result of which must be the inauguration of many new companies and associations. Within that period better and moro powerful machinery than was in use beforo has boen set in operation hy two or threo well organised companies with abundant capita! nn-J a sufheient extent of ground to occupy them for several years; and to this cairne the rather startling rise in the value of Bendigo Waterworks Company's shares is said to bo attributable. Judging from tho results heretofore obtained with very rude machinery on tho samo ground which this company is, »bout to work, tho ¡ returns havo been estimated by tho diredo« nt ! a high ligure, Tha «arefceuuart causad; by dUc, .sudden riso in tbo valuó of tlio only shares before tbo public lins stimulated inquiry, mid it may bo hoped tlut full particulars of the operations of this and evory othor enterprise of a similar character will bo periodically published. There has been considerable speculation in tlio shares of this company, and tlio. Argus Flat ' Company has boon quoted in justification. In this company, the scene ot whose operations is in tho Castlemaine district, tho shares vvoro only 101. each, and theso havo beeiisoltlas high as 160/., -oven after a large portion of tho ground, only throo acres at tlio first, had been worked out. There aro but fow of tl:o30 si a-es, and thoy have been always hclel by working-men and persons in the ¡inmediato neigh- borhood of tho Companys ground. It will be satisfactory if tho various companies now being started prove in their working that an extensive oponing exists for tho profitable employment of capital on tho gold-fields. This result will bo certain if economy and judgment aro employed in the direction of affairs.. No alluvial diggings of any very great import- ance have boen oponed np within t.io last fow weeks. Discoveries of nsw ground thorn have been, and some of this is tolerably rich, but none of the new diggings havo yet proved to bo of any great extent. As usual, we rood of now quaite veefs being taken up overy day, and many of ? thcso uro stumbled . on by tho merest occident. Ono near Pleasant Creek, and supposed from the superficial indications tobo far richer than any now worked there, although much of the best quartz from thore yiclils gold in tho proportion of 8oz. to tho ton, was lately found by a shepherd, who, while tending his Hook, thoughtlessly kicked away a tuft of moss ; and perceivimr somo quartz beneath whoro it lay, had tho curiosity to toko up somo pieces, which he found to bo thickly studded with- hold. This reef crops out on the surface, and sinco it has boon marked off in claims, mid speci- mens obtained from different parts, it has been declared to bo by far tho richest in a district famous for tho yield of its reefs. Wo havo moro than onco had reason to refer to a number of reefs discovered not long since in another part of tho country, near Boody Creek, and to point out tlio loss lo the miners thero, und to tho country at largo, from the insufficiency of tho machinery within their reach. There is but one crushing-mill, of littlo power,in thodistrict, and this could bo kept nt constant work with the quartz from ono or two claims, so thal the owner of tho mill in trying to divide his favors equally can only crush a fow tons now and again fir oach pnrty. But this state of things is of frequont occurrence, and a recently-published statoment of tho actual returns from a claim on'one of theso reefs would seem to indicate an unusual degreo of blindness or stu- pidity in somo direction. During the Inst three months 482 tons ' of quartz havo beon raised ( from this claim, of which only 182 tons havo boen crushed, at long intervals of time, the producá of tho gold from thin smaller quantity, at the averngo yield of Kioz. Cdwt. 3gr. to the ton, amounting to no less than 10,095/. and. some ¡.hillings, leaving a clear profit to the owners, after paying all expenses, of 8,511/. But with sufficient crushing power nt hand, lho profit might havo been trebled or quadrupled within tho same space of time; and this claim is not oven ono of the richest in tho district. Last week ono ma- chino was engaged in crushing quarto from another claim thal was yielding between 35 and ?10 ox. to tho ton, tho lowest yiold from this claim nt any time previously having been 24oz. totbo ton. It would not require tho produce of many days' work in crushing such stono as this to pay the cost of tho machino, yet this want has boon severely felt for the last threo months. Tho reason for this hesitation > and delay in supplying machinery is to bo found in. tho dearly-bought' experience of many persons in tho early days of tho gold-fields, when there was much ignorance and credulity on tho subject ; but it is only from a censurablo excess of caution that such quartz can now bo suffered to, lio uncrushed within 40 miles of Molbourno. AGltlCUTiTtrKE. The want of min in the curly part of the autumn prevented many of the farmers from commencing to plough ns soon i_ they otherwise would havo done, but no time has been lost sinco the first decided break In the weather. A great breadth of land has been already sown, and tho young crops uro in a moat promising condition, and quite as forward ns thoy ought to bo; indeed, it is the universal remark that thoy never lookod better at this season. Sinco the first appearance of tho braird above ground the growth has been rapid and unchecked, nnd in nil parts of lho country tho young plants present tho sanie ap- pearance of hciilthy luxuriance. In tho principal agricultural districts through tho gold-fields much now land has been already broken up, and tho farmers aro still turning over more, so that tho increased acreago under crop will mo'.t likely be still greater than it was last year. 1/itllc stimulus was noeded by thoso near the markets of tho interior, who still find farming to pay thom well, whatever complaints as to low prices may be heard in unfiivorablj-situated districts; but the lato advance in tho price of wheat has no doubt tended to cause a little extra exer- tion, and wo may look for an increased produc- tion of this grain at next harvest, instead of the fallinqf- nff shown by the returns of hist. The causes which last year led to the great increase in the growth of hay mid oats, to the exclusion of wheat, do not now exist. Horse-corn and fodder li.ive again assumed their legitimate value relatively to that of brcrid-stufls, so thcso will command their due share of attention from (ho farmer «gain, and the colony will for à whilo make rapid strides towards supplying tho con- sumption of its inhabitants. Instead of seeing rieh now land subjected to lho rather anomalous treatment of being sown with oats when first turned up, most of this will have again to boar tho nobler grain until it begins to show unmistiikiible symptoms of the neces- sity for a chango, when it will bo sown with oats for a your or two, and then set apart for tim growth of hay, in tho regular courso of colonial farming, which lins been reversed in many places of lato years, in conséquence of horso-provender being of more valuo than food for mun. Tn lim newly-tilled portions of the country this inexpensive and, for a while, pro- fitable sybtem of funning will bo followed ; butin the longcr-srttled portions moro correct ideas aro slowly but steadily gaining ground, mid grass seeds, clover, mangold wurtzel, sorghum, bone dust, nnd gur.no aro coming more into requisition oich year. During tin last month or two tho only public events of especial importance to the agricultural world h.ivo bc.-n tho ploughing matches held in nil paris of the country; and these have been many in number, and havo been got up and supported in a most spirited manner. In n few clays thero is to be a final trial of skill nt the champion mitch of the year, nmong the prize takers nt the several matches in tlio districts around Melbourne, and in connection with the Port Phillip Farmers' Society. Attention is now being directed to, and prepa- rations have commenced for, this society's annual spring show of stock and implements, which was exceedingly good hist year, but which will be batter this ; at least, bo much may be said without much risk ns to tlio truth of the prediction. The show is to be held at Melbourne within a day or two of the time fixed for the mo-,t important race meeting ever proposed in tho colonies, when tho Aus- tralian Champion Sweepstakes arc to bo run for by the best horses of New South Wales. South Australia, Tasinniiin, New Zealand, and Victoria, the event to be decided on the Molbourno course. On snell an occasion tl-.e town will bo crammed with visitors from nil these colonies, nnd from nil parts of our own, most of whom will gladly avail themselves of tho opportunity of seeing oin- best stock coUcetcil in tho show-yard. Tims our breeders mid importers will havo more than ordi- nary motives for exertion, in petting their stock into good condition and bringing thom forward; and the noddy will not be backward in offering every inducement on thoir part by giving larger prizes and affjrding increased accommodation. Foi- somo years back we havo had good cause to be proud of thoso animal gatherings, but, as fai- ns can be foreseen nt present, the coining exhibi- tion will miieli excel any yet held in tho southern hemisphere, both in the quantity nnd quality of clio stock entered. AMUSEMENTS. Mr. Brooko's now manngoment of tho Theatre Royal continues to be attended with signal suc- cess. Tlio special novelty of the month has been the revivid of the spectacular píceo of "Aznel," which was placed upo» the stage with a complete- ness which speaks well for tho liberal spirit which governs this establishment. In addi- tion, Mr. . Brooke has appeared with the lïiost unimpaired Eucecss in bohío oí his best stock characters, both in tho high urama, ami also in the lighter HiUwiJnn special- ties. TttQ ktrat production, fe, Brjurxicqult's, comedy of "Love in a Maz:," lyhich is now " running." Tho Princc33's has boon closed for about n fortnight, and was opened tho other evening, with a modified company, including the name of Miss Provost, who has returned from Syd- ney, where sho has boen engaged some months. The drama, of " Camille, in which Miss Provost is so well kriorni to -ex- cel, was the, opening piece. Tho com- pany has among it also Mr. Rayner, Mr. Tom Fawcett, Mr. Graham, Mr. Birch, and Mr. AVobster, besides Mr. G. Fawcett, the manager. Tho ladies' list has been strengthened by tho ad- dition of the name of Mrs. Howard, who also is from Sydney. . * ' Tho Olympic Theatre ro opened on the 20th ult., with a very excellent comedy company, in- cluding Messrs. Rogers, F. und R. Younge, Milno, Seailo, Russell, and others; and Mesdames F. Youugo, Bellair, Dunn, Fanny Young, ku. Mr. Falconer's now comedy of " Extremes" was the opening piece, and it was given with much completeness, not only as to the acting, but in respect of genenil getting up. This piece was succeeded by the burlesquo of " Mazeppa ;" and for tho last fortnight Mr. Hudson has been fulfilling an engagement at this establishment. In musical matters thero is not much novelty to record. Mr. Boulanger gave a concert tho1 othev evening, at Ilockins Rooms: and Mr. Far- quharson has returned from India. Ho sang, a fow nights ago, a new Australian national song, by Mr. S. Nelson. The Philharmonie Society aro aili gently engaged rehearsing for the Handel Cen- tenary Festival, which is to take place during tho ensuing month. Tho nippodromo continues to secure good audiences. Tho attractions 'have boon in- creased by tho addition of Mr. Worrell, the clown. . , . Wo have to record, with tho deepest'sorrow, tho death of Mrs. Mortyn. This melancholy event took placo on tho 22nd of last month. In her tho stage has suffered an irroparahlo loss, i and the regleta which followed this accom I pushed actress to tho tomb wore -doop and universal. Nor has the respect felt for hor been confined to a merely verbal expres- sion. Performances have boen given Both at tho Theatre Royal and at the Olympic in 'aid of the children and mother of thodecoased lady. Tho attendances upon these oooasions,.espBoially that at tho first-named establishment, wero over- flowing, and a handsome sum is believed 'to have been realised. COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. Sinco our lost Summary, the second quarter of the year has been completed, and the mentis havo been afforded of instituting comparisons of the present state of our finances und of trado and commerce with previous years. Commencing with the gold-fields, from which our principal sources of wealth ' aro derived, wo find that thoy have ylcldod, according to the escort returns, l,074,8G3oz. for tho first half of 1850, against l,133,lGGoz. for tho first half of 1858, showing a fulling off of 58,30 loz. Theso returns do not lepresent the entire yield, many small parcols being brought dow n by tho coaches from thoso districts which aro w ithin ono day's journey of the metropolis, but they give a very fair in- dication of tho actual production. Tho nvorago weekly quantity brought down during the quarter just ended has beon 44,-117 ounces. ' I'lio deficiency of 58,301 ounces is therefore equal to about tho yield of an average week, and one-third of tho present production. The average of the year 1857 was 47,070 ouncas ; and of 1S38, 4*4,841 ounces. Tho average of tho first quarter of bust ' yoar was 41,923 ounces, against 41,983 ouneos for tho first quarter of this year ; and of the second quarter 45,200 ounces against 44,417 ounces for the quarter just ended. The shipments for tho first six months of tho year were 1,107,002 ounces ; ov, 40 tons 17cwt. 2qr. 51b. 2oz. troy, of the value, at £4 per.ounce, of £-1,788,2-18. During tho first half-year of 1858, the shipments amounted to l,277,568o¿. ; or, 53 tons 4cwt. 2qr. 141b. troy, of tho value, at the samo rate, of £5,110,272. For the purpose of affording a fuller comparison, wo subjoin a state- ment of the escorts and shipments for the first halves of the yoare 1834-5-G-7 : 1851\. - 185S. - 1850. 1857.

The quanti- ties brought in this ovoning amounted to 41,108 ounces, bringing tlio total for tho year up to 1,221,505 ounces. In the following table a detailed statement is given of the quantities brought down weekly by escort for tho threo months ending on Saturday hist. It will bo seen that the totals have fluctu- ated but little, and that the gross totil of the current year boars favorable comparison with that of tho corresponding threo months of 1S38. At tho present time thero are, and throughout llio year thero havo boen, fewer hands employed directly in mining pursuits than during the samo period of la«t year. No inconsiderable portion of tho bono ¡nid muscio, of the gold-fields has been diverted to other pursuits, and their place has not boon supplied by immigration. At the samo timo machinery has boen introduced in greater relativo proportion than the deoreasa of ¡abor, and for this circumstuneo wo arc indebted in no small degree to tho present increase in tho escort returns. In tho following tablo the quantities brought by escort from all the gold- fields aro given for 13 weeks.

The gold mai-kot has boon -subjected to unusual fluctuations during tho month, in conse- quent of tho frequent changes in the money market, and moro especially thoso affecting ex- change on England.

The rates of dis- count had been lowered previously to the arrival of the mail, and have been raised since to the old rate. On tha 27th of June the six banks acting together in the matter of the Government Railway Loan announced their intention not to allow interest on current accounts and on depo- sits at call after the termination of the quar- ter about to cease. The banks participating in this movement were the Bank of Austra- lasia, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of New South Wales, the London Chartered Bank of Australia, the Bank of Victoria, and the Colonial Bank of Australia. At the same time they announced a reduction of 1 per cent. in their rate of discount for bills of from three to four months' currency. The National Bank of Au- stralasia joined in tiio movement on the follow in" day. Tho wai- njws by the mail steamer was telegraphed on the Gth instant, and immediately a meeting of the directors of thaea banks was called. A second meeting was held after tho deliver}' of tlio niii'is, and the result waa made known on tlio 11th instant. In the m:an timo tlio Oriental Bank, and the English, Scot- tish, and Australian Chartered Bunk had raijiid their rates of interest, and tho Colonial Bank ha 1 seceded from the movement. The five banks previously mentioned announced their mten iou of allowing the following rates per annum fol- lín future :. On suiiiä deposited, .subject to threo months' notice of withdrawal, 4 per cent. ; and on 3-.ims 'deposited, subject to sW months' notico, 5 per cent. The rates of discount wero also raised, on bills not oxeocding 05 days'cur- rency, to 8 per cent, peruinniuii ; and on bills oxceedings 05 days, and not having more, than 125 days' currency, to 9 per cont. per annum. In this latter movement all tho banks havo sinco joined. Tho Oriental Bank, and the English, Scottish, an-1 Australian Chaitoi-ed Balik allow interest on tho daily hshineo of current accounts at 3 per cent, per annum, and about Í per cent, higher ratos on deposits at call on notice. On sums deposited for 12 months they allow G per cent. In accordance with recent alterations, the rates of exchange now stand at '¿\ premium for GO days sight for largo amounts, and '¿.{ per cent, premium for 30 days' sight for bills under £50. Freight on gold by sailing-vessels is from 2¿tl. to 3d. per ounco, deliverable in London ; insurance, J j¡ per cent. By the overland route tho freight to the Bank ot England, including transit du tv, is 1 per cent. ; insurance, U per cent. To Mauritius and India, 1 percent pre- mium, insurance, 1J per cant. Outsido tho banks there has been a steady ib mand for money on tho mortgage of freeh-ihl properties. The rat03 ruling for this kind of in- vestment may be quoted nt from 10 to 1" per cent., according to ¡he improving character of tlio neighborhood in which tho properties are located, and tho amount of margin between tho values mid the sums required to bo advanced. Speeio has boon exported to England in very largo quantities. ' Sinco our last summary £228,202 in British sovereigns have boon cleared out, while tho imports have boon altogether in- significant. If this drain continuo tha banks will reqniro to coin lavgoly at tho Sydney branch of the Royal Mint, to enable thom to keep up tho reserves required by law in proportion to their issues of notes. Tho revenues of tho colony, as exhibited by tlio Government returns for tho year and quarter ending the 30th of Juno, point to the present etato of the colony as statioiiiry rather than pro- gressive. There has not been any falliiig-off un- explained by tho cii-eumstnii'-es of tho day ; but there has not boen nny increase Immigra- tion has fallen off, and during the last quarter of 1S5S and tho first of. 1850 tho built of tho towns' population «as not in full empby.lient, .nid tha miner i wai e not reaping an average yield. Habits of greater economy wore in consequence forced on all classes. The railway works li'ivo sinco afforded profitable occupation for largo numbers, and of lato consumption is on tlio increase., The usual, quarterly statements of the revenue'and expenditure) for thu quarter are iligcifcd thus in tho Government Ca:c'tc of tho Sth inst : - Rovcnuo fordinary), £858,853 ]3s. 9d, ; repay- ments, £2,841 in. 3d. ; npccinl aceounifc, £3,077,777 7s. 9d. ; special funds, £258,579 17s.

Total, £j,0S!),03j 13s. 3.1. Tlio special accounts require soino explanation. Thoy include, both in rovenuo and expenditure, the whole value of tho Railway Debentures trans- mitted to England, as well as tho advances inado by the banks m anticipation of thoir realisation. In the comparative statements of revenue for the year and the quarter, a table of which wo subjoin (omitting fractions), wa find a net increaso on the quarter of £71,525. and a net decrease on the year of £190,091. Tho ordinary rovenuo of the past quarter amounted to £85S,853 13s. 9d., against £787,328 4s. for tho corresponding quar- ter of 1858. For tho year ending the 30th June, ¿ho ordinary rovenuo amounted to £3,0"2,790 11s. !3d., against £-1,223,484 13s. Id. for the year ending the 30th of June, 1S58. In comparing tho rovenuo of tho quarters wo S-jhI a docroaso hi th© Customs of £12,003 ; it\ tito department of t;he gold-Mdä of £1,310 j «klWtj.aiiil.luvt.bojs.ci I £240 ; nnd in fees of Courts of Iiaw of £1,923. There'was an mercase in tho revenue derived from tho salo of Crown hinds of £4S,578 ; in that for licences of _l,b-6* ; postage of £2,551 ; fines and forfeitures of £2JO; and miscellaneous of £34,91G. The balance of Inereaso over decrease was -£71,52-5. -The comparison- of tho years shows a decline in the Customs revenue- of £8,8-12 ; on that' for gold of £12,761 ; in the sale of Crown lands of £3157,012 ; in feos of Courts of law of £1,023; in lines aud forfeitures of, £3,0f>5. Thero,was nil increase in ports and harbors of £214 ; in licences of £8,004 ; in post ngo of £11.430; and in mihcellnncous ¡toms of £32,831. Tho balance on the year of dcereaso over increase was £190,094. These items do not indicate any great fluctuations in the revenue from any other source than that derived from Um silo of Crown lands. Tho revenues gene- rally have boen stationary-if anything, decreas- ing rather than! increasing with the additions to the population.

Speculation has been activa in small matters, and alorgor quantity of general nierchntt- , diso has changed hands than is usual at this Benson of tito year. Should the next mail bring news conducive to the conclusion that tha nail- ' trality of Great Britain cannot bo preserved, tha ' immediate effect will be a íupid rise in the prices of all articles of genei-.il consumption. It is felt, however, that under any circumstances the carrying trade of the seas will bo open to the Unitod States, through whoso mercantile navy our wants will he supplied, after the first disruption, with tolorable certainty and re- gularity. As regards the internal condition of trade, it may bo pronounced healthy. There has not been thnt rash spirit of speculation observ ablo w-Iiich has characterised fo.-mcr years.
