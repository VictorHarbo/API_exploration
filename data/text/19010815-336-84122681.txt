Whey>apparently cannot see that the Government is adopting the easiest and iairest way of imposing a land tax, as it is from the land that local authorities derive their rates. - * * * * * The Federal Immigration liestriction Billis about the m<fet absurd bit of legislative folly that even Mr. Barton has indulged in. No person will foe allowed to land in Australia unless he hr she can write a dictated sentence of fifty words in English, or;if they do land they are liable to be expelled at any time if unable to comply with the condition. This measure says, Mr. Barton sapiently, will not raise any objections at home, and is cunningly devised to *keep out the Asiatic. # * * « * As a matter of fact, hundreds of thousands of Bengalis^Snd )tber Indian natives would easily pass the required test, so could many Japanese and Chinese co >lies from the big coact towns, but most of ithe European immigrants of the best type, such as Danish and {jerman agriculturalists, would be excluded. j[f other countries chose to adopt a similar measure as a retaliation against us, there are mighty few, even in the Federal Parlia ment, who could ever visit Europe, or even indulge in a trip to Japan to get rid of that " tired feeling." « . » ft ft There tove ^ce>ntly been considerable changes in the staff of the Brisbane Newspaper Company, and last week Mr. W. B. Carmichael, late business manager, and Mr. Da vies, of the literary staff, severed their connection with the Company, and were both suitably entertained by their former colleagues, who wished them every success in their new spheres-a kindly expression of sentiment in which FIGARO heartily joins. Davies returns tto journalism on the Southern Press, where there is more scope for his abilities than in our little capital with its stagnant Press, and Carmichael is reaping-the fruits of his recent business trip to America, and, I understand, will now act sa the Australian representative of an important American com bination in the printing line. Good luck to both of.them. * * * * *' .>.' .4 Both gentlemen ;are leaving, I understand, to better" themselves. Many of the B.N. Co.'s staff have recently done the same thing. It is to be hoped that the journals controlled by the Company will follow the example of their former employees, and though it may ^ot be convenient for them to leave Brisbane there is no reason that they also should not also make a laudable effort to " better " themselves. * * * ft .# What Happened to Henry,-Committed for contempt iot disobeying an injunction of the Supreme £5ourt.
