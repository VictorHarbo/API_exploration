This was certainly a time when Granny Chamberlain was my best friend for I thought sure he would be permanently injured by the awful straining of the cough. which was always worse at night and used to nearly suffocate him. But I gave him Chamberlain's Cough Remedy right away. and in frequent doses, and it was surprising how it liquified the tough mucus and made it easy for him to expec torate. Of course the whooping cough had to run its course, but Chamberlain as Cough Remedy saved him lots of suffering and any after effects. Since then I have had several occasions il i i to use Chamberlains Cough Remedy for whooping cough and although this disease always scares me I knowthere is no danger when Chamberlain's Cough Remedy is freely given. you get 60;W 1i' Clhmmbaan' " -.h PATRIOTISM.

"I feel ure my daughter would . have lost all her hair but for Koko, the way it was cooming out. It fell dreadfully but Koko soon stopped the falling, and has since made the hair grow. thickly all ove hesr head." "A Doctor's wife advised me to use Koko when my hair was falling. It is wonder ful how eoko. made the hair grow, al though I am not a young woman." "I cannot imagine anything better than Koko for thin and falling hair. All my friends notice how nicely my hair is growing since I used Koko. It is a de lightful preparation to stop !the hair fall ing, making the hair bright and decidedly wavy." 'Koko is the best thing I have ever aued for promoting the growth of the hair. It is just lovely for making the hair soft and glo?osand is delig?yt cool and refresh ing to the scalp when it is hot." "I never believed there could be socl a lovely dressing as Koko for the hair. it is most refreshing to use, and makes the hair soft, glossy, and quite lufr and wavy '"Koko is the cleanet dressing I ever used. and two bottles did my hair motr good than all the other things I eer tried." SiAMES GIVM . SB.BATHING WILL NOT HARM YOUR HAIR IF YOU ARE CAREFUL TO' USE KOKO AS A DRESSING AFTEIWARDS. The attainment of beautiful wary hair with that massy ftliness so much desired, comes pleasantly with Koko. To tempt omen to use it regularly, we have made Koko exquisitely clean odourless, neither oily nor greasy with a cool refreshing effect that is most enticing in warm weather.
