MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL. The Argus Office, Monday Evening. The Buenos Ay es Slandaidot 31st May discusses "Gold at 400," and alleges that Lord Rothschild s judgment was at fault when he assured the London financial world in December last that as soon as a Mora torches loan could be arranged for Argentina to relieve the Government of the necessity to remit funds quarterly in payment of coupons during a term of three years the market quotation would fall to 140 'Die Moratoribus loan was effected, but instead of gold falling to 140 it has risen to 400 Our contemporary proceeds to show, and we think rightly, that the effect of the Moratoribus loan could only be trifling as compared with the effect of over issues of paper money, writing as follows -- It is our firm conviction that The value of the shin plaster depends wholly, or almost wholly, on the amount of existing; paper money The quantity of bullion that may or may not be in Buenos Aires is a very second try consideration The country needs a certain amount of currency consistent with its trade and population, and any excess of shin plasters must cause a corresponding depreciation loudly irrespective of debt finances or anything else It is moreover notorious that whenever a country finds itself afflicted with inconvertible paper money no human power can prevent gold and silver from taking flight If he were in a portion to un port from Europe a sum of gold equal to the capital of the Bank of England, say 14 millions sterling (and L find its way back to Europe The foregoing remarks are quite sound If the Argentine Republic had not resorted to inconvertible paper money, but had maintained specie. payments, it would not have fallen into the plight in which it now finds itself. The mercantile community at Buenos Ayres is quite alive to the importance of returning to hard money, and the Chamber of Commerce has lately petitioned the Government to reduce the volume of "slim planters" in circulation Possibly the new National Bank lately projected may be able to deal with the subject, but if it cannot it will not render the country any appreciable service Incom terrible paper money basis way s entailed disaster, and its issue is only a desperate effort to restore exhausted credit In the meantime Argentina is increasing in productiveness and is so far on the road to recovery Mint for the first four months of the year emigration exceeded immigration by !),D71, which is in striking contrast with the experience of 1889, when the net immigration was 220,200 Army also of breadstuffs in Melbourne and Geelong by railway from the country districts during last week, according to the Government returns, compare with those of the pre \ ions week and of the corresponding week last year as follows - RECEIPTS OF W7IL7AT AND FLOUR.
