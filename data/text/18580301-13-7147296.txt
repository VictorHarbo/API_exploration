COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Saturday Evening, Export entries were passed at the Customs this morning for 1,114 ounces of gold, of which 724 ounces were for shipment in the Glebe, and 388 ounces in the Oithona, both for Hong Kong, the remainder being in the hands of passengers. There has been a decidedly better feeling in the gold market this week, larger parcels having been brought forward for shipment. Prices remain without change, at the following rates:-X3 les. 6d. to £3 14s. 9d. for Castlemaine and Sandhurst; £8 14s. 6d. to £3 15s. for Mount Korong: £3 16s. 6d. for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Creek, and Avoca ; £3 15s. to 3 15s. 9d. for Ararat and Pleasant Creek ; £3 16s. to 3 17s for the Ovens; and £3 17s. 6d. to £3 1791. for Ballaarat. The escorts for the week have been below the average; but the returns from the majority of the diggings have been well maintained. In comparing these returns with those for the same period of last year, it will be seen that Ballaarat, Castlemaine, and Sandhurst show 1 a considerable falling off. The fortnightly I escorts are in all cases distinguished from the 1 weekly by the prefix of an asterisk to the names of the gold-fields : 1858\. 1857. ozB. data. ozs. its.

The gold-fields are at last in full work once more, the rains having visited nearly every district. The long-continued drought has been productive of one great good. It has; stimulated the residents of the gold-fields to come forward in all directions with project! for securing a steady supply of water. A gigantic scheme for the supply of water at all times, and at a moderate rate, to the Bendigo district, is being canvassed among the capitalists of the locality, and will in all probability be carried out by associated enterprise In the mean time, greater activity prevails The Bendigo Advertiser says :-"' The late seasonable rains have given an impetus to alluvial mining. Many mills which have been stopped for weeks for want of water are again in work, and we have no doubt but the next escort will be more satisfactory and encouraging than the last one." The same journal bears evidence to some considerable falling off in the old spots " We are sorry to remark, that though the rain has set a large number of mills at work again, yet a very considerable number from some cause, still remain idle in the neighborhood of Ironbark and the lower end of Long Gully. About the junction several miners, taking advantage of the death, has been and are still carrying down paddocks in the line of the old creek, with varying success One party has, we understand, on very well at it." The rains have come down, the creeks in such volume at Ballaarat as a i h eaten, at one time, serious consequences but fortunately the flood passed over without any injury being inflicted. Carngham i becoming depopulated for the present. From. Pleasant Creek and Ararat there is nothing new to report. At Bendigo attention is being turned to the hitherto unworked quartz reef on the Seven White Hills. Along the bank of the Loddon great activity prevails, in several instances of individual success has been authenticated. One thousand and fourteen immigrant landed at the Port of Melbourne during the week, including 428 from the United Kim de m ; 325 from the Australian colonies, t from Hamburgh, 1 from Bordeaux, 4 from Gottenburg, 21 from Suez, 169 from Hong Kong, 2 from Calcutta, 2 from Bombay, 1 from Manilla. The number of departures is con puted at 170. The net addition to the population by the seaboard during the current year has been 4,232. Arrived.

There have been some attempts to excite speculation in the local stock and share market, but very little has been done, the disposition among capitalists being just now anything but favorable to this kind of securities.

Trade has been anything but brisk this week, although a greater amount of business has been transacted. Buyers for the country trade are either holding back to the last moment, or they are not prepared to replenish stocks in anticipation of the winter. With regard to the winter trade, it is evident that Melbourne) will be in future the great mart throughout the year. The improved state of the roads renders the liability of fluctuation in the rates of cartage less imminent than at any former period, but still the rise which the approach of winter is certain to bring about, will operate to induce the transport of large quantities of heavy goods during the month of March.

WESTERN MARKET.-The quantity of commodities in the market was this morning larger than usual, and prices somewhat lower. The greatest confusion prevailed, and business was very much obstructed through the difficulty of getting the carts placed upon the site now appropriated for them, and matters will not mend in this respect till the stands are marked off and numbered, and a particular stand allotted to each grower, to which he could proceed at once.

HAY MARKET.-The supply has continued heavy, and, being somewhat in excess of demand, has given a rather dull tone to the market. 500 loads have been brought in, against 557 last week, and prices remain unaltered. We quote best hay at 61. CB. to 71. 7a. ; inferior, 51. to 02. ; straw, 4s, to 5s. per ton. Wool, TALLOW, seen the arrival of the English mail the usual weekly sales were resumed, and on Thursday last Messrs. Goldsbrough and Co. submitted about 5000 bales wool to the trade. The advices from the home market, however, deterred merchants from purchasing and as the growers had placed somewhat high reserves on the host lots advertised for sale, and which, in absence of sufficient money being bid, were withdrawn, the late passed off heavily, the prices paid for the lots purchased body., however, quite as high as last advices could justify. Fire quantities sold were as follows 370 bales greasy brought 8d. to 10d. ; 0 bales greasy lambs, lord. ; 8 bales pieces, Syd. ; 31 bales slip Old. to 12d. ; 10) bales fleece, 18d. to 10d. and 25 bales handwashed, TBd. per lb., the marks and descriptions being greasy, M K, 1 bale, 8½d. ; ditto, I O, 0 ditto, Od. ; ditto, B R Broughton, 4 ditto, Old. ditto lambs, J G, 0 ditto, 10d. ; greasy looks, J H, 1 ditto, 88d. ; ditto, Fit Co., 8 ditto, Old. ditto, E A, 11 ditto, 6d., ditto, ESP, 11 ditto, lOd. ; ditto G, in diamond, 35 ditto, 8d. ; ditto pieces, It, 8 ditto, 534. ; slipo, W B, 3 ditto, 12d. ; ditto, F T, 2 ditto, Old, ditto, J J, 1 ditto, Old. fleece, R O K, 6 ditto, 18d. ; ditto, J B, 8 ditto, 18d. ; ditto, IVAN, 37 ditto, 8d.; ditto, It 3 Broughton, 103ditto, 10d.; ditto, N J L, 7 ditto, 13d..

Fat Cattle The market has been somewhat short supplied with this description of stock, and, owing to the trade being only moderately supplied, prices have steadily advanced on last week's quotations. Prime quality beef bringing 25s. to 27s. 6d. Second-class 20s. to 22s. 6d. per 100lbs. Store Cattle. Small lots of fair quality are in good inquiry. Messrs. Ryan and Hammond acquaint used having effected a sale of 400 head at 120s. each, cash. Working Bullocks are In much Inquiry, and. If in good working condition, of ready Sale. Messrs. J. L. Logan and Co. report the sales of six teams, with gear c, at from 66. to 86!. the team. Mr. W. W. Treacy also announces having disposed of seven teams at from 10s. to 140!., with drays and gear. Calves have been supplied about equal to the demand and have consequently produced fair prices, say from 30s. to 75s. each. Fat sheep have come freely to market, and prices remain unaltered from last week's quotations. Good wethers may be quoted from 14s. to IS 3, Messrs. Ryan and Hammond report a few prime ft' having brought 20s. to 21s. each; good ewes, 15s 6d. to 15s. each. Store sheep are in better inquiry and as the rains increase and bring on pasture, more demand may be looked for: at present, prices continue: without alteration. Messrs. Dalmahoy Campbell and Co. report having sold a lot of 4,801 good round wethers at 13s. each, to be delivered or this side the Murray. Lambs. The demand has considerably declined, and sales have consequently been more difficult to effect. Prices are, Indeed, nominal and may be quoted at from 9s. to 12s. each. HORSE MARKETS-The market has shown improved dcmaudforreallystanch good horses of all descriptions and a general degree of briskness In this class that has long been wanting in the market. The prices procure for unbroken stock have been somewhat low figure i but this class of stock sent in for sale has been decidedly; inferior, and so long as such woody mobs continue the forced on the market, better prices cannot be expected. Mr. W. W. Treacy reports having sold 0' head from the stud of David Mr okey, of Maneroo, a an average of 25!. each and Messrs. J. L. Lohan an Co. advise UB of sales of really stanch draught stock, in condition, at from 70!. to 105!. each and good light harness horses at from 19. to 30!. each. ? LABOR MARKETS-The demand for farm labor of all descriptions has entirely ceased in Melbourne, although a good demand is reported to exist in the farming districts, where good ploughmen am thorough farming men are reported to be in re quest. The late arrivals have brought a considerable number of mechanics and tradesmen who as yet have found some difficulty in procuring employment. Domestic servants, both male and female, the latter especially, if competent to the duties they undertake, and with references, are very scarce, and much sought after, even at rates in advance of our quotations. The emigrants per Cargo talons were, as we previously intimated, all of the description termed "assisted," and, although out; arrived at the depot on Tuesday last, have, with but few exceptions, been already taken away by their relatives, leaving none in search of employment Seamen's Wages.-Monarocomliigforwardcon6ldorabl: in excess of the demand, notwithstanding the man; ships about to sail require numerous hands ; rates 0 wages are consequently unchanged, and we quote them as follows:- Coasting Voyages, 6!. per month India or China and back, 4!. 10s. per month ; India China, west coast of America and England, 4!. 10s. per month ; England direct, 4!. 10s. per month s for Callao only, 2!. 10s. per month.

MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRICES CURRENT The Argus Office, Saturday Evening. The advices by the overland mail have at is brought reports of reductions in shipments of seven articles of general consumption. Stocks on hand however, are mostly 80 large that the effect of d creased Imports must be felt before prices can be in fluenced; and as the shipment of many articles with which our market is overstocked has not, by last r Sorts, decreased, the import market on the whole h derived little or no benefit. In early part of the week a good country demand caused more activity for most descriptions of goods, and gave a better appear ance and tone to the market than had latterly exists The continued heavy arrivals have, however, In a great; degree, dissipated this feeling, and, with the exception of flour and horse feed, nearly all imported article have been difficult of sale. The extracolonial arrive of the week amount to no less than 12,740 to register, comprising 7 vessels from the United Kindom, 3 from China, 3 from Manilla, 2 from Bordeaux, from Hamburg. 2 from Gottenburg, 1 from Mauritius from Ceylon, 1 from Lombock, and 1 from Boston, U.G from which it may fairly be inferred that our supply has not only been extensive and far beyond all poor bro requirements, but of a most assorted description andlnfacool which, with previous heavy stocks < hand, no present prospect of ameliorated prices can reasonably be looked for. Liquors Draught ale is, as usual, in fair rcquo best brands being preferred and being almost the on ones commanding steady prices. Bass's No. 3 Be too sells readily at 6!. 6s-, and sales of Allsopp's a reported at 0!. to 92. 2s. 6d. Other approved bran take their proportionate value from Bass's No. 3, b inferior and doubtful sorts are difficult of sale, tri spective of price. Draught porter continues to go off very slowly at almost nominal prices for most of for red sorts, other kinds being nearly unsaleable Bottled beer has been in rather easier demand, a sales, except at very low figures for inferior sor rather difficult to collect in large parcels, By aa beer (ale and porter in equal proportions) is not won more than 10s. 6d, to 10s. 6d., although reports stn other settlers to have been sold at high rates. Spirits continue without improvement The arrivals during the week past have laon oxen rash and though the absence of transactions may be prevented apparent decline in prices, extensive word Or any description could doubtless be except readily at reduced rates on quotations. Case bran of best description and genuine brands has been good demand: several parcels have changed hands 878\. for United Vineyard Proprietors' being about highest ruling rate paid. Genuine dark Brandies best brands have also been in rather improved t quiry, but the figures offered being very low, r much business has been done, although there appear a disposition to soil. Rum Is saleable, althou slowly, and in very small parcels, by auction. W. 0 To 8 op., brought 3s. 8d. and 10 to 20 o.n., 4s. 5 to 4s. 4d. per gallon. Geneva, even of best bran has become again dull of sale, and for old tom a whUkoy there appears to be no demand white Wines present no feature of improvement general Light wines, owing to over supplies, continue, they have throughout the summer been to be little request. By auction, good still book has so sold for 265. j sparkling hock at Stjs, j and sparkle uoscllootsomoprico per dozen. In low ports and On Prices nothing is doing, and even middling quill 1 i are dull. Really prime wines, stories particularly, meet ready sale at full prices, by auction ; very ; primary golden berries have sold at 40s and 4s. 10d. already paid sherries, 43!. and 60!. 10s ; middling, 52\. 15s. to 63. per butt ; Quarlos Harris's treble dc almond port, brought 05!. 10s. ; Sandomau's' double il'Binond, Off. 10s. to 651. ; fair ordinary ports, 00!. to O' I. j and good sound full-flavoured wines, 67!. per pipe. Flour, Grain, &c; The demand for flour, reported last week, has continued and In tboabsoncoof arrivals prices have steadily advanced. Country orders still i 'unto freely into the market, and from small parcels the demand has increased to quantities of considerable extent. Our market is bare of Tasmanian flour. Ado hide shippers show no disposition to export at pre i ant rates, and as stocks of this growth have been, by steady consumption, run somewhat low, and no amount of ooloiiUl-grown wheat is as yet offering, improved rates may fairly be looked for, at any rate for some little time to come. The prospect of a rising market has InduojJ speculation, and some rather large sales both in South Australian and American barrel There are to-day reported at full quoted rates. Several holders of the former kind have indeed, in hopes of improved rates, withdrawn the parties they were previously offering. The demand for wheat in Adelaide for Sydney orders is reported to have been unexecuted to the required amount, in con so Thence of advance of prices and firmness of holders in that market; but by last advices from Sydney we do-, in of a considerable parcel of barrel flour having arrived there from the United States, which will probably operate as a check on previously advancing rates. The 1 wing prices of the flour market to- day an 119 10s. for country and 17!. 10s. for town brands [Adelaide). ii h in in demand Inodvanco stocks on hand, and owing to the slowness with which wheat comes into millers' hands, the supply is inadequate to consumption, and prices are consequently firmly maintained at 3s. 4d. to 3s. 8d. per bushel. v heal comes forward very slowly, and in small [). interest only, and is in good demand at from 6s. 3d. to 6s. 6d. per bushel. oats. h., vi much improved in demand. Several large parcels of Scotch have changed hands at 5s., many holders refusing to sell under 6s. 6d., at which rate Danish have been placed during the week. Colonial grown oats are hold firmly for 7s. 3d. to 7s. 6d. per bushel. Barley is in much request for good, but the market being all but share, prices are nominal. Bran is in good demand, both for home use and export, and nee i s. per ton holders will not part with stocks, while 18!, is readily procurable for small lots. Provisions. The improved demand for butter his caused a corresponding amendment in prices of now good torts, and, as this description is scarce, 15d. may be quoted as the price at which it is readily saleable ; old and Inferior sorts, however, are wholly without improvement, and an average parcel of this description was placed by auction during the week at from Led. to 6d. per lo. Choose, English, in really good condition, is readily saleable at about 13d. per lb., but Inferior and unsound lots are of nominal value only. Hams continue in steady demand and fully support improved prices-Is. 4d. for really prime being readily obtainable Bacon somewhat strangely does not partake of the improvement in prices of hams, and for most descriptions is not saleable at above Lid. and 18 per lb. Salted provisions show no change either in demand or value Candies. For this article there is no improved demand, and small sales only are effected without varia- tion in value. Oilmen's Stores of most descriptions of general con- traction continue of steady sale in parcels of more rain amount, without change in prices, the considerable supplies of green fruits daily coming to market, of course, depressing the demand for bottled fruits and jams. Qrocorlcs.-Coffees have continued very quiet, with a steady demand. The Customs return for the week it ws 46,300 lb. delivered. The Marion, from Ceylon, has brought a supply of about 80 tons, but as this article is in few hands, the market is not likely to be influenced by this arrival. Teas. Small lots of teas have been offered to the trade by auction during the week, and, considering the qualities, have produced fair prices, ordinary lay muslin bringing 5!. 15s. per balf-picul chest, and 10 catty boxes 23s. 6d. to 24s. each; half-chest ordinary congou, 44. to 4!. IB., and ten-catty boxes 13½ lb.), of shades quality', 27s. 6d. to 28s, each, which shows no depreciation in value of of really good qualities. The damaged toss saved from the wreck of the Eli Lafond have been disposed of by auction, the highest rates being-6!, 6s. per chest, and 2!. per half-chest for black tea. Sugars. The chief trade of the week has been confined to auction sales, of which there have been several consisting of previously rejected lots and remnants of Mauritius cargoes, the prices procured for which have not been a fair index of the market prices, and have certainly been disposed of at rates showing a de canoon previously quoted values, fine crystals bringing only 40!. 5s. ; low to fine yellows, about 83!. to 43!. 10s. middling to good brown, 88!. to 80!. Timber continue] of still ready sale, and at somewhat improved prices. One sale of coals by auction only has occurred during the week, which was well attended and sold readily, the prices procured being, for yellow deals, on the Wharf, 0x4 (size in much request), lOd. ; 11 x 3. 6d. 1018, 6d. ; Scotch floor- ing boards, 66 x 12, brought 25d. per foot. SHUGG have sold more steadily, and at an advanced rate of about is, per 1,000. Melons continue, from amount of stocks, very dull of sale generally, the demand being confined to the sorts suited for roofing and building purposes, over which sorts are by no means brisk.
