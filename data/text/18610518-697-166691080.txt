I en gaged a parcel of wool In Sydney to be landed for the February sales, giving & guarantee for it, or lose half freight, and I am sorry to say lost it by only one day. I hope the Sydney folks will give me credit for doing my best to prove the sailing qualities of the Cairngorm. I am new loading for Sydney.'

STRANDING OF THE STEAMER WILLIAM THE FOURTH.—We have been favoured with the following particulars respecting the stranding of the abovenamed vessel :—The William the Fourth, laden with potatoes and grain, in endeavouring to cross the bar at the Moruya on 10th instant, grounded, and after striking heavily was cast upon the inner landspit, where she now lies. The information received does not lead to the belief that she will be- come a total wreck ; every exertion is being made to float her off the spit. The captain states that the channel had completely shifted during the recent gales, to which may be attributed the cause of the disaster. The Hunter (s.) will leave here for the wreck to-day, and will convey an efficient party for any requisite purpose, and we believe Captain Malcolm, on the part of the Sydney Marine Assurance Company (where the steamer is in- sured), and the manager of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Com- pany, will proceed to the Moruya. We are happy to add there was no loss of life.

Captain Wrangles had a 6cvcrc accident a few days since, which nas fractured the ribs in his right side caused by falling down the after hatchway. Mr, Crook, the harbour-master, boarded the Constantino immediately on her arrival, and finding that the health officer had left the 6hip, and the captain quite helpless and without any assistance, immediately proceeded on board the emigrant ship Nile, and solicited the attendance of Dr. Holman, who at once proceeded on board and afforded every relief in his power to Captain Wrangles. The following vessels have been chartered by Government for the conveyance of emigrants, troops, or stores to the foreign stations named during the month of March, nearly the whole of them sniling from Graveecnd :— William Stewart, 576 tone, for Melbourne ; Broadwater, 571 tons, for Auckland ; the Earl of Mar, 422 tons, for Wellington ; and the Eircnc, 186 to&6, for East Lon don. The Mangcrton, 966 tons, will sail from Plymouth with emi grants for Morcton Bay.—MitchclPs Segistcrt March 9th. The Robert and Betsy left Launccston on the 9th instant. No arrivals from Sydney are reported. Toe Ubaba (s. ),— In noticing the report of the departure of this vessel from Grafton, on the 24th ultimo, it must be borne in mind that the township is fifty miles from the bar, end that it would be impossible to ascend the river against the heavy fresh that must hare boen running; so that doubtless the steamer is 6till lying enug within the bar, RtreRT of tite Loss of tiie Schooner Jessie, at Anatam. —Thursday, March 14th, 186L — Jessie, schooncr, was lying moored in Anatom, for tbe purpose of refitting, with seventy-five fathoms on the S.E., and forty-five fathoms on the N.W, chain ; during forenoon, fresh breezes from S.E. by E. and cloudy, with occasional squalls of rain. At noon, barometer 29'70 ; 2 p.m. barometer 29'60, and breeze increasing, but no shift of wind; 4 p.m., strong gale and heavy clouds rolling up from S.E. to N.N.E. to S., end round by west to north : barometer at this time down 29*45. Topmasts and yards being on deck, paid out chain on S.E. cable and clinched the end round foremast. 5 p.m.— Water one mass of foam, but no sea, and spray flying from bows to stern of the vessel. G p.m.— Barometer 29*20. From this time till 7 p.m. tbe firmament in the E. and N.E. quarter appeared lighted up with a blueish light, so much so that, although it was dark on other nights by six o'clock, any person might read a book by it 8 p.m.— Barometer 28*90. At this time, the wind blowing a heavy gale, very little lightning perceptible ; ship riding with tremendous strain on her cables, and so it continued until 10 ; barometer still falling, being down to 28*60 at 10.30 p.m., blowing 0 perfect hurricane ; not a man could see the land for sprays, the ship beingcovcred with them; wind from E.S.E., having shifted the last half-hour. 11 p.m.— More wind, and perfectly dark. Vessel begun to drag starboard anchor ; paid out chain on the port anchor, as the vessel took it and clinched the end round the mainmast, when it brought the vessel up for a few minutes ; the force of tbe hurricane at this time was so great that the crew were blown about the docks, and with difficulty secured them selves with ropes. 11,55 p.m. — Barometer 28'30, and at 0.10 a.m., Friday, 15th, barometer 28*10, wind E.S.E. At 0.20 a.m., ship stinck heavily ; attempted to cast off and let go the cables, when the vessel was reported filling, and in ten minutes after she first struck she was full and aground. Masts tore the steps from the kelson, and ripped the decks up with difficulty, then cut away the masts, when they fell over the side. At 1 a.m. a perfect calm, wind dying away all at once. Three of the crew jumped over board and swam on shore to give the alarm ; when, at 2 a.m., a boat camc on board fron the shore, and took the remainder off the wreck, a moderate breeze springing up from the N. at the time. Wc have been favoured with the following account of a series of hurricanes that have passed over New Caledonia The hurri cane that passed over the New Hebrides and Caledonia, on the 14th March, was pronounced the heaviest that has been felt for many years. Previous to the commencement on the 14th it had been blowing hard for two days, with rain at intervals. In the forenoon it blew from S.E. by E,, being very cloudy, and with very vivid lightning to the N.E. ; at 6 o'clock p.m., it blew a gale of wind, gradually increasing until 10 o'clock, when it blew furiously, so much so, that it was impossible for a man to stand against it ; the trees were blown down, and roofs of houses blown about in all directions. Several people that were outside wcr driven many yards, and finally were brought up against shrubs, trees, hillocks, &c.; Boats were lifted bodily off the beach into tho water ; the leaves of all the trees on the weather side of the island were blown off, and the force of the hurricane washed the sea 350 feet further in land than erer known. Missionary houses, school houses, and native houses on the beaches on the weather side, were washed away, and the natives had hard work to cscapc from drowning. It is also known that two ships, vie., the Hiron delie and the Jessie, belonging to Mr. Underwood, of Anatam, were driven on shore from their anchors ; the Jessie became a total wrcck ; with the loss of everything beloning to her and the crew. All hands on board saved, by swimming and being carried by the waves on shore, some of them being severely cut and bruised by the coral rocks. On shore the force was such that houses were blown down, windows and doors carried away, and several people inside forced against the opposite walls. We have had five hurricanes down here this season. The first was in December (I860), which com menced E. veering to N.E., and on to N. W., lasting eleven hours. The second, on the 3rd to 6th January, the heaviest of it lasting fifteen hours, commencing E.S.E. to N.E, to the westward. During this several small crafts in the Caledonia and Loyalty Groups were blown ashore, and a great deal of damage done to shipping. The third was on the 10th to 11th January, which lasted sixteen hours, commencing S.E., S. to S.W. The fourth on February 20th and lith, lasting twelve hours, and passing the same way. And the fifth on the 14th to 15th March, lasting seven bours, from E.S.E. ; part of it passed over Caledonia. It was in this that the Caledonicnnc French war schooner was struck by a sea, carrying away her port bulwarks, several of her sails, &c;,, and completely hurling oer ballast over and over ; iron ballast stoved underneath, atone ballast was hove on the lee side, throwing her nearly on her beam ends, but fortunately, righting immediately, losing her lee boata, dant -, &c;,t and carrying a way ber weather chain, and disabling her. — A Correspondent, The Great Britain has discharged tbe whole of her cargo, and is now a clear ship, ready to take in her homeward loading. The time occupied in discharging this immense vessel has been 22| hours only.— Argus, May 8, Notice to Mauke&s.;— Sunken Wrcck near the West Channel Lightship.- The chief harbour master gives notice to commanders of vessels, pilots, and others navigating Port Phillip Bav that a small cutter lies sunk within half-a-mile about E. by N. from St Leonard's Jetty, in four fathoms water, with about fifteen feet of bcr lower mast above water. A red flag will be exhibited en the mast by day and a light by night until the wrcck has been removed.— Argus, May 8. The Beemen Bahqvb Diana.— The conduct of Captain Herman Huang, of the Bremen barque Diana, in saving the crew and coming out of his way to land them at the first British port, at an expenditure of time, provisions, and money, is not only deserving of praise, but of more substantial acknowledgement We should think that under the circumstances the Customs and Pilotage dues will not be permitted to fall on the 6Mp. The Diana was bound to Valparaiso from China. In putting into this port, as a matter of humanity to the thirteen souls picked up in the open &cnt; Captain Husing has performed a great duty in away to entitle him to the substantial thanks of British citizens all over the world. — Argtu, May 8. The arrivals of vessels at the ports of Sydney, Newcastle, and Adelaide, will be reported by telegraph, at the Exchange, for the information of subscribers, on and alter this day. — ^4r^w#, May 9, The little euttcr Venture has had a passage of twenty-six days from Sydney, including throe days detention under Mana, in Cook's Straits, sheltering from the S.E. gale at the close of March. Captain Emerson reports sighting the boat which drifted out of Okain, nearly in the same place and at the same time as she was seen by the Mountain Maid.— iA/ttclton Times , S0- h April. EXTHACT FIlOM A LWTEE FROM PaLLIBER BAY.— 'I 6&W; til B late paper tlmt the Phantom, which left Port Cooper, bound to Wellington, to take in passengers for the Fcegeee, was missing. She left Fort Cooper prior te the gale in January last. Now, I think that I con account for her, in so far as that about eight days after the Shamrock was lost here, part of the starboard bow of a vessel camc in between my place and TcXopi. She had been pine-built (Norway or American), partly fasten od with yellow metal. The bow planking was npped. longitudinally, through their tbickncBs to within about six inches to where they were rabbeted to the stem. Xt was too large nnd heavy for me to secure, and a heavy sea and high-tide took it off to sea again ; but I have still one or two planks which I secured. 1 may mention that tho w reck was qultcTrcc from barnacles, and must have been lost in that gale,'— Wellington Independent, April 23, Captain Langlcy, of the brig Gil Bias, was off the port four days : on Wednesday, 1st May, encountered a severe easterly gale, equal to a hurricane, which lasted five hours, The captain says he has not experienced such a violent gale for the last eight years, and was six days in the 6tralts. The Deva, brig, from Newcastle, and Dart, brig, from Sydncy.had arrived. „ The Hamburg barque Dido, while on a voyage from Singaporo to China, was wrecked in tbe Straits of Salaycr on tlie 16th Feb ruary. The crew and a part of the cargo were saved, but tho ship is a total wreck. On the 13th March the Dutch schooner Benin, from Rotterdam to Makassar, was lost near the latter place. The crew and passengers were saved, but the ship and cargo have been lost.— Singapore Free Press, flth April.

This vessel left Newcastle on the £7th, for the Clarence, and put into Port Stephens on the 28th, and Captain Crccr, tier commau icr, in a letter received from the latter port, signified his intention of sailing again the follow ing day, but did not leave until the 30th. The New Moon (s.) was in Port Stephens on Monday, and no report was obtained there receding any vessels being lost The harbour-master, Sir.

She was off Green Island wbcn( the cat-fall breaking, the anchor of course fell, and the ship having headway upon her, above a hundred fathoms of chain ran out The capstan bars were shipped, and themen standing by. What with the firing of the bars and the running out of tho chain, no less than eighteen men were wounded, two it was feared fatally. Medical aid, in addition to that of the surgeon of tho ship, was instantly procured. The ship was detained three hours in consequence. — China Overland Trade Report, March 15Ui. Extracts from the Queensland Guardian of May 8th The Micronesia was lying 6unk on the Eagle Farm Flats, water level with the gunwale. Greater part of cargo landed on the bank of the river. A terrific squall, with torrents of rain, passed over the pilot station, April 27th, coming from S.S.W., and veering round N.W. and eastward. It carried off the roof of the boat 6hcd, some of the rafters whirling a distance of 200 yards ; carried away one of the men's houses, and tore up several trees by the roots. One hardwood tree of eighteen inches diameter, was snapped off. The Premier (s.) and the Vanquish, schooncr (with both anchors out and chain to the bare end), lying in the roads, drove consi derably, the latter to within two lengths of the beach, where sho held on. The Premier, the following night, during a moderate breeze ftom N.W., parted her chain (which had been, no doubt, previously strained), and drove on the beach. At seven p.m., j pilots Curphy and Sholl, and Captain Scott, of the Vanquish, pro ceeded with a boat's crew end rendered all the assistance in their power. The squall lasted three-quarters of an hour, and during the whole time tlie atmosphere at Ihe signal hill was quite calm# The Vanquish sailed en Friday, 30th, at noon. Tnr Light Suip Robe. — The following notification from tho Harbour Master appears in our advertising columns, in reference to this vessel, stationed at the Bar in Moreton Bay ' Tho light vessel Rose is placed at the Three Fathom Hole, on the west side, and a light will be placed on the west beacon during the winter months, when the tide suits to cross the bar, from dusk until day light. Vessels steering the usual course from Cowan Cowan ; should, after making the light, keep it about two points on the port bow, until it bears S. & E., then steer for it, and pass it on the starboard side. The light on the west beacon kept a ship s length open to the eastward of the light in the Rose, will carry a vessel in mid-channel, across the bar, and into the river.** The steamer Premier, as reported from Morcton Island, May 2nd, was 6unk four feet in sana, and the tide ebbed end flowed in and out of bcr. The Breadalbanc returned from her on Saturday, Captain Twine finding that it would be ncccsBory to have a num ber of casks before attempting to float her. On Monday the Brea dalbanc started again for the beached vessel, supplied with nume rous ensks and tanks, and no doubt the attempt to float her will be made the first favourable day. I The Telegraph steamer was discovered on Sunday afternoon to I leak considerably, and on sounding the pumps four feet of water I were found in her hold. As the vessel was dry cm Saturday, tho 1 caute was inexplicable, until Monday, when the cargo having been removed from that department, it was discovered that m one of tbe iron plates near tlie garboard streak amidships, a hole I had been punched about an inch in circumference. Owing to the ' rush of water much of the cargo in the neighbourhood of the leak was damaged. It is supposed that the cause of the accident, was ber settling on a snag or bar, on which she had rested, . No time was lost in stopping the inward stream, and a piece of plate was bolted in and fastened,, which will effectually stop up the leak until an opportunity offers on her return to place her on tao I Company's slip in Sydney. Several surveys baye boen held on tbe damaged goods, some of which are advertised for sale ny | auction. , !

Emulation nu)« rut, Pout or LivnEroou — Tnc returns of thr emigration from the port of Liverpool during tbe month of ? February have boen made up by the G«venuncnt Emigration 1 Commissioners at that port. From these returns we see that in that month the number of ships M under the Act,' which nailed to the United States was twelve, having on board J 736 steerage and 1 fiflv-«cvcn cabin passengers; to Victoria there were throe ship*, with 761 hteerific and 105 cabin paracngers, making a total of flltccn ships, taring on board 2517 tetceragc and 162 cabin passengers. Qf this number, wc may state that one *hJp— tbe wrcw steamer -Great Britain— carried out to Melbourne no lews than 492 nawnaers. -of which eichlv-six were cabin. Iu addition to this number the Great Britain had on board a crew of 137 men. The numbcr«of short ?ships — ships not under the act— which left tie Mereey during tlie tome month was 2', 17 of which went to the United ^States, with 797 passengers; 1 to Victoria, with 34 jiassengtrs ; 1 to New boutb Wales, with 4 pas^cuRcr* ; 3 to tJouth Amorica r 4 to Africa, with 35 passenger* ; and 1 to the Wert Indies, with 75 passengers. From thc*e figures we gather that the total number ofnaiwenffm which left Liverpool during the past month waa 8588, which when compared with tbe same month of last year, show6 on increase of £72 ; and an increase of the re inrng ©rJajiuary ofthc present vcarof 2352. Thegcncroitoncoftho emigration trade from the port i0 not eo brisk a* in former years and this is Attributable in f*mc respects to the present unsettled tdalc or '.politics in America, and a]*o to tbe lather unsatisfactory intclliponcc from Australia, which states tbat the rrcent depres sion of trade had caused much depression in the labour market.

TIIK MEffSAGERIES IMPEHIALKS. 3 n our telegram from Adelaide, published in the Jltrsld of the 10th instant, it is stated that a French Overland Company had euc cccdcd in obtaining an Imperial subsidy of £280,000 per annum, s&d; that the Company had despatched the first of their fine eteamtrs for India via the Cape of Good Hope. Concerning this important undertaking, we give the following particulars from the Calcutta Englishman of March 21st. Tbat journal says; — The Peninsular and Oriental Company have ill length worked out the competition in the Eastern seas for whieh we have been to long waiting, ond the public so long wishing, in vain. The desired relief is coming from a foreign quarter.; and it will be put in motion and supported by a man who does not j?cncrally let bis projects fail or die out for want of energy and determination. Our readers must have heard of late many rumours of the coming of the Frcnch into the India and China watcra with a large steam Genicc- These rumours have a firm baste of reality in France, and will soon appear out here in actual fulfil ment, represented by a noble fleet of fiteomcrs, to open tlie Asiatic steam lines of the ifewageries Imperial**, it is no longer a threat or a fiction; several ofthc steamers have already been launched in France, and one ot least bus started for the East. Wc have been furnished with many of the details of the new Frcnch enter prise, and ore well assured of its speedy inauguration. The LmptTer of the French is most anxious that the Frcnch steam lines in tbe East should be opened and maintained, and he has promised his thorough and hearty support to the project. The coal depots and other establishments on the Eastern steam lines have been arranged, and arc fast advancing to completion and efficiency. Tbe line from Suez to Shanghai will be the first opened, probably in the commencement of next year ; and mcanwlulo the divergmg line to Calcutta will be taken into consideration. There arc to be seventeen steamers sent out from France, of 2500 tons burthen, and 500 honac-powcr, nominal ; and the accommodation on board these vessels will be auperior beyond all comparison to anything which the 1', and O. Company have ever thought of providing for their p&recnpers.; We have seen a sketch of the cabin and saloon accommodation of these superb vessels, which arc euch as must give universal satisfaction by their spaciougio&s;, comfort, and clcgancc. Each Toomy cabin will contain but two pcrbous ; the fit* tmg» up and accessories will be all that can be d pored, and the bathing and other accessory conveniences will be eo numerous as to ensure almost exclusive privacy for the occu pants. finally, overcrowding wUl be impossible, as these Teasels will be strictly forbidden by the regulations of the scrvice to carry more than a hundred passengers. Again, the French will, in working their lines, show their superior power of organisation, and will immensely facilitate, and render less troublesome, the passage to Europe, and even to England, overland. A passenger proceeding -to England will take a ticket which will carry him right through to London— Frcnch and English railway fares hdng all included in the passage money, which, wc oelievc, will probably be not more than what i* uow ?-aid to Marseilles. Before teaching Marseilles the traveller will make over his heavy baggage to the ihirser, or some such official, of the steamer, and he will find it at tbe London oflicc on his arrival. He will him self land in France with a small portmanteau, previously ex amined and passed on board ; there will be no passport required, and he can continue his route without a moment's delav( and get along as leisurely as he could reasonably wish, as his railway ticket will be gooa for some eight or ten days. In fact they Trill carry out in these steamers the ]-crfcct arrangements whicn re ? lieve travellers -on the French and Austrian lines of railway from all trouble with regard to their ' belongings.' We bid the new company welcome into these seas, where competition has long1 been grievously needed, and where wc hope it will meet with fair play ana plentiful encouragement. Wc bear the P. and O. Company no ill-will, bpt it has for a length of time required something to keep it in check ; and wc shall be glad if the serious inconveniences and endless overcrowding on board their steamers should turn out to be & proof that there is room nnd work for two companies on the Eastern steam lines, cspe- , cially on that betwoen Calcutta and Suck, of which more com- : plaints have been published than of any other steam route in the world. On the 26th, the Englishman adds :— We learn that four of the large steamers for the Meuagerics Jmperiales . arc now completed ana launched in Fran 03, and probably have left for the Eastern rtcam lines ; and Uie remaining ships are progressing steadily in the dockyards. It is hoped that the line from Calcutta to Hues may be opened in February next. LOSS OF TIIE DAXNEBROG. By the arrival of the American whale Ehip Ilibcrnifl we learn tbe loss of tlie Danish brip; Dannebrog. Wc have been kindly favoured by the Captain with the following report Tv tite Editor oj the Daily Press. ?v ^ ... Ilongkong, 10th March, 1801. Dear Sir,— I take the liberty to send you & few particulars con cerning tbe total loss of the Danish brig Danncbrog under my command, on her passage irom Hongkong to Sydney. After nearly three months' stay at Agano. Guam, 1 obtained a passage for myself and nine of my crew to this place per American whale fchip Hibernia, Captain Edwards. 1 avail myself of this oppor tunity publicly to express mj most sincere thanks to Captain jEdwarde. not alone for giving us a free passage to this place, but also for the great kindness and consideration with which he has treated mc,— 1 remain, Dear Sir, your obedient sen-ant, M. S2ME6I&, bite master of the Danncbrog. The Dannebrog left Hongkong, bound to Sydney, on 25th August. She toox the eastern route round the Caroune Islands. Tbe voyage was prosperous, until 0th October, when a bearing woe taken, Torres Island in latitude 7*32 N. and longitude 230'56 E. The wind then hauled to 2S.S.E., and a strong currcnt was found setting to the westward at the rati of twenty to thirty toilet per day. i'roceedcd towards the equator, in the hope of finding more favourable winds, but was disappointed, and finally bore up for doe of the Straits meat of Xewfiuinca on 29th October. This was done in corowqucnce of the prevalence of the winds and currents in a contrary direction, and there being only three weeks provisions on board. Steered W.S.W., wind to the eastward, with light breezes aceompasicd vith squalls. On 2nd November winds hauled to the westward ?yith squally weather; on 5th idem squalls so severe that gall had tobc shortened. o« then in latitude 1*36 ft. and longitude 1£J'26E., squalls increasing hi violence until 0th.

At 2 p.m. the ship struck something with her stenipost with BHch force that the man at the helm was thrown to leeward and much damaged. Then endeavoured, to heave the £hlp to on the port tack. The sea coming more from the southward, and blowing heavily from s. and W.i jshe would not lie-to, so brought her round on tiie other tack. At 8 sounded the pumps and found three feet, the ffcip never baymg mode more than half an inch per hour before. dJhpfcd^ juwirt tiie pmpe, an a got wrftK bj 11,39 '5-«9i*tnt to rest at 1 a.m. 3 feet of water again to the wcITf jffifiLediately manned the pumps and bore up for Guam, that being tbe nearest land tbat possibly could bo made, trusting to arrive ocftrte |he veasel sunk. The ship certainly struck upon ft rock, as on 39th, the leak greatly increased, and the stem post was badly shattered. Com menced to break out the after hold, and throw overboard all the sugar that could be got at ait, not being able to open the main hatch ; lightened the vessel two met aft Leak atill increasing ; carried as much sail as possible. On l&th; November, in latitude 10.42, longitude 145.06, wind more moderate, aea running violently and the leak increasing. On 14th, at 2 p.m.. made the island of Guam, abaped a .counc lor the lec ode of the island for the purpose of bcaching the ship : at 4.30 p.m. struck soundings ana got out tbe boats, the alup then four feet by the head. At 5 p.m., all the men entered the boats, the captain remaining on board until the ship was a cable's length from the shore. After all were in the boats, made an attempt to land but the surf prevented them ; pulled all night and the next day round the island until 2 p.m., when being on the north ride the three boats separated and the men, all sorely fatigued, made another attempt to land in which one boat was capsized, and Sirs. Simcscn, tue cook, and steward, were drowned. A most distressing incident here occurred. Tne captain succeeded in getting his wife a foot hold when a sea again took bcr from hjm, and she was not seen jyjain notwithstanding his strenuous endeavours to pick bcr up. The captain and five men were landed from this boat, and shortly alter tbe gig arrived and landed five more men .in safety, being tbe whole complement of the crew. On the following 'day the captain and two men proceeded to Agana for assistance. 17\. M. ships Niger, Captain Cracroft, and Miranda, Captain Glynn, returned from the Waitaro, yesterday forenoon. Niger dropped down from Onchunga on Saturday, but, in consequence of the threatening appearance of tbe weatner, brought up below Popongi for the night. Both ships, accompanied by Fawn, Captain Cator, proceeded to sea, in company, on Sunday morning. Niger had scarcely crossed the bar when some part of her long tried and well worn machinery gave to, and she made tbe best of tbe difficulty, under which ehe was placed, under her foreand aft canvas. Miranda by ^igitalt proceeded on her course, and in nbout an hour and a half Nlgcrs intelligent and indefatigable engineers had the ship again under steam, enabling her to fctch Waitara at 9'30 a.m, on Monday morning, Miranda folio King shortly afterward*. Itolh vcesclfl were prompt and cnergctic in taking thcil troops aboard, Captain Glynn affording every pos sible asiiistnnco. Niger embarked forthwith Colonel Leslie, and 473 officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers of tbe 32ib , and 40th regiments, Miranda finding accommodation for nearly an I equal numbi r, with whom they arrived in the Manukau, all well, I veaterday shortly after noon. The troops were at once discm- ! barked, and pitched their tents at Onchunga, from whence two companies ofthe G5th regiment, in command of Captain M'Grcgor, I marcbtd into Auckland yesterday morning. This trip will, we ! undct rtand, be the last or poor olcf Niger under her present com- | mission, now within a few days of five years duration, eighteen months of which have been de\otcd to the service of New Zealand, j The ship is much in want of an overhaul, and her machinery has I been pretty well used up. .She will leave us for England, much I to the regret of our universal public, in the course of a few days. Lieutenant Garforth of the I'eiorus is about to join the Niger, whilst Mr. White of the Niger is about to be transferred to the Felonjs. Fawn was going into Waitara as Niger left. She will, wc believe, bring up the Jioyal Artillery. — -Vfic Zealaudcr.

Wonga Wonga, appeared on information sworn to bv Mr. James M&cfarlanc;, Immigration officer, for breach of the 14tn section of the Colonial Passenger Act, Mr. Mallenon appeared for the defence. Mr. Macforlanc stated that ou the 25th ultimo he cleared out the steamship Wonga Wonga, bound for Sydnev. lie found pareengen; equal to &4 adults in the steerage, and ll'in the intermediate, and on muttering them discovered that there were 33, independent of the above, without tickets, bcini? 31 in excess, lie cautioned tbe captain, and told him not to proceed ; if he did, he mufct take the consequences. Henry llubbard, sworn : I aro asfisUmt-immipration officer. At the mustcringof the passengers on board tlie Wonga Wonga, on the 25th ultimo, 1 found seventy-five adults and eighteen children, being equal to 64 adults in the glccr&gc.; i have sincc measured the intermediate and steerage accommodation of the *hip for passengers. I heard Mr. Macforlanc say 'If you go on, you must stand the consequences.' Patrick Morncnc, sworn. — 1 assisted in mustering the passenger* on board tbe Wonga Wonga on the 25tb ultimo, and found 32 adults and 2 children, being equal to S3, without tickets. 1 afterwards observed the chief onlcer issuing tickets to some of them. Mr. Mallcson then ad dressed tbe liench for the defence, stating, among other observa tions, that Captain Walker bad been entrapped into this by Mr. Macfarlanc, who was a new hand at his business and carried out the old adage ' that new brooms sweep clean,' and that he would call in Coptain Walker to prove what he had stated. Mr. David Walker, swom.— I am commandcr of the 6tcamship Wonga Wonpiu On Thursday week, before leaving the pier, I met Mr. Macfarlanc, who said to mc, ' 1 wish to muster your passengers ; you had therefore better put off from the pier, hut do not go too far.' J did so, and steamed out a distance of about half a mile. 1 then instructed my officers, the chief officer in particular, to muster the passengers aft, and render all assistance to the immigration officer's boat's crew in doing so. On this being done, I told mychicfofficcrto allow those who bnd tickets to pass forward, and those without ts 6top aft. Air. Macfarlanc then said tome 41 You have an exccsa of paF.FOTvgcrs : we will count those without tickets.' I assisted him in doing so. Mr. Macfarlanc, after making some calculations, taid, ' Your complement has already passed ; I counted thirty.'' ) said, ' 1 shall cither go back to the pier or anchor the vesscL' He replied, ' You may do as you please, but I must take care of myself,' not giving me any advice or expressing any wish that J should land these passengers. He then descended the bridge with me, and we went into the saloon, where, having partaken of some slight refreshments, he signed tbe lists, 1 said, ' Is it all right ? Am I to go back and land them or not ! ' to which no reply was made. Mr. Macfarlanc, Mr. Hubbard, and wlf then went on deck, and I had no further conversation with him. He then went into his boat.— By Mr. Mallcson — 1 was very much surprised to find a mmznonfi waiting for mc. Mr. Broad has, 2 think, on two different occasions, caused mc to land passengers prior to signing my papers. I could have carried fifteen in tbe saloon, but there was ample room without making any further proxision tor them. ]n the main hatchway there were only a few boxes of luggage. 1 have frequently taken pilots to the Heads. They have never been reckoned among the passengers.— Mr. Frcver, J.P.—1 That did not come within the meaning of the act. Therefore they could not be counted as passengers.— By Mr. Mallcson — Thirteen ot the passengers were for Twofold Bay, a distance of 330 miles (which doee not bring tlds place withia the meaning of the act). Captain Walker then, remarked that he had been entirely misled by the immigration officer. Frequently he had carried a number of passcagen who had not been booked at the office, a list of whom was handed to (he immigration officer on the return trip. I)f the Bench: Lately the passengers have not been mustered. By Mr. Mallcson : The pasM&gcrs; could have occupied a portion of the after hatch way ; b few minutes only would have sufficed to clcar it away. I requested Mr. Macfarlane to state to the steerage passengers that they could occupy the intermediate and main hatchway if they required It Mr. X Drown, chief officer, corroborated the state ment* made by Captain Walker. The Bench considered it a hardship, but they were compelled to abide by the Act, and fine the defendant £5 for each of the eighteen passengers in excess (tbe remainder, having been landed in Twofold li&y;, not coming under the Act). They also stated that the only remedy Captain Walker had was an appeal to the Governor in Council, and which his eoUcitoi stated would be followed out. The Marquis of Argyle, Captain Monro, from this port for Lon don, encountered a violent hurricane, which lasted twenty-six hours, on the 2nd and 3rd December. The following interesting account, as detailed by Captain Monro, is taken from Afifcfctrs Jlcpithr of February 23rd I have experienced several hum ' cfinc-s but I think none of them blew so hard. The ocean was one vast sheet of foam and spray, and tbe waves rolled in mountainous, or rather pyramidical heaps, resembling the Alps or Peal: of Tcne fifle. Tlie wind keeping so steady from N.S. W. for twelve hours, and the ship running E.N.E. at tiie rate of eleven to twelve miles per hour, I apprehend the course of the cvclonc to have been E.N.E. and N.N.E., and its rate of travelling fifteen to twenty miles i-cr hour. As the meteor passed onward, or got ahead of the «hip, Uie wind gradually veered round to the south* when it be came moderate/ When the tempest appeared to be at its greatest height, occasionally (for a minute or so; in the zenith an opening took place in the low, murky sky, showing the azure of the firma ment. When these openings occurred tbe gusts of winds were, if josfiiblc, more severe. I have noticcd this in similar storms. As at the commencement and during the continuance of former hur ricanes cxjwriebccd by me, which was again verified in this, I have a full conviction these furious tempests originate or are caused by an cxcese — a large surplus accumulation of electricity in the atmosphere over, or nearly over, the locality where they burst forth. When this storm was beginning, numerous spiral columns of lightning darted^ or rather wheeled, down from the firmament, the whr-clings being (to appearance) of ven* large dimensions. After dark the same evening the surface of the sea presented the phenomenon all round, of numcroua balls of fire, about the sizeof 6ix-pound shot. The barometer, afternoon of the 2nd, was 29'40, aud it fell during the hurricane to 28*20. It began to rise again before there was any perceptible abatement of the wind's force. It rose from one to one and a half tenth of an inch per hour. During the fury of this tempest (about G a,ro. of the 3rd), when the low, murky atmosphere was so commingled with Uie epray of the ocean, that we could not see beyond a mile in any direction, wc approached close to a berg (ice island) of from *4 I to b miles in length, and from IA to 2 miles in breadth. I Its sides and ends were square, right porpe&dicular.; and smooth, i as if cut by an ice-saw. The surface or top was slightly convex : in form, and all solid ice, of a blueisb colour. Its height above I water would be at least 150 feet. I have seen a great many ice I bcrvs in Baffin's Ilav, and on the banks of Kewfoundlana, but such a magnificent floe, or block of ice, afloat, 1 have not before seen. About l£ mile distant, south of iL was another berg, upwards of a mile long. It was much higher above water than the large one, and tbe surface or top was hummocky. We went betwixt tho two. Before noon, while the storm and dark weather still continued, we passed seven more bergs. On the parallel of 53 degrees S., betwixt the meridians of 150 degrees W. and 142 degrees W., wc passed no fewer than 05 ice islands. Ifod the weather been clear during the gale, we probably should have 6een as many more, for, from 2 a.m. of December 2 (the preceding day) to 3 p.m. (i. e., 18 hours* time) wc passed, on either band, 65 bergs. Imminent indeed la the risk and danger to rbips from these ice islands in dark weather, or in the dcnscncss of a snow- storm. At the time wc noared the above-mentioned prodigious glacier (for wc were running right upon it), had a thick snow shower, of even 8 or 10 minutes' duration, been passing over, instant destruc tion would have been inevitable, j have no doubt many missing ships have perished— suffered the dread catas trophy of being dashed to pieces— by collision with some one of these ice islands, in circumstances somewhat akin to that I have narrated. I have run ca6t, on the same parallel, and about the same season of the vcar, twice before, hut 1 have not seen a tenth part of the bergs discovered on this passage. From the above-mentioned meridian, namely, 142 degrees W„ until wc got round Cape Horn, we did not see any more bergs. | The Lower Tubon.— As a proof of what increased population ! may cffect, on partially worked gold- fields, I may instance the fact that the Chinese have almost deserted Opmr and the con tiguous creeks, and settled in great numbers (estimated at 600) on Uie Lower Turon and Macquarie rivers ; where, by the magnitude of their works, their numbers and perseverance, they are setting an example to many of the old professional river-diggers of the anti -co-opcrativc principle, who have comparatively been scratch ing on the bars of tbt aforesaid river, still to leave the 'piles,' to an inferior and alien race : Who. combined la large parties, are now sluicing tlie ripple beds ' right on a face,'1 and obtaining from £1 to £1 10s. per man daily, whilst many Europeans ore wondering about, from placc to plaoc, wondering where to set in to w*ork. It Is by no means impossible, therefore; noticing such instances of revived activity, and remuneration iii conscqucnce, that many places within a convenient distanpc of t.hfa town may yet turn out very profitably to enterprising prxties, even thougn they may at the present umc be termed 4* worked out.'— ftjf*- rctpctniciif of Bathurst Frc*.
