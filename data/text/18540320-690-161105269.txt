In (he month of March, therefore, you will have a treble mail from England, Xum also happy to tell you that the February mails will be taken l-y our ehip the Bosphorus, sister to the Het. lesponr, and now jutt returned after an excellent passage from India. She will sail for Adelaide, Port Phillip, and Sydney, on the 4th February, but our negotiations with the Government are not yet sufljeientlj, matured to enable us to say whether we shall have a permanent contract for carrying the mails every alternate month. The Boa.r«),a6 you will infer from the foregoing remark, are actively occupied La considering the terms upon which they nie6, and they have reason to hope that tlmr negociations will come to a favourable issue, By their present arrangements, the Ci as us wi!l be followed by, the Busphorus on the 4th February, nnd the Golden Fleece in April, with the Jason in June. And you act upon tMs.ed vice bj publicly announcing the sailing of the ships in that order.' . ... .-. .
