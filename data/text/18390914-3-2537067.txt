[ADVERTISEMENT.] SELECT POETRY. BY BEVERLEY SUTTOR. To the public I just wish to say, I'm going to publish another poetic lay; Of some poems I have written a few, The subjects varied and anew. As Paul Pry says, "I hope I shan't intrude," My lines are penned in gratitude, Thanking you for all te favors past, While I respectfully inform you, I sincerely hope 'twill not be the last My humble efforts will gain from you, And trust your minds are all at ease, Satisfaction's what I want to give, For all my endeavour's been to please, And in your estimation live, I pray you be a little kind, And if there's aught I've said that can offend you, Banish the intention from your mind, While my lines for more support I send you; Being my very first production, You'll own with much I'd to contend. And hope you'll make a fair deduction, Determined my humble efforts to befriend. Believe me when I say I've no desire To give offence to any one, And rather than excite your ire, I court the favour of every one. The public taste you know is varied, Every one can't think the same, Flowers are numerous and very varied, Yet all are sweet, and smell the same, Although they bear a different name, Some like the lily, some the rose; The one blows fresh, the other fair, While one the fairest beauty chose, The other chose the darker fair. Each lovely in its own sphere is placed-- Each its own peculiar sweetness has supplied, And 'tis not because wine varied taste That the meed of admiration should be denied, To one or other of this earth's production, Each has its share of Nature's function. Some take their share in civil toils, Some in field like sports; Some take tbe field in warlike broils, Some delight to move in Courts, Some o'er the face of Neptune soar, And brave the depthless deep, And bravely fight their country's war, While others on the land will keep, Each has its goodness in its own peculiar way, Some fam'd for shrewdness--some for milder sway. In short, there's such variety 'twould tire to tell you more, I could write to all eternity which perhaps might prove a bore. In one word, then, I thank you all, Many thanks I've got in store, And hope you'll not resist the call, When my lines I send to you for more; Great numbers to me have kindly sent, And said they wished to see, On what my Poetic mind was bent, And what the cost would be. I number'd proudly in my list, both high and low degree, And with respect I now insist That all should buy my poetry. I've representatives of Majesty, And holy men in divinity-- I've Lady's Fair, of worth and greatness, And gallant Knights who share their sweetness, For Civil Officers, and Warriors bold, And those whose coffers are untold; I've Men of Letters, and of Law, And of the divine Doctor-- I've country Squires, and Squires in town, And all professions that are known. From the palace to the lowly cot, Each my little work has got; The list, in short, if I'd room, Would nearly fill a little volume. Now having told you what I've done, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, And hope to have a greater run With the one that's coming out anew. To my old subscribers I intend A copy of my Poems to send, Who no doubt will cheerfully pay, Five shillings for my next poetic lay. To those who have not yet got them, I beg respectfully to say, I will lake care to send them At an early day. We all require sustenance we find, The animal Œconomy can't do without: But 'tis essential that the mind, Be fed as well no doubt, The one sympathises with the other, And this is a homely truth, For if one is only fed, the other Will be of very little worth. So one and all I sincerely hope. You'll never let a Poet droop. Look at some of our Poets of old-- See how they languished, drooped, and died, While Nature's beauties they'd unfold Their wants were scantily supplied. IMMIGRANTS.
