Tho past has been a qniet week in the import market, the doparturo of the European mail and its accompanying engagements having occupied the attention of merchants woll into the week. Thero has boon no desire for speculation cvinced, and business throughout has lieen confined to country houses and New Zealand shippers. Very few cliangos have occurred ; pricos generally, if not showing any npward tendency, have, at all events, been pretty steadily maintained. In bulk ale, Bass's has lightly doclined.

Mercury of tlio former date : — Wo cannot report any improvement in trade to day, but wo heard of some sales of wheat aud wool. Tho Rales of the latter wero ut Is lAd and Is 2d ; they were small clips, and the first that have changed hands this season.- The wheat ranged from 53 64 to 5s 9d. Hay continues to arrivo in small quanti ties, and loose realised from £5 to £G. For pressed a better demand exists just now, owing to tho de mand for tho trading vessels, and last salc3 of hydraulic pressed wcro made at £7 53. Tho Cornwall Chroniclc, of tho 25th, says : — Wheat continues scarce and is advancing iu value, 5s 2d per bushel has been offered for a largo parcel and refused. Oats aro on the decline, and some parcels have been disposed nt from 5s 3d to 5s Gd per bushel. Bran remains at Is 4d. Flour, £12 por ton. Potatoes aro declining in value, and are now offerod at £4 to £4 10s per ton, bags in. Advance on Wool Freioht. — Considerable dis satisfaction lias beon cansed by tho fact that the freight on wool by the Martha Birnie aud Ca'.liance, now lying alongsido tho Yarra street wharf, has been raised from three farthings to seven-eighths of a penify per lb ; wliilo it is alleged that tho Donald Mackay nnd other vessels iu Hobson's Bay take it at three farthings, and pay tho lighterage to Melbourne into the bargain. On the other hand it is alleged that the Donald Mackay is tho only vessel loa4ing at tho lower rate, nnd that when sho is filled up tliero will bo a further rise to a ponny. Iu tlio face of theso conflicting statements we hesitate beforo affix ing blame upon the agents of the ships here. — Gee long Advertiser, November 28.
