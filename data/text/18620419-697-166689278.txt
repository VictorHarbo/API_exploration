Fawn has returned to her moorings in Farm Core from the Government Dock. The American sehooncr lately purchased by the Government as a pilot vessel, was taken down the harbour and outside some short distance, on the 12th, Captain Towns and the Harbour Master being on board. There was a fair sailing breeze, the wind being from tbe southward. The Mcl&nic;, lately rigged as a three mosted schooner, went down with her, but was of course ill adapted to test the wc&therly; qualities of the pilot ves&cL; TbeLochiuvar left Adelaide on the 24th ultimo, and had light weather nearly all the passage.

His Ex cellency 6ii John Young landed immcdiatclv on the Pelorus coming to her anchorage. ILM. ships Pelorus and Fawn manned yards, and & salute was fired from the Fawn, which was returned by the Pelorus. The schooner Native L&ss;, Captain Stafford, from Newcastle, coal-laden, bound to Melbourne, put in here on Sunday morning to 'repair. The damages this vessel has lately sustained are numerous. In the first place, her windlass is disabled, bowsprit sprung, foremast and forcy&rd; quite rotten, and chain plates carried awar ; the pumps are likewise in bad condition, and the onlv boat on board Is unseaworthy. To add to the misfortunes, the* ship is leaky.

She is seven ty-ninp feet in length, eighteen feet beam, and eight foot hold, with a draft of water, when loQdcd, of seven and a half feet ; she is built entirely of hardwood, and Is coppered and coppcr-fastencd throughout, and from tbe style in which she came up the harbour will prove a. remarkably fast vessel. The schooner Venus, supposed to have been lost in the late gale, was the property of Mr. Dawson, of this city. She was com manded by Captain Farrcr. owner of the Edward cutter, which vessel was aleo out in the gale, and is missing. The Julia llcyuc left Newcastle on tho 2nd Instant, with a fine breeze atN. W«, and was off Bateman's Bay when she met the. late southerly gale, which came on so suddenly that both topsails were blown away, and the vcs«el was compelled to run before the gale for twenty-seven hours before It was deemed prudcat to heave-to, by which time she was abreast of Tort Stephens.

Bv the arrival of some of tbe vessels which were compelled to make for Port Stephens on Sutidav last, we are placed i& posses sion of further particulars of tiic wreck of tho Ccmberland schooner, Ac. It appears that those on board the ElCb ketch, which crossed over the spot where tho Cumberland went' down, almost immediately after tbe occurrence, saw the crew of tbe schooner clinging to tbe wreck, but owing to tho frighlf&l; sea running, it was impossible to render the slightest help, Onotrc meudous sea struck tho Elfin herself snd washed two of her crow overboard. Tbe ketch was stunned for an instant, and her pro gress thus being temporarily arrested, the two men wore exacted to scramble on board again, and were thus rescued from the f&te; that had just overtaken their comrades. Tbe same wave that washed tuc men overboard, carried nway a large portion of the Elfin's stern. Tbe Herculean schooner lost her foreran], and seve- - ral of the other vessels sustained more or less ' damage. One vessel—the Venus, a small sehooncr, that left herb* ou Saturday with 64 tons of coal, and was driven back by the* gale— has not since been heard of. She was seen to bear up in tfcd direction of Fort Stephens, and tb&t; is the last that is known of her. It Lb feared that she, too, has been losL On Thursday evening, a party ' of the friends of Mr. Farror, the master of the Vcnusj -started to proceed along the coast to Fort Stephens, aud yesterday morning, Davey, one ©f the water police, went from here about twelve ' miles along the beach, where he met a mounted troopcrydtepatehed by Afr. Sub'-InEpector Husscy from Kayutood Terrace, who woe to follow the coast to Port Stephens. Davey, who went tbe same road on Tuesday, stales that he observed yesterday, about ten miles away, the remainB of a vessel firmly Imbedded in tkb saod, the top of her painted green, with & white riband round. He did sot remark her there on Tuesday, but coxswain Donaghueinelincsi to the belief that the wreck is one that was there some twelve inontli6 buck, and might have got covered with the sand* which had been washed off within the lust three days by the strong 'surf breaking upon the shore. The report of the mounted trooper Will he made fionr Raymond Terrace.— Kctvcaallc Chronicle of lflhV Tjie Veni's, Srnoonp.R.— No further tidings have been obtained1 of this vessel, which it is to l-o feared must have perished. Hugh1 Gilmorc and the other friends of Farrar, the master, returned from their search on Sunday, having followed the coast line as fcc as Banna Bay, wftbout finding any signs which could lead to the* certainty of the wreck ; but racy found at tbe Sand Hills several' pieces of bulkhead, painted a dirty yellow, lying strewn about the beach. Near there, a part of the Cumberland's boat, with the name puinted on tbe stern, was seen.— Kc\cea*tle Chronicle, NEWCASTLE. ARRIVALS.

Reported Wreck.— On Saturday afternoon it was reported, on tbe alleged authority of a lcttci: from a lady at the coast, that the Sea Gnu, & large English immigrant vessel, bad boeii dismasted in the Straits, and that the nasf *agcrs were being landed at tbe Don. Many persons supposed that: the vessel was the Lady Egidia, and those who had relations or a board were thrown into a state of great distress concerning their supposed fate. There was just the slightest grain of tr ath for this report. The Mayflower met the Sea Gull in the S trails, bound from Canada to Now Zealand* She was un- Yer jurvmasts, and making for Portland Bay, having been die' jiasted about 2000 miles off the Australian coast. The wife of 1 jbc captain being in a critical state of health, a passage was prov jded for him and his wife in the Mayflower, and they were landed at the Don, On Saturday night the import was wholly disbelieved, as, upon reference to the English files, no vessel named 1'ne Sea Gull had sailed for Australia cither in November, December, or January.— Jlolart Town Mercury, Aprils. 9 Captain Patrick, of the Kccra (6.), rcportg that, half-way between C*'«pe sbanck and the Heads, he saw a spar on end, about Rlx feet above w ter in the boUow of the sea.
