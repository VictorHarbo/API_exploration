TfiE POPtfliATION OF TUBKEY. ill 'EkTSf&OKT;^VKAKX MtiirjBE OF BACES. The'TarMs|i!^niat6ir'-of Finance ; issued -in 1867 a ktatistical notice inVhich the pppnlation of Turkey is placed ati8,SbO 000 for Europe; 165001,000 for Asia^FithlCyprus j and5JtXK))€03 tor Africa, making a total of 4O,O00,Op0:f or th©' Sinpire. But from this number must be xle ducted, 9,000,9^ or f more properly 10,000,000 as belonging to 'the tributary states. This would lea«re 13;000.000 5a Europe, 16,600,000 in Asia, and only 750,000 in Africa, In this computation, Eoumania is taken at 4,500,000 Servia at 1,260,000 for Turkey in Europe is however, too high, and when checked by the local '.salnamehs' and other information «riust be reduced to about 11,000,000. ' Messrs TJbicini and' Conrteille put the total population oE the empire, exclusive of the tributary states, at 28 600,000. From similar sources of information, it appears, that Turkey contains about 13,500,000 of the oonquering race, tho remaining 15 ,000,000 being an agglomeration of races o? different origin, language, and religion, some 6,000,000 of theaa being Mohammedan. In Europe Turkey, however, there are only about 2,000,000 of Osmanlis, sparsely settled; whereas in Asia, and in Asia Minor, thera is a compact mass ot 10.000.000 or U.'OOO.OOO. As this fact is gener ally overlooked in proposala for driving the Turksoutof Europe at any eosfc,perhaps&t; would be wiser to include in such proposala & few suggestions for dealing with 'the Osmanlis on the other side of the Bosphorus, instead^ o finding it better not to touch. Asia. To the aame group belong some 500,000 Tuacomang in Asia, and some 200,000 Tartars from Europe iu the Crimea. The Greeks do not seem t number more than l-,O0O,O00 in Aaia, and 1,000,000 chiefly along the coast and in the islands. The Albanians, although they differ so materially from the Greeks, are usually in cluded in the (Jreco- Latin group. They have been variously counted, but form prebably 1,060,000, Qf whom nine-tenths av5 Mjihomedan. The Coutzo-Wajlaohs, akia to ths Wallaohs :of : Boumania, are estimated at; 200,090 south of the Balkan. : The -250,000- of *f oppressed' Wallaehs in Servia are generally -overlooked in stating the population ol tnfi* 'country, rhe Slav group must be- divided. , into Serba and Bulgaxiana, the former more or leas filled with the Servians, who ?- are Se?bs and the latter a supposed Turanian race with a Slav -langupge and a Slav admixture. Statistics place the Sorbo-Croats at 1,500,000, of whom, however, only a short million -would appear to be Christ ian. The Bulgarians are estimated at 3.000,000 Of whom a, large portion, or even nearly half, is Bouth of Balkan, Then there are some 50,000 Cossacks and Iapovann, who have been at various tinaes driven out of Eussian territory by the persecutions against the ?_' old belijvera' of the Greek Church. The Turkish Govern-, ment acknowledges the colonisatipu of -695,000 Circassians in Bulgaria, Albania, and along the Servian frontier,, and also an immigration of. about 400,000 into Asiatic Turkey. In European Turkey therj are about 500,000 of Armenians chiefly in Constantinople and a few large towns, whereas in Asiatic Turkey - there are 2,000,000. To the same i ethnographic, group belong 1,000,000 of Ottonian Kurds in Asia, who are Mahomeda-ns,- :but often hostile to the Osmanli. Lastly, there are in European Turkey a bout 200,000 Mahpmedan gypsies and more than 100,000 Jews of Spanish descent, and in Asiatic Turkey about 1,500,000 of the Semitic group. . . It has been iound that gasses of-sach- a dele' teiious character emanate from ^he raalts and brick-lined graves in the Melbourne Cem*efcery Jthat.the City Council determined to call upon the trustees, to issue an order for the: whole-1 of them being filled up- with dry earth. ' In ail.poiiciea of. life linsurancfe these afcapug a host of^other^tjiiestions! occur: 'Age of father. i£ Uving? Age of mother, if living; ?' A. man in the country who filled' up an ap plicatioa tnade his father's age 'if hving' one hundred and twelve years/ and his mother's'1 one hundred and two. The agent was amazed at this, and fancied he had secured an excellent customer,'; but feeling somewhat dubious, he remasfced that^tlie applicant came from a very loug-liv-ed family. 'Oh, you see sir,' replied he, 'my parents died many years ago. but *if living' would be aged ss they are' pne down.' 'Exactly — I understand,' saiS the agent. American industry' will largely profit— in- deed, is.profitiiig— by the demand'apon it from Eussia and Turkey for small arms and cartridsr es. We learn that a supply of Colt's Eifla machinery has arrived in Eussia, where it is turning out larafe numbers of rifles for the use ef the army, and that up to Christmas 3,000 000 had been manufactured by them. During the -past year Russia had from another American firm 100,000 pistols- In addition 20^060,000 of the so-called ' Russian Cartridges '* have been madeinBridgeport, Coanecti(*ut,and muchiuery to moke them having been sent to Russia.' 400.000 cartridges are being made daily at St. Petersburg and Moscow. On the other hand' the Turkish Government hare contracted to be supplied with 800,000 Martini-Henri rifles, of ?which 450,000 have akeady been shipped.
