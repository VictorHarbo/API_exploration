GESTLEMEN-I have to acknowledge tho honour of receiving your respectably and numerously signed requisition, soliciting rae to become a Can- didate for the seat in Council for tho representa- tion of tho City, vacated by your-lato member, John Lamb, Esq. I thank you heartily for this distinguished mnrk cf your approval, which, if it could be stamped with higher value, is moro precious to me, beensso you frankly stato it to bo tho result of my public career in connection with the city, and the satisfaction you have felt in my dis chnrgo of tho public duties devolving on me. AVith the Famo spirit of frankness and enndour ?n which you have addressed mc, I accept your in- vitation, confident alike in the sincerity of your expressions of approval, and your promises of support. I ngreo with you, that in tho turmoil of political events which of late yenrshas agitated tho colony, you must have had fair opportunity of judging pretty accurately of the general scope and tonor of my political opinions, und far moro for tho snko ol'thc advancement of those opinions which I hold to bo true, than for the possession of thc honour yon wish to confer upon me, do I rejoice to bear that those opinions aro your own. But nt a time liko this, when political integrity alone can safely pilot thc ship of the'state through tho shoals ana quicksands that surround it, it would not be just in mo to withhold a definite expression of my principles from those who do not know mo as well ns you do. Fortunately this mnv bo done very briefly, as tho great questions wfiich interest thc people of this colony are mainly important through their cxtrotno simplicity. First, then, I nm an advo- cate for the extension of Education to its utmost limit, and believing tho National System thc only ono which can cifect this leading object, I shall strenuously support it. Second. I believe that any system which shuts up tho land of tho colony from settlement or cultivation is radically bad, and that it must impede if not prevent tho advancement of tho country. At tho samo timo 1 have no hesitation in saying, that those great interests which have grown up with so much advantage'to the colony, ought to bo treated always with a fair und just consideration. Third. I repudiate any system of legislation which shall involve distinctive laws for any, branch of industry, which is recognised or per-' milted, or licensed by the Government, as a colonial pursuit-and consequently, ! beliove tho gold digger to be entitled to all the social and political freedom which is accorded to any other class of her Majesty's subjects. Fourth. I would-assimilate our Constitution as nearly to that of England as possible, always bearing in mind that spirit of progress which ¡B constantly tending in that. Constitution to thc enfranchisement, with political rights, of all-men of mature ngo and untainted by crime. . Fifth. I will advocate to the full extent of my. ability the principle of Free Trade, not only os: it lins been none by the Government, with a view ito tho promotion of commcrce, but nlso' for tho",,] full : ona .fair development of tho treasures of. | our soil. Sixth. I am a friend to religious liberty iii' its fullest sense, but I think thia liberty may bo best preserved by every sect separately, maintaining its own ministry and ordinances ; nt the same time I will advooate a fair divi- sion of the sums reserved for religious pur Eoaes, to all sects alike, until a wise and. better support to religión shall ' havo been established. These are the leading principles which will govern roy conduct in the Council should you elect me. For industry and energy in carrying ont the details which these principles involve, I appeal to that experience of my past public life, which bas invested me with that confidence you have been pleased to place'in me. I hare the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Respectfully, Your very faithful servant, W. THURLOW. To Thoma? Hyndes, Fsq., and the other Electors of the City of Svdney signing the above Requisition._*_2329 TO THE ELECTORS OF THE CITY OF SYDNEY. GENTLEMEN-I have been unexpectedly in rited, by the usual form of requisition from au influentia'l. number, of your body, to oder myself as a candidate for the seat in your repre- sentation which has become vacant by thc resignation of our late excellent member, Mr. Lamb. For the last few. years I have taken an active part in thc public movements of this city, and, by this gratifying recognition of my humble services, I feel flattered into the hope that ray etlbrts have been in some measure conducive to the public benefit. During1 that time, I have never thought of stepping aside from what I believed to be my path of duty, to Beek for office or mark of distinc- tion at the hands of my fellow citizens ; and there are those among you who know how ar- dently I have desired, on tfce present occasion, to see a candidate, with higher abilities to serve you and stronger clnims to your support, brought forward for your suffrages. Tho principles which I hold necessarily lead me to fii the standard of qualification for n Representative far above my own estimate of my capncity to fill with credit and usefulness that dignified and respon- sible office. Besides a sense of my own unfitness, the anxiety which 1 feel in the discharge of other important duties would urge mo to decline tho invitation with which 1 have been honoured, if 1 could feel assured that the public interests would be committed to bauds abler and more willing than mine to promote and defend them. As it is, I do not feel warranted in taking any other course than acceding to your requisition. After much thought, and.consulting with friends on whose advice I set much value, I have made up my mind, in good faith and with a firm purpose, to place my services at'yóür . disposal. Should your choice, on tho dajr of polling, bo in my favour, my limited abilities shall be steadily and faithfully employed, in my new .sphere of action, to ad yanco the "prosperity and-, freedom of the country. It now becomes necessary for me to explain and i will do-EÓ'as^briefiy as I can-the principles wliic.h will regulate my publie conduct« if elected to the distinguished post of your Representative. Throughout ray lifo I have' advocated tho exten- sion of political power to the great body ol tho people. The experiences ?' of ? every day have tended to confirm my adherence.to those prin- ciples of Progressive.. Reform which are now admitted to be tho best safeguard of our British institutions, and tho brightest glory of our national charactor. I am an advocate of the National System of Education, believing it to bo the best plan hither- to, devised for extending to all classes the advan- tages of knowledge-that greatest blessing of civilised society. I would extend the political franchise, that this great social blessing might follow, as well as on the ground of inherent right ; for, assuredly we must look for enlightenment ns tho fruit, not walt to'see it'planted hs the root,-of sound and rational liberty. n As a leading principle, I would make popula- tion tho basis of the representation, BO that honest action might be given to a liberal franchise, in the electoral- decisions of tho country. lam prepared to carry out to my utmost in colonial legislation, the principles of that Free Trade Policy of tho Imperial Parliament, which has already produced such magnificent results for the advancement of British commerce. I am'. opposed to all State endowments for Religious purposes ; but so long as the existing Schedule for Church support is contiuued, I will, if elected, vote for an equitable distribution ot' the public money to all Denominations. These general statements of the principles which I entertain, will indicate how I should be likely to net in tho Council with reference to particular measures of legislation; but in those opportunities of intercourse which will occur before the day of election, and on the Hustings, 1 shall be happy to explain my views, on any public question, to those of your number who tuny wish to ascertain more fully my opinions. I nm called upon-without any motion of my own-by a voice which I do not feel nt liberty to disobey to submit my claims to^your judgment. 1 know 1 must abide by your decision. My public conduct is before yon," and open to the canvass of all ; ray sentiments have been frequently expressed, and nt all times without disguise or fear. I only ask for myself, io be dealt with impartially; I only ask of you, to voto so as to satisfy your consciences and serve our country. I have thc honour to bc, Gentlemen, Your very faithful sorvnnt, HENRY PARKES.
