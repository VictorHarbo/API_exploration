It is, in fact, the perfection of Gas Lighting. By its use a dull and wavering light is rendered intensely bright and steady, and this delightful improvement is effected simply by causing the gas to pass through a metallic vessel containing a specially-prepared substance called Albo-Carbon, which, being vaporised by the heat of the gas flame, so enriches the gas as to raise its illumination to the highest power. 4000ft, of Also Carbon Gas is equal to 3000ft. of ordinary gas. Two-thirds the number of burners dispensed with. A remarkable advantage is the diminution of heat, and the escape of vapours so DELETE- RIOUS to HEALTH. This invention can be applied to ordinary gas fittings. BELMONT HOUSE, PRIVATE BOARDING ESTABLISHMENT, CORNER OF' MARGARET AND YORK STREETS, Wynyard Square, Sydney.
