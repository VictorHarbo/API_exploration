WRECK OF THE ELIZABETH SELDOK.

She was in the breakers before the crew were aware of their close proximity to land, and falling broadside on the beach, soon became a total wreck ; fortunately all the crew, con sisting of the captain and seven men, with great difficulty got on shore sale. They made at once for Mr. Hargr ave's residence, who kindly shewed tbem every attention in his power, and the follow ing day sent a boat off to the Paterson (s.), then on her voyage to Newcastle, where Captain Quaile sent his boat and brought them en board, taking them on to Newcastle, when they were transferred to the Williams (s.), and arrivedin Sydney on the 9th, The Elizabeth Scldon was a fine schooner of 130 tons, the pro perty of Sir. Seldon, of this city, and wc believe was insured for £i€G0.

The Treasury, Queensland, 26th November, 1801. His Exccllcncy the Governor directs the .publication of the fol lowing sailing directions for entering Broad Sound. Chails may be obtained upon application to the Harbsur Master, Itockhampton, or at the Treasury, Brisbane. R. R. Mackenzie. DIRECTIONS. The entrance of Broad Sound it- between the North Point Islands and West Ilill, a remarkable mount, bearing W. by N, | N., twenty miles from the western North Peint Island. The numerous creeks with which Broad Sound is intersected arc mostly diy at low water, affording entrance only to boats, which of necessity must ground at every tide. The best anchorage for coasting vessels on the west side of the Sound is that in the mouth of the Styx, in three fathoms at low water,— See chart. In approaching Broad Sound £ good look-out should be kept for the numerous rocks and shoals in its vicinity ; enter between the North Point Islands and the Flat Islands, where there is a channel of fourteen fathoms, wbich decreases quickly on ap proaching the Upper part of tbe Sound; after paswng about mid way between those islands, steer s. £ E. about sixteen miles, until Pine Mount bears E. by S., which will be about six miles from the shore, in six and a-half fathoms ; and from thence steer S. E. or for the Upper Head, where a vessel may lie in saifcty at about one mile to the eastward of the nead in four fathoms. All vessels trading to Broad Sound should be well supplied with good ground tackling. M. S. Rvndle, Harbour Master, Rockhampton. — Courier, December 4. The Hotbam returned yesterday afternood' from her trip to the northward. — Courier, November 29.

Tbe Vanquish and Black Diamond were at Maryborough. The Vanquish ex pected to sail for Sydney, with timber, about Tuesday.— Courier* Collision.— The Breadalbane, on Thursday afternoon, as she was nearing M'Cabc's Wharf, with the immigrants, ran into the Flora, doing considerable damage to her side. The Flora was hauling off at the time, but -lid not do so quick enough. The captainof the Breadalbane ordered the engines to be reversed, and did everything in bis power to prevent mischief, or the Flora might otherwise have been ran through,— Moreton Bay Courier , December 7. The Wonoa Wonoa.— Tho South Australian Register of the 27th ultimo gives the following account of the accident which has befallen this vessel : — ' On tne arrival of the above steamer on Sf, 7n~ia& botfa her outward cargo, preparatory to receiving the English mails at the Semaphore Jetty, for King George's Sound. On Monday night the pilot proceeded on board, that every preliminary might be arranged to take advantage of the following morning's tide, ond on that flowing, cargo lighters were alongside prosecuting tbeir work. Some difficulty was experienced in e singing so large a vessel in narrow water ; but this was overcome, and she pre pared to steam through the channcl towards the outer bar. The engines had made several revolutions ahead, when suddenly a whizz and a tremendous motion in the vessel announced some accident, which proved to be the loss^ of the screw, which, by some unaccountable feature, bad vanished from tho aperture, but whether from the breaking of the shaft, or carrying uway the blades, was not ascertained when the shipping re porter's boat left her. It was certain, however, that she was totally disabled ; so the anchor was let go, and the prosecution of the contemplated voyage with the English mail was relin quished nntil some repairs were effected. It has been deter mined to lighten her and to bring her into harbour, for the pur pose of shipping a screw, originally belonging to the Admolla, v liicb, with some alterations, it is considered, will answer the pmiiose. The screw was conveyed to town by rail yesterday afternoon, and the necessary alterations will be performed, by the permission of Mr. C. S. liore, at the engine-works, at the railway terminus, under the directions of Mr. Clark. A lighter wus towca doun for the purpose of lightering the steamer to sixteen feet water, when she will be able to proceed over the inner bar.' Tbe loss of the screw of the above steamer furnished food for all sorts of conjectures as to the causc of tho unexpected accident, as well ae a few novel remedies for its repair. Among the latter, a gentleman resident at the Port, proposed that the steamer should be taken under Leu's Wharf crane, and raised to a sufficient height to*4 put on' the new propeller. But the cause of the break down was not discovered until a diver in harness was lowered 4o the 6pot in Light's Passage, where the fragment of the screw lay. On inspecting it a portion of a Manila or coir hawsor was found to be entangled and entwined round the broken fan. and it became evident that the accident was of a nature that could not possibly have been guarded against ; for it Is evident the hawser was fished round the screw long before the accident, and the vessel, being deep in the water, it was a matter of impossl -blUty for it to he seen from on board. She Is now laid on the river bank in order to ship the fitted Admclls's fan, and all pos sible despatch is being exerted to forward her departure.— South Australian Rcghtert November 30. The American ship Humboldt, which arrived in Hobson'e Bay yesterday afternoon, from Boston, brings a cargo of ice.
