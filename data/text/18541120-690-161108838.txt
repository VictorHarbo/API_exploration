Captain Godfrey.— This favourite and successful commander, who has now for many years been engaged in the Australian trade, was. on the departure of the mail by the Norna, in the London Docks, in command of a magnificent new ship of 1400 tons, pre- paring to sail for this port. The name given to this noble vessel s the George Marshall. Captain Godfrey is expected to arrive here about the end of December, and we are informed that he will sail again for London in all January, with, as usual, a full comple ment of passengers,— Argus, November 15. The Warbler, from Sydney, bound to Adelaide, put In here last evening to repair her pumps, which are choked with sand. Experienced very heavy weather all the passage.— Argus. November 15.

The Arabian.— Another magnificent specimen of naval archi tecture, the Arabian, anchored in Hobson's Bay yesterday, being the sixth of the celebrated White Star line which has arrived during the past month, adding in the aggregate to our population three thou6»nd souls. She has brought 313 passengers, all in good health, after a rapid passage of 85 days, and her commander, Captain Bannatyne, and his officers have received testimonials from all classes of the passengers, complimenting them on the satisfactory termination of the voyage. The Arabian will have quick dospatch from this port, and will return to Liverpool direct, . affording another opportunity to the public for consignments of wool, gold, and other produce, and another competitor in the coming race homeward. — Argus, November 15. The Calcutta cleared at the Customs on Saturday, and sailed for Southampton yesterday morning. She carries home only a small number of passengers from Melbourne, but a very valuable freight, consisting of gold dust to the amount of 89,781 ounces, and specic to the value of £11,550. — Melbourne Herald.

PORTLAND. Arrival.— November 5. Albion,' from London. 6. Champion, from Adelaide. 8. Thomas Lord, from Warrnambool. THE SCUTTLIN OF THE NESTOR. — We mentioned in our last (says the Portland Guardian,) that Captain Brown had been ap- prehended, and was to be brought up on a charge of being con- cerned in the scuttling of the Nestor, immigrant ship. Captain Brown, the carpenter (Jolly), and a newly-appointed second mate (Robertson), were placed in the dock at the police-office on Tuesday, charged with 'unlawfully casting away the British barque Nestor.' The magistrates on the bench were J. Blair, Esq., P. M., S. Lapham, Esq., S. G. Henty, Esq., F. Henty, Esq. The Guardian publishes very lengthy evidence, taken on three suc- cessive days ; but the only new matter that transpired is contained in the following depositions :— T. B. Alexander, Tide Surveyor, deposed : I went on board the Nestor on Saturday morning after she had grounded ; remarked to the captain that it was a bad business ; he replied yes, and thought some of the hands from shore had done it. He said there were some men on shore to whom he had refused to give £50 for the run, and he thought some of them had done it. 'He also said he had a share in the ship, and would be a great loser by it. An Arab, named Selim, deposed that he had been engaged to dive under the ship by the Captain of the Nestor, at the suggestion of the Harbour Master, and was paid £5 for the service. He found the ship bedded in the rock ; tbere were two butts started on the starboard side, one about midships, the other close to the stem-post. He then dived on the port side, and found a hole abreast the poop underneath, about one span from the sand. The copper is off where the hole is, about the size of the hole. Received from the Harbour Master a peg to put into the hole, which was found too large, and had to get it scraped smaller, and went down again, when it was put in the hole. Thomas Ward, one of the Harbour Master's crew, deposed to having seen some augurs lying on the port side of the after hatch, just before the poop. The result of the examination is hot given in the Guardian. WARRNAMBOOL. Akrivals,— November 2. Mariquita, and Thomas Lord, from Heibourne. Departures. — October 29. Mary Smith, for Melbourne. 30. Jessie, for Port Fairy. The Jetty. — This structure was commenced in 1849, and has been dribbled at until about fourteen months ago, when it was given up for want of funds. It was left in a highly dangerous state, with a number of the piles unplanked. During the last nine months, namerous representations have been made to head quarters respecting it, but the promises received in return have no appearance of being fulfilled. The authorities have no excuse in the matter ; in fact, the Collector of Customs and the Harbour Master have had occular proof of this great drawback to the\ business of the port. Tenders were called in July last for con tinuing the Jetty, which, by a stupid round- about away, quite peculiar to Government, were sent to Portland, where plans and specifications were ready for inspection ! Of course it could not be expected that the Government could do so simple a thing as to merely order the plans to be opened for inspection at the Police office h ere. However, despite these difficulties, the work was con tracted for, and the tenders forwarded to head-quarters three months ago, where they will probably remain until the successful contractor is either insolvent, defunct, or has retired from busi ness. — Examiner. ADELAIDE. Arrivals,— November 3. Adelaide form London. 4. Fop Smit, from London; Oceanica, from Glasgow; Steinwarder, from Hamburg; Grenada and Nonpareil, from Melbourne; J. W. A. Lorentzen, from Hamburg. Clearances,— November L Reihersteig, for Valparaiso. 2. Pestonjee Bomanjee, for Colombo. 4. Emily Jane, for Sydney, 7 Packet^, for Sydney. The ship Adelaide, from London, arrived at the Lightship anchorage after a voyage of 97 days. The passage from the meri dian of the Cape has been tempestuous, part of the bulwarks and aniron bunker having been washed away, and the skylight stove in, It will he remembered that the Adelaide left our port about t^o years since (than barque- rigged), with a cargo consisting chiefly of wool, which became on fire from spontaneous combuB tion. By the truly memorable exertioiiB of Captain Tremearne, bis officers, and crew, the Adelaide was Bayed from total destruc tion, and the barque, with the passengers, gold, and other valu able cargo, having reached Port Louis, Mauritius, was there re paired, and eventually thence prosecuted the voyage to England. —S.
