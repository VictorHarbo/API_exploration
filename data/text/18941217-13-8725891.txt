Mr. Monash arrived in Melbourne just before the gold era, and established the well- remembered importing house of Martin and Monash. While never an aspirant tor public life, the deceased gentleman identified himself with the foundation of numerous friendly societies and social institutions. For several years he took part in the inter-colonial chess tournaments as a leading player. In recent years Mr. Monash had retired from active business pursuits. Though for a long time in indifferent health, his death was sudden and unexpected. He leaves a son and two daughters.
