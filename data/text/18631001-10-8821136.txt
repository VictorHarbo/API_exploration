GENTLEMEN,-Your petition to His Excel- lency the Governor was duly published in the Gazette of the 22nd instant.

As one of those petitioners who took con- siderable iuterest in getting up that petition and who saw most of you personally on the subject, I have thought it my duty without any delay to address a letter to the Colonial Secretary, of which the following is a copy: "SIR,- In reference to the Government Notice No. 164 published in the Gazette of yesterday stating 'that the District of New Town being proclaimed a Rural Municipality had been published under a misapprehension.' May I request that you will be good enough to inform me of the nature of that misapprehen sion and in reference also to a conversation I had the honor to have with you on the subject yesterday, will you cause me to be favored with a copy of the letter you received from certain of the ratepayers against the petition, together with the names attached to that letter, in order that I may lay the whole matter before a public meeting of the petitioners. "I have the honor to remain, "Sir, "Your obedient servant, "W. CARTER." "The Hon. the Colonial Secretary. On the receipt of an answer I will imme- diately convene a public meeting of those who signed the petition, that the whole subject may come under its consideration.

By following the directions given with every Packet and Bottle, it can be administered with perfect safety as a FAMILY MEDICINE. AS a guarantee, the original aad genuine bears the words, "F.
