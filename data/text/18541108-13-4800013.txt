She is to be driven by sixteen separate engines, having a total or 5000 horse-power, at the average speed or twenty-five miles per hour, and to have berths and staterooms for 3000 passengers. A few such steamers, placed on the route between here and Panama, would certainly afford great conve niences for passengers. On such a boat, a passen ger could almost imagine himself in a good-sized floating city. - Alta California. PORTLAND BAY. - STRANDING OF THE NESTOR. - We abstract from the Portland Guardian the evidence of the second mate, of the carpenter, and of an able seaman, before the magistrates sitting in enquiry on this matter. There are other parties to be examined. "The examination respecting the stranding of the Nestor, emigrant ship, was con- tinued on the 30th ult., and following day. Henry Morgan deposed that he was engaged in Melbourne as an able seaman for the Nestor, and came round by steamer with the captain to join the vessel lying at Portland. This witness's evidence, as well as that of the carpenter, is to all intents the same as that of the second mate, and is therefore omitted. Allan Robertson, second mate of the Nestor, was examined, ' Came down from Melbourne, with seven others, engaged as able seamen for the Nes- tor. Was rated second mate of that vessel on Friday morning, with sanction of the crew. Was formerly first officer on board the screw-steamer Black Swan. First mate was on shore all day last Friday. Anchor was lifted on Thursday, and was foul, the starboard chain having a turn round the anchor that was lifted. Anchor was let down again without being cleared, by order of the chlef officer. On Thursday night the Harbor Master asked the chief mate if he could not get his anchor cleared. He said not. After some con- versation, the Harbor Master said he would come with his boat's crew in the morn- ing, and clear the anchor for them. The chief officer went ashore that night (Thursday) by leave of the captain, and was to be back in the morning in time for the Harbor Master, but did not return till the vessel grounded on Friday night. Between one and two o'clock on the Friday af- ter I was rated, captain said to me, "Now you know what to do to get the vessel ready for sea.'' Said I did. Captain said he should lie down on the sofa as he was tired, having been up all previous night, and if I wanted him I was to call him. Captain gave strict orders not to allow any boat to come alongside without calling him. Do not think the captain was called till about tea-time. I and the carpenter took tea with the captain between six and seven o'clock. Went out on the deck at differ- ent times to see that all was right. Captain talked about the ship, and remarked how she was pitch ing. Do not know that the pumps were sounded. At nine o'clock wound up my watch, and went for- ward to set the watch. Captain was lying on the sofa smoking a cigar. Morgan came on watch. Went in the cabin to go to bed. Car- penter had just turned into bed as I got into the room. Carpenter was sober in my opinion. As I was just turning into bed the boy came and said the captain wanted to see me and the carpenter. The captain asked when the ship was pumped out. I said on Wednesday morning. He said the ship seemed to have a strange motion while he was lying on the sofa, and he ordered me to go forward and call the peo- ple to have the ship pumped out. While I was standing waiting for the men, the captain came forward and said " Lads, there is a strange motion in the ship : pump her out, and then my mind will be at ease. " The first question I heard was "Car- penter, have you sounded the pump?" and on going round saw the carpenter with the line in his hand, and heard him say " Ten inches." Cap- tain was in tho cabin at the time. That was about half past nine. Captain then said "The ship has a strange motion ; I cannot understand it ; but if that is all the water in her, pump her out dry in the morning, and wash the decks clean." The captain then remarked a second time, he could not understand the motion at all, and said, "Pump the ship out dry, and then my mind will be at ease." After we had pumped, as we had supposed, ten inches out or her, captain ordered to sound again ; when the line was brought up we could not see the water-mark on the rod. Both pumps were then kept going for about three quarters of an hour, and then we thought there must be some- thing wrong. I and others went below with a light, and found the water washing clean fore and aft under the lower deck. I told the captain the state of the ship, who then ordered a signal of dis- tress to be fired to get assistance from the shore to pump out the ship. Went down below again with a lantern, and saw the vessel filling fast. Captain then gave orders to slip the cables ; one of the men did it ; carpenter was under the doctor's hands and unable. Do not think the carpenter was drunk at that time. The captain did not consult with me or the other officers before slipping the chains. The carpenter's tool-chest is in his own cabin, off the cuddy. There is a small after hatch in the cuddy, abaft the mizen mast.'" A survey was held on the vessel on Tuesday, the 31st ultimo, by Captain Fawthrop, harbor-master, the captain of the Maria captain of the Vixen, and the captain of the Panama. The decision was that the Nestor should be pumped out, and then got off. The pumps have been going night and day since, and the depth of water in the vessel has been already reduced, THE GREAT NAVIES OF THE WORLD. - We find in our exchanges a table shewing the extent of the five first navies in the world.

Johanna, arrived yesterday, reports as follows : - "Off the Loo Choo Islands, on the 6th July, saw the British Clipper barque Skimmer Of The Seas hove to, and a Russian frigate near her ; the frigate was also hove to. It was a fair wind at the time at the time, for the barque, They remained in that position four hours, when we lost sight of them." The above statement is corroborated by Mr. Lundlorge, a passenger, - Alta California, August 18.
