DANISH LUNATIC. "THREL APPLES _SINCE THURS D)AY." :\t 1.20 on \Monday morning, Con stable Casey, while on duty in Nelson place, had his attention .drawn to a respectably dressed man in a blue serge suit and white canvas boots, walking with peculiar gait. The officer accosted him, and noticing something abnormal, arrested him and brought him to the lockup. There he gave the name of Gunnar Gunnarson, a Danish seaman, and was charged with having no means of support. Finding the man hungry, the police on night duty shared their "crib" with him, and he ate the food ravenously. Gunnarson's story was to the effect that last Thursday he was discharged from the Sunbury Lunatic Asylum without a penny. His railway fare to Melbourne had been paid. For three nights he had found a camping place somewhere about the Spencer-street station. He asserts that all the food he had partaken of since arrival in the metropolis had been three apples. He had seen the Danish consul, who had directed him to board a foreign vessel on the eve of sailing. He did so, and after a long wait the captain came to him and asked him if he would go to work. . He told the cap tain he was too sick "to turn to," and the former thereupon gave him 2/-.and told him to leave the vessel. He did"so, had been wandering about ever since, and eventually found, his way to Wil liamstown During Monday forenooin he was. brought before Mr` Jackson, J.P., and remanded. By a strange coincidence, Gunnarson was arrested near the same place in 1919, three and a half years ago, by Constable Simpson, when he was sent to Kew Asylum. At Tuesday's court he was again pre sented. Sergeant Boxshall detailed the facts, and explained that he was a pro hibited immigrant. The Danish Consul desired him remanded until a suitable opportunity could be found to deport him overseas: The Bench remanded accused for seven days.
