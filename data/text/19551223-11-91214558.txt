WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING GREETINGS FROM DANISH GYMNASTS Christmas greeting to Canberra friends comes from the Danish gymnasts who visited Canberra for two displays earlier this year. Manager of team, Mr. Erik Flensted-Jensen, says he is very grateful to those people who assisted the Danes while they were here. "Travelling is not the places and things you see, how beautiful and interest- ing they may be, but the people you meet on your way," he writes. "We have had the privilege of meeting the most lovely and inspir- ing people wherever we have been, and among them you certainly are," he said. Ad- vance manager of the team, Mr. Herman Andersen, also sends his thanks, for "your grand hospitality and per- sonal interest." Canberra people took the Danes home for dinner while they were here and some firm friendships were estab- lished. For those who wish to write, the address of the manager, Mr. Flensted- Jensen, is Kongeven 147B, Virium, Denmark, and that of Mr. Andersen is Idraet- shoejskolen, Soenderborg, Denmark.

HEAVY ENROLMENTS TO LEARN TO SWIM Parents who want their children enrolled in the learn-to-swim classes run by the Canberra police, will have to act quickly as the quota of 200 children is al- most filled. The classes, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., will run from January 16 to 26, with about 14 policemen as in- structors. The police deci- ded that a limit of 200 would be set so that there could be adequate individual tuition of each child. Sgt. G. Grove said yesterday he was sorry that more children could not be fitted in, as the number of enrolments had been great. The classes, will be held at both Manuka and the new Olympic pools, Par- ents who have applied for enrolment of their children will receive a letter from the police, stating the time of the class they will attend.

Bushfire Council Christmas message to pic- nickers and holidaying tour- ists. The bushfire danger over Christmas is expected to be moderate, but the grass is drying off with the hot weather and a serious fire could result from care- lessness with fire by pic- nickers. An official of the council said yesterday that most bushfires were man- made. Fires were caused from picnic fires made by hikers and campers, careless discarding of cigarettes and matches, children playing with matches, and sparks from motor vehicles. He suggested to picnick- ers that they use only the established fireplaces for fires in the open, light only small fires, be careful with matches and cigarettes, and do not park cars in long, dry grass. "Should a bush- fire start then you should ring the main control office at 659 or 658 and assist to put it out," he said. The official concluded. "En- joy yoursel, but consider the firefighters and let them enjoy Christmas without having to battle a fire caused by someone's carelessness."
