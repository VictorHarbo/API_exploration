The barque Time and Truth, Captain Slater, of and for this port, left Manilla in company with the Glen- shee, she was again sighted in the Straits of Sunda. The American ships James Littlefield and Kathay, and the Danish brig China, were loading at Manilla for this port. The celebrated ship Marco Polo anchored in Hob- son's Bay late on Sunday night. She left Liverpool on the 12th of December, and arrived off Cape Otway on Wednesday last. Since then she has been detained by adverse winds. She entered the Heads at three p.m. on Sunday, and had to beat up against a strong northerly wind the entire distance. Captain Arnold has been presented with a letter of thanks for his kindness by his saloon passengers. The South Australian Government revenue cruizer Yatala, with Sir Richard and Lady Macdonnell and suite on board, anchored in Hobson's Bay yesterday afternoon. On entering the bay she was boarded by Mr. Macfarlane, immigration officer, accompanied by Captain Bancroft, A.D.C. His Excellency shortly afterwards landed at the Railway Pier, Sandridge, and proceeded to Toorak. The Wonga Wonga left Sydney Heads at ten minutes past four p.m. on the 8th March.

Soon after midnight on the 9th, fifty miles N.E of the Promontory, was struck by a whirlwind.
