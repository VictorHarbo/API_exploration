TRADE AND FINANCE.' Saturday afternoon. ! Trade ns usual towards the end of the month, cased off (luring the week, but the turnover still shows substantial improve, ment as compared with the corresponding neriod in 1004. ine jateness or uic bcusuu his naturallv restricted the demand for miner lines, chiefly in softgoods. The building trade continues to expand, both in the capita and throughout the country. Ihc producing industries ure making litftithy progress. The prices now being obtained for the increased wool clip, to- pti,er with increased returns from dairy ing and the prospects of substantial re- coipts from the wheat crop, should lead to money circulating much more freely to wards the end of the current year and during the fire' half of 1908, and a further marked expansion should take place in Aus tralian trade. Monev is plentiful locally, nnd lending rates are easy, with a tendency towards oven lower levels than now ruling. The probability of a further adjustnaent of bunk deposit rates is causing discussion, and tile opinion is almost general that if such action he taken a large amount of capital would he thrown into industrial invest ments. The deposits with the banks are still growing, nnd during the next few months the Ilow of money from the woo! dip, grain crops and dairying should load tea very substantial addition to the public funds held by the financial institutions, and there does not appear to be much hope ot the present difficulty of finding suitable and profitable investments being removed.' Exchange has been active, particularly in connection with the wool exports, and it is expected that rather bettor than the current low rates will rule later in the year. Buying CO (lays' sight drafts from wool shippers at 10/ per cent, discount .is practically lending money at 2 per cent.— a rate which certainly gives the banks little or no margin of profit. Rates and allow-- ences quoted by tho banks are as fol-. low:— ADVANCES. Discount rate. 5J to 6J per cent, per annum: orcrdratt rate, G to 7J per cent, per annum. DEPOSITS. For six months. 2 to 2J per cent, per annum; for 12 months, 3 per cent, per annum; for 2 years and upwards, 3) per cent, per annum. LONDON EXCHANGE. Buying. Selling. Par to 5/ p.c. discount..

CtlAltCi:.-, ON ACCOUNTS. A charge c.f 5/ per half year is mndo on ail cur-: rent accounts, whether debtor or creditor. The ltoyal Bank of Australia allows 2 per cent, on current account minimum monthly balances in excess of £100. With cheap money in Australia attention must he paid to State Government securi-- ties quoted ia London. Victorian 3 per cuts, are worth only £80 in London, tit -pet- cents. COS, and 4 per cents. £105. 1 1 certainly appears better to buy these securi-' ties at current rates titan keep on piling up deposits at 3 to 3t per cent, in the Aus tralian banks. in referring to the conversion of the Metropolitan Board of Works Loan, of £500,000, in 4t per cents., falling due on 1st April next, in our issue of Saturday last the date up to which debentures could be changed into new 4 per cents, was inad vertently stated as 17th November, in stead of 15th November. Money remains denr in London, the cabled rate of discount in the open mar ket for best 3 months' bills being 4 per cent.— the same as the Bank of England, minimum. The Bank of England's posit'on is weaker, the proportion of reserves to lia- Eg bilities now being 40.17 per cent., against Eg 43.21 per cent, a week ago, and 53.28 per i| cent, at this date u year ago.

Those engaged in the trade have good reason to take a gloomy: view of tho situation on account, of the severe, niqnctary losses incurred recently, but so long us the market Is lumbered up with ovmkcpl and stale parcels it' Is useless to expect any lasting' improvement. The "corn eggs" arc now coming forward In small quantities, ami lis they iiuginent, buyers will hnvc better opportunities to increase tlioir suics'witli fresli goods. Shipments hid fair to be ample, nnd quotations have lately lioon miich knocked alioiit; but symptoms arc forth coming of a revival in the demand, the general tone having been' less depressed during the pnst day or two. At It binqtiet given in honor of All-. George, president of the Canadian Manu facturers' Association, at Montreal, oil his return from his recent visit lo Europe, the guest of the evening, discussing the tariff question, contended that Canada was in a splendid position, and he believed that the Canadiiin manufacturers' tour in England would help immigration and bring n'oout an influx of British capital into Canada. While .Englishmen, he contended, no doubt knew how to run their own business, he thought there must be something wrong in England with 13,000,000 people living: from hand -to mouth- on the very verge of starvation. However, they must eJioo3e their own policy, be it protection or free- trade. in .connection with this subject, mail advices say that a recent meeting of1 Canadian manufacturers discussed tliC re vision of the tariff', which is now the sub ject of investigation by a tariff' commis sion in the west. The manufacturers ex pressed satisfaction that the Dominion Go- vcrniittnt had recognised the necessity for a rearrangement of the tariff iii view of changed conditions, so ns to give better protection to Canadian produce. A resolu tion xvaa passed, says the "Yorkshire Dost" correspondent',' urging the Government to: apply -> stale >1,1 unties us soon as the Dominion IVriiaineiit had decided upon the reports to be submitted by the commission, so that no unnecessary incon venience, might be . caused to trailers by, the unsettling conditions incidental to the delay of waiting. for the new scale to come into operation. Last week attention Was called to an .in teresting paper furnished by M. Mais'trc, the French Consul at Melbourne, to' the "Moniteur dti Commerce," in connection with the trade of those States with the Re public, M. Jean IVrier, French Commer cial Attache in London, in a paper on tho exportation of manufactures from France to England, published in the same organ, indicates that lie is not quite satisfied with the present situation of trade 'with Great Britain, though the exports of manufac tures to England already amount to £32, 000, 000 out of . a total of £SS.'320,0n0. He objects Jihnt tho goods pass through the hands of English merchants, who gain a proilt on. them which might be secured to .the French manufacturer' with a. better organised commercial system. He rbmurks that London is not England, and England is not all the United Kingdom. London is almost, the sole centre for the distribution of French merchandise, while there shpiild be a large market 'in- the provinces., Lie therefore proposes that French manufac turers should establish individual br col lective agencies in tlic provincial towns of the United Kingdom, and by this m. bans lie believes they would intercept the profits made by English firms, and lie able to com pete better with the Germans. English competition in this class of goods supplied by France lie regards as a negligilTie quan tity . - A short time since a cable message ap peared in "The Age" stating that the ship ment of chilled beef from New 'Zealand to London per steamship T'okomaru proved a failure. Advices now to hand report that tho meat was inspected twice a. day on the voyage home, and appeared :so satisfactory that it was not considered necessary to freeze it, as was instructed to be (lone if the beef did not keep. The meat was 71 days in the chamber, and at , 'first was kept at a temperature of 32 dog., which was afterwards reduced to 29A (leg. Air. Clcater, the chief engineer, who ir,acfe the inspec tions. is strongly of opinion Unit it should lie kept at no less than 2r to 29 deg., and freb circulation, of air is imperative. Mr. Henderson, the representative of the Christ- church Meat Company,' recommends that in a farther experiment o'.ily hind-quarters should be sent. Muqh was learnt by the shipment that will assist; in carrying out further experiments winch the company will probably make. It' may be said that if once .the difficulty in 'sending to England chilled, .instead, of frozer . meat is overcome, the value of shipmen ts will be increased by 50 per cent. , The accounts of "G.ovdon House Limited" for the year ended : 30th September show net profits of £12-' ,2. Deducting the in terim dividend at (lie rate ,of 5 per cent, and ; adding the. hi dance brought forward,' 'there is £1237 ava-'Jnblc, from 'which a divi dend at tho rate of G per cent, is proposed, leaving £773 to be carried forward. The paid up capital . is £15,470, the slim of £0000 is duo on mortgage and £1413 on overdraft. Freehold properties are valued at £26,300, and fittings, &c;„ at £1000.
