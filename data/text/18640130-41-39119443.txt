The Glensiieb arrivetl from Melbourne on Thursday night, after a passage of nine days; but the discourteous demeanour of the master pre vented the shipping reporter gleaning any par ticulars of the voyage. The Aldinga left Hobson's Bay as announced by telegraph.; but on reaching Port Phillip Heads a gale set in, which induced Captain Stewart, as well as the royal mail steamer Bombay, to anchor till it moderated. She sailed at 4/.10 a.m., anil in 47 hours afterwards was boarded at the Lightship anchorage, notwithstanding strong wind and heavy head sea to Cape Northumberland. The latter part has been marked by light south and south westerly winds. The George F. Patten will not discharge here, Captain Mitchell having received orders to proceed to Melbourne. _ VESSELS IN HARBOUR. ACTIVE, brigantine (British), lWtons, McDonald, master, from Melbourne. W.
