COMMONWEALTH CENSUS. POPULATION RETURNS. /XTI2RESTING COMPARISON*. However much political economists may differ .concerning the value or otherwise of Maitiiusian teachings in their application to old and well- populated countries, every thoughtful Australian recognises that the most essential assets of the Common wealth are its people, and that they are far too few to permit of patriotic Go vernments viewing -with complacency a possible return to comparatively station ary conditions. John Stuart Mill observed that "the countries in which the greatest prudence is manifested in the regulating of population, rfre often tliove in which capital increases least rapidly." The ex perience of Australia, ii^ common with that of the United States and Canada, estab lishes the conclusion that the growtti of population—provided that the children are properly educated and trained, and that the arrivals from oversea are of the right class—is more than parallel by the inciden tal increase of well-distributed material comforts, and a proportional accession of power to impart benefits to the other mem bers of the Empire, and to the rest of the world. —Official Slate Totals.— The Canadians are disappointed with their census returns, and complain ap pareutlv with good reason—that they arc unite untrustworthy owing to the defective method? employed in collecting ihe statis tics. Australian.? had been led to hope 1 Hat their numbers were larger than the re'.ult proved, but they have full confidence in Uie accuracy of the tables which Mr. G. II. Knibbs and his able and industrious staff of assistants are preparing. Census bulletin No. 3 lias just been issued, and may be studied with protit as showing the rela tive positions of the States in respect, par ticularly, of their ability to attract and re tain settlers. It also demonstrates iliat in recent years, in spite of a low birthrate— which happily is attended by the lowest deathratc of any country in the world Australia has made remarkable advance ment in white .population. The official totals of the census are as follow:— New South Wales .. .. .. .. 1,GIG,734 Victoria 1,313,551 Queensland <505,813 South Australia 408,558 Western Australia 282,114 Tasmania .. .. 191,211 Northern Territory 3,310 Federal Capital Territory .. .. 1.714 Commonwealth total .. .. 4,455.005 There weje 2.313,035 males-and 2,141,970 females—a difference in numbers which sug gests that Australia should be a paradise for the British working girl, as well as for the working man. In this State the males outnumber their sisters by G,15S only, but in Western Australia there are 41,000 more "lads" than "lasses." The enumeration of full-blooded aborigines, so far as.it could be obtained, resulted as follows:—New South Wales, 2,012; Victoria, 196; Queens land, S,687; South Australia, 1,433; Wes tern Australia, 0,369; Tasmania. 3; Nor thern Territory, 1,223; Federal Territory, 10: Commonwealth total, 19,939, of whom 11,385 were males, and 8,551 females. —South Australia's Steady Progress.— Some curious facts are disclosed in the comparative tables for the last three de cennial periods. For example, the progress of South Australia has been more steady and consistent than that of any other State. From 1881 to 1891. the additions to the population were 39,119, or 14.15 per cent.; from 1891 to 1901, 42,813 (13.57 per cent.), yand for the last decade, 50,212 (14.01 per cent.). The largest leaps .were made by Western Australia—20,074 (67.57 per cent.) for the first decade alluded to; 134,342 (269.86 per cent, for the second; and 97,993 (53.22 per cent.) for the third. A striking proof of what Australia owes to her gold fields! The figures for New South Wales are perhaps the most gratifying of all, be cause they—like those of South Australia— are connected - with solid and permanent agricultural and industrial enterprise. '. Be tween 1881 and 1891 the population of that; state increased by 374,129 (49.90 per cent,), in the following decade by 230,892 (20.54), = and in the third period by 293,602 (21.67). Victoria's increases are represented by thel percentages 32.30, 5.37, and 9.53; Queens- i land's by 84.39, 26.52, and 21162; and Tas- ■ mania's by 26.76f 17.60, and 10.66. The num- J ber of whites in the Northern Territory ! declined from 4,898 in 1891 to 3,310 this year! .Generally.'the tables indicate that; irPCOT IWE1 the present tide of immigration must rise much higher if it is to equal that which distinguished the eighties' decade. • —Arrivals and Departures.— In connection with the census, the latest official migration statistics embody some important and agreeable facts. Duringthe month of October, 1011, the white immi grants who landed at Commonwealth ports ■numbered 12,365, of. wbdmsll,389 were Bri tish subjects. ' For the ten months," January; to October - inclusive, the oversea "white , arrivals were 106,198; compared with "47,048 ■who took their departure to other lands., This means' a clear gain of 58,550^ inhabit ants from the outside world. In-the corres ponding . period of last year there "were 71,352 arrivals end 43;728 departures; the gain being 27,624. Of the immigrants for the later ten months 96,738 were British, 993 Austrian, 299 -Danish, 256 Dutch, 1,054 French, 1*987 German,..466 Greek, 1,123 ltan lion, 802 Russian, 1,191 Scandinavian, 132 Spanish, 107 Swiss, 10 Turkish, 681 Ameri can and 359 oElier whites. The advocate* of 'White Australia" will be gratified to'; learn. that, during the period the coloured people woo leu tne snores 01 Australia were slightly more numerous than those wlio came here, the actual figures being 4,483 and 4,454. There were 2,384 Chinese immigrants, but, as against them, 2,463 Celestials took tlieir leave.
