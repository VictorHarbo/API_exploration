Dare (lightship), Emily (guardship), Morning Star (cutter), Janet (Argus storeship), From the North China Herald, of the 3rd March, we glean the following facts respecting shipping : - The Countess of Seafield, arrived at Shanghae, from Sydney, on the 10th of February ; the Gypsy, Thetis, and Dolphin, from New Zealand, arrived respectively on the 10th and 24th February ; Lord of the Isles, from Adelaide, on the 26th February; Orient, from Melbourne, on the 10th, and the Tor- rent on the 20th February. The Bolton was load ing for Sydney. The Utonia reports the barque Fleetwing, from London to Geelong, on the 28th February, 28 days out, in lat. 11° 14' N., long. 25° 22' W. On the 8th of March the ship Stag, from London to Swan River, out 29 days, and on the same day the Quintin Leech, from Glasgow to Batavia : a seaman waa unfortunately lost overboard. The passengers have presented a complimentary ad dress to Captain Taylor. The Alice Brown, reports the arrival of the schooner Vixen, from Melbourne, at Taranaki. A novel event transpired in the latter harbor, on the 21st of April. A new schooner, built in the port and named after it, was launched. This was a first attempt at naval architecture ; and it may fairly be surmised that no great facilities exist for prose cuting the art at Taranaki, as we learn that this little craft was three years on the stocks. - Sydney Empire, 8th May.

The Veloz has not spoken any vessels during the passage. - Sydney Morning Herald, May 7. We have had four arrivals from the adjacent colonies since our last, viz., George, Elizabeth Ann, and Comet, from Sydney, and the Caroline, from Melbourne. These vessels have all experienced bad weather, with strong gales from the eastward. The Elizabeth Ann has been twenty-seven days on the passage: she has lost part of her bulwarks, split her mainsail, and carried away her bobstays, the bolts having drawn. The Comet is twenty eight days out; the first fourteen days were occupied in getting off the coast of New Holland. Out of 200 sheep shipped she has lost 30 on the passage down. The George is thirty days out, having had easterly winds to contend against the whole pas sage. The Caroline is twenty-seven days from Melbourne; she spoke the Amherst, from Mel bourne, bound to Port Cooper, on the 24th March, fifty- six miles east of Kent's Group, Bass Straits; has had twenty days' foul winds during the pas sage. - Southern Cross, April 20. MERCHANTILE MEMS. FROM ADELAIDE. - The brig James, from Dram, Norway, brings a large num- ber of battens. Her voyage, which has been very long, has been doubtless protracted through the unfortunate state of health of the crew, who have suffered very much from scurvy. Our reporter, on boarding her, found only the captain, the chief officer, and one seaman able to handle the brig, the remainder of the crew being laid up from the ravages of that fearful malady. The brig Mimer, full of deals and battens, arrived at the Lightship anchorage on Saturday night. Spoke during the voyage the Swedish barque Ariel, from Gottenburg, making for the Cape of Good Hope for water, being nearly out ; the Dan- ish ship Scheld, from Gottenburg, bound to some port in Australia, but could not ascertain which. The steamer Leichardt, which was built in Mr. Fletcher's yard, had her engines triad on Saturday last, when they were found to work easily and satisfactorily. Tney are of the collec live force of sixty- horse power, and were built by Messrs. Fawcett, Preston and Co., of Liverpool. The tubular-boiler is fitted with a number of brass tubes, which it is calculated will be of great saving in fuel. This vessel is built expressly for river navigation, and from her appearance she seems admirably suited for that purpose. We are in formed that her speed and capabilities will be tested by a trial- trip down the river in a few days, which we have no doubt will prove satisfactory. The Burra Burra having been found too heavy for the patent slip, was grounded on the bank adjoin ing Mr. Fletcher's yard, a few days since, for the purpose of having her screw or fan fitted to the shaft ; this being done, she was again floated, and warped to her berth at the company's wharf. Adelaide Times, May 7. The STEAMER BURRA BURRA. - We had the pleasure yesterday of joining a large circle of the friends of Messrs. Hull and Co., who had assembled at their invitation to inaugurate the above-named steamer, their property, by proceeding in a trial trip down the Gulf, and partaking of the festivi- ties prepared for the occasion. The Burra Barra left her moorings at the McLaren Wharf at twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, and accomplished the distance to the Lightship in exactly one hour and eight minutes, which, considering the disadvan tages under which she labored from the circum stance of her engines having been entirely unused for many months, may fairly be taken as a most satlsfaotory indication of her steaming capabili ties. The steamer was entirely without ballast yet, notwithstanding this, the unpleasant vibra tory motion so generally experienced was scarcely perceptible. On passing the Lightship the fore and aft sails and the topsails were set, and the craft went ahead at a slashing pace as far down the coast as Brighton, when, in order to arrive at Port Adelaide early enough to prevent the unplea sant contingency of the numerous visitors from town finding themselves benighted, the course was reversed, and the steamer regained her moor ings, after one of the most successful and pleasant aquatic excursions that has taken place at this port. - Adelaide Times, May 9. LAUNCH OF THE ALBURY. - Our correspondent at Port Elliot has f'urnished us with the following partioulars relative to the launch of the Murray River steamer Albury on Thursday last: - "The launch of the R. M. Co.'s new iron steamer Albury took place at the Goolwa, on the afternoon of Thursday, the 3rd inst. The ceremony of christen ing was performed by Miss Finniss, on the right of whom, and upon a platform erected for the pur- pose at the extreme end of the vessel, stood his Excellency the Acting-Governor, W. H. Maturin Private Secretary, T. N. Higgins, Esq., J.P., and lady, Mrs. P. F. Laurie, Mrs, W. T. Glendenning, Mrs. G. B. Smith, Mrs. and Miss Thring, Mrs. Na tion, and the Misses Newland. The weather was delightful, and a considerable ooncourse of specta tors were assembled to witness the interesting scenes of the day. The launch was preceded by a boat-race, which resulted in favor of Mr. Crawford's Fanny over Mr. Stewart's Alice. After the lapse of some time a pulling matoh between Mr. Winsby's Atalanta and Captain Cadell's Alma was won by the former. Against this result Captain Cadell protested, but upon such grounds that the judges could not en tertain. Several other boat-races were to have taken place, but they were deferred until the day following. The Goolwa, now become a place of rising importance, presented throughout the day gay and animated appearance. From the roofs of the several houses in the more immediate neigh borhood of the scene of excitement might be seen flags of various hues streaming in the breeze. Upon a tasteful arch, erected on the deck of te beautiful craft, were suspended a profusion of colors, surmounted by the Union Jack. The entire proceedings were marked throughout by great de corum, and to Mr. Varcoe and Mr. Hillier is due every credit for the accommodation they provide for the strangers, some of whom had come from considerable distance." - Adelaide Times, May 7. A few minutes past eight o'clock, last evening a gun was fired from a ship, some ten miles down the Bay, and upon our Bay reporter boarding her it turned out to be the clipper ship Blue Jacket. The intelligence, as will be seen, is of the most interesting nature. Capt. Underwood, an old face in these colonies, formerly of the Barrack pore and Diadem, has accomplished a magnificent run, occupying sixty-eight days, and has thus carried out the contract of the " Fox Line Company, who had engaged to deliver here the March mails in that space of time. The Blue Jacket reached the Line in twenty five days, and encoun tered numbers of icebergs during her passage. The greatest speed she attained in twenty-four hours appears to have been 310 miles ; but for the illness of upwards of fifteen of the seamen and officers, she would have made the run in a shorter space of time. It will be perceived that amongst the passengers by this noble ship, is his Excellency Sir Richard G. MacDonnell, C. B., Captain-General and Gover nor-in-Chief of South Australia. Our files of English news are very complete, and we owe thanks to the agents, Messrs. Meyer and Co. (whose repre sentative came out in the vessel) for very promptly furnishing our Bay reporter with papers down to the day of the ship leaving England. Much credit is due to Mr Pilot Beat, who brought up the ship for using every possible exertion in bringing her within reach of our express-boat ; as it would have been very annoying had the slightest delay take place in publishing news of such moment as that brought bv this mail.
