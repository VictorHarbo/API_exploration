There are many reasons why you should come to us to BUY a USED CAK. In the first place, we sell on COMMISSION ONLY. Secondly, we do not own any Ueed Car that we have for sale, and we are there fore in a position to give AN UNBIASED OPINION On any that wo -have for sale. Thirdly, tho vulue of any Used Car is de termined' by the PUBLIC DEMAND. and all Usetl Cars hive a definite market value according to the- manufacturer's name. a'e, mechanical condition, and appearance .Many experienced buyers pay twice the market value for a Used Car, and it is therefore to the advantage of all Buyer*, whether experienced or not, U- select their Used Car from salesmen, who have the humlling «f Used Cars, and thereforo know the tIU0 MARKET VALUE. Fourthly,' the VaJue placed by onrselves ou all Used Motor Vehicles, coming to us for sa!e is determined by the general condi tion of tho car, the make, and model, based on our long experience of the market s demnnd. We will only accept cars for sale where the owners are prepared to sell at a price that -Q-CIE;;TIOUSI,r ajk of a Buyer, end one which is equitable to boih Vendor and Purchaser. We will not offer you Used Csts above -hcir true market value, because we cannot afford to endanger the GOOD REPUTATION mo have already made in Western Australia. We endeavour to give a fair deal to both Vendor and Purchaser, without fear or f«v OWNERS of Old Model Cars in bed condi tion are advised that there is little demand for such ivt prices that would be satisfactory to themselves or the Selling Agents.
