GENTLEMEN,-The Additional Members Bill, introduced by the present Government, having now passed both Houses of Legislature, you will soon be called upon to elect a second Member to represent you in Parliament As I have been requested by some of your number to allow myself to be nominated for that position, I now respectfully, but briefly, lay before you some of my views on political matters. I have, as many of you are aware taken an active interest in political matters for the past twenty years and have always been a supporter of the Liberal Party, because l believe their policy is best calculated to advance the interests of the colony generally, and their administration, though perhaps not without faults, has generally been bUsinesslike and equitable, and so long as they follow their present line of policy and administration they will have my support The Valley Electorate has, in my opinion, been somewhat neglected by previous Governments. The Sandgate Railway, which ought naturally to have gone through Fortitude Valley, was taken, as you are aware, through Victoria Park, thus in a great measure depriving the Valley of the benefit of railway communication. The present Government is anxious to remedy this by constructing the main line from the present terminus through Fortitude Valley, to joIn the Sandgate line about Bowen Hills, with a probable branch line to Bulimba. This has my hearty support, and if elected I will do what I can to have it carried out as soon as possible. About seven years ago, when the Douglas Ministry was in power, £1500 was voted for a Post and Telegraph Office in Fortitude Valley ; this money has not yet been expended, for what reason I do not know ; should you return me, I will endeavour to obtain an additional sum, sufficient to erect a Post and Telegraph Office worthy of Fortitude Valley, and not allow an officer and his family to live in a disreputable building like the present one, for which the Government is paying a rental. I am strongly opposed to black labour in any form, and would not countenance the introduction of coolies, even with restrictions the present Opposition say they would put upon them, believing that this colony is adapted for and should be settled by Europeans. I am therefore in favour of an extensive but. judicious system of immigra- tion, similar to what Mr. Randall, our agent at home, is now endeavouring to obtain namely, young people and men w til families from the rural districts of Great Britain, who would settle on our lands and become useful colonists. There are many other questions that I should like to speak upon which cannot be well expressed within the limit of a published address, but I hope to meet you in public meeting previous to the day of polling, and then to address you more fully, although I feel I am not a stranger, having represented you in the Municipal Council for nearly fourteen years. I remain. Gentleman, Yours respectfully. JOHN M'MASTER. Fortitude Valley, 27th August Heetinga M MUNICIPALITY OF BRISBANE.
