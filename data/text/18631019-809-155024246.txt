COMMERCIAL. Aoe Owice, Saturday Evening. Export entries were passed at tlie Customs to-day on 4 oz of gold for shipment per Gothenburg for j Canterbury, New Eenland. Tho week commenced with rains and floods, and went out in a similarly stormy and gloomy manner. A largo amount of business has notwithstanding been transacted, the country and local trade demand generally during tho curivnt week, giving sufficient evidence of tho iinproveni3ut that is certain to follow upon seasonable and settled weather, good roads, and cheap carriage, to create a hearty wish for their speedy advent, so that the dreary dullnoss of the 2'ast winter, may be speedily forgotton in greater activity and increased trade. Bulk ale maintains its price, though B.iss's No. 3 has been placed at n lower rate. Tho demandforbottlod stout is better, and prices tend upwards. Com sacks have been ranch inquired for, but the rates asked havo as yet provented much business from being done. Wnolnfiftlrn linv-A nlcrt h -«-n vnn ? «rwl oinmCni proving insufficient, an advance on lato rates lias beon obtained. Breadstuffs, though presenting a quieter j market, and operations not so heavy, are a sliado bettor, 5s to 10s rise on (lour having been esta blished. Extensive purchases iu sugar havo re sulted in an advance of £4 per ton ou couutera, £3 on rations, nnd £2 to £3 on crystals. Bice ha3 once moro attracted considerable attention, tho trade having at last come forward and bought freely. A decline of Id to 2d was submitted to on. tho sale of tho Kahlamba's teas, at auction. Tobaceoes are firm. Iu timber, lumber has been sold largely. Wines and spirits are heavy, and incline downwards. Tho British and Foreign arrivals comprise, one vessel from Liverpool, one from Mauritius, one from Rotterdam, ono from Batavia, tho mail steamer, and H.M. steam corvette Esk. Ale and Stout. — Though an improvement has been experienced in tho demand for some brands of bulk ale, tho unsettled naturo of tho weather litis yet prevented any decided change for the hotter. Bass's No. 3 is freely offered at £7, whilst to effect sides in parcels £6 15s has been accepted ; trade lots of No. 4 havo been quitted at £7 10s. Allsopp's has not beon in great demand, at £6 I5s to £7 for No. 4\. Marrian's and Carlisle Company's meet with fair . notice from tho trade, at £7 12s 6d to £7 15s. : Joule's lias been in more active request, ami sales havo been more freely effected, at £7 15s. Tlie Colonial Company's lias been sold at £6 ; Guest's is offered at £5 10s ; and Scotch brands havo been quitted at £5 10s to £6. Stout is without any per ceptible change, Allsopp's realising £6 10s ; Wliit bread's, £6 los ; Taylor, Walker aud Co.'s having been disposed of at £6 17s 6d. Bottled ale moves off but slowly, sales in the ineantimo being very limited. Bass s and Allsopp's brands bring 9s 6d to 9s 9d ; tho finest Scotch brands, 10s to 10s 6d ; ordinary, 9s to 9s Gd. Joule's is hold for 9s 6d, and the Colonial Company's is sold at 8s 6d. Bottled stout seems to bo recovering from its listlessne3s ; there has been more inquiry, and parcels have been more readily sold. No alteration lias taken place on Henry Whito and Co.'s and, inconsequence, sales, utlOsto 10s 3d, have only been moderate. Edmoud's pig brand has also been placed at 10s 6d ; Machon's having been reduced to 9s and 9s 3d has been more extensively purchased. Fow sales of Byass's have been reported, the brand, however, i3 firm, 83 10id having been refused for a large parcel. For Dunphy's 9s is generally asked, most sales effected having beon at this rate. Hibbert's brings 8s 6dl to 8s 9d. Very little Colonial Company's is offer ing in consequence of tho small stocks held, and a quotation can hardly be given at present. Bagging. — Corn sacks have been actively in quired for, but as holders have been firm in their demand for 14s 9d and 15s, little business- lias been done. . To-day and yesterday buyers have evinced some inclination to concedo this, and it is likely the rates named will be established. Early in tho week a considerable parcel of woolpacks sold nt 5a for 10 lb's, and 4s for light weights. Towards the closo, however, a brisk domand sprung up, but sup plies being short, higher prices havo been obtained, aud though salos have been mado at 5s 3d, 5s 6d ia tho moro authentic quotation for 10 lb packs. Candles havo again become heavy, tho improve ment experienced last week having been entirely lost during the present. Few private sales have been effected, but at auction the usual quantity of ! damaged wero offered, and brought 9gd for badly,. ? to lOJd for slightly damaged. We quote Bouai ; lOJd, for best foreign and English, to lid for Bel- ; inonts, and lljd for the Neva Stearine Company's.

For South Australian generally £15 is asked. Moyno Mills has beon placed at £13 LOs, an advance of 5s to 10s on the wholo has. thus boen established. Californian has changed hands it £13 ; in trade lots £14 has been obtained. In Adelaide wheat little business has boen doiic, sup plies still coming very sparingly forward ; we quote [is 9d for this description, Victorian being valued at 5s 9d to 6s 3d. Feeding barley is not quite so firm, boing worth 4s 9d to 5s, and malting 6a to Gs 3d. Oats continuo to move off' freely nt Sd to 6s 3d for good feeding Colonial, md 6s 6d for milling.

Tlio price1 of 50 ton lots is fixed nt £22 10s, nnd though soioe out side parcels have been sold nt less, this in nt- wise affects the determination of the combined liolders. For small parcels higher rates are required. Ono lot of damaged, es Neiuberg, sold at £3 2s 6d, for badly, to £15 for slightly. 2000 bags, nlso ox Neinberg, and 3200 bags, ex Aurifera und Mary Aun, more or less damaged, were ulso disposed of, for net I cash, nnd realised good and satisfactory prices, ' Salt.- Coarse is a shado hotter, this week £3 has beon obtainod. Most landed parcels aro held, as thoy have been for a long time, for n much higher figure, and tho market,- not having been pressed by fresh arrivals, ou which storage charges are not to be incurred, seems gradually though slowly to be improving. For fine,, £5 10s is asked, and salos havo beeu mado at about this iiguro. Sugar. A very extensive trade- has been done in this article ;. but, contrary to' Usnal custom, most sales havo been oflected privately, instead of nt auction. On Monday tho St. Ives's cargo was offerod, but tlie.- auctioneers only succeeded in dis posing of a lot of low ration at £18 15s immediately afterwards, however,, several parcels wore- Bold privately at prices- which wero not disclosed.. Sinco then, the Sugar Company have been very large pur cimseis,. ana many muiureil tons, cliieily counters, have changed hands,, some importers and'' holders having, been entirely cleared out, tho trade- have in consequence also bought moro freoly, aud an. ad vance of fully £4 per ten- is now required ; for ra tions and crystals very much higher prices nro nlso demanded..

New South Wales. — Wo havo our filos from Now South Wales to tho 13th inst. We take tho following from tho S. M. ITerald of the 10th A comparative statomout of tho Consolidated Re venue of the colony of Now SoutU Wales, and 0! tlio special funds paid into U10 Treasury, at Sydney, during the quarter ended 30th September, 1862, nnd 30th September, 1853, respectively, showing the in crease aud decrease under each head thereof, is pub lished in to-day's Guzcite. From this statement we find that the total revenue for tlio past quarter amounted to £397,923 133 9d, against, in 1862, £431,643 13s 7d. There is, therefore, a de crease on the quarter of £33,719 19s lOd, or 7£ per cent. The deficiency is owing to a con siderable falling-off in our customs', gold and mint receipts, and nlso in tho land revenue. In tho postage receipts, fees of office, and pilotage rates, there is a small decrease, but to no amount. The heads of revenue which show an increase are licenses, rents (exclusive of land), railway receipts, electric telegraph, tonnage due3, and miscellaneous receipts. The following is an abstract of revenue, showing the increase and decrease: — Tho customs rovouue for the third quarter of 1863 wns £115,338 Is 2d, against, in 1862, £138,701 3s 2d. Decrease, £23,263 2s, or 17 per cent. The decrease is in spirits, tea, sugar and molasses, but in wine, ale and beer, tobacco, coffee and chicory, and opium, there is a slight increase. There has been a fair amount of business trans acted in the share market this week, but the fluc tuations in prices have not been of much import ance. Bank shares continue firm.
