The football match, arranged to tak-i place nn Thursday, between Oaii.per down and C>bden, has been postponed owing to iho intbiliiy of the southern dab to get a loam together. The clubs will meet lnti r on. A certain fair Tismauian has involved herself somewhat comically with the Postal Department. The object of her affoctio-s, a young Victorian, proved unfaithful, and her revenge took the form of the despatch to him of a huge earthenware domestic utensil, wih a letter concealed tti. rein, an a wedding present. The curious shape of the package excited the suspicions <<f the postal authorities, "ho opened it, uud found the letter. Now, any attempt to setid a letter at parcels rates is an indictable offence. The lady whs called t>> account, and agreed—to quote the oilicial language—" m submit uerse'f tv th* Postmasier General." Senator Drake thereupon solemnly fined the girl £1, anil having paid the money she has now to decide whether h-r wedding fctft shall be sent onto iis destination. It is understood she has cUcided to play the game to a finish. At the Butter Factory Managers' Conference, concluded in Melbourne on Fiiday, Mr. P. Co = -hlaii t of Cohc. rend v paper on Borne Separator.". He ex plained that he did so purely on oruad principle?, and not at all on personal grounds. He condemned their use principally on (he ground of their abuse. Factory tnanag'rs, he urged, should in 'xist 6:1 daily deliveries of cream. Uo h?d found the home separator cream a treacherous factor as compared with the receipt of milk supplies during the past year. Ie took the same ntnouut of labor ?nd money to make a p mnrt of bid butter ?a a pound of good butter, and it was therefore essential that the best materials should ba used. It was a curious fact that home separator** were not now used in Denmark, and yet in Australia ininy dairymen got such machines made in that country. How the Denmark dairymen roust smile when they contemplated such out of-date action on the part of lueir Australian competitors. (Hear, hoar.) Mr. Wils >n said credit was dne to Mr. Coghlan for bringing ihe subject for- ward. The Factory Mauagers' Associa tion onght tf> be up in arms against the companies in this matter, and they sli .nli] seek >i confer- nee with the Dairymen's Association with a view to getting the Government to do some thiug to check the supply oE bad cream. He moved tb.it the association communicate with theD.iirymen'sAESoci ation wi'li that object. (Hoir, hear). Mr. P. Coghlan seconded the mot ion. Mr. Evans thanked God he had nob gut a separator. (Liughter.) There was one tbtt passed his place on the way to the factory, and they could smell it as it went by. (Lauyhter.) He sup ported the motion strongly. They should gee the use of the hand separa tur prohibited where it cuuld be done without. (Applause.) Mr. Ryan said hu had hau to dual with a lot of hind separator cream that was not lit t? make butter of. All managers having the butter industry at hears must deuoanca Che hand separator every time. (Ap plause.) Mr. 11. Crowe said iha mo tion was a step in the right direction. The acti'iu proposed wonl'l do a lot of g?ud. It w*j tho k-ystone of tliu future mcceas of the dairying industry here. If sums law were passed to regu late the treatment of the home septra tnr cream before it retched the factory the industry would bj rained tv a higher plane a', mice. The i im<j was ripe fur such act ion. It would be forced npou them in an alarming man ner if they did not tako the matter up without deUy. (Applause.) The mu tiou was carried uuaniiuuusly, md as tliu result of communicating with the sccre try >>f th! Dairymen* Association it w?s decided to try and arrange for a conference with that bjdy in July. A few days ago Mr. Scorer, Secretary of the Victorian Engine-drivers' and Fircuicn'ti Association, cabled -to the Canadian Government inquiring if there I wer<s any openings in Canada for skilful I eugine-d- ivers. and stating that 200 i.f them were prepared to emigrate.
