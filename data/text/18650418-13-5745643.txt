NB-The play will be produced with entirely new scenery and mechanical effects. ROYAL HAYMARKET THEATRE. Sole Lessee, Mr. Hoskins. ISS CLEVELAND, with the permission of the manager (Mr. Hoskins), begs respectfully to inform the public that the play entitled LEAH, THE FORSAKEN, is positively her private property, having been adapted for her from the German by Mr. Charles Vincent, and is now being performed at the Theatre Royal without her sanction or consent, to her probable injury, the management being unfortunately shielded in this unjustifiable proceeding by the non existence of the International Copyright Law in these colonies. Miss Cleveland trusts that her original impersonation of Leah, having been already stamped by the press and public of Melbourne, will yet find friends and admirers to welcome her first appearance at the Haymarket Theatre, on Monday next, April 24, In spite of all the strenuous exertions made to the contrary and confidently in trust her future in the hands of those to whom she is indebted for so much of her past success.
