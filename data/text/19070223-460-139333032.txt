BUBAI TOPICS. . The summer seems to have gone astray somehow. It is questionable if even the proverbial oldest inhabitant remembers such a long stretch of comparatively cool weather, extending, from the middle of Oc tober to the -time of writing. About the beginning of October there Were a -few days during which the temperature ranged moderately high, but since then there have been long intervals between each warm day, and the temperature between whiles occa sionally got down to freezing-point in some districts. It is most fortunate in one re spect that so much cool weather has-pre vailed, otherwise there would have been some disastrous bush fires. Grass was never more plentiful throughout the state,, and if normal summer temperature had pre vailed; it'is practically certain that many serious losses -would have been sustained. Of course it is quite possible that we may get some very hot weather before the autumn rains break up the season, but the days are shortening, and the sun will soon begin to lose its.power. The cereal har vest is now practically completed, and it will be interesting to learn later on what the actual yields of wheat, oats, and barley have been. The pre-harvest estimates have differed "Widely, but it is now generally ac knowledged that the sanguine expectations of the early portion of the season have not been nearly realised. With regard to dairy ing there has, naturally, been a consider able falling-off in the production of butter -that always takes place at the correspond ing lame of year-but if we are fortunate enough to get early March rains, a profit able prolongation of the productive period may be expected. In Victoria there is very little stirring in pastoral circles, but in New South Wales and Queensland there is al ready talk of shearing difficulties, which may lead to serious and regrettable trouble later on.

Already 30 out of 40 divisions have been taken up. A large consignment of the pamphlets calling attention to the advantages of Vic toria as a place for settlement have already been forwarded to the Agent- General for distribution, and it will be necessary that he should soon have particulars of the land available to submit for consideration of in quirers who may think of coming to Vic toria to settle. The stack-building prizes offered by the Shepparton Agricultural Society were -won as follows:-W. R. Vin cent, Shepparton, 89 points, 1: M. J. Ewart, Murchison, 07 points, 2. The other {competitors were Messrs. W. and D. Ross, Shepparton (51), and P. Gil-lard, Sheppar .ton (20). The'judges were Messrs. W. j Sayers, J. Ferguson, and N. Hogan. A number of experiments were made during the past season with Federation wheat, a variety produced by the late Mr. Farrer, wheat experimentalist, as a hy brid for Purple Straw and Indian Fyfe. It It-has attained considerable favour with millers and farmers, points claimed for it being that it is prolific, di'ought resisting, and that it holds the grain well. Last 'season In the Qoulburn valley, when for a time a large area of crops were under water, it did, very well. During the week ending February 15 the records submitted to the secretary of Agriculture show only 117} tons of butter was exported from Melbourne, of which 97 tons was for the United Kingdom, and 201 tons for Eastern ports. The quantity inspected for export during the week, [however, was 308i tons, of which 14,769 boxes were in bulk, .556 boxes in pats, and 334 boxes in tins. Of the 14,564 boxes intended for the United Kingdom, 12,006 boxes (82$ per cent.) was salted, and 2,558 boxes (17$ per cent.) unsalted. The quantity inspected for South Africa was 761 boxes, and for Eastern ports 334 boxes. The director of Agriculture has received from Mr. Henry Vale, jun., of Picola West, [a report in connection with his experiences | of the "Federation" variety of wheat. Mr. Vale states that he obtained one bushel of the Federation wheat from Dookie College in 1905. This was sown without manure on fallow land, at the rate of half a bushel to the acre, ana yielded six bags to the acre. The produce of this crop was again planted in 1906 at the rate of 441b. to the acre. It was sown without manure on fallow land, which had been cropped off and on for 30 years. The result was eight bushels to the acre. The produce, of 251b. of seed re turned 170 bags of wheat. At the Royal Agricultural Show, Sydney, on Wednesday, ffiUtrch 27, Pitt, Son, and Badgery Ltd., will sell a number of high class shorthorn, Hereford, and Devon bulls afid cows from the'studs of leading breeders in New South-Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. The lastnamed stud will be represented by the trustees of the late Mr. J: H. Angus; the New. South Wales studs include those of Messra, J. H<ffmes (Holm hurst), B. 8. Harris (Berrigan), R.

Held). - It is the fixed determination of the Go vernment to see that all fruit imported is inspected, the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Swinburne) $ays, but if the committee representing importers and others can show any improvement on the scheme of the de partment for carrying out this work such suggestions will be acted upon. The Go vernment entomologist (Mr. French) is to meet the committee of impor ters and growers, to confer with that body on the detaQs of the scheme. It is desired, the Minister says, to work the inspection with as little friction as pos sible. Mr. French is strongly of opinion that inspection at'Melbourne is essential, and is tetiefied that in three of the five cases of fruit fly that have been discovers! in Victoria the pest originated from fruit that was imported into Melbourne. He does not agree with the contentions of Mr. H H. Davey, that the fruit-fly will only come by way of the border, and that the present first inspection is sufficient. As to the as sertion of Mr. Froggat, the New South Wiles entomologist, that Wodonga is lite racy alive .with fruit-fly, Mr. French says his inspectors had made a careful investi gation, and have &0t found that to be the caBe.'

The annnal potato-growing competitions held in connection 'with the Smeaton Agri cultural Society were decided on Thurs day. There were 11 entries. The re sults were:-Joseph May,- 100 pointB; Crisp Brothers, 99 points; L Boustead, 99 points: R. Pearson, 98 points; A. M'Kin non, 97 points. Mr, George Seymour, of the1 department of Agriculture, acted as judge. At a meeting of the Closer Settlement Board one estate in the Western district, which had been placed under offer, , was refused as unsuitable. Valuers were j appointed to inspect another estate. The i members of the board have this week in j spected a small property in the Western district, and next week will go to Hamilton to inspect an estate in the neighbourhood ' of that town. Some time ago a sum of £200 was granted by ihe Premier to give Ballarat unemployed work in filling in about 20 acres of abandoned mining ground adjoining the local orphan asylum, and after the work had been completed the land was handed over to the asylum authorities. Last sea son a crop of hay was taken off the land, and it is now growing a luxuriant crop ol potatoes, maize, cabbages, and mangolds, af fording, it is claimed, an excellent illus tration of what can be done with compara-, tively useless lands if properly treated with j fertilisers. We have received from the hop-gardens of Mr. Sullivan, of Eurobin, per favour of Mr. J. Foxcroft, the finest specimens of golden hops ne remember to have seen. The foliage is particularly healthy and vigorous, while the strobules are unusually large and well-coloured. It is nearly 400 years since the hop was introduced into England from Flanders. Petitions were presented to Par liament against its introduction. It was stigmatised as "a wicked weed that would spoil the drink and endanger the people." A hop-garden, just as the scales are ripen ing, is one of the most beautiful sights in nature. Some misapprehension appears to exist in the minds of holders of closer settlement ] blocks as to the provisions of the law re specting exemption from payment of instal ments. Some of them are apparently of opinion that they may claim as a right ex emption from these payments for a period of two years, but it is pointed out by the secretary of the board (Mr. Jenkins) that this is not the case. What the law provides, lie explains, is that the board has the power to grant remissions up to 60 per cent, of the unencumbered value of the improvements which the lessees have put upon the land. Each case must be dealt with by the board on its merits. In order to encourage youths of the dis trict to experiment in farming, the Colac Progress Association offered some time ago prizes of £5 and other amounts totalling £10 for the best plots of maize crown by boys under 18 years of age in the neigh bourhood of the town. A number of boys entered the competition with spirit, and tne plots are said to show very well in compari son with the crops of maize grown by far mers in the neighbourhood under the ordi nary methods. Altogether 27 plots were planted about the end of October with Yankee Doodle, a variety of maize recently imported by the Department of Agriculture. The maize was thinly planted in drills 3ft. apart, and the prizes are to be awarded for tne highest quantity of shelled grain pro duced by the crop. Mr. Lee, Agricultural superintendent, states that, on tne whole, the plots are promising very well indeed. They are usually from 5rt. to 8ft. high, whil« crops sown broadcast and left without at tention since have, owing to the dry sum mrrjjrflvri TijTmpTiriitivr failure. < , ^JlfTocomotiunusual type, known fas the, ®ate|it geared locomotive, \- |tSU?

The deputation from the dairy produce trade to the Railway Commissioners on Monday, discussed some important points relating to the handling of butter and cheese. One of the main requests was that a separate shed should be used in Mel bourne for butter And'cheese, in order to avoid the risk of taint from other produce being in the same building. Mr. Tut in formed * the deputation that all .station masters and officials are instructed to keep butter and cream as much ap&rt; froim other produce as possible. It is seldom, however, that the railways receive full tnitidoads, and for commercial reasons it is impos sible to reserve a'whole truck for vfcry small loads. Thestationmasters are careful to see; that in no case are objectionable articles, such as .hides and akina, allowed, to travel with butter arid cheese; While the depart ment are unable to reserve & shfed in Mel bourne specially for dairy produce, an ar rangement is bang made which, it is con sidered, will practically have tue desired effect. Another matter brought under the notice of the commissioners was tfce delay in getting ddivery of butter at Melbourne, this being accentuated by the fact feat trucks at stations are at times shunted, and have to wait for other trainst especially in the case of the Western district MrV-Tait pointed out, in reply, that the department cannot undertake, for instance, to ran the Western produce right tjiroqgh. without waiting'for the Ballarat train fit (^Belong, as separate trains would me§n two .retujms at considerably gre»tel,;ex]3enjiei Speakiig generally, the department is watching: jn&t; ten closely in orifa^todo allitpossibly to assist the trade._ A- ;i Mr. Jamca Gormlifey, M.L.C., _has |>een unanimously elected,president..of the Mur rumbidgee Pastoral and Agricultural So ciety for the present year. Darwin thought that as man gained in intellect he lost in instinct. Most likely. This may explain why a great scientist might be unable to harness a horse or milk a cow. Yet he might work out some principle of mechanics which would enable a horse to haul 30 per cent, more weight. The Quilbone Estate, in the Coonamble district o£ New South Wales, will be offered at the Royal Exchange, Sydney, on Feb ruary 27, as a going concern. Intending purchasers can obtain full information from tbe auctioneers, Winchcombe, Carson, and, Co. Ltd. A serious bush fire broke out at Ma honga Station, New South Wales, on Sun day. The fire spread to Handley and Bur gandra stations, but was checked at the Wallandool boundary. The extent of the fire was about ten miles, and a large amount of grass and fencing was consumed. The origin of the fire is unknown. In northern parts of Sweden earth is often baked in bread, and is sold in the .public markets of the Italian peninsula, as well as on the island of Sardinia. In Persia certain kinds of soil were used in the manufacture of confectionery, and it is probably from the Persians that confec tioners in Western Europe learned to use terra alba for the same purpose. In Nubia and other tropical countries it is used as a medicine as well as a food. This practice probably had its origin in the knowledge that all earths have some kind of flavour, and take the place of salt, a necessary in gredient in all kinds of food It is stated that there is a probability of an important change shortly in the method of bringing Danish perishable goods into England. The imports from the former country consist largely of butter, bacon, and eggs, and these find a ready market in London. Hitherto they have chiefly been sent between Esbjerg and Harwich. A movement is on foot to institute direct communication between Esbjerg and Lon don. The. saving of time effected by com ing direct to London would be 14 hours. The trade that is now carried on by the Danish Steamship Company is estimated at 100,000 tons annually, at a freight of from 20/ to 30/ per ton.
