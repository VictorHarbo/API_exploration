COMMERCIAL. Aoe Office, Saturday Evening. Export entries wero passed at tho Customs to-day for 3147 oz 4 dwt of gold, for shipment per Agincourt, for London. The continued delay in the arrival of the mail has very considerably affected the ordinary course of ^irade ; for, though dealers havo manifested overy desire to do business, tho want of definite information as to shipments from home has acted as a £heck on operations. The sugar market has, howoyer, boen an exception, advices, indirectly received from Mauritius, having not only re-animated holders, but encouraged dealers to such an extent as to have caused a good deal of excitement during the week — somo 8000 bags having changed hands at auction, besides what was sold privately. Now ale having reached tho market, holders of old have been moro eager sellers, and large parcels have been dis posed of at a reduction. Increased arrivals of Byass's stout havo induced importers to accept of rather less money. Portland cement is easier. Ling fish has declined slightly. Tho absenco of that demand which existed nt the close of the. year has acted unfavorably on dried fruits. Chicory is lower. Candles ore rather firmer. Cornsacks are riot worse than last week, though the market is not strong. Cordage has been extonsively sold, at im proved rates. Flour is rather better. Feeding grains continuo noglected. Sales of hams and bacon manifest a lower 'tendency. In teas and timber a good business has been done, at prices scarcely maintaining former values. In spirits, Hennossy's eoao alone shows any improvement. The British and Foreign arrivals oompriso six vessels from England, two from Manilla, ono from Macao, ono from Natal, and H.I.F.M. corvetto Isis, from Bourbon Ale and Stout. — Holders of bulk ale, as tho, season advances, are bosoming more anxious to realise, and, in consequence,' larger parcels than ?usual have boon disposed of at auction, 500 to 600 hhd having been quitted during tho week at low prices. Wo understand that tho lirst of the1 new season's, beer' has arrived,. a shipment of 2 JO hhd (Arrol's) being in the Shalimar, now in tho Bay. Advices havo also been received of a consignment of Ind, Coope and Co.'s, per Kent, oxpocted ivory shortly.' In such circumstances it would not be I wise to look for .any improvement during the re mainder of tho season. In trade lots Bass's No. 3 has been placed at £6 to £6 3s, and No. 4 has brought £7. Allsopp's is offered at £5 10s, at which a moderate quantity has found buyers. ! For Murrian's £7 to £7 10s is required. Tho Carlisle Company's lias boon disposed of at £7 to £7 5s for small lots, while 50 hhd parcels havo been quitted at within a trifle of those rates. Joules' has been sold largely at auction. The Colonial Company's is valued at £5 10s ; for the light ale, £6 17s 6d is obtained. Scotch brands can be purchased at £5 to £5 10s. Bulk stout is offered at a prico to induce purchasers to clear off stocks of old, but dealers aro not to be tempted. Taylor, Walker and Co.'s can be bought at £6 to £6 6s. For Wiiitbread's, £5 15s would bo accepted for small lots, and 5s less for parcels. All sopp's can bo had at £5 5s. The demand for bottled ale continues on a fair scale, and iu the meantime is quito sufficient to meet supplies coming forward. Tho Scotch brands go off freoly, Muir's and Prestonpans at 10s 6d, Aitken's at 10s 3d, wfe'plaSgd 10s to 10s 3d, tho limited shipments advised being invariably contracted for long previous to arrival. Blood's and Arrol's have been placed nt 10s ; Bass's and Allsopp's, if in good condition, bring 9s 9d. Tho Colonial Company's lias been sold at 9s Gd. Joule's is not offered at present. Inquiries for bot tled stout havo been vory moderate, but save for Byass's, of which supplies havo como very freoly to hand, prices aro well sustained. . Edmond's pig brand sells at lOs Od ; for Henry White and Co.'s 10s to 10s 3d is obtained j Blood's and Arrol's have been sold nt 9s 9d ; Burke's Guinness's realises 9s 6d ; Dunphy's has been placod at 9s. Byass's, in trade lots, has been sold at 8s 9d, but in parcels can be had at 8s 6d, one shipment of 600 cases having been quitted at this figuro._ For tlio Colonial Company's single stout 8s 6d has boen realised, while double stout has fetched 9s. Hibbort's sells at 8s 3d ; , Ton- nent's has been quitted at 8s. At nn auction sale of 1000 cases ale and stout, tho whole was disposed of at fair prices. Bagging.— Cornsacks are ., comparatively , neg lected, though offered at rates favorable to buyers, Sales have been made at 18s Gd for parcels to 18s 9d for small lots. ' ' , Candles. — There has beon more inquiry for Bel monts ; but, notwithstanding tho demand having 'been solely for tho supply of- trade wants, prices havo firmed, and an advance of jd to Jd is required. 'Parcels have -been placed at 10Jd, whilo many holders want lOJd to lid. Ogilvib's and Hale's are valued nt lOJd, and Brandon's at 10Jd to lOJd. Tho Neva Stearino Co.'s havo been sold to a fair extent at lid. Light weights are wanted, ' and a rise of fully Jd lias been established ; for the small quantity offering, 8d to 8|d is asked. At auctiou, sound light weights wero sold nt 7$d ; and faulty full weights at 9Jd to lOJd. Of damaged the quantity offering now is small, hence the im provement wo have already noted. Cement.— Portland, in consequence of recont 'numerous nrrivals which are hoing placod on tho market, is hardly so steady, _ 15s being now full value. American plaster remains unchanged at 20s, tho rnto wanted by dealers.

' Cordage.— Tho Australian, arrived this week, has added 150 tons to our stocks of Manilla cordage ; but, in consequonce of tho small quantity hold by dealers, an impotus has been given to tho market rather than otherwise. Vory considerable sales havo beon effoctod at an advance . ou previous rates. Somo sixty tons were disposed 'of on Thursday at £52 for 2 to 2J inch, and £48 10s for J to 7 iuch assorted.

A fair sample of Danish is offered at 4s without meeting purchasers. To Scotch no value can be given. Calcutta#, offered nt auction, did not sell. Barley is dull of salo at 4s for feed ing ; malting being quoted nt 5s. Maize, though a considerr.blo rise ha3 taken pluce in Sydney, has not moved here, over 43 4.Jd is not got, and even at this figure it is not active. The gram recently arrived was offered' at auction without success, though, after the sale, tho lot was placed at a full priGe, the exact rate did not transpire. Bran is wanted ; about 15,000 bushels have been quitted at equal to Is 8d — sny Is 7^d and Gd for the bags. Colonial oatmeal lias boon rednced to £28. Pearl barley being firm at £30 ; for Scotch there is not inncli inquiry at £23 to £25.

Malt continues qniot ; and, though salos of bins have boen raude at 9j 4Jd and 9s Gd, and of trade parcels at 9s 9d and 10s, yet it is clcar prices will rule lower unless tho demand improves.

Quicksilver, in small trade lots, realises! 2s, but the demand is very inoderato. Rice. — Patna has not boon moved off so exton sively as formerly; prices, however, are firmly maintained at £25 to £25 10s for parcels. For Java, at auction, £26 was obtained. Sugar. — This market began to ovince symptoms of weakness till holders were reassured by advices, via Sydney, from Mauritius of an advance of £5 there on receipt of the October English mail, and considerable excitement has since prevailed. One parcel of 1000 bags was placed privately at £40. Previous to this, the Java sugars, ex Jeannie Os- wald and Eliza Goddard — consisting of 6000 mats — wore offered, and were sold at £80 2s 6d to £30 12s 6d for browns; and £38 10s to £39 5s for white crys ?fefeisting' o?B!fc ships, was placed on tho market, and, though in consequence of tho uncertainty prevailing on account of the delay in the arrival of tho mail, tho bidding was listless.

A parcel of about 200 tons recently arrived, had to bo stored, as the limit of £3. 5s could not bo ob tained. Fine sells slowly to trade buyers at £4 15s to £5, the latter figuto was obtained to day. Tea. — Country requirements, as well as local wants, have taken off a fair amount of stock, at from Is lOd to 2s 4d for good congous to fine mediums. Orange polcoes have also beon sold at 2s 4^d.
