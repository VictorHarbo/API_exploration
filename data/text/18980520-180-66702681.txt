Lockyer wag congratulated on Saturday evening hy the passengers on board the steamer Adelaide on the remark ably quick time in which the trip from the LeeiWTn to Fremantle had been made. The Adelaide left Albany at noon on Saturday, and as she cleared Breaksea Island it could be seen that rough weather was to be an ticipated. Throughout that afternoon and during Friday night a strong head wind and sea were experienced, which so much im peded the vessel's progress that it was 5.20 a.ro. on Saturday before Cape Leeuwin was abeam. After the vessel rounded Cape Leeu win the weather conditions proved more favorable, the subsequent passage to Fre mantle having been made in 12 hours, which is the fastest time established by a coasting steamer between these two places. Imme diately on nearing the mouth of the Swan river the Adelaide shaped her course so as to enter the river, and subsequently she took up a berth alongside the South Quay, where 284 passengers were disembarked At 4 pJE. to-day the Adelaide will leave Fremantle on the return trip to the east. S.S. WABOONGA The S.S. Waroonga arrived at Albany from the eastern colonies at 2.30 on Sunday after noon. She encountered strong north and north-west vrinds, with rain and heavy head seas across the Bight. She was a very full ship, cargo having to be shut out. There are dOQ sheep on board for Mr. C. Maidment's station at Bunbury, also 200 turkeys for an other station-holder near Beverley. Passen gers: — Mesdames Simpson, nurse, and child.

A FEAT Es* TOWING. Full details have reached Liverpool from HaJifaY^ N.S., reporting the arrival there on jlarch 20 of the disabled Glasgow steamer Osbome, in tow of the Newcastle steamer Duffieid, -which has successfully accomplished a towing feat of over 1000. miles during the prevalence of very stormy feather. The Os Dorne, which was under the command of Captain Rettie, was on a voyage from London to Philadelphia, and on March 11 her tail shaft broke. The weather at the time was very rough, and for four days the vessel drifted about in a helpless condition. It is stated that one day an east-bound steamer came near enough to be signalled for assist ance, but she declined to take the drifting vessel in tow. The Duffieid bore down to the Osbome at six o'clock on the morning of March 14, and three hours later had her under weigh, with two hawsers attached. This was in lat. 46.25 ST., long. 42.50 W.. which is a distance of over 1000 miles from Halifax. Captain \oung, of the Duffieid, offered to tow the ^sbome to Halifax or Philadelphia, and Captain Rettie preferred Philadelphia. Had the weather hot been go ooisterous the two steamers would doubtless have reached Philadelphia, in safety, but when nearing the coast terrific weather pre vailed. AH along very stormy weather nad been encountered. The Osbome had a light cargo, and consequently rolled and pitched fearfully. The strain on the hawsers was very great. On March 18, Captain Rettie requested the commander of the Duffieid io make for Halifax, and the vessels' heads were turned in the direction u- teat port, which -was safely reached two days later. The Osbome' s propeller was not lost when the tail shaft broke, as it was secured and lashed before it fell off. The Duffieid had towed her. prize about a mile inside of the Camper down, at the entrance of HalifaT harbor, when the hawser broke away, and the stea mers separated. The Osbome was safely an chored, however. VICTORIAN SHIPPING TRADE. In spite of the fact that trade is improving (says the Melbourne 'Argus') the shipping of the port is uncommonly dull at present. May 3 was a record day in the annals of Vic torian shipping, for not a vessel arrived in the bay, and up to a late hour not one was signalled. The 'oldest inhabitant' knows of, no parallel, and boatmen and others who live by or on the few human minnows who want either to go off or to come off dangled their legs idly from the pier ends, or fished pensively, or exchanged stories of the days when belated 'swells' offered fancy prices to catch their boats, and sometimes forgot to pay in their hurry to get aboard, and diggers from the goldfields declined to pay in anything less than sovereigns, and gentlemen with titles wanted change back out of a shilling. Then, too, there was the story of the drunken sailor who, bereft of his last sixpence, elected to swim out, and did it. and the parsimonious i passenger who also elected to swim out, and got drowned. Luckily every day is not as dull as Tuesday. May 3. was : otherwise the. water man in Port Phillip would become as extinct as the dodo. THE GERMAN-AUSTRALIAN STEAM SHD? COMPANY. Arrangements have just been completed by Mr. BL W. Henderson, general agent in Aus tralasia for the German-Australian Steamship Company, who is at the present time on a visit to Fremantle. for the establishment of a regular monthly steamship service between Hamburg and Adelaide, via Antwerp, Port Elizabeth, and Fremnntle. The new service will be inaugurated by the steamer Essen, which is to leave Hamburg on July 21. The subsequent steamers to continue the trade will be the Chemnitz, Sommerfeld, Solingen. Stassfurt, and a fifth steamer, which will probably be a chartered vessel. It has not yet been decided -whether or not Fremantie is to be a port of call on the homeward trip. Cargo received on board at Hamburg will be delivered in 58 days and Antwerp cargo in 52 days. These vessels will also receive at Ham ourg transhipments from New York. Messrs. Strelitz Bros, are the Fremantle agents for the German-Australian Steamship Company. The steamers belonging to this line are not by any means strangers in Western Australian wsters,as several of the company's boats have, during the past 12 months, visited Fremantle. Heretofore, however, they have not run at regular intervals. THE GERMAN matt, STEAMER. Shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday morning the German mail steamer Weimararrived in Gage Roads, where the subsequently dropped anchor. On the voyage from Colombo to Fre mantle a slight accident occurred in the en gine- room, which, together with heavy weather, was instrumental in preventing her from teaching Fremantle op to schedule time. Discharging operations were commenced im mediately after her arrival,and as it was neces sary, owing to her being behind time, that she should be granted quick despatch, the idea of berthing her alongside the South Quay, in the Swan River, had to be abandoned, captain F. Mentz reports that the Weimar left tfremerhaven on April 6 and Colombo on May 6. During the passage to Naples strong variable winds and rough unsettled weather were experienced. The subsequent passage to Aden was made in fine weather and smooth sea. On the run from Aden to Colombo a light S.W. monsoon was experienced. Daring the latter portion of the passage, from Co lombo to Fremantle. heavy weather prevailed, in 12.45 K lat, and 49.50 E. long. 3D Arabian fishing vessel, flying distress signaJs, was sighted. A boat was sent off to her, when it was ascertained that the little craft had run short of provisions. These were supplied by the Weimar, and the voyage to Fremantle resumed. After landing her Fremantle pas sengers and cargo, and embarking a number of additional passengers for the east, the Weimar resumed her voyage to Sydney via — -elaide and Melbourne at 4.30 o'clock yes terday afternoon. The United Steamship Company of Copen hagen intends to add eight steamers of 6000 tons and over to its fleet, as well as a couple of smaller dimensions. According to Danish papers the idea is to extend the company's transatlantic traffic. The company's accounts for the year 1897 show a balance of profit amounting to 2,877,733 kroner, and after writing olf the sum of 22,179 kr., adding to the renewal and reserve funds, and paying a dividend of 10 per cent., 17,000 kr. will be carried over to the new account. The Isis, a powerful screw steamer of 6500 horse-power, and 2000 tons register, which is being Duilt at Greenock for the P. and O. Company, ' -? successfully launched last montft. At a recent board meeting of the North Ger man Lloyd Company it was decided to es tablish a monthly line of cargo boats between Bremen, Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp, and ports in Eastern Asia. This will be in ad dition to the line of Imperial mail steamers, and six new boats will be built for the ser vice, ues-oes a couple of mail steamers. The proposed dividend for 1897 is 5 per cent ±^e Government of Venezuela has granted to an English syndicate what is described as almost a monopoly of navigation on the Orinoco, together with valuable india-rubber concessions and extensive powers with refer ence to immigration. The same syndicate is said to be seeking similar powers from the Brazilian and Colombian Governments. The dividend of the German Levant line for last year is to be 6 per cent., against 4 per cent, for 1896; the Hungarian Adria Company will pay 12 florins, against 10 florins; and the Argo Steam Navigation Company 7 per cent.
