Export entries were passod at the Customs to-day on 2748.1 oz of gold for shipment as under: — 1G87 oz 18 dwt, per Balclutlia, for Sydney ; 10G0 oz 12 dwt, per Wutor Nymph, for London. . Shippers of gold per Suffolk, for Loudon, are : — Bank of Now South Wales, 21,044 oz ; Bank of Victoria, 7823 oz 4 dwt; small shipments, 2 oz 10 dwt ; total, 28,80A*oz 10 dwt, of which quantity 12,530 oz 7 dwt are transhipments from New Zea land vessels. The import market, during tho past week, on tl;e wholo, has beon quiet, showing few changes of im portance, tho domaud being still affectod by the difficulty of Bonding goods to tho interior ; and, with tho excoption of some extensive operations in butter and hams and bacon — which havo conside rably advanced in consequence — business i.'ausac tions gonorally have beon rather of a limited nature. In corn sacks holders havo reduced their demands, and some 50 bales sold at 15s. For New Zealand soveral parcels of flour havo been disposed of at a decline on nominal rutes. Adelaide wheat has also been placed at a figure showing a doelinc. Tho small stocks of rice attract tho notico of doalers, and wo havo no doubt au improvement will immediately follow. Tho sugar market is quiet, but prices aro without variation. In teas a fair amount of busi ness 1ms beon dono. Ilecent American advices have rather stiffened tobaccoes. Timber likewise. Wines und spirits remain in a very unsatisfactory position. Koroseno oil lias further advanced. The British and Foreign arrivals compriso two vessels from England, one from Ceylon, ono from China, one from Rotterdam, oue from Sweden, and ono from Javo. Ale and Stout. — Bulk ale, during tho week, has romained quiet, and evinces no signs of improve ment. Tho demand has been small, aud, until up couutry orders can be executed and despatched at a reasonable rate of carriage, is not likely to increase. Bass's, No. 3, has been variously sold at from £G 15s to £7. Of Allsopp's wo have heard of few sales ; for No. 3. £6 15s is wanted ; No. 4 being sold at £7. Marian's continues in favor, aud commands £7 12s Cd to £7 15s from the trade. Joules' realises £7 15s. The Carlisle Company's is quitted readily in trade lots, at £7 12s Cd. For the Colonial Company's, £G is asked ; £6 17s Gd being obtained for their light beer. Ind, Coope and Co.'s is sold nt £7. In Scotch, there is little doing — it is nominally quoted at £5 10s. One parcel sold, all faults, brought £4. 160 hhds English, sold at auction at from £3 5s (for faulty) to £5, in good order. Bulk stout continues difficult to move ; sales being trifling ut £6 10s, for All sopp's ; £6 12s Gd for Wliitbrcad's ; and £6 15s to £G 17s 6d for Taylor, Walker and Co.'s. Bottled ale is not yet much inquired for ; stocks of really good, however, are extremely light ; and, to judge by present appearances, must be much short of what will be required when the warm weather sets in. For best Scotch brands 10s to 10s Gd is asked. Sales of Arrol's havo beon mudo at 10s to 10s 3d. Bass's and Allsopp's command 9s !)d to 10s. Joules' can be bought at 9s Gd. The Colonial Company's is offered at 9s ; and some lots of Byass's old label have been sold at 9s. Bottled stout has been far from nctivo, and consequently disap points in this respect the views of many holders and importers. Henry Whito and Co.'s, in trade lots, brings 10s to 10s 3d. Edmond's pig brands is sold at 10s Gd, but not freely. Blood's and Burko's we quote 9s 4Jd to 9s Gd. Machin's meets with increas- , ing sale at 9s to 9s 3d. Dunphy's is sparingly pur- ' chased at 9s. Byass's is offered more readily at 8s ? 9d. For Hibbert's Ss 3d is accepted. Tho Colonial Ce.'s single stout can be bought at 8s Gd, and double' stout at 9s, a shade less being taken for largo par cels. Bagging. — Corn sacks havo been held for 15s 6d to lGs, but, as no business could bo douo at those rates, holders had to relax, since which some fifty bales were taken up at 15s. Supplies of woolpacks do not meet requirements, and prices arc firm at 6s Gd. Candles attract no attention, few. transactions having come under our notico, nor have wo heard of any inquiries. Tho small trade demand experienced was met at auction, both sound and damaged lots having beon so disposed of. A parcel of Ogleby's, say 300 boxes, 6 lb packets, sold at 9j}d to 9jfd. Fine foreigus, 1 lb packets, brought 104d to lOJd, and damaged, 9gd to 9 Jd ; light weights having been quitted at 7Jd to 7Jd. Belmonts aro held for lid, and the Neva Stearine Co.'s for llid. Confectionery. — A fair trade inquiry exists at lid for best brands of assorted, and Is for jujubes ; candied peel selling at 13d. Chemicals.— Soda crystals' find buyers, to a small extent, at £8 15s. Carbonate can be bought at 19s, but goes off slowly. Caustic there is littlo consumption for at £18 to £19. Hohlors of Hour of sulphnr are ready sellers at £18, but less would be taken. Chest opium has been vainly held for £250 ; liut, as no progress could be made at thoso rates, importers have been induced to take £240, at which a parcel has beon sold this week. English sulphuric aoid can be purchased ot 4d, but we hear of no sales. Tartaric is valued at 2s 2d. Coffee. — ;The demand is not great ; prices, how ever, aro firm at lOJd for plantation, 9.Jd for Native, and lOd to 10jd for Java, of which latter stocks aro small. Chicory. — There is no change to report, 3Jd being obtained for the best description, but only in insignificant qnantitios. Cement. — Portland has not altered, lGs to 16s 6d being the prico realised for parcels in first hands ; plaster, howover, is much lirinor ; and, as there are no lots outside of the trade offering, a very con siderable advance on 15s Gd, our last quotation, is sought to' be established. Cordage. — Manilla ropo is dull, and there aro few inquiries. Wo quote trade lots, assorted sizes, £47 10s. Europe Manilla is held for £46. Europe flat rope, tarred, best sorts, is sold at £G0 ; oommon can bo had at £40 ; ordinary round is worth £3G to £40. In Bengal lines we have heard of no transactions. Best seaming twine sells at 14Jd to l-ijrt. At auction, twino was sold at 9Jd. Fish. — Recent arrivals ot ting have been rapuUy absorbed at 5d to 5Jd. White herrings are not over activo at 26s for half-barrels and 9s 6d for firkins. | Whybrow's red herrings brought 31s per dozen at I auction. ? ? Fruits. — CurrantB have had a free snlo at 4;]d — tho consumption steadily increasing as tho season advances. Raisins show no alteration, though holders confidently look forward to a rise as tho new year approaches. Loose mus catels sell for 5Jd ; layers, ordinary sized boxes, aro worth 6Jd, while small still com mand 7d to 7Jd. ~ Capes havo declined to 6Jd, at which sales are now made. Dried apples are sold at 7d. Figs have boon placed at 5Jd. Bar celona nuts aro offered at 5 Jd. Floor and Grain. — Tho depression in flour is not relieved — for best Adelaide brands, such as Hart's and Magarey's, £14 10s is nominally quoted, but littlo or no business lias been done. Towards the lattor end of the week, however, we heard of a few ordors from New Zealand having becu executed at £13 15s to £14 for Hart's. Merri mills is quoted at £13 10s. Adelaido wheat has boon placed at 5s lOd, and Victorian is valued at 5s 4d to ?5s 6d. For oats thoro is a better inquiry; fine samples of colonial for milling are scarce, and com mand Gs 4.$d ; feeding sorts havo been sold at Gs ; Danish are heavy at 5s ; fino Irish have beon quitted nt 4s Gd ; ordinary Scotch aro offered at 4s 3d. Feeding barley is nominal at 4s 6d to 4s 9d ; malt ing has been purchased at -5s Gd. Maize can bo had nt 4s Cd for parcels to 4s 7$d for small lots. There is no sale for gram.

Oils. — Linseed is dull at 5s 9d in drnms, aud 5s 3d in bulk. Castor is in little request at 5s 3d. Colza und Chinese burning oils aro much wanted, but at present are seemingly out of tho market. Kerosene has been more activo. Oriontal changed hands at 3s 3d, and Downer's at 3s 5il, and is still in requost at thoso rates ; but most of the stocks in town is now held for 4s. Oilmen's Stores. — lib jams are saleable at 10s Gd to 10s 9d. Bottled fruits are being barely sup plied ; 14s, if not more, could be got. Sales, to arrive, have boon made at 13s to 13s Gd. Picklos, Molloy's, havo been placed at Gs, and up to 9s is requirod for finer brands. Whybrow's quart vinegar brought 8s, pint salad oils lis 4Jd, half-pints Gs Gd.

On i buttor, as well as hams and bacon, there has been I quito a run sinco tho arrival of the New Zealand steamers in tho beginning of tho weok. Of buttor considerable parcols changed hands at 8Jd to 8id, then 9d to 9id wa3 paid. Yesterday about 800 to 900 firkins were disposod of at lOd. To-day salos havo beon made at lO.Jd, and wo understand much higher prices arc anticipated. A great deal willj however, depend on tho tonor- of European advices by tho mail, now nearly duo. Iu liko manner lavgo parcels of hams and bacon have been picked up. York havo been placed at lid. About forty cases Broom's hams, eqnal lo Sinclair's, brought 13d. About forty cases Campbell's hams and bacon also wore parted with, but the price was not given. About 80 cases Cooy's realised 14d ; aud 40 casos Sinclair's sold early in tho week at 14d.

Privately sales havo beon made of first j white crystals, at £38 ; of yollows, at £33 10s ; and I our quotations of £32 10s and £34 5s for first counters, £29 for medium, aud £22 and £24 for rations, remain unaltered.
