They tell Denmark about us Australia's intake of Scandinavian migrants should benefit from a visit of Danish journalist Mr. Jorgen Ranten, who has arrived in Australia. Mr. Ranten, the second Danish journalist to visit Australia to study our immigration programme, arrived at Port Melbourne aboard Skaubryn at the end of December. He represents the newspaper Berlingske Tidende which is very widely distributed in Denmark. His articles are published also in Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian papers. Mr. Ranten plans to produce a series of articles and picture stories on his return to Europe after about six weeks in Australia. He is particularly interested in the Australian experiences of Scandinavian migrants. He will visit Bcnegilla Reception Centre and see migrants settling in. Mr. Ranten hopes to visit some of our great national projects, and to meet Scandinavians who have been settled in Australia for some years. The other Danish journalist, correspondent of a Danish magazine with a 900,000 circulation in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, is Mr. Hakon Mielche. Mr. Mielche, who has been in Australia since late last year, plans to have written 36 articles on Australia before he leaves in April. He will also write a book on Australia's immigration programme.
