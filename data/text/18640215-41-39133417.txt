The Helena is one of the well-known Peter Godeffioy line of passenger vessels, some of which have been in the Adelaide trade for a long perioiL On her last voyage here the Helena afterwards loaded wool at Fort Augusta, and made a favour able passage to England. She is now commanded hy Captain Waller, who reports leaving Hamburg in September, and after a very stormy passage down the British Channel was subject, from Cape Finnuterre to the Line, to a continuation of calms and light variables. On reaching the Cape of Good Hope some of the passengers landed, and a longer . detention than expected was caused to the vessel from the indisposition of the chief officer; but she sailed from there on January 9, and occupied but a short time over a month on the run down. The cargo on board consists of the usual miscellaneous assortment of light goods, and is not very exten sive, consequently the master was inclined to dis charge in the anchorage; but during the day the steam-tug Young Australian to .red her into har bour. The names of the cabin passengers were telegraphed on Friday night, and above will be found the list of persons in the steerage. Unfor . tunately the captain hail omitted to procure later Cape papers, but he reports that prior to his depar ture one of the Adelaide wool ships had touched there in order to repair damages, the is described 03 a long Liverpool vessel with iron frame and wood planking, but he does not iememlier her name. The steamer Penola left the wharf shortly after 4 o'clock on Saturday. At Port Robe she will take in a cargo of wool for Melbourne. The Alexandka sailed for Melbourne and Sydney early on Saturday morning. The following additions were made to her passenger list:— For Melbourne — Joshua Lazarus, Ann Cuinaford, Henry Dally, William Hoskins, John Hanley, and Ann Malony, in the steerage. In the cargo \- list, 400 bags wheat, Beeby and Duustan, should have been 204 togs. The T. E. Boyd arrived from Melbourne on Saturday, after a passage of remarkable celerity, having left there on the 11th. Sh? reached the lightship anchorage on the 13th. Her owner. Captain Currie, is a passenger on board, and in the T. E. Boyd he has a vessel in every way adapted to meet the requirements of the colonial . trade, being a very fast sailer, and of sufficient capacity to carry a large cargo on alight draft. During Captain Currie's absence from the Port he has made a trip to America, for the express purpose of selecting vessels as additions to the colonial mercantile fleet, and his choice of the T. E. Boyd was certainly made with judgment and care, and three other vessels— the Douglas, Isabella, and Catherine— were at the same time purchased. Captain Stock reports leaving Port Phillip Heads at 8 a.m. on the 11th, and on the 12th, at 2, passed Cape Northumberland. On the 13th entered the . Gulf, and reached the anchorage on the same day. The Verulam. for London, was towed to the moorings at Light's Passage on Saturday morning, . where she will take in the remainder of her cargo. PORT ELLIOT SHIPPING. Sailed. Friday, Februabt 12.
