The following letters will interest many of our readers: From Mr. H. Jewell,. 65 ' Richmond . ,! Terrace, Ttlc-hmoncl, Vic. 'Borrie months ago one of my kidneys was severely bruised by a fall of rock whilst working: on the sewerage contract, and I was laid up and helpless., for fSDveral;.weeks_The pain I ïutTerecl.was excruciating.. could not eat "'or sleep. Rael became very weak and despondent; more especially when the doctors who were attending mo failed to do me any good, and only made matters worse by - telling me that I should never be able to do any laborious work again. I was so bad that four doctors were in attendance upon me. Failing to get relief from medical men, I at last decided to try if Warner's Safe' Cure would benefit me. I little thought that it would restore "me to health,, but it did so in a very short time, I took in all about seven bottleful of the medicine, when I was up and back at-my work again, on the sewerage contract, which is no light work for the strongest of men. I I think that my case proves the I efficacy of Warner's Safe Cure in the most severe cases." r . From Mrs. Marr Black, 30 Ann Street, Surry Hills. Sydney, N.S.W. "About six years ago, when I was in Western Australia, I Buff creek from kidney complaint for about two years. I consulted three doctors, but got no relief from their prescriptions. Then a friend advised me to take Warner's Safe Cure. After taking two bottles I felt greatly relieved, and after taking, perhaps, seven or eight bottles altogether, I was completely cured. My symptoms were loss of appetite, ex- cruciating pain in the . small of the back, lassitude, with no energy to do housework. I got them from- inability to take my meals." Warner's Safe Cure is sold by chemists and storekeepers everywhere, both in the original (5/-) bottles and in the cheaper (2/6) non-alcoholic (Concern stated) form.
