The Dudbrook left Newcastle on the 14th instp.nt, with S00 tons coal, bound lor New Zealand, but when about 190 miles to the east ward it was found that the vessel was too deep to prosecute the voyage with falcly, and Captain Duncan deemed it prudent to bear up for Sydney, nnd discharge a portion of her cargo. This is another instance illustrating tho risk incurred by overloading yessels, | The Susannah Booth, from Otago, has had a succession of ; heavy westerly gales since leaving, more particularly from the 9th to tbe )2lh instant, and again on the 16th, the vessel being , compelled to reduce canvas to only foretopmast and main etay- ! sails. A large three-masted schooner was sighted on tbe 9th iu- ! etant, running to the S.E. The barque Frederick baB had a very tedious passage of 175 1 days.

Captain Hsyes bos furnished us with the following elaborate account of bis passage from Hokianga, which we have published more especially as, with other reports, it will tend to obviate the difficulty under which Lieutenant Saxby appears in oompiling his weather table for this part of the world :— The Caroline crossed the bar at Hokianga on Thursday, May 12th, at noon, with fine weather, the wind at north, veering to westward, bat with a falling glass ; encountered heavy weather tbe same night, wind veering from north and westward round to southward , with heavy confused sea and thick rain. 18th. Strong southerly and westerly winds and squally weather. 14th, Light aire from the eastward. From 14th to 17th, strong winds, veer ing and hauling from N.W. to S.W«, and heavy equalle, with rapidly falling glass ; the night of the l&th;, aneroid below 29*20, with bearp westerly gale. 18th, hove to with heavy gale from the southward ; glass rising to 39- 8P. ) 9th, strong winds from the southward, bearing to east ward, with heavy squalls and rain ; glass rose to 29 US. From 19th to 22nd, fresh breezes, ranging backwards and forwards between south and east, with fine weather and occasional squallB ; glass rising steadily. 22nd and 2Srd, steady moderate winds from tbe eastward, with fine, clear weather ; aneroid up to 30*47. 23rd, passed a barque standing to the northward ; found current of about j knots per hour to S.8.E., at 120 miles from tbe land. 23rd and 24th, light aire varying from S.W, round by east to N.W., and calm, with light showers ; current, at 50 to BO miles from the land, about ]£ knot per hour south. 24tb, at 8 p.m-, made 8outh Headlight, W'. byN., distant about 25 miles. Barque Roderie Dbu, Captain Macpbereon, loading at Hokianga for Bombay, via Sydney, would probably be ready for sea at the end of thie month. During tbe passage of Caroline the glass bad been both remark ably low, viz., below 29 20, and equally high, vi/, 3047— the former during strong N.W, and westerly gales, but not so violent in the Caroline's position as to expect &o; low a glass— the latter during fine and settled weather, with wind varying from S.E. round to easU Tbe Roderick Dhn had been to a place called Jackson's Bay, on the west coast of tbe Middle Island, from Twofold Bay, with 6tock to form a station, but not any country being founo on wbich the stock could bo placed, brought them on to Bekianga, where they were landed. The Caroline brings a fine specimen of a rare species of pigeon, sent by Mr. John Webster, of Hokianga, for the Zoological Gardens. AceiDEKT on uoaed ^hip.— Ofl the 19th instant, as the City of Newcastle (s. ) was leaving for Newcastle, Mr, Allen, the chief officer, had one of bis legs broken by tbe carrying away of the bowline, which forced a block against him. Tho limb is the same that was broken a few years since in a like manner, and a little below the eame place. A few weeks ago Mr. Allen broke one of his arms, and had scarcely recovered from its effects before another accident befel him, Mr, Allen was conveyed asuore in a boat, and taken to his residence, where two medical attendants set his leg. Tbe Grafton (?,), from Macleay River, crossed tbe bar at 7.30 am. on 21st, and arrived at noon 22nd instant. She had fresh south-east breezes, with heavy rain squalls and confused sea throughout Uie passage. At 7 p.m. on 21st passed a steamer, supposed to be the llrara, off Cape Hawko. The Grafton brings up 870 bagB,mai7.e, 11 eases eggs, 2 coops fowls, 2 bales skins, and sundries. Amaikub Champion SciLuyc Matcii: Huntkb's Hti.l,— Champion Aniatenr Sculler's Race, open to all bona-tide gentlemen amateurs in tbe Australian colonies. From Mr. Huntley's poiat, round Spectacle Island, and back to stating point. Entrance £2 2a. Prize— a 50 guinea cup. This event was the result of the disputed contest which toak place on the 1st January last at Hunter's Hill, and formed a portioa of the programme of tbe annual regatta held at that place. On that occasion tbe pullers were— Messrs. Crook, Fitzhardinge, Deloitte, Bennett, end Moore, the above being tbe order in wbich they arrived at tbe flag-boat. The protests were of a double character, viz., againt-t the start as referring 10 Messrs. Crook and Fiizharaingc aid ngainst tbe boat pulled by the latter, being longer consi derably than the stipulated length, le?s than the stipulated depth for the class of boats in which she claimed to rank ; and these protest* being entered, it was decided by tbe committee that the race ehould be pulled over again. Thus premising, then, wc may state that on the present oceasion the interest in the event was not apparently lessened by the time which had elapsed, the waters in the vicinity of Hunter's Hill being almost cohered with beats of every description. Mr. Bennett did ljot make an appearance, the competitors were therefore re duced to four, viz., Mr. Moore (Star of Australia), pulling in purple; Mr. Deloitte (Zerlina), in his now well-known colour magenta; Mr. Crook (l'avorita), in the light blue adopted by him on different occasions : and Mr. Fitzhardingc (Cornstalk), in tbe noticeable tawny and blue. Mr, Moore did not seem altogether in his usual sbipe, befog stiffer and u little outof condition; tbe other wen all in capital trim, and all alike readv to strLggle for victory. Little difficulty was experienced ji placing tbe pullers, and at Mr. Robinson's signal tbey went off very close, making a capital start. Abreast of the wharf Mr. Deloitte began to lead, increasing bis distance to tome two or three lengths of hiB boats by tho time tbey got to JPalpit Point. Here, however, Mr. Fiubardinge, who had actually been for a little while last, pulled up, und at the bottom or the .aland led round the point. On the south side Mr. Crook pulled up, and in hie turn led but for a minute only. Mr. Deloitte, petting on a little steam, took first place, and at tbe upper end of the island had bis boat clcar ahead, where he kept her; Mr. Crook occasionally palling up to his stem. Zerlina, however, was not to be beaten, and on each n earing of the Favorita, with a couple of strokes, was lifted away again: tbe others, now a long way behind, but Btill pulling hard. When within a hundred yards of the flagbo&t; Mr. Deloitte polled right away from bis plucky antagou'ft, and landed about a couple of lengths ahead amidst the vociferous cheers of bis friends; Mr, Moore, when close to the finish, pissing Mr. Fiubardinge, both of them apparently raftering from tho exertion. It is not too little to say of Mr. De loitte's pulling that it is tho most scientific and finished style of any of our gentlemen amateur#, and this on 21st Instant, pulling against heavier men as he did, was most evident, Hia stroke by no means short, pulling well forward and through, with a telling, graceful sweep, and clean lift of the paddles from the water pe culiar to himself, which, added to au absence of any spasmodic effort, constitutes, we believe, the style of tbe most finished rowex. On his present success, securing the most valuable prise yet pulled for by gentlemen scullers in the oelony, and agtunst men, some considered, his superiors, we heartily congratulate hi m- It may be worthy of notice that the first three boats were built by Mr. Reynolds, of Balmain. Tho report of the Vernon is as follows Left Southampton December 4th, 1868, with 873 Government immigrants, under oharge of Captdn Goldamid, and under the medical superintend ance of Dr. James Sheridan Hughes, Owing to contrary winds was compelled to anchor off the Mother Bank, Isle of Wight, and remain there till tbe 13th of same month, when she prooeeded on her voyage. When a short time out, the Incapacity of the captain displayed itself, a spirit of insubordination broke out amongBt a portion of the crew, and the vurgooB-superinlendcnt resolved, with the assistance of the chief omoer, to put into Rio Janeiro, The state of the ship waa there laid before the British oonsol, wh- Imprisoned the mutinous portion of the crew, removed Captath Goldsmld, and appointed the chief officer, Mr, Aldddge, to take 1 command of the vessel.

The instru ment, which Is the invention of Mr. 6. B. Bingcr, is ingcniouslv constructed. The disc is formed of mother-of-pearl, on« half being dark. On the darkest night it can easily be read. For mariners it is invaluable, as it docs away with the necessity for a binnaclc light, and for travellers in tbe bush it will be very useful. Messrs. Sawtell and Son, the agents for the sale in this colony, left one of tbe compasses at our offlcc, and wc have had an oppor tunity of testing it. On a very dark night we had no difficulty lu reading the card, and we have no Hesitation in saying that it would be possible to steer a vessel on the darkest night without the aid of artificial light, within a single point. The invention has been subjected to a rigid test, and naval captains and pilots in England have expressed a favourable opinion of its merits,— H A, Megister, May 9, (Shipping Newt continued from page 9.) r IMPORTS. | *eU \ SlOpackaiea, S.

Hale, Tbk DuMAHriNA.— Intelligence has arrived— overland from Maekay— respecting a somewhat serious disaster which is stated to bave befallen tbe Dlamantina in tbe Pioneer H-Wer. Fall par ticolars bave not yet reached us, but we learn that whilst dis charging *ber cargo alongside the bank of tbe river, near the landing-place, It wa£ suddenly discovered that tbo tide ebbing rapidly bad left the steamer partly resting on a snag, tbe precise locality of which was pretnraed to be out of the wav of the vijuet, and which, before tbe Dlamantina could be eased off had forced jjg way through and made a hole in her bottom. This sccid^at, we are informed, will verr pinbably cause the steamor to be de tained some eight or ten days in the river.

Tbe public importance of the principle hue been fully acknow ledged, Indeed, by its partial adaption by tbe Admiralty, and the testimony given u- its merits io tbe House of Commons by Linl Cljijrnce Pa^ct, £ir iam?i E2phiaetono, aad others. These triih hnve bitbtTto taken plate on the comparatively smooth waters of tbe Ibamce, but on Wednesday and Thursday, tbo iCth and 17t!i instant, the twin screws reached tboir as yet culmiiift ting point of success in tbe trial trip of the AtaUnu from London to Calais, and tbcncc in a rnc2 between that port and Dover with one of the fastest boats of the London, Chatham, and Dover Hallway -V-m- paby. 1 be Atalanta is an iron vessU, built by Messrs. J. anil W. Dudeeon, of Cubi'tt-town-yard, Millwall; is 500 ton* burden, 200 feet long, 24 feet in breadth, 14 feet in depth, and U driven by two screws, with independent engines, the collective power bcin'if 2.J-) borse. She iaa smart, clipper-looking craft, possessing »it the same time large carry Ing powers. On Wednesday ebe left Graved enc at fifteen minutes past twelve, in charee of Mr. Leigh, Trinity Pilot, the wind bring fresh ftom K SE , and the young fliod tide coming upagainfct her. The steam was up for the first time, and it was therefore not Intended to make any official trial of her speed between tbe Thames and CaloU, the port to which she was first bound, but in passing tbe measured mile in Long Reach she vas found to be going 14-136 knots, which certainly appeared to confirm the assertion of bt-r builders that she would prove to be, for ber tonnage and horse-power, tbo fastest screw vessel afloat, Tbe Nore light-ship was w»ed ut twenty-one minutes past one, tbe greater part o! the lime the port engine only having been at work, owing to some adjustment being required to the starboard crank besrings, but even under tfaffce disadvantageous circumstances the distance, 2J& miles, was made in 75 minutes, Tbe wind was now freshening, but the water was smooth and tbe weather clear as tbe vessel kept on her course through tbe Oaze Deeps snd tbe Alexandra Channel, the engines making 120 revolutions without a rattle, and doing their work magnificently. At 4,80 p m. the bold outline of the South Fore land wee merged in the gi-neral dark outline of the English coist nnder tbe Atalanta's lee, while tbe white cliffs of Fraace west of Calais were riting rapidly above the line of waters ahead. At 6 p.m. the Atalanta was la her berth alongside the pier at Calais, just ahead of the psddlo mail packet Vivid, with which she was to try ber strength across Channel on the following 'day, Tho distance between tbe Downs and Calais oould bave been accomplished in considerably less time, quick oa it really was, but for tbe vessel having boen kept I db a mid-channel course between Dover and Calais for seme ten miles, thus deviating from ber direct course ] for the lattc r place. On Thursday the Atalanta crossed over from 1 Colulg to Dover, so as to steam back from tho latter to tbe former I nlsce in company witb tbe Vivid, which waa appointed to lea^e ! with tbe mail for Dover ot 0.30. At 45 minutes past 9t the ; Vivid came out, and the Atalanta baring been placed in position | as nearly as possible abreast of her, the race across commenced. From the time of rtsrting the result waa never for a moment in doubt. The Vivid, pitching her bows into the aea as she Rot clear of ibe laud, was evidently makl/ig bard work of Jt, and fast j dropping astern of the Atalanta, which, without throwing a drop of spray over her deck, waa making her way In splendid style, and improving ber position with every fn»h pufl of wind ana roll of tbe sea. As tbe French land was neaied the wind frrabent-d, and w it so freshened and the sea rose Ut better tbe Atalanta behaved. Calais was reachcd in scveuty revm minutes by tbe Atalanta, but tbe Vivid was 107 minutes— I bnlf on hour behind the double screw. The success waso. w dccided fl character that it wan considered unnoctPf-ary to teat the tpf-i-d ofthe boat any further, and a return coarse was therefore f-haped for tbe Thames, where i»he arrived at 5 p m., and where fbc will complete her outfit for tbe service for which *ne has been built. In crossing theCnsr.nel tbe action of tbe screw oa each quarter was beautifully distinct thiougb tbe deep, blue C'earnefw of the water, and it was autpriaing to notice with what rmooth solidity and entire uVtuce or water disturbance ct fcUy kind they worked.— JfFw«, Match 16.
