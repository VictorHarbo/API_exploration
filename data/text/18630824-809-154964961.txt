COMMERCIAL. - Age Office, Saturday Evening. Export entries wero passed at the Customs to day on 5 oz of gold, for shipment per Madras for Point de Galle. As our monthly reviow of tho markets, which will bo published in to-morrow's issue, embraces the transactions of tho past week, it is unnecessary on the present occasion to give more than a barp out line of what has occurred during that period in the import market, which continues without ovincing any appearance of improvement. Privately, soles can only be effected with the utmost difficulty, and then only at roduced prices, while fruitless attempts have been made to sell at auction large quantities of goods not generally disposed of in that manner, dealers having no desire to operate.

Tho Hobart Town Mercury, of tho former dato, says : — iiusmess has continued iluu during to-uay, anu very few transactions havo taken place. A small parcel of wheat was Bold for local consumption, but at the same rates as previously quoted. Thero nvo considerable quantities of potatoes arriving, bnt wo have no chango to record.

The latest commercial report is as follows : — Business has remained quiet sinco our last report. The, principal loading the last few days has been for tho now Hogburn diggings. Tho latest quota tions for carriage are: Dunstan, £22 10s; Lake, £43 to £16 ; Hogburn direct, £22 to £25; The principal feature worthy of remark is a noticeable diminution of shipments to this port. A further cessation will necessarily give a firmer tono to the market. As it is, many holders of stocks prefer wailing a turn iu the chango of events to parting with their goods at our last quotations, which are without change. The news from Melbourne is un important. That market was exceedingly languid, and speculation hud received a check. Flour remained firm, at £14 10s per ton for Hart's aud Magaroy's ; other Adelaide town brands, £14 ; and country brands, £13 10s ; Victoria silk dressed, £13 ; lino Adelaide wheat, 6s per bushel.

Malt : Tho rocently improved feeling has boon quite checked by tho English advices. Tho last quotation was 8s Gd to 8s 9d per bushel. Sugar : Tho market was very depressed. Teas maintained full rates. Blasting powder : Some spe culation had taken place, aud considerable sales bad been effected at 7d per lb ; holders now ask 7Jd. Alo and beer : Tho low prices ruling for bulk had induced several rather large purchases. Parcels had changed hands of Marrian's at £7 10s to £7 12s Gd ; Allsopp's, £7 to £7 5s. Ind, Coopo and Co.'s light ale was held for £8. Somo large 2-arcels of Allsopp's and Bass's had been placed at prices not disclosed. Scotch alea, £6 10s to £0 12s Gd per butt.

Stock Market. — Wright, Robert son and Co. report for the week, ending 8th August, 18G3 : — The market this week has been very irre gularly supplied with stock; tho few lots of fat cattle that have come forward being eagerly bought up by the butchers, at an advance on late rates. Fat sheep are much wanted and scarce. Store, both cattle and sheep, arc much inquired for, and few offering. The only arrivals this week are the Oregon, from Welshpool, with store, and the Priiico Alfred, from AVangpui, with fat cattle. Tho former lost very few, but tho latter lost 16 out of 60 head shipped. Station property much inquired for, but no transactions to report. Fat cattle : A fair supply came to hand during tho week, principally Provincial bred, and of ouly middling quality, but they were readily sold at fully last week's quotations. Wo yarded 40 head from tho Canterbury Province, chiefly cows, light weights, which realised £18 to £23 per head. Wo quote first quality bee.f at from G5s to 70s per 100 lb ; second do, from 55s to 60s per 100 lb. Fat calves are iu good demand, but very few coining for ward. Wo sold 15 head, Igood quality, at from £G to £8 5s each. This may bo taken as the market value for first quality, smaller, and poorer conditioned ones proportionately less. Store cattle : The demand for good stores still continues brisk ; wo sold 100 head, mixed Provincial bred, at £15 10s. The Oregon arrived from Gipps Land with 85 very fine bullocks ; they were sold at £12 10s por head. We quote provincial cattle over two years old at £12 to £14; ship do, £11 to £13; mixed lota from £10 to £12. Working bollocks : No great demand at present exiRts for teams, their value rules about tho samo as last week — say from £55 to £G5 per pair. Dairy cows : Few really good cows are brought to the hammer, thoso in full milk or near calving are most saleable, with nu merous inquiries. Owners disposed to sell would rea lise good prices. Wo quote their value at from £20 to £25. Fat sheep: In tho nbsenco of many comiing in hand, few transactions have taken placo during tho week. We sold 300 wethers from tho station of T. Ord, Esq., deliverable at Tokomairiro at 8d por lb. Ruling price in Dunodin may bo quoted at from 8d to 8Jd for prime mutton ; second quality, from Cdto7dperlb. Store sheep : Thero are numerous inquiries for this description of stock, any coming to hand can be readily placed at full value. We havo no transactions to report. Large framed Pro vincial wethers aro worth from 28s to 303 ; ewcB, 33s to 35s ; imported wethers, from 24s to 2Gs ; owes, '28s to 80s per head. Station property : No transactions to report. Horses of a light de scription, adapted for saddlo and packing pur poses, continue in active request. Our Bales during the week number over 100 head, and tho prices realised wero marked by an advance of at least 15 per cent, on late quotations. Tho market is now almost bare of anything saleable, and until tho arrival of supplies from Victoria and Hobart Town wo may expect a still further advance. Thero is a fair inquiry for first-class and medium heavy draught, but they also are nearly all drafted out of tho market. \V*o have over 20 head light horses for sale to-day (the propurly of Messrs Dun can and Wilson) after which we must bo entirely dependent upon odd lots from tho various glaziers until exports aro again resumed from the other colonies. Wo quote — First-class heavy draughts (none in the market), £76 to £90 ; second-class, do, £45 to £05 ; first-class light harness none offer ing), £45 to £60; second-class do, £30 to £40; lii.st-clnss saddlo (few offering), £10 to £55; second do, £20 to £35. ^
