COMMERCIAL. Aob Office, Saturday Evening. There -were no export entries passed at the Cus toms for Gold to-day. The past week has been another exceedingly ?dull one. The import market has evinced no ?animation, and no transactions of any importance nave been reported. The arrival of the mail has also further unsettled business ; and as it was late on Friday, before merchants were in receipt of their advices, it is difficult to give any very correct account of the true state of the market. There have been «everal failures during the week, which have caused a tone of general insecurity to pro Tail, and whilst, on the one hand, the demand ifl very limited, on the other; merchants find it necessary to exercise such caution that business has been brought almost to a stand-still. The present condition of the -trade may be pretty plainly gathered from, the fact that some of our largest importing houses are now quitting their goods in small retail quantities — single boxes and baes. The week commenced unfavorably with the failure of Baxter and Walker, of Collingwood for the sum of — as near as can be ascertained — £10,000. The assets are stated at about 7s in the pound. Mr Goodman Teale is somewhat involved in this estate, *nd at present it is difficult to etate how the matter will ultimately be settled. Next came the failure of Mr Nicholson, wine and Spirit merchant, of Bourke. street. The liabilities here are about £10, )00, and although the assets are stated nominally at £6000, yet the greater portion of them are of such a questionable character that but a Very poor dividend is ex pected. On Friday it wo* announced that 'Williams Brothers, of Ballaarat West, had called a meeting of their creditors, and on Satur day the failure of another house at Geelong, also in the. wine and spirit trade, was reported on 'Change. A large Melbourne house, whose place of business is in Collins street also suspended payment upon Saturday, with unsecured lia bilities, stated roughly at £19,000. A meeting of the creditors of the estate of Moses, Myers and Co., late of Bendigo was held at the Colonial Bank on Saturday last, and it was then unanimously agreed that the official assignee should bring another action against Davies and Co. for the compensation which it is alleged they had agreed to pay in consideration of the whole of the estate having been handed over to them. The creditors have subscribed 2a in the pound upon the amount of their claims, to defray the necessary expenses. The intelligence received from' the continent re presents the vines to have greatly suffered from the severe frosts, .so that there was but little pro bability of the vintage of 1861 yielding more than halt the average crop. This had rendered the brandy market very firm, and Messrs MarteJl, Hennessy, and fho United Vineyard Proprietors Company had instructed their London agents to decline all orders for the present. This fact would, no doubt, have improved the tone of the market here had it not been for the large ship ments—upwards of 44,000 gallons — during the month ending the 12th of May. As it is, there is no great probability of an improvement being established upon present quotations. The exports of butter, we are happy to see, have fallen off; but we have large supplies of bacon, cheese, oilmen's stores, and also of malt. Taken as a whole, it does not seem probable that the intelligence by the mail will produce any great effect upon the colonial markets. As we have mentioned before, we have nothing of import ance to report relative to the import trade. With the exception of breadstuff, our quotations are nominally the same as last week's. In flour thero has been a slight reduc tion, holders being anxious to induce a brisker business than has lately been doing. A great deal of inferior flour is in the market, and con tinues to be moved off under false brands, to the detriment of the legitimate trade. A few small parcels have been quitted for shipment to New Zealand, and it is probable that a considerable quantity will be required to supply the increased demand caused in the island by the presence of a largo number of troops. Our quotations are — for country and town-made, £16 to £16 10s ; superfine silk dressed, £17 to £17 10s ; Adelaide sorts, £16 to £17 ; and Hart's and Magarey's £17 to £17 10s. Bran has .improved in consequence of a considerable quantity having been taken for exportation. It is now selling at from Is 2jd to Is 3d. Wheat is ruling at for Vic torian from 6s 3d to 7s, and for South Australian from 7s 3d to 7s 4|d. Oats have not been m bo good demand, the trade being pretty well supplied. Prices, however, continue the same : 4s for Scotch, Irish, and Danish, 3s lOd to 4s 2d for Californian, and 4s 4d to 4s 6d for Colonial. There is still a good demand for sugars of all descriptions. Messrs Fra3er and Cohen sold the whole of the cargo of Mauritius, ex Planter, on Tuesday last, at consi derably improved rates, the bidding being very brisk.

By the Aldinga we have received our file of South Australian papers to the 1 1th inst. The news is generally of an unimportant character. The following relative to the flour and grain market is from the S. A. Register of the above date : — Flour remains very dull of sale, and prices £14 10s to £15. Wheat has been very quiet, buyers offering 6s Id, and sellers asking 6s 2d for parcels at the Port ; in town the millers are still giving 5s 9d. Our usual Market Reports' and Prices Current will be found in our seventh page. Saturday Evening, 13th July, 1861. Stock and Shahe Market.— There wa3 a large business transacted on the Stock Exchange this week. Monday commenced very briskly, and animation continued up to this day. All descrip tions of stock had their supporters. During this month and August, a large number of meetings of joint-stock companies are held, annual or half yearly balance-sheets are submitted, and the divi dends to be declared become at this period the subject of anxious speculation. Amongst those which will divide their profits, during the next six weeks may be enumerated the Bank of Vic toria ; of Gas Companies, the Ballaarat, Bendigo, Castlemaine, Geelong, and Melbourne ; of Insurance Companies, the Australasian, Colonial, and Victoria Life. We are not able to record much confidence in Mining Companies' shares. Business in them is not steady, and the prices paid are, naturally enough, based upon the prospects of the hour, which may undergo a serious alteration the day following. We trust before long being able to record the conclusion of arrangements for several mines no-v in abeyance being worked upon the tribute system. This will be found to be the most satisfactory adjustment of the respective positions of capital and labor that can be compassed in mining affairs. It will protect the capitalist from being drawn into and becoming deeply involved in schemes which aie utterly fallacious, and it will give the working miner a direct interest in the labor at which he is employed. We could quote an instance of a party of twenty tributor3 in the Castlemaine district, doing well for the owners of the mine, and clearing for themselves over £7 103 per week per man. On 'Change to-day, the fol lowing sales wero made : — Colonial Bank, at £5 12s 6d, and a small lot to an urgent buyer, at £5 14s. National Bank, at £3 10s. Bank of Vic toria, at £35 and £35 2s 6d. Melbo urne and Hobson's Bay Railway, at £41. Suburban Rail way, at £1. Eagle Hawk Association, Tarran gower, at 16s and 16s 6d, and Mount Koronf, Lane's Reef, at Is 3d. The aggregate sales of the week are recorded in the ' business done' column of the share list. TWwva ? rwm;«i n„„i, 1, ? i... . :j ' , '.ive ueen aeait in to a considerable extent. Sales on Monday at £5 12s 6d; towards close of the week £5 'j.ls 6d was ac cepted. lo-day a better leeliig jyas manifested,1 &ncl; the prices of this dsy wcslc '\v6rc flpjtiin. 6fc tamable. Transactions have b- j611 0f daily occur rence and numerous. The bank's position with regard to the. Suburban Railway Company and the railway contractor is the ob vious cause of the pre.- /e'nt ^cession from the range of prices ruling for years past. A special meeting of shareholde /s is c£Ilvcmcd for 26th July, foi the purpose of e iecting a director in the place of Mr James Bute? ^nrt( resigned. We would sug gest the desirabi 0£ management taking this opportumt* Qf re-asguring the proprietors, by explaining th*' ^ |3an]t»8 position, with regard to this unfortunate railway undertaking. There is no disguising c^e £act) t]lat discussion on tho proba bilities r ^ t[ie daiiy theme of debate umongst those interested, and it would be very lame p0iiCy 0n the part of the manage mer .c to take shelter under the fact that the m jeting referred to is for a special purpose to jvoid giving -those explanations which the circumstances of the case demand. Since the price has fallen below £5 15s, orders from the country for small parcels of shares have come in freely. National Bank arc wanted at £3 9s, and are offered at '£3 10s, a very close price. Sales of the week have all been at these rates. At the close buyers were much more numerous than sellers. NewSouth Wales have not been moved. Rank of Victoria have been rather largely ?dealt in. The! dividend of 25s per shere (assum ing, as we haVe good reason to do, the customary half-yearly declaration) affords solid ground for the present' demand. It is believed that £10,000 beyond the amount required for dividends, will be available for reserve fund or any other pur pose. Sales have been at £35, and large parcels at £35 2s 6d. At the close to-day £35 5s asked, and £35 offered. Gas Companies. — Ballaarat nominally at 25s premium, but buyers are unwilling to give any thing like this figure whilst the stock of other ?gas companies, with small capital and capable of equally good management, are obtainable at, and in some cases considerably below, par. Bendigo Gas are fancied at £3 10s, and the selling rate is not much over — £3 12s 6d being demanded. . No transactions noted. Castlemaine were sold this week at £2 10s, which seems to have awakened buvers to the fact, that a stock which will proba bly bear a dividend within a few weeks ought to be worth more than fifty per cent, discount. To - day buyers at £2 12s 6d, no sellers. Colling wood Gas have been sold at £5 la. The mar ket was rather weaker this week in conse quence of the directors having given the share holders the option of taking up a pro ratil fresh issue of shares at par. The expected meters have dome to hand, and a large increase in consump tion will promptly follow. Geelong Gas are in favor, and buying and selling prices are creditably close. To-day £3 19s was offered and £4 asked. Several sales during the week at £3 18a 6d and £3 19s. Melbourne Gas are in better request as dividend time approaches. No sales have been ,d ' effected, but buyers are ready at twelve and a half per cent, discount — sellers at five dis. _ As a whole, Gas stocks occupy a good position in the share market at present, and afford prospects of improvement. Insurance Companies. — Australasian have not a quick sale over 30s. Buying price has varied from 29s to 293 6d — sellers at 31s. Sales at the intermediate rate of 30s. We hear that the half year's profits to 30th June are about £6000 ; add ing this to capital, £40,000, and reserve fund, £35,750, we have an aggregate of £81,750. As £1600 will suffice to pay half-yearly dividend at rate of 8 per cent., there ? will still be above £80,000 remaining after its payment, leaving the office value of the shares over 40s each. Of | course, to arrive at the precise intrinsic value it would be necessary to deduct the cost of re insuring current risks, but against this on the other side, there would be the goodwill of an established and flourishing business. Colonial Insurance are offered at 20s, and wanted at 18s 6d. Sales at 18s and 18s 6d have been repeat edly made. An expected 10 per cent, dividend next month causes the stock to be rather eagerly watched by buyers. It should not be lost sight of that this com pany's meetings being annual, the purchaser now gets the benefit . of twelve months' dividend instead of the half-yearly one, which attaches to most other stocks. Melbourne Fire have not been dealt in. Sellers at 3s, buyers at 2s 3d. Victoria Life and General are offered at £3 10s, buyers at £3 7s 6d. AU the sales of the week have been at £3 10s. Opinions as to rate of dividend oscillate from 7s 6d to 10s per share. On Monday last a parcel of Victoria Fire and Marine changed hands at £60. Miscellaneous Companies. — Very little novelty to note, nor is there much room for comment. UJenUlgU YV ULUtWUiA.B UllCiUU au ocr». MC SA11VAC1 stand that the filter beds are being proceeded with. In its present condition the water is not available for domestic use. The brewers oil her have or want it at once. The Hobson's Bay Sea Bathing Company, at their meeting, showed a profit, which they devote to improvements. Guaranty, on the strength of the completion of the sale of their risks at a better price than was previously offered, are in demand at 4s 6d, sel lers at 5s 6d. The company is still encumbered by having money out on mortgage, which, unless the securities are disposed of in globo, may delay the winding up. Sales of a fe ft hundred at 4s 6d. Occasionally 29s is offered for Ovens Waterworks, sellers at 353. Provident Institute more closely held ; none offered, buyers at 13s. On Monday a large parcel of Studley Park Bridge changed hands at 6s 6d. No quotations since. Railways. — Hobson's Bay Railway have been several times sold, and always at the same price — £41. To-day the best offer -jvaa £40, holders asking £42 10s. Suburban Railway have been sold at 203 to 22s, and at all intermediate rates. Transactions have been of duly occurrence, and the market closes with the very narrow margin of Is per share between buyers and sellers. We are sorry that the meeting held this week did not result in anything more satisfactory than an adjournment. In so critical a position as that in which the company now stands delays are dan gerous, and we would urge upon the shareholders to decide upon some distinct course of action at tho adjourned meeting. E3sendon are not in the market. There have been no quotations for St. Kilda and Brighton for some days. ' In the absence of such we may venture an opinion that buyers at £7 or sellers at £5, could be accommodated. Debentures. — St. Kilda and Brighton seven per cents, are offered at 97i ; Suburban Railway ten per cents, at par ; Melbourne Gas seven per cents, at 104 j. The transfer of a parcel of Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway five per cents. (Government), 1873, at 102, .has come to our knowledge. Buyers have given up in despair their inquiries for securities of this class. Dividend Mines. — Ajax are constantly sup ported at 40a, This week's returns are anxiously looked for. Sales of Albion at 15s, a small parcel. At the close to-day there were sellers at 16s ; no declared buyers. Atlas neglected, except by time buyers ; sellers at 20s. Beo Hive have changed hands at 60s cash, and 75a two months. Capper's Reef nominal. Catherine Reef (Keith's) in the market at 5s ; best buyers' bid 3s ; sales on Monday last at 5s 6d cash, 6s 6d three months ; on Tuesday at 5s, and on Wednesday at 3s 3d. Catherine Reef United declared 1\ per cent, dividend on Tuesday last. To-day they were offered at 163 6d ex. div. Clunes would be at once taken at £210. Sellers at £265. Eaglehawk Association have not been so largely dealt in as during the week preceding the present ; con siderable parcels of shares have, however, changed hands. Sales have been chiefly at 16s and 16s 6d' the extreme either way being 15s and 17s 6d. Eaglehawk, Specimen Hill (M'Nair'tt) have been once sold at 15s ; sellers at 25g, buyers at 15s. The position of this once generally icgarded model mine is a heavy blow and sore discourage ment to mining companies generally. With' the' T ! I large sums realised from the mine, and tho share capital all expended, the management comes to the shareholders for more money. They will re qu;re to be very explicit as to the judiciousness of the expenditure before they get assistance out of present difficulties. Fortunately jnany of the shareholders are men of large means, who will ' now have an opportunity of distinguishing them selves by rendering the company liberal aid. Ga ribaldi are offered at £30. Hercules ire again, limited at old rates ; £7 dividend paid this week Some ,Nelsr-n Reef shares were sold at 7s 6d on Monday J since then no transactions. To-day, sellers at 10s. We have casually heard that the company is now busy cru hing. Tyson's Reef. offered at 15s 6d ; United Brown's, at £175; . Vaughan, at 22s 6d ; Victoria Clunes, at £650* . No offers for any of tho four, Progressive Mines — We are informed that tho disputes betwen tho original owners and the town shareholders of the Amherst Mining Com pany are settled. Bagshot were sold at 2s 9d, buyers at 2s 6d. Since the defeat of tho share holders in the Equity suit, &3 only is offered for Bolinda. Clunes Alliance close at £40 — £55, No sales of Eaglehawk Union reported this week. Prices arc very close to-day, 14s 6d offered, and 15s asked. Hustler's Reef have been sold at 4s 6d and 5s ; finishing with 4b bid, and . 5s demanded. Johnson's Reef are lialf-a-crown better than this day week. Some very handsome specimens taken from the mine have -been exhibited at Sandhurst. Sale#, have been at 21s 6d and 22s. This day 23s 6d was offered, and 2os would have been accepted. Sales of Linscott's Reef at 29s, 29s 6d, and 30s. A very satisfactory meeting was held this week at Maldon. Is was deemed advisable (taking warning from the course of other companies in the district) not to be too hasty in declaring divi dends. Long Gully have been dealt in at 3s and 3s 6d, inclusive of Is call, closing to-day with 3s 6d asked ; best buyer, 2s. Sales of Mary'joro' at 2s 6d, ending 2s offered. Mount Korong have been sold at Is 3d and Is 6d. The demand at this wretched price is owing to some golden quartz having been taken out of a thin seam in solid ground, at a point considerably above pre sent water level. Sales of M'lvor Caledonia at 29s and 30s. New Churn offered at 12s. Sales of Sandy Creek at 10s and lis. At the close no sellers. There is a suspicion abroad that there is something favorable to the company's prospects which has not yet been made public. The com pany is blessed with a board of local directors wuo ueugnt inucn in mystery, specimen Lruuy are offered at 10s. Sales of Star Reef at 4s 9d. Steiglitz to be had for the last call.
