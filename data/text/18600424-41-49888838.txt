Thb Gbutd TBixifos.— On January 10 the Grand TrianoBleft Lirerpojl, and on tha 15th Sdlly was passed durin; the prevalence bf heavy south-westerly weather, which continued until the lBtb, when it moderated, and changed to light east and scuth-eaftirly breezes. The north-east trades wc-rc felt on the lOlh February, ia lat. 16° 30' N., long. 25° W., snd nice days subsequent to this period the equinoctial waa crojeed. She donbled the Cape of Good Hope on the 22nd March, and arrived at the anchorage on Sunday night at a late hour, after being 1(3 days on the pissapo. Thb is about an average passage at ttu3 reason of the year. The Grand Trianon on kcr arrival here in Jane, 1355, had not occupied as many days us on the present trip. From the report of Captain Clark, there eppcars to have been no entry of any importance in the log-book, the only inci dent worthy if notice being a narrow escape of collUion with a linre ship on tb« line. On her arrival in the Gulf she cune to anchor aud Orel a rocket, which mas answered from the Pilot Station by a flish light, and shortly after the Doat started, but the weather was so boisterous that it was impossible to land in time to for ward particulars for SI en Jay's publication. Dr. Duncan exhibited his usual promptitude by payisg his visit of Inspection on Monday moruin?, and the steam-tug signal being made, she will no doubt proceed into harbour without delay.
