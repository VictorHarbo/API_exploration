F .j&LM.;&X; 'i&-'Si!E MM T LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. * (BY' JSLEOTJBIC TELEGRAPH. i (FROM OUR OWN REPORTERS.) The following isthe remainder of the report of ? proceedings of the Legislative Council ori Thursday, held over from last issue :— .?'!.'*' ' ? ? '; '' ? MAIN LINE QUESTION. Mr.CROSBY moved that it is inexpedient, whilst Parliament is in session, to wait re ceipt of the Agent-General's despatch con uuiuiug siigsustionB ior tne settlement oi matters in dispute between tlie colony and the Main Line Railway Company. This ^Council1 therefore recommends the Govern ment to irepeat.'its message'of October 4, viz. : — ' Telegrapn at, once terms of sug gested arrangements. Government un favourably disposed to any concessions.' He saidi if ; the Government would place the Agent-General's letters on the table this day week, when the mail arrived, he would not push his motion . Mr., SCOTT seconded1 the motion, and Baid if the Premier's answer was not satis f'actory-a' telegram should be sent, even1 if it were only to relieve those who saw taxa tion looming in the distance.' He thought the Main -'Line Railway was not worth more than half a million. » The PREMIER said the colony was not committed to expend a farthing by any thing Mr: Douglns had done. The Govern ment did' not desire to conceal or make any mystery about anything that was goinc on. There r could not ? be any objection to' tho motion, except on the (ground of expense, and as they would/have full information in about six' days there was no necessity for telegraphing, as letters by tlie mail now at Adelaide were written on September 10. Messrs. MOORE arid FYSH supported the withdrawal of the motion, on condi tion that the letters would be brought before them on arrival. ; Mr. CROSBY said according to tele grams in the Press on Sopt. 27, which tho Attorney- General said in another place tho Government' knew nothing about, and be lieved them to be incorrect, tho arrange 'mpTlfi nftlll(1 ' llftf..

' i The PREMIER at this stage produced a copy of Mr. Douglas's telegram. Mr. CROSBY said, as the Agent General's telegram stated, the despatch was dated Sept. 10, and it would arrive here by the mail next week, if tho Council ' seemed to think it desirable to wait he would ask leave to withdraw the motion. ? ? ? ; !

MESSAGE FKOH THE ASSEMBLY. The ATTORNEY-GENRAL and Mr. M'KEN/IE brought up a mssjage stating the Assembly had passed the Meander Electoral Bill without amendment, also a bill to authorise the redemption of certain debontures, and for other purpoBes. The latter bill was read a first time, and the second reading fixed for Tuesday. AFFIRMATION VERSUS OATH. 1UX'. X 1£-£L UJUVBU UI1U.U 1U LilU U|J1U1UU UJ. this Council the time has arrived when there can be judiciously extended to all classes the provisions of the Imperial Act of 1883, allowing the solemn affirmation of Quakers and Moravians to be taken wher ever in the administration of our laws an oath has been heretofore required. He thought it was time men pursuing an ordinary course of business could go through all necessary forms without having to carry the Bible about in their pocket. He alluded to the flippant way oaths were administered in law courts, and quoted the opinion of Lord Hathorly— no mean authority — upon the subjeot to show that the taking of oaths was to say the least immoral, as men of honour would, nrjj; be any more likely to break their word it' they had not taken an oath, but men with out honour would not hesitate to break their word simply because they had sworn on the Bible.' He considered a man's word should be regarded ns of equal value when given without a pledge as when he gave it with a pledge. Of course perjury would vuLiy us LKiiiiLuies jusij one snuio us oerore. Mr. MOORE seconded the motion for the sake of discussion. He knew that the matter wa9 engaging the attention of Legislatures in various parts of the world, but the motion before the Council was so sweeping 'that he could not support it in its present form. It was not desirable topre cipate matters of this sort, but it was better to proceed by degrees. So far the legislation of the colony tended to dp away with oaths by affixing a form of de claration to schedules of acts of Parlia ment. Thure were large numbers of people who looked Upon an 'oath as binding on their consciences,' and would not have the same feeling with a declaration. Mr. ROOKE opposed the motion, think ing that the abolition of oaths altogether, would have a paaettect onsociety. In the law courts an oath was 'much more binding upon millions '6i 'person's who might be ; called xipon ' to' ; 'give ' evidence than any affirmation1.;'! ''|Ui ','''' ?'' '' ?'' '?

LEGALITY. OF RAILWAY VOTES. [. The adjourned debate was ;then resumed :. on the question whether theioxcess votes _,of £40,000 in 1884, and .£25,000: in 1885, .if or., the: -.Mersey Railway ? should ) not be ..validated by a special Act of Parliament. .,- Mr, MOORE said; the ^mistake had occurred through the Government not shaving brought in an appropriation bill, .which after it had been passed in Assembly ., should be brought before the Council for its concurrence. As it was, the money was . spent simply , upon: a resolution agreed to , .in committee of ways and means. They , did not wish to raise ? any dissent over this . matter, but simply wished to see things -done in order.

TO THE GOVERNOR. .,'' ?',.{'. -, -When, ,thp; .Council., resumed.- the PREMIER ' presented , the report of, the committee appointed to prepare; an address to his Excellency the .Governor, and moved it'be read, which was agreed to. .-.;.,.' ... . : ?:, In moving its adoption, the. ; PREMIER said since the Governor had arrived. in Tasmania, he, had; always shown.; himself fully . alive . to ; the importance of his position, and he (tlie Premier) felt sure he ?wbnld not.have grumbled if his duties had been. more onerous, seeing that that he had tiefore coming here been Governor,, of Crown colonies, where ihe had a much greater amount of official work to do. His Excellency had made himself thoroughly acquainted with the island throughout its length and breadth, and had exhibited the warmest interest in our charitable institu tions, and had particularly endeared him self to the children in all nublic institu tions, and this alone was an admirable trait in the character of any man holding such a position. The way Sir Geo. Strahan had governed the colony deserved the highest commendation, and the, way, his purso had been opened to all needy institu tions was alike exceedingly gratifying to all who had now to part with him. . . ? Mr. MOORE seconded the motion -with the greatest pleasure. He had had an in timate acquaintance with his , Excellency, .. and had accompanied him on , many, \ of . his . tours . .throughout ,the island,, and his Excellency had always exhibited, the, ?warmest interest in theiprogress of ,the' colony.', . Whilst '.'on, these, ; tours .. he , ;inade, very many valuable suggestions for the improvement of many matters, several of which had- been carried out. Sir George Strahan had shown practical sympathy with charitable institutions, and although when he. came here he.. found some of them in a very bad state, he had witnessed their improvement, and ho (Mr. ; Moore ) was pleased to say many of those improve ments followed . upon suggestions made by his Excellency, who never failed when inspecting them to lend a willing ear to any coinplaiat, and to carefully note any thing[whichrequiredalteration,always with a view to seeing it carried out. Although his Excellency had never had any ne cessity for having to come into contact with Ministers of Parliament, still he (Mr. Moore) felt that if any constitutional crisis had arisen his Excellency would have been fully equal to it. He hoped if Sir Geo. Strahan did not come back again he would be appointed to some place quite as nice as this, and one where his duties would be quite as easy. Mr. GIBSON said he felt that he must say a few words upon the report, which he was pleased to see alluded to his Excellency in such high terms. As he was largely interested in agricultural and pastoral matters, it had always been a matter of gratification to him to notice the very active part and the liberal support which the Governor had taken, and the manner in which he had contributed towards agricultural and pastoral societies. There were not any institutions in the colony which would feel his loss to a greater extent than : these societies, and he was sure that the mem bers of every society in the island would regret his absence from, their. shows. . , .He could also bear testimony to the fact that his Excellency . always had a, kind wprd.fpr the afflicted. Ho could ,? join, heartily withi the wishes for the health,, happiness, and prosperity of. our (departing, ,Go,vernor.i (Hear,: hear.) .!; ., : -, . .-.; ..';. ., ,..,,,?? ! The report ., was- adopted, and .oni.tbiei motion of the Premier it was decided it be' presented at twelve o'clock next day. ... ,.;, i .DISEASED ANIMALS IMPORTATKWBILL.- } ,,The.

Wher ever sheep were- kept improvements must be made. As to .arguments in, .favour of an, income tax, he. failed to.see.how income escaped taxation, because ^incomes had to be drawn from sources which, were already taxed. If an income tax were ever estab lished it ought not, to touchthe incomes of professional men, because no incomes were, likely to fluctuate more, and a slight acci dent at any time might either suspend or do away away with the sapport of a family through the loss pf the only person earning that income. If ever incomes were taxed he hoped that no fixed exemptions would be made. He would like to point out that the; bill did not propose the amount of the tax, but left that to a future Parliament. Mr. FYSH thought the principal reason of the bill being introduced was because the Treasury saw difficulties in the future to face. In 1883 the year closed with a surplus revenue of ^638,000, besides allow ing a large number of Treasury bills to be paid off. They then very unwisely gave up some of their Customs duties. (Hear, hear.) The year 1884 closed with a defi ciency of X28.000, which in , 1885 was £80,000, and whilst 1886 was expected to close with a deficiency of only .£3000, with a deficiency of, .£40,000 at the end, of next year. Hewever, he thought the deficiency at the end of 1886 would amount to some thing like £16,000. He noticed; that, £3000 had' been passed in ? another: place for re pairs or renewals by altering from the broad to narrow guage in the Launceston and. Western Railway, but . as & fact, £2700; of that had, already been paid, and; it was ; simply because the; auditor had suspended i.that. the Treasurer, sought to, get ..it: ?n. -.* .?-??,?!:.-„.

He trusted that the Council would be. no party.to such, finance, pr-finesse, as that'./ In his opinion the more fair and equitable way for land to contri bute to the revenue of the colony would be (is put forth by the Government of which he, .arid Mr. Moore were' members, viz,/ that the :. tax he upon the rack rental pf all lands, in the colony. That proposal would hold water yet. It was a fact, .but the proposal before them was .fancy., , He had, read Mr.- W. Ritchie's ^pamphlets, and. followed him through: his arguments,. but the Government in model ling' their measure upon Mr. Ritchie's letters had, he thought, only taken notice of Mr. Ritchie's examples, and not of his principles. Everyone would agree with those principles, which were the old prin ciples laid down by Stuart Mill; but they could . not agree with a principle which called upon land to bear the great burden of taxation. Iri New Zealand, when tho cash value was introduced, the tax was started at one-eighth of a penny, but every year it was increased, and it would be just tho same here. If the bill had been passed with a provision for a halfpenny rate it would have returned £50,000, and that was .what the Government wanted. ' If the bill had; passed as. was first intended, he (Mir: , Pysh) could have upset it on a constitu tional point. There, was a clause , in it giving power to the Government to pur chase, but it had evidently been overlooked that the Constitution 4,et would ,npt allow tlie Treasurer to find money, to purchase; until the Governor had forwarded a mes sage to Parliament . recommending/ the' appropriation , of the. money /for that, purpose. . , , , . : i , ; , . j ; . , ; . . ,' ;.

Mr. DODERY, opposed the.. bill,apd did ?not think any. commissioners could find the capital value, as that could only be done by two persons, viz., the landlord and tenant, ; He admitted the valuation rolls throughout the country wore not what they ought to be, but they should be revised,, and every, man should be asked . to ? make a declara tion as to the amount of rent paid.

The injustice was that whilst landowners' income was taxed, the income of others was untaxed. (Cheers.) This was the injustice the colony had spoken against. Lnunceston was the only place that favoured tho bill, and Launceston was ruled by Mr. Ritchie — (lauehter) — who had got a fad into his head. He supported the amendment. Mr. HART said that. Hobart and Laun ceston would suffer iriost from a capital value assessment. In Launceston it had long been feltthere were inequalities in taxation, and the annual value principle did not meet the difficulty. He pointed out instances of land being held for speou lative purposes and not paying its fair shareto the revenues'. He would support the bill going into committee. '. ? . Mr. SMITH said if , Tasmania had, a Government that understood/and appre ciated our mineral resources there would bo no necessity for real estate duties.
