Tho SINGER TRIUMPHANT. The higost premium iu the gift of the public has again been awarded to the SINGER SEWING MACHINE COMPANY. Read the following evidence :— The Custom House report in the " Melbourne Journal of Commerce" for 1873 supplies the follow ing important figures: — Imported by Messrs. Stanford and Co.. ngcnt9 for the Singer Manufacturing Company Cases 6G5&, value £83,487 Being an increase on the imports of 1872 Cases 1930, value £8632 And exceeding the imports of any other firm by Caes 2471, value £11,220 Thcse'facti sneak volumes for the Singer Sewing Machine. This extraordinary success of the Singer" has been mainly achieved by the company's " New Family" machine, which is universally acknowledged to be tho most simple to learn, the cosiest to work, unequalled for strength and beauty of stitch, nnd Die most com plete and perfect in mechanism and aoccsiurie for every variety of domestic mowing and embroidery. BEWARE of IMITATIONS of the SINGER SEWING MACHINE. Spurious Singers, made of inferior metal, are In the market, but they can bo easily detected by the absence of the Singer trade mark, with the name of our firm wr ttcn underneath. Any person caught selling a counterfeit machine as genuine Singer, will he prosecuted without further notice. Illustrated price lists sent post free. STANFORD and Co., SOLE AGENTS For Australia and New Zealand, Corner of BOURKE and RUSSELL STREETS, Melbourne. iMPORTS of SEWING MACHINES for 1873. The liupor s of The WHEELER and WILSON MACHINES Show an Increase of over 150 PER CENT., or Four times more than Singer's, As proved by the Journal of Commerce. The great success of the WHEELER and WILSON Company is without doubt due to the superior Ex cellence of their machine, and the LITTLE EXERTION required to work them, which render thorn the most suituble for females. These qualities aro owing tu the" Rotatory Hook System on which they are constructed, and which combine GREAT SPEED with surprising durability and simplicity.
