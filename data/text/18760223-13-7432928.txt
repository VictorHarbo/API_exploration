INTRODUCTION. When the last mail left business in Parliament was at a standstill, and there were ominous indications of a bitter struggle between the supporters of the McCulloch Government and the narrow minority in opposition. The minority had distinctly refused to grant supplies unless a dissolution were granted, the Opposition leaders declaring their de- termination to die on the floor of the House rather than yield, and the Govern- ment had announced their intention of adopting means which would compel the granting of supplies. The Opposition were allowed to per- severe with their obstructive tactics for a given time until the inconvenience of the stoppage of public payments began to be generally felt, and then the Govern- ment introduced the first of their measures of coercion. This was a rosolu- tion to the effect that during the re- mainder of the session the Government business should be called on not later than 5 o'clock. The House sat during the whole night with closed doors, the Opposition members talking against time to defeat this proposition, but the motion was carried without a division after a sitting of some l8 hours The minority still continuing to provent any business being transacted, the Go- vernment introduced a resolution for the adoption of a new standing order, pro- viding that when any motion has been moved in the House or in committee, a resolution may, without notice, be pro- posed "that the motion be now put," whereupon such resolution shall be put forthwith. This proposition became known as "the iron hand," some re- marks of a private member having supplied that convenient title. It was donounced by the Opposition as an at- tempt to stifle discussion ; but a similar standing order works satisfactorily in South Australia and other places, and it is akin to the French plan of la cl√¥ture. The utmost excitement prevailed on the 8th inst., when this motion came on for discussion, and the partisans of the mi- nority filled the Parliament-yard with a somewhat disorderly mob, which, doubt- less, hoped to overawe the Ministe- rialists. Both parties in the House were told off in relays, and arrange- ments were made to sit continuously for a week if necessary - the fate of the resolution having to be decided by a trial of physical force. Early in the evening, while complaint was being made of the disorderly conduct of Mr. Lalor, the member for South Grant, strangers were ordered-out of the chamber. The House sat continuously, excepting one or two brief intervals, with closed doors from the night of the 8th inst. until a quarter past 11 o'clock on the night of the 10th inst., when the Government were victorious, the "stonewall," as the Oppositionists called themselves, having utterly collapsed. This result was brought about much quicker than it othorwise would havo been in conse- quence of the Opposition having in- advertently allowed a Ministerialist to move " the previous question," the effect being to prevent the minority fron moving any further amendment. The Government carried their "ironhand' resolution by a majority of 41 votes to 20\. The Opposition then saw that any further obstruction would be futile, and on the next meeting of Parliament a Supply Bill was passed through both Houses. During the sittings with closed doors there were not only unruly scenes in the Parliament-yard, but grossly disorderly ones in the Legislativo Assembly, the leaders of the Opposition being greatly infuriated by their impending defeat. Mr. Lalor, who on previous occasions had behaved in an insulting manner to the Speaker, said in an under- tone, just loud enough for the occu- pant of the chair to hear, " This is a corrupt House, presided over corruptly." Mr. Lalor refused to withdraw the words or apologise. He was adjudged guilty of contempt, and threatened with committal to the custody of the sergeant-at- arms, but on a subsequent day he apologisod, and the apology was accepted. Mr. McKean, who had called an hon. member "a d-d sweep," was also allowed to escape with an apology. The budget proposals of the Govern- ment are now under consideration. Not- withstanding the adoption of the new standing order, the Government have shown every disposition to allow the fullest latitude of debate, and they are not pledged to adhere to every detail of their scheme. The Opposition, though their obstructive power has been greatly lessened, and in spite of their crushing and humiliating de- feat, still avail themselves of every opportunity to delay the transaction of the public business, and leading members of the party have addressed meetings in various parts of the country in the hope of stirring up sympathy in their own behalf. The Government have carried their land and property tax, and the tax on bank notes ; and the income-tax, against which there is a strong opposition, is now before the Assembly. There is every probability of their financial programme, in a slightly modi- fied form, being adopted in a few days. Addresses to His Excellency the Governor, praying him to dismiss his political advisers and dissolve the Legis- lative Assembly, have been adopted at one or two Opposition meetings. The reply in each case has of course been a polite refusal. Therehave been three elections to the Legislative Assombly this month. At Villiers and Heytesbury, the Hon. Joseph Jones, Minister of Railways, defeated Sir John O'Shanassy by a majority of 383 votes. For East Bourke Boroughs Mr. Cook, the Opposition can- didate, obtained a majority of 141 over the Ministerial candidate, Mr. Staley. The election for Collingwood, to fill a vacancy occasioned by the death of the Hon. J. F. Sullivan, took place yester- day. The Opposition party had two can- didates-Mr. J. Mirams and Mr. W. Gaunson. The Ministerialists were re- presented by Mr. G. D. Carter. The result was the election of Mr. Mirams by a large majority, the numbers being Minims, 2,440 ; Cartor, 1,287 ; Garnison, 307. SOCIAL. The mail steamer China, which left Galle on the 13th January with the mails for Aus- tralia, had to put back, in consequence of the breaking of her eccentric. She again left on 20th January, but on the 4th and 6th Feb. uary two slight accidents to the same por- tion of the machinery caused further delay, and more time was lost in consequence of the course of the vessel being altered to avoid running into the vortex of a cyclone. The China therefore made a rather long passage, arriving at Adelaide on the 17th inst., and at Melbourne on the 19th. She was closely fol- lowed by the Avoca. Whichh arrived only 36 hours later. The AVOCA brought an extra mail, her London dates being to January 7, a fortnight lator than those of the China. The Avoca comes to take the place of the Ellora in carrying mails between Melbourne and Sydney. The Zealandist, one of the new steamships constructed for the San Francisco and Aus- ralian mail service, arrived on the 4th inst, after a rapid passage of 40 days eight hours. There was a detention at St. Vincent for coaling and the time occupied under steam was 43 days 14 hours. The steamer, which was much admired during her short stay at the Sandridge pier, went on to Sydney on the 7th inst. The San Francisco mail steamer Granada arrived at Sydney on the 6th inst, having made a fine run from San Francisco of a little over 27 days. The Australian mail, which left London on De- cember 16, and was due at San Francisco on the 2nd January, did not arrive there until the 8th, detaining the Granda six days after her advertised sailing time. The delay was owing to the prevalence of fogs on the Atlantic coast which prevented the European steamers making port. Telegraphic communication with New Zea- land has been successfully established. The New South Wales end of the cable was laid at Botany Bay on Saturday, February 5, and the Hibernia and Edinburgh, the tw0 steamers engaged in laying the submarine cable then proceeded on their voyage to New Zealand. The work was performed in a very expeditious and successful manner the whole work being completed within a fortnight. The New Zealand end of the cable was landed at Nelson. On the comple- tion of the work congratulatory messages passed between the Governor of New Zea- land and the Governors of the various Aus- tralian colonies. The charge for sending messages from Melbourne to New Zealand is 10s 6d. for 10 words, and 1s. for every additional word. The United States corvette Tuscarora has arrived at Brisbane. She has been taking deep sea soundings from San Francisco to Honolulu, and thence to Moreton Bay in view of the proposed construction of a sub- marine cable between San Francisco and Queensland. It is understood that the route is considered particularly favourable for the projected cable. After coaling and provisioning the Tuscarora will proceed via Sydney to Auckland, and run a line of soundings thence to Kandavu, to ascertain the feasibility of cable connexion. At the mayor's quarterly luncheon, held on February 9, His Excellency the Governor was present. In reply to the toast of his health, His Excellency, in one of his charac- teristic speeches, expressed his pleasure at again enjoying the hospitality of the corpora- tion. He recounted the honours he had re- ceived during his visit home. "AtRome, he said, "I was welcomed with open arms by the Royal Family and statesmen of Italy and I was told that I am the only man who ever was received at private interviews in the course of 48 hours and with equal cor- diality by the King, by the Pope, and by Garibaldi .So, too, in America I met with the greatest courtesy from all the pub- lic men - from General Grant to Brigham Young, from the President of the United States to the president of the Mormons." Of the political position he said, "On my return I found myself in the centre of one of those political typhoons which periodically disturb the usually calm atmo- sphere of the Australian colonies. But on this very stormy question I will only say that I have every confidence that the good sense and moderation of our national character and the well known capacity for self govern- ment of the Anglo Saxon race, will find a way out of the present difficulty, as tbey have found ways out of worse difficulties and that the political tempest will soon blow itself ont." An important meeting of about 50 wool- growers was held on February 14, at Scott's Hotel. Mr P A. Jennings presiding to hear certain statements from Dr Rowe and Mr. James Cochrane, who represented a com- mittee of gentlemen in London who had in quired into grievances alleged to exist in the wool trade there. Dr Rowe and Mr Coch- rane presented certain resolutions arrived at by the committee in London, and explained the action taken by them, of which they had formed a part. These resolutions recom- mended that the committee of the Wool Merchants' Association, acting for the con- sign√©es, should appoint independent persons to attend the weighing of all wool delivered from the ships, and to check the various weights, that in all cases where wools have been lotted and in course of being arrranged for sale, tbat the consignee or his agent should be at the warehouse and have a few bales weighed occasionally, whenever he may elect that the auctioneer should have instruc- tions to take bids of id per lb for all lots of wool offered for sale. A resolution thank- ing the committee and Dr. Rowe and Mr. Cochrane for what they had done was agreed to, and also one appointing a committee here to act with the London committee in matters connected with the trade, but the meeting had dwindled down to about a dozen persons when the latter resolution was passed, many of those who had attended having left between the proposing of the resolution and its adoption. By the mail the reply of the Colonial Wool Merchants Association was received, declining in effect to alter the existing arrangements. The movement for the shipment of frozen meat under Mort and Nicolle's freezing process has received satisfactory support, and there is no doubt that the funds will be forthcoming to despatch the trial cargo. On the 14th inst a meeting of persons desirous of assisting in the movement to send a cargo of fresh meat from Sydney to London under this process was held at Scott's Hotel Mel- bourne. About 50 gentlemen, principally stockowners were present. Mr P. A. Jen- nings, of Sydney gave a sketch of the history of the project stating that Mr Mort had always declined to take the first step until he was confident of success .The sum of ¬£25 000 was required, of winch ¬£17 000 had already been promised in New South Wales, and it was intended only to ship the very best meat that could be procured. A resolution was unanimously passed, stating that the move- ment was worthy of support, and encourage- ment, and an influential committee was ap- pointed to collect subscriptions in farther- ance of the object After the meeting was over, Mr P. A. Jennings mentioned that a telegram had been received from Sydney, stating that promises had been received there amounting to ¬£17,500, or three quarters of the entile amount required The telegram also stated that the Commercial Bank had promised ¬£250 and it was hoped the banks in Melbourne would follow their example His Honour Mr. Justice Bury has obtained twelve months' leave of absence, and has left the colony on a visit to Europe. He will represent Vittoria at the approaching Phila- delphia Exhibition. Prior to his departure he was presented with an address from the members of the bar. The address was read to his Honour by the Attorney General on behalf of the barristers and was responded to in suitable phraseology by his Honour. There were between 40 and 50 members of the bar present on the occasion. His Honour subsequently left Melbourne on the 7th inst, by the s.s. Wentworth, for Sydney en route for America and England The board appointed to inquire into the management of the Kew Asylum has con- tinued its labours during the month. The charges made by Miss Ellen McKee formerly an attendant at the asylum of cruelty exer- cised by the attendants on the patients have been fully investigated. The evidence on these points was very contradictory but there appears to have been an unsatisfactory con- dinon of things at the asylum. Dr Robert- son, the superintendant, attributed the pre- sent inefficiency of the institution to the mode in which the appomtment of attendants is vested in the Government. When once appointed they are us secure in their position as the superintendent himself however in- competent or unfit for their duties they may prove themselves to be. He is strongly of opinion that the asylum will never be efficiently managed until the sole control of the attendants is placed in the bands of the superintendent who could be made respon- sible to a board of visitors. He pointed out that this practice has been followed with great success in England and in the asylums where it did not prevail the results were most unsatisfactory. The South Melbourne Gas Company have completed the laying down of their mains through the streets of Melbourne. This company has now neatly 50 miles of mains laid down in all. An interesting collection of new and rare plants the gift of Dr Joseph D. Hooker, F.L.S. director of the Royal gardens at Kew has recently been received from Eng- land at the Melbourne Botanic gardens The Japanese Agricultural Commissioners are on a visit to Learmontli Cieswick and the neighbouing districts. They have men- tioned that it is their intenion to establish a firm in Melbourne, so as to exchange Japanese commodities for Victorian wool &c.; The news retaramt the ship blcerryvo e which tuts despatched in in Melbourne to San Francisco itith the Victoimn and Tas- manian exhibits intended for PhiladJi Ina is not satiBftctory. She was cojipillod tj put in at Lj Hilton New Zealand and tv Ulla at that port the crew or a greater portion of them deserted and the captain bocamo quite uiiinanateablo through drink. Money however, being raised ou bottomry bonds a new crew was shipped, the captain recovered, and a fresh start was made on the 9th January. Mr J A Langford, LL D, who is a mem- ber of the Birmingham School Board, arrived in Melbourne by the steamship Somerset shire. He intends making a tour of Aus- tralia, with the view of collecting informa- tion respecting the different systems of edu- cation in operation m the colonies. The railway from Ararat to Stawell has been completed to within a mile of the Sta well railway station, and will be completed through to the town in about two months The railway has been opened for traffic as far as finished. John Rouget, the young man who shot his fellow servant, Mary Hanley, at Hawthorn, and who was committed for trial on the charge of firing at the woman with intent to murder, was acquitted at the Criminal Sessions. The defence was the the occur- rence was accidental. An interesting example has been shown of the uses to which the telegraph may be put for purposes rather of conversation than of correspondence Sir Julius Vogel intended to proceed to Sydney to settle several matters with the Government of New South Wales, which had been referred to him from New Zealand. He found, however, that he was unable to carry out his intention, and a tele graphic conference was suggested. The Government here gave him the free use of the wire as far as it extended in this colony, and on Saturday, January 29, Mr Robertson, the Premier, and Mr Burns, the Postmaster Geneial, of New South Wales, at one end, and Sir Julius Vogel at the other, held a four hours' conversation, during which an understanding was come to on all the sub jects under consideration. In some respects a telegraphic conversation has peculiar ad- vantages. There is less liability to turn to side issues, and there is a disposition to come more directly to the main points Sir Julius Vogel left for New Zealand direct on the Thursday following, in the s s Arawata. The picnic given, according to annual cus tom, by the proprietors of The Argus and 'The Australasian to all connected with the papers, together with their wives and families was held on Saturday, February 12, on the Flem- ington racecourse. This place has been the scene of many festive gatherings of a similar kind in previous years, its vicinity to town and the conveniences afforded by the cammo dious buildings, which were kindly placed at the disposal of the visitors by the Victoria Racing Club, rendering the locale most suit able. The company, numbering over 600, a large proportion of whom were children, started from the Spencer Btreet station shortly before 12 o'clock, a special train having been provided for the purpose Arriving at their destination, the visitors dispersed over the course, and engaged in amusements suited to their various tastes. There was a long programme of athletic sports, which afforded enjoyment both to those who took part in them, and to these who contented themselves with the simpler r√¥le of spectators About 2 o'clock the company adjourned to luncheon, held in the rooms below the grand stand. The toast of " The proprietors of The Argus and the Australasian! was proposed by Mr. F. W. Haddon, and received an an enthu- siastic manner Mr Hugh George replied on behalf of Mr Edward Wilson, Mr J. S John- ston on behalf of Mr. Mackinnon, and Mr. James Spowers on behalf of his brother Mr Alfred William South, M A, of Trinity College, Cambridge, has been appointed second master of the Church of England Grammar School, in the room of Mr. Leeper, recently elected principal of Trinity College, Melbourne. Mr South is expected to arru o in the Durham, about the 12th of March Mr. William E Russell, B A , exhibitioner of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, has also been appointed to a mastership at the Church of England Grammar School. Mr Russell is travelling in America, and will not arrive until after the midwinter holidays. The death of the Hon J. F. Sullivan, one of the members for Collingwood, and for many years a prominent politician, occurred on February 3. He had suffered from disease of the liver, and jaundice, for many months, but was able to go about until a short time before his death Mr. Sullivan, who was 58 years old at the time of his death, was bom at Waterford, Ireland. He was for many years in America, and arrived in Australia in 1852. He settled down in Sandhurst, and took an active part in public affairs in that district. He was returned to Par- liament for Mandurang m 1861, and continued to sit for the same constituency until 1871, when he retired from Parliament for a time in consequence of ill health. Almost immediately after be was elected in 1861, he accepted office under Mr. Heales as Commissioner of Customs, and continued in that position until the close of the same year, when the Heales Ministry was defeated, and succeeded by the O'Shanassy Ministry. On the defeat of the latter m 1863, and the for- mation of the McCulloch Ministry, Mr Sul- livan accepted a portfolio as Minister for Wines, and held it until March, 1867, when he was appointed Minister of Railways and Roads for about 12 months m 1868, while the Sladen Ministry was in power, he was out of office, but on the re formation of the McCulloch Ministry he again joined it as Minister of Mines, and continued to be a member of it until its defeat in October, 1ECJ. At the last general election, Mr. Sal hvan's health having improved considerably by his retirement from public life, he an nounced himself as a candidate for Colling wood, and was elected by that consti- tuency. The death of Major John Bell, of Bell park, Geelong, has also occurred. He was an old colonist, and arrived in Victoria in 1840, and took up land at Colac in conjunction with Mr Calvert Mr Bell died at the age of 54. He left wealth to the extent, it is estimated, of between ¬£400 000 and ¬£500,000. The visit to the colony of another team of English cricketers appears to have been de- cided on. By the last mail Mr J H Bennett, of Tmerald bill, received a letter from Lilly- white, stating that a team of professional cricketers had been chosen which would fairly represent the best cricketing talent in England. Their names were as follow - Messrs Southerton, Jupp, Greenwood and Lillywhite (who were in the last team), A Shaw, Morley, Hill, Pooley Emmett Charl wood, Lockwood, and Ullyett. The team, who are coming out on their own speculation, are expected to arrive in November next. The conduct of Mr J. G Beaney, one of the honorary surgeons of the Melbourne Hospital, has again been placed before the public in an unfavourable light. It is only a month ago that he laid himself open to censure by performing an operation for lithotomy, winch resulted fatally on a patient named Berth, without consultiug the rest of the staff, as the rules of the institu- tion required him to do. This month a similar case has occurred in connexion with the death of a woman named Margaret Ann Kelly who died in the hospital after undergoing an ope- ration at the hauds of Mr Beaney. The de- ceased suffered from diaease of the knee joint, and on December 2 Mr. Beaney at tempted to excise the joint but finding during the operation that the disease was ex- tensive, bo amputated the leg through the knee joint The operation was performed on the same day as Beith s case, and, as in that case without any consultation with the other honorary surgeons. On the ninth day after the operation the deceased was attacked by erisipelas, but this subsided a few days after- wards. She died on the 29th January, from exhaustion from the effects of the amputa- tion and the debilitated state of the system At the inquest which was held several medical witnes3es wero examined as to tho manner in which the amputation had been performed, and nearly all stated that it would have been better Surgery to have am- putated above the diseased bone. Mr. Beaney gave as his reason for not doing this that such amputations above the knee were in his opinion more dangerous. The verdict of the jury was that the deceased had died from the effects of the amputation which Mr Beaney rashly performed with out consultation - a practice which the jury recommonded the Hospital Com- mittee strictly to prohibit m future. In another case Mr Beaney was by the finding of a coroner's jury found guilty of neglect in not attending to a patient when sent for. The patient was Mr Adolphe Joske, wine mer- rchant who fell through a trap door at Messrj Webster Brothers warehouse, Queen street, Melbourne, and sustained concussion of the brain. He was taken to the hospital, and Mr Beaney was sent for, but although he received several messages requesting him to attend, he did not do so. Mr. Joske died, and although it did not appear that any medical skill would haye availed, Mr Beanet's neglect was regarded as none the less culpable. The report of the Minister of Public In struction for the jeal Wi 3 which tva=i recently presented to Parliament, shows that a substantial and constant increase ia apparent in the numbers attindmg the stato schools, in spite of the previ leuce of infec fir tis diseases duiing the last l8 months While the total number of pupils enrolled in 1872 nas 135,002, with an average attendance of r/8 435 the numbers had risen in 1874 t 216144 enrolled and 104 375 in averag attendance. The number of children in the colony of school age in 1874 was 277 078 and allowing for those who attended more than one school during the year 188 380 distinct individual children at tended the state schools during the year, in addition to 24190 children who were in attendance at private and other schools. The number of schools in operation on 31st August 1876 was 1100 with 113 249scholar, in average attendance and the number of children who up to 31st October 1875 had obtained certificates of education up to titi compulsory standard was 10 430 The de- partment the report says may now claim to bave brought the means of education within the reach of most of the children in the colony. As to the cost of the department it appears that the expenditure between the 1st July 1874 and 30th June 1875 was ¬£5G5 91 17s 8d Of this amount ¬£250 053 7s 5d was paid as salaries to teachers and ¬£173 91' 10a was expended on buildings, sites fences furniture &c.; A very interesting ceremony took place or the 7th inst in the Executive council cham- ber when His Excellency the Governor, in the presence of the members of the Execu- live Council and Colonel W. A. D. Anderson presented the bronze medal of the Boys Humane Society to Henry Murphy a young man 19 years of age. It appeared that in January 1875 a four oared, gig was capsized in the River Yarra and as none of the occu- pants could swim there was every proba- bility of them all being drowned. Murphy who was passing at the time plunged into the river and with great difficulty saved the lives of two of the party. The other two were drowned. Colonel Anderson witnessed the gallant act and brought it under the notice of Sir George Bowen who forwarded a statement of the facts to the Royal Humane Society. By the last mail the bronze medal of the society was sent out to the colony and the presentation was made by Sir George Bowen in a few well chosen words. The young man thanked the Governor for his kindness and retired. The epidemic of scarlet fever in the colony appears to be dying out. The deaths from this disease in Melbourne and the suburbs have for many weeks averaged over 30 often reaching 40 and 50 and sometimes even 60 and 70. During the week ending the 12th inst however (the week to which the latest returns of the registrar general apply) the deaths from scarlet fever numbered only nine. The Melbourne Lying in Hospital which had to be closed on account of the outbreak is about to be re-opened. A highly successful demonstration was given in honour of Dr Cairns in the Town hall Melbourne on February 21 prior to his departure from the colony. On the platform were ministers and leading men of all the Protestant denominations and in the hall were about 3 000 people, a very large propor- tion of whom were members of other de- nominations than the Presbyterian to which the Rev Dr Cairns belongs. The chair was occupied by the Hon A. Trasor M.L C and addresses were delivered by different clergy men. Two written illuminated addresses were also presented to the Rev Dr Cairns one by the congregation of his own church and another by nine ministers of different denominations all of whom had been autho- rised to sign the address on behalf of their denominations. In reply to the addresses Dr Cairns gave a short resume of some of his acts in this colony He was loudly cheered both at the commencement and the close of his address. On Saturday, February 12 the new works of the Cognac Distillery Company on the south Yarra bank were opened and the event was celebrated by a luncheon. The enterprise thus inaugurated is in great mea- sure the result of the efforts of Mr L Marie its manager who went to France to obtain the very best distilling apparatus procurable in that brandy producing country. Its peculiarity is that, so it is asserted, it distils utterly pure spirit free from every essential oil. The works which are capable of distil- ling 1,000 gal. of spirit per day, Were erected at a cost of ¬£13 000. Mr B C Holtermann of St Leonard's Sydney a wealthy amateur photographer, is making a very extensive collection of photographic views of the scenery antdpublic buildings of New South Wales and Victoria He has already expended nearly ¬£4 000 in carrying out his project and has obtained between 1,000 and 1500 different negatives some of them of a great size. A number of views of the city aud suburbs have been taken from the top of Government house. They are of an unusually large size and will be mounted so as to form a complete pano ramic view of Melbourne Mi Holtermanrj intends to exhibit his collection at the Phila- delphia Exhibition, and after visiting Europe for the purpose of ascertaining the latest im provements in the photographic art he will return to Sydney and there perfect his collection of Australian views. He con templates at some future time exhibiting his complete collection in England and on the Continent of Europe. The Dayspring mission vessel has ar- rived in Hobson's Bay and has been visited by large numbers of children attending the various Sabbath-schaols in the city and suburbs. The children from Sandhurst Ballarat, Geelong, Castlemaine and other centres of population have aleo bad oppor timitiea of visiting her There is a large collection of curiosities on board, which greatly delighted them. A shocking occurrence took place in the bay near the Emerald Hill Baths, on Sunday the 6th of February. A young man named Peter Rooney aged l8 years was bathing in the sea about 6 o clock in the morning near the baths. He swam out a considerable distance, came in and was swimming out again, but when in about 5ft of water he was seized by a shark. He cried out in agony "For God s sake save me". A young man named George Pritchard who was swim- ming a horse in the sea near, rode out to him. He caught the unfortunate victim by the hand and pulled him out. Rooney was bleeding profusely from a wound on the leg, and died almost immediately. The shark after the man was taken from it swam to the plat- form and round it and then back to the place where it first seized Rooney as if in search of its prey. After circling the spot several times the shark sheered of into deep water and was not seen again. This shark was described as about 12ft long. Rooney' s thigh was bitten through to the bone and his leg below the knee was bitten in the same manner. At the inquest a verdict was returned that the deceased died from loss of blood from being severely bitten by a shark This accident was a curious instance of a neglected warning for on the day previous a letter appeared in The Argus cautioning bathers of the danger from sharks. A few days afterwards a shark 10ft long was caught off the railway pier, Williamstown. A testimonial has been raised for presentation to Pritchard as a reward for the bravery and presence of mind displayed by him. A distressing and fatal accident happened on Februaiv 6. At about half past 3 o clock Eliza Mayall aged 10 years daughter of Joseph Parkin Mayall photographer 81 Bourke BtreeteoBl was standing on the roof of the house by a i arapot near a skylight while her father gave her a bath by throwing water upon her from a \ an Yean hoso when she overbalaiced ond fell through the skyhgl t a distance of lut t t the floor. It was a double skylitht about 5ft by 3 t with two plates of glass one under the other Dr Bl ir was called in but the child died five minutes after his arrival. Tho cau3e of death was conct esion of ti o brain but the poor child was fr g1 Kully cut by the glass sustainnt ono .articularly horrible gash in the side.

A sad occurrence happencd at Castlemaine recently. Henry Abe a boy about 10 years of age the son of the Rev F. H. Abe formorly curate o√≠ the C1 itrch of England at C stlo maine but now a missionary in Borneo died from the effects of drinking a quantity of colonial wine. The c1 lidien of Mr Abe were left under the c ro of tho Rev Mr. laik who has a fnrm at C1 ii amana Creek. The wine was kept for the labourers' use.

A frightful murder and suicide occurred at Soi ti Or loi ¬£ ri lilmaiy 11. Sone time ago Williani Stenton, a garder by occupa- ti i was committed to the \arra Baud whence he came out a little more than a month ago. Sir co became outof theusylumho has continued very quiet and no alarm was felt at his release. Between 1 aud 2 o clock on the day mentioned he and his grown up daughter were picking apples in the garden and had taken a basketful up to the house when he said to her "You go down I will be after you directly". She had not been gone many minutes when she heard her mother scream ing. She rushed up to the house and found her mother rushing, about frantic with pain Stenton having been bumping her head on the floor. She told her mothor not to go in the house again but being half mad with pain she did so. Shortly after the poor woman died in her daughter s arms. Stun ton rushed after his daughter but not catch- ing her retired to his bedroom and cut his throat from ear to ear He then staggered down the steps into the garden and died. Deceased, who was between 40 and 50 years of age leaves a family of four children. The death of the wife is believed to have been caused by the bursting of arteries. THE POLITICAL CRISIS Political events during the past month have been of an exciting character. A minority in the Legislative Assembly contemptible in numbers and ability has taken upon itself to obstruct public business to refuse the granting of supplies for the payment of the public creditor, and has reduced Par- liamentary government in this colony to be a hissing and a byword among the people. For several evenings in the Assembly the proceedings were so utterly discreditable that for ibo sake of common decency the press and the public were excluded For tunately the courage of these self seeking politicians was on a par with their intelh gence The celebrated stone wall erection, which these heroes were prepared to defend to the last extremity collapsed with the most ridiculous ease the moment tho Govern ment applied pressure in earnest. A new standing order enabling the debate on any resolution to be brought to a close on the motion that the question be now put being carried was proposed by Sir Jamies M Cul loch and was adopted after some vam struggling on the part of the Opposition by the House A similar rule has been found to work well m 1 raneo America and in the neighbouring colony of South Australia. Since this victory of the Government sup plies bavo been obtained and the public business 1 as been proceeded with with some degree of regularity A number of public meetings have been held throughout the colony protesting against the unconstitu tional conduct of the Opposition THE STONE WALL This famous structure the threat of which had been held in lerrorem ovor the Govern- ment for many weeks was erected in earnest even before the departure of the last mail. For the information of those who reside in more orderly communities we may ex plain that by the stonewall is meant the abuse of the standing orders of the House for the purpose of obstruct ing the public business The mein bera of the late Government who cannot forgive their unceremonious ejection from the Treasury benches and the few followers who havo pledged their allegiance to thom in til6 hope of obtaining a fleeting popularity among the unthinking classes of the com mumty have not scrupled to refuse to grant supplies thereby bunting the colony into the position of being unable to pay the public creditors The conduot of tho Opposition in thus recklessly risking the reputation of the colony seuBibly damaged their cause and forced all opponents of the Government save those blinded by prejudice and pasBion to withdraw from their ranks Mr Higm botham who although an eccentric and crotcbetty politician is a man of honour and ability was so diefctiated with their proceed inga that he retirod from Parliament alto pether Mr Servico the Treasurer in the Kerferd Administration also a strong op ponent of Sir James M Culloch condemned their conduct and refused to be a party to tbeir unconstitutional action These de fections very senouBly weakened the Oppo Bition who were now left without any men of weight or character amongst them The talkers of the purty however weie detor mined not to give wt-y until they had had an oppoitunity of proving their capacity and though with the expectation of failure before them they continued their policy of obstruction When the Assembly metogain on the2othuIt the request made by Sir James M Culloch for supplies was again met vv iib. a distinct refusal, and several leading members of the Opposi- tion delivered impassioned harangues upon Hie sacred duty they were determined not to shrink from-that of obtaining an imine diato dissolution of Iurliamont Sir James M Culloch repeated that when the Eroper time came the Government would e prepared with a method of obtaining supplies in spite of the factious oppo binon of the minority but that it was considered advisable to allow the minority full time to conBidcr tho circumstances He assured the bon member for Geelong West that he would get such a lesson in con nexion with his stone wall as he would never forget and that that structure of mud would smother him and his friends politi colly On the following day the Opposition secured a count out but on Thursday the 27 th ult the Premier submitted his proposal that during the remainder of the session the Go vernraent business should bo called on not later than 5 o clock intending to follow it with a second resolution that the House should sit on Fridays The Opposition resist ed the motion at an attempt to gag hon members and ao tho first instalment of the non hand and met it with points of order and motions for adjournment Strangors were ordered from tho galleries and the HoiiBe sat through the night Ihe talkers had a bril liant opportunity for tho display of their powers One member continued speak mg for six hours aud was stoppod only by the necessity for catching theeaily morning train His, coadjutors with less pi j sical capability did their boat and pro lot ted theuitting until a quarter to 11 o clock um They were then exhausted and the majority who had refrained fiom speaking altogether carried their roint In the interval between the adjournment and tbo next meeting of the House there was dissension in the Opposition camp Some members who retained Bome fiuntglimmermg of common Benee desired to abandon the policy o' stone wallu g suj plies Announcements were1 made at public meetings that the O,ipo Bition 1 ad no desire to refuse supplies One or two mombers of the lato Government ex hibitmg a sublime disregard of truth and an amusing belief in the gullibility of their 1 carets aUBured them that the Government and not the Opposition were to blame for the refusal of supplies. The moderate counsels however did not prevail and at an Oppotn tion caucus hold on Tuesday the 1st it was resolved to proceed with the formel plan of refusing supplies and stone walling all the Government proposals. On the reassembling of the House the dis Mission was contn ued on Sir James McCulloch s proposal that for the remainder of the session Tridny should bo a day on which the Assembly si ould moot for the des patch of business The Opposition deter mined to resisj; ti o motion and the debate was monopolised bj Messrs W C Smith Woods and M Kean who avowedly spoke against time At half past 11 o clock tho galleries were cleared of strangers and at a quarter to 12 o clock the Government counted tbo House out as no buBinoas could bo doi e On the following day a meeting of Go\ ernment supporters was held at which ti ere were 40 members present and five absent eupporters of tho Government ex cueed their attendance by lettoi It was resolved that this senseless waste of public time Bhould no lontei be permitted and it was uuarimously otreed that the Premier Bhould move in the House the adoi tion of a new Btanding order providing that wkon any motion haB Been movod m the House or in coan lttee a resolution may without notice be pre posed that ti o motion 1 e now put vrl ereu) on such resolution shall be pat foitluuth TUE IRON HAND This new standing order christened the iron hand fell like a bombsl oil amongst the Opposition ranks already dieorg inised by previoisdefeatB I ven the most mv efe rate tall ers saw that the beginning of the end vts opiioaclnug On tho meeting of the Assembly on 1 ebruary 2 d Sir James M Culb eli gave notice of his intention to m to next day That tho following be a ki ted ao a Standing Ordor of the Legisla t i e Apteml ¬°j to bo 11 forco durmt, tlio 1 csent besoion of Pirliaiient -When ony i otioi has leen n v ed m the noueo or in any cor mitteo of ti o whole House a reso lu ion n nj without notice bo proposed 1) t ti o motion le now put whereupon buch resolution shall lo put forthwith wit) out ai endmei t or debato and i otion B1 nil oe made or question of o niBcd m til Buch resolution has boo posed of If such resolution 1 e ropo' the affirmative the motion and an) meut or question submitted subsef he motion and not then disposed o shall be put in tho accustomed order of pn cedence without further debate or questio of order being raised until such question ho been disposed of In committee of the who!

Mr Lalor and overruled by the Speaker at amendment was moved by Mr Berry of thi omission of the first Une of the resolution At 10 o clock disorderly conduct on the par of Mr Lalor created a disturbance and the galleries were cleared at the instance of Mi M Kean The House continued to sit with scarcely an intermission from half past i o'clock oi Tuesday afternoon until 20 minutes after 1 o clock on Thursday night. The Govornment and their supportcrs were firm in their de- termination to carry tho new standing order and allowed the Opposition members t ramble on until exhausted nature bade then stop. On both sides arrangements had bool made for continuous sittings Upon thi Government devolved the duty of keeping i House Their supporters were dil ided mt< two watches of about 2' or 23 member each Whilst one watch was on dut; the other members could retire to thei bornes to rest The younger and mon vigorous members of tho party bon the burden of a Parliamentary fight not reduced to a mere conteat of physica endurance leaving to their older brothrer the easier duty of the day sitting The Op position did not require moro than three o: four members in the House and the remain ing stone wallera wore enabled to seek re pose in any of the adjoining committoi rooms They had however to undertaki the task of talking continuously and thougt the habit had become second nature wal them they found after the second day thi duty too onerous to be longer maintained On Tuesday night Mr Berry spoke fron about 12 o clock until 2 o clock the followioi morning and waa followed by MesBrs Woods Longmore Munro Gaunson James am Major Smith who spoke about two hours ant a half each At 8 o clock in the morning fresl reloys came in to take the place of the nigh watch and the talking match waa resumed the Oi position members giving their speaker; an occn toual rest by riBing to points of ordor During the night the Opposition had mm members in the precincts of the House hu rarely more than four inside the chamber. The minority half a dozen timea ottemptoc to count out but there were alwaya 27 or 2f members on the Government side. Shortly before 4 o'clock in the afternoon the Govern ment arranged a count out on a motion foi the adjournment of the debate in order te secure the bringing on of the same business at the fresh day s sitting beginning at half past 4 o clock. At tho new sitting the pro ceedmgs were public for about five minutes but the galleries were then again cleared and members allowed to fight out the battle in private. So averse were some of the members to the disreputable proceedings being made public that strangers were ordered to withdraw even from the precincts of the House. The Assembly continued to sit with closed doors until half past 2 o clock .The proceedings were frequently of a most unruly kind and the Speaker was often called upon to exercise his authority with severity to secure tbe preservation of the semblance of order. About 7 o clock m the morning the Opposition speakers were ex- bauBted Mr Munro who had spoken on the original motion attempted to speak on the question of adjournment but was ruled out of order in accordance with a decision of the formel Speaker of the Assembly. The motion for adjournment and Mr Berrys amendment were then negatived by large majorities the Opposition only mustering 13 to the 33 of the Government The Opposition intended to move a second amendment immediately upon that of Mr Beny being negatived but in an evil moment for them Mr Murray Smith took advantage of the opportunity to jump up in his plaie and move the previous question. The exact effect of this proposal at first pus-zled even experienced members. Gradually it began to dawnu. on the House that a form of Parliament had been hit upon which could be used for the promotion of business as effectively na other forms had been used for weeks past in obstiucting it. The provious question is generally, almost in- vanably used in the House of Com mons to prevent an objectic aable motion being put. The member who submits it moves "that this question (the question before the House) be now put" and the movor and those who act with him vote against this motion and if it be negatived the obnoxious motion is not put. Some times howover it has happened that the previous question has been carried after which the original motion has at once been put without further debate or amend- ment. It is in this latter way that tina form of Parliament has proved so effec tive a weapon in our prosont trouble. The previous question cannot be amended, though the debate on it can be adjourned This feature of it is its c1 lef recoaiinenda Uon for the pur. ose for which it was used. The chagrin of the Opposition on the dis covery of the trenchant effect of this new weapon was mteiiBe. Having allowod the pievious question to be moved they were at once debaned from submitting any furthor amendment on Sir Times McCulloch s motion They had arranged to move in numerable amendments on each of which all their men could speak and this mishap was therefore a fatal blow to them .The tolling effect of the smart manoeuvre of the Ministerialists w is at once seen. Dismay oveiapread tho countenances of the Opposi tioniete The greatest oxcitomont prevailed and anathemas were hurled at the hoads of the iniquitous inventors of tho iron hand Tuither time was wasted over an absurd attempt to ratso a question of privilege be cause reports of the proceedings had appeared in the daily journals. Tho motion was ad rmttod to be a mock one ovonbythemover At half past 2 o clock the Govornment arranged a count out in order to securo tho samo do bato coming on og in at the next day s ait In g At 1 alf past 1 o clock tho nouso re sun ed and strangers woro again ordeiod to withdraw after a deecroditable Bcene For several horns tie Opposition continued to waste time but the end was not far ofi They at ilrBt endeavoured to arrange a truce and promieed to allow supplies to be granted on certain conditions. The Ministerialists re- fused to entertain a compromise of any kind and proceeded to demolish their opponents by dividing tho House. The propos il to adjourn the debate was negatived by 41 votes Then the previoua question was d by 40 votes to 21 and without dobate, Sir Jr mes M Culloch's resolution for the new standing order was carried by 41 votes to 20, Mr Bent crossing over toi lie Government; Bide on this question Sir JameB M'Cullo.u asked the Opposition to allow a supply bill to be passed at once but this tbf y refused and ¬° the House adjourned until Tuesday Thus the fumous " stone wall,' which was to cover Mr Berry and his colleagues with glory for all time, collapsed utterly, and the minority which has blustered BO much became the laughing-stock of the whole country. THE PUI1LIO BUSINESS Owing to the action of the Opposition it is only within the last week that any oppor- tunily bas been afforded for the considera- tion of public busineBs. On Tuesday, Feb- ruary 16, a Supply Bill for ¬£540,000 was passed through both Houses, aud received the Royal assent. In the Assembly the "iron hand" resolution was used for the first time, but by a member of the Opposi- tion. The debate on the financial proposals was proceeded with. The Opposition prevented any substantial progress being made, Mr. Berry avowing that he desired no further discussion of the proposais. The Government, however, were anxious to afford every opportunity for the investigation of their scheme, and if neces- sary its amendment. The Opposition again availed themselves of the new Btanding order with the object of pieventing any discussion, but the motion that the question bo now put was negatived by 41 votes to l8 The remainder of the evening was wasted in discussion on points of order The following evening some pro- gress was made The first resolution, embodying the land and property tax, waa carried ona division, by a majority of 32 votes to 28 many of the Government supporters being absent, and the second resolution, for the imposition of a tax on bank notes, was carried without a divi- sion. Mr Mackay was desirous of making an addition to the land tax proposal, to the effect that there should be a cliargo of Id. per acre imposed upon lands in one holding exceeding ( 40 acreB, and 2d per acre upon lands in one holding exceeding 10 000 acres, but it appeared that the resolutions could not bo amended in committee The Govern- ment undertook, howover, that upon the resolutions being reported they should be re committed with a view to amendment. On the next night the proposed income tax was considered This tax is the one most seriously objected to, and the Government will probably have to modify their proposi- tion, if not to withdraw it altogether. The discussion has not been concluded DISOItDEBlA lBOCEEDIhaS IN PAULIU1ENT. The Legislative Assembly during the past month has been turned into a bear garden by the disorderly conduct of certain of the representatives The aceneB which bave oc- curred have been utterly discreditable to any decent assemblage. The members of the Opposition were prominent in these dis- turbances and it was perhaps fortunate for their public character that the worst scenes occurred when the Assembly waa sitting with closed doors. Mr Peter Lalor, M L A , one of the members of the late Government, was the "hero" of one of these scenes On the evening of the 8th mat, shortly before 10 o'clock, when Mr Berry was paying that if Sir James M Culloch's motion were passed the Assembly would cease to bo a Parlia- ment, Mr Lalor interjected, for the second or third time, in a voice just sufficiently loud for the Speaker, at whose left- hand he sat, to hear, "A corrupt House, presided over corruptly " The Speaker at once directed attention to this gross outrage, and Sir James M Culloch moved that the words be taken down Mr Berry argued that as the ofleneive remarks were not made in debate they could not be taken down The Speaker ruled that the words must be taken down without discussion. A complete with- drawal and apology were demanded, but , Mr Lalor refused to withdraw. It was ulti- mately agreed that Mr Lalor be adjudged guilty of contempt, and be ordered to attend in his place on the following day to offer an explanation of his conduct. The consideration of his case was post- poned until tbo next week m consequence of more pressing matters In the inWval Mr Lalorreniainedrecalcitrant.undoxpreBsed bia determination not to apologise, although willing to withdraw his observation as far as the Speakerwas concerned He was regardod as a vent able hero by his particulai associates and* other unthinking persons whoso natuial proclivities are on the sido of disorder. The Government howover, wero not disposed to make a martyr of him, nor was be specially desirous of the honour On the 15th inst. bia case was dealt with Ho promised to apolo- gise if the motion adjudging him guilty of contemptwas withdrawn Ho waahumonred, and then, dismounting from Ina stilts, he made the apology required of him. Mr. MTCean, another "stonewaller," also grossly insulted the Spoakor, bat after being severely rebuked for his unseemly conduct he apolo- gised Thara wero other discreditable scenes, in which the lie was freely bandied about between members, accusations of intoxica- tion, and other pleasant insinuations, PUBLIC MEEHI, OS. Public meetings have been held through- out the country to protest against the un- constitutional action of the Opposition. The boaBt of Mr. Berry and his followers, that they, though a minority in the House, repre- sented a vast majority ia the country, has aioused the more respectable portion of the community to resent this assumption. Tbioughout the country districts the feehug of the people has been strongly expressoa agawBt the reckless and wicked conduct of the Opposition in stopping supplies, and rendering the country unable to pay the debts Justly due Amongst the uneducated and unthinking populace and amongst those de- sirous of avoiding tho threatened taxation, has the wild policy of the Opposition found its only support lhe laugna^ used by the members of Ibe Opposition is euflicient to show to what lengths they wero prep rjd togo. Mr Munro the late MmiBter of Ld ication, speaking on one occasion said that ' ,f hw constituents were going to stand conduct like that (stopping debates after duo discussion), ' they did not deseive thatany man with a spaik of courage should repioaent them " The tvio sides ho said, bud now entered upon a war of extermination, and if there waa a spark of manliness left in the people of Victoria they would crush those who sought to gag the OppoBition Mr Patterson, another * member of the late Government, is reported to have spoken at Richmond as follows - " " 'There uie times when rebellion is a virtue and submission is a enmo Tho people of the colony aro a peaceable people, and cm put up with a great deal, but I warn those men in Parliament to be careful how they tamper with the good liattuo of the people. If any disaster should occur, upon their heads heit undi am very much mistaken if the people will allow this gauging motion to be passed ' Mi Longmore also a member o¬£ the Borry Government, speaking at a meet mg eaid - If Sir JameB M Culloch's iron hand were put in force, it could only be resiBted by tbo ' rod right hind ' of an indignant people." If these men exercised a power proportionate to their maltee, serious consequences might ensue, but foitunately tbo groat body of the people view them with contempt Amongst the unsettled and disorderly spirits which are found in every community they have influence to a certain extent On Tebruary 8 the Parliament jard was filled by an exoitoil crowd, numbeiB of whom had been rogaled by the cheap sedition spouted by stump oratois at an open air morning held near. They booted all the supporters of the Mints try, and Mr Mncpberaon, the Chief Secre- tary, was hustled roughly, but the largo body of police m attendance provonted any serious disturbance. The downfall of tbo stone- wall has been received with j y, muifclod with a feeling of ridicule at ita promotora throughout the colony. THE ELECTIONS There have been three elections in the past month. The Villiers and Heytesbury election, where there was a vacancy caused by the death of Mr M O Grady, resulted in the return of Mr Joseph Jones, the Commis- sioner of Railways by a majority of 183 over his opponent, Sir John O Shanassy. The East Bourke Borouglhs, where there was a vacancy by the retirement of Mr Higinbotham, re- turned Mr Cook, a stone waller, by a majority of 141. The election for Colling- wood where there was a vacancy caused by the death of Mr Sullivan, created great ex- citemcnt There were four candidates nomi- nated-Mr G D Carter (who came forward as a supporter of law and order) Mr Mirams, Mr Cock and Mr William Gunson (stone wallers). Mr Cock retired at the la3t mon out but tbo other throo went to the poll At the meetings of Mr G D Carter roughs of the lowest type were engaged to create a disturbance and prevent the candi date obtaining a bearing Mr Carter was assaulted on one occasion The conduct of the roughs if not incited by Mr Mirams, at any rate met with his approval for he pub- licly stated that he considered Mr Carter had met with the treatment he deserved. The result of the election waa the return of Mr Mirams by a large majority the numbers being -Mirams 2,419 Carter 1 287 Gauu son 307 LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL The Legislative Council owing to the dis turbed condition of political affairs have been able to do little beyond meeting and immediately adjourning until such time as it suited the Opposition m the Assembly to proceed with business. The Bailiwicks Boundaries Bill und the Public Health Bill were passed through their remaining stages and the Lega' Profeesions Amalgamation Bill waa read a fi st time The Supply Bill was also passed The University Degrees Bill, allowing women to take degrees was slelved MR. HIGINBOTHAM'S RETIREMENT. On January 31 Mr Higinbotham addressed a farewell speech to the electors of East Bourke Boroughs explanatory of his reasons forresigmng his seat in the Assembly While believing in the policy of Mr Berry s b tdgot he stated that he did not feel justihedm assisting him in using tho forma of the House to effect bia object It appeared to him that Mr Berry a proposal was a proposal to override the will and determination of the majority of members of Parliament by means of the forms of Parliament put m force by the minority-in fact that the mi nonty Bhould rule the majority a principle which Btrnck at the root of all Bociety At the same time he did not feel it his duty to support ti o Government in its determina tion to overthrow the stone wall and after mature deliberation he arrived at the convie tion that the proper course for him to take would be to retire from Parliament alto gether THE ROOT OF THE MISCHEF A very interesting and instructive article containing a comparison of the loquacity of the Victorian Legislature with that of the members of the House of Commons waa published recently u Tie Arg is Ouoting the dictum of the Edinbwgi Review that ' The evil which lies at the root of all the mischief in our Parliamentary system so far as it affecta the legislative action of tho House of Commons may bo summed up in one Bimple but comprohonBive word 'Talk the writer proceeded to cite the opinions of Macaulay Carlyle and W R Greg who agreed m denouncing as the root of the mischief the tendency to loquacity in all popular assemblies Apply ing the remark of the /fenicio that Tho time which ia wasted in talk ia some thing marvellous to those who regard the HOUBO of Commons as a body intended and intending to do the work of the nation to our own case he Bhowed that we are forced to acknowledge that the House of Commons is reticent and taciturn by comparison with our own Legislative Assembly in proof of which w o have only to refer to the immense amount of printed matter which the i sports amount to in a single session Take that of l875-76 for example It commenced on the 20th of May 1875, and up to the 2nd of the present month the Lower House had sat for 74 days and the official record of the talk which went on during that period occupies 4 148 octavo columns each contaning;

Mrs Denbigh was the first witness ex- amined, and gavo evidenco of the ' ¬øtent of tho night work which her husband iiad been compelled to do by Mr Smyth For more than 10 years she stated Mr. Denbigh bad sat up nearly all night for at least four nights a week, in order to attempt to overtake the extra work which the secretary for Mines had given bim to perform. He had frequently Blatedtbat "Mr Smyth would do for him yet," and Mrs Denbigh bad no hesitation m stating on oath that the conduct of the secretary foi Mines had greatlyaccolerated her husband s death. Oflicem of the department aleo deposed to numerous instances of ex tremelybaish and humiliating treatment to Mr Denbigh, aswellas toall the other officers of the department with whom the secretary came in contact. Some of the instances re lated of Mr Smyths treatment and de- meanour towards his subordinates would be extremely amusing wero it not for the humiliation which the evidence showed was caused to the officers daily The sound of Mr. Smyth's bell, it waa Btated, went through Mr. Denbigh and other officers like au electric shock, and officers of experience and ability would go into Mr Smyth's room pale with the antici patton of the language which would be used to them, and would come out blushing with shame at tbe humiliation they had under- gone Documents would be destroyed be- cause a "f was not crossed, or an "i" dotted. Officers would be heavily fined for tbe most trilling mistakes, and no appeal was ever made to the Minister for the time being, through the fear of the secretary's re eentment. Officers with salaries of ¬£400 or ¬£500 a year would be sent like errand boys about the city, to look for particular kinds of pens which Mi Smyth might fancy at the time, and would be reprov ed like children for any error. One officer deposed that tears often came into lus eyes during ratings from Mr Snivth, Mr Denbigh was sworn to have been fouud on many occasions in tears after an interview with the secretary, and twice on coming out from his presence, fell in a faint. A former officer of the department deposed that he WOB once BO angered with Mr. Smith's lan guage and abuse tbat his (the officer s) only regret was tbat hehadnotsmashod thosecro tary's bead at the time with a ruler Numbers of officers would be kept hanging about outside Mr Smyth's office for hours, awaiting interviews on important business This Btate of affairs, it was stated by the officers examined, bad gone on for years, and Mr. kernot, now lecturer in engineering at the Melbourne University, and who was for- merly in the Mining department, stated that his recollection of it was as of a pande- monium It IB but right to say that Mr Smyth has not yet had an opportunity of answering these chargeB, as only a portion of tbe evidence of the complainants has yet been heard, and the board has adjourned until the 29th mat GOLD AND THE GOLD FIELDS The mining industry has been pursued steadily during the past month on all the numerous gold-fields of this colony, with, so far as can be ascertained, the usual satisfac- tory results in the gold yielding mines, but very few incidents have occurred in con. nexion with the industry worthy of special mention in a monthly summary for Europe Within the lost few months the quartz mines of Sandhurst have again come promi- nently into notice through the increasing yields of the valuable mines there, and Erices of shares in many of the mines avo greatly increased since the com- mencement of this year The number of quarlz mines profitably worked on Sand- hurst, together with the extensive size and depth of the reefs which traverse thetn, have now led to the undoubted assurance that mining will be carried on there for many years to come in at least quite as extensive and profitable a manner as at present, if not more so The yield of gold at Sandhurst during last month, ns shown bj the ol'icial returns, amounted to ¬ø2 1√î0..7 14dtvt 18gr , which IB regarded as being a very good com- mencement for the ye tr, January being (m consequence of hohdayB, ,1c ) a broken montb. Tbe yield of gold in the previous January waB 18,297oz √údwt 9gr , which shows that the returns this January are consider ably more At Elaine, the Minerva Company recently Btruck an exceedingly rich lode of quart? in tbeir claim, from a very small quantity of which thoy obtained 527oz of gold. The finding of the quartz m this instance was a good illustration of the veering chances of mining The Minerva Company had had very fine yields for some time, and mude the fortunes of two or three people, but gradually the yield diminished, and the mine did not pay oxpenses, and the proprietors began to think it waa time to turn the miners adrift and shut up the claim. On Thursday, the 10th inst, the afternoon shift waa the last that was to be Bent below previous to suspending opera tions, half the men having boen previously paid off, but in that last shift the grand dis- covery was made which has somewhat electn lied the people of Elaine The vein of rich auriferous quartz that was Btruck is a very email one, and seems to be a small leadei tunning out of, or into, the main lode, and is very little more than an inch thick in places, but it is immensely rich It remains to be proved yet how extensve the lode which the company have fouud is, but its discovery bos had a very cheering effect on tho people of the district A remarkably nch reef baa recently been opened at Linton, m a claim belonging to what is called the Linton Quartz Company, the last crushing from which resulted in an avorage of moro than 4oz. to the ton from 27 tons This, in a district never famous for even payable quartz, is very cheering The yields of the Kingston and Creswick alluvial mineB have been very fcood recently, showing the richness of the mining country opened out in that district during the past year or two Another splen- did patch of rich quartz has just been found in the claim of the United Black Hill Com- pany at Ballarat, who obtained about 200oz of gold m one day, one piece being a solid lump of 122o7 Tho Sovereign Company at Ballal at havo at their 780ft level pushed through the cross course, which has pre- vailed in all tho upper levels to tho south, and hav been rewarded by discovering what IB said to be the finest body of stone yet seen in the mine, but from tbo lmmenso quantity of water found with it and the difficulty of working it finely, it will be some little time before its extent and value will be known The prospects of the Magdala Com I any at St moll, in whose Bhaffc gold waB found at the hitherto unprecedented depth of 1 700ft, havo been much bright- ened by soma good ciiiBhingB from stone taken from tho Moonlight claim, which adjoniB the Mandala Tbo directors and maimt-eis eif tbo latter are continuing the operations of Bystomatically opening out the lnige roef they struck at about 1 700ft, but they have not as jet had a crushing of any Jaree quantity of their stone Ibo Newing- ton Company, whose mino is also situated at Stn nell, li ne now sunk their shaft to over 1 700ft deep, and pulposo continuing to en.k until they lind the reef they aro ia search of '1 bo good j leid noticed in last summary BB having been obtained from a new lead of alluvial vvanhdirt in the Winter's Freehold Company, at Ballarat, has not been con- tinued during tbiB month, and, as a conse- quence, inces of the Bbarea have fallen um tennllj, the latest quotations being about ¬ø5 Tho prospects of aome of the other alluvial mines on Ballarat are becoming much jcopuidised through the rising of water in them, consequent on the cessation of pumpii y operatiotiB in several of tho deep mines that have been worked out If the water should not bo stopped by soaio kind of urbanisation amongst the mining compimes or othorB interested in the success of mining on Bnllurnt, all the alluvial claims on the Sebastopol platouu thoic, tho workings of which are below 90ft, aie m great danger of beirtg swamped out and rendered useless.

AGRICULTURAL The weather for the lost month having been favourable for harvest work, the late crops have been secured in much better ordor than waa anticipated Our whoata aro gene- rally excellent m quality, and there is reason to bebevo that the quantity will not bo de- ficient, In some cases, as already reported, partial failures were caused by the wet, but in the newly settled areas an immense quantity of wheat has been secured in fino condition Vintage prospects on the Murray are moderately good , of the quality it ia too early to speak, as that will de pend upon the character of the weather dunng the next five or BIX weeks In the Sandhurst district the black spot disease has done considerable injury, but the o√Ødium has been kept down by sulphuring About Goornong, and in some other parta of the Victorian Murray district, the o√Ødium has been suffered to establish itself.

The numerous cricket clubs in and around Melbourne, and those of the up- country dis- tricts, are playing the favourite game of Englishmen just now with real earnestness, the Eeaeon being especially favourable for the amusement. The best players of the clubs in the metropolitan districts have been called upon to make special exertions to meet the demands made noon them for men to con test matches with other colonies, and they have found the teama, though, BO tar, without much success for Victoria. Early this month an eleven went from here to South Australia, to play against eighteen of that colony, but our eleven was far from being representative of Victoiia, most of our best players being either engaged to proceed to New South Wales for an intercolonial match there, or altogether unable to go to South Australia from business or private reasons. The result of sending such a mediocre team to play agninBt l8 of a colony where cricket is prac- tised almost aa osaiduouely aa it ia in Victoria was unmistakable defeat for our men, who only scored 80 in two innings, while South Australia's eighteen made 153 in one innings. The defeat in Adelaide, coupled with tho beating of our picked eleven on the Mel- bourne Cricket-ground last Christmas by an eleven from NcwSonth Wales, has consider- ably reduced the estimate the general public had of our cricketers.but it ia thought by many fitst-claBB judges of the game, that our non-success this Beason ia more attributable to bad luck than deficiency of skill, and that before long our men will show the same fcuperiority in the game as thoy displayed for many years until their recent defeats by New South Wales and South Australia. A new Victorian club, calling themselves Boho miane, and whose ranks are filled by players from different metropolitan clubs, have re- cently visited Tasmania, and played two matches there-one at Launceston, against the northern players of the island, and tho other at Hobart Town against the southernites. Tboy were successful at Laun cest√≥n, but at Hobart Town, the team was too good for them, and they wero beaton by 10 wickets, the Bcoring being-for the Bohe- mians, 113 and 193; and for the Taamanians, 284 in the first innings, and 29 in the second without the IOSB of a wicket. An eleven of Victoria started from Mel- bourne last week for Sydney, to play the return match with New South Wales. Tho eleven is the best that could have been chosen, with perhaps two or three excep- tions of players who wore unable to go away from home for so long a time aa. tho voyage to and from Sydney and the necessary playing would require, and it is hoped they will be able to win. The fact, however, of New South Walos having scored three intercolonial matches with us in succession, togoth√®r with the knowledge that she has a moat formidable team choaen against our players, make her men very strong favourites. Until the three last gamea New South Wales lost with Vic- toria continuously for a number of years, but each fresh season her players came up again with undaunted courage in the hope of winning, and now our men have gone to Sydney in a Bimilar hope, and with a reso- lute determination to retrievo the rocent de- feats. Most of our players are oxperioncod cricketers, the colt element having boon avoided, and if they do not win, it will cor tainly not bo from want of courage. The match will bo played on the Albert ground on Friday, the 25th hiBt., aud following days. An Australian high-rope porformor, namod Mr. L'Entrango, made bia first appearance heforu the Melbourne public on the 19tli inst. His performance was identical with that given by M. Blond√≠n whan he visited Melbourne. Mr. L'Ealrange appears to be quite as much at homo on the rope as his celebrated predecessor. MUSIC.

The expenses connected with the return of Poly- nesian labour are estimated at ¬£7,000, of which the greater part ought to be recovered from tbe parties on whose account the expen diture ia incurred, but which will, in fact, His Excellency fears, to a very large extent re- main a burden upon tho colony. A sum of ¬£350 is asked m aid of the expenses of the marine survey.

The Governor proposes that in futuro the community system of taxation prevalent in North Western India and other places, where the village or,tbe family forms the social unit, should be substituted for individual taxation The Legislative Council will from time to time MBeflS the amount payable by different pro- vinces and districts For the first year it will probably only be possible to assess the different provinces as a whole In subsequent years it may be possible to assess each dis- trict and perhaps even each village sepa- rately. The Governor proposes that " the amount of the provincial assessment shall be raised by the production of articles of export, which will be taken off the hands of the Government at fixed rates by contractors, who will themselves undertake the work of collection and shipment A sum of at least ¬£500 IB expected to be realised from the sale of land, and a like amount from the fees on Crown grants to settlers. Should these various sources of revenue,which form a total of ¬ø40,400, at all realise the amount expected, the ordinary expenditure will be defrayed and the loan be applied exclusively, or almost exclusively, to public worksandotherexpenses incident to the foundation of the colony." The tax on Polynesian labour will be abolished Anew tanfl l8 proposed As a rule, the late ¬´xietmg duties are untouched, but 10 per cent has been put upon imports that were recently admitted free, and 15 per cent upon drugs and jewellery Persons following any trade or profession have also to take out bcenccB, similar to the practice obtaining in Mauritius and some other colonies.

STATE OF TRADE Business during the month now closed has not been characterised by anything like activity or animation A steady routine trade demand has been experienced, but no transactions beyond that have been allowed to come beforo UB The larger buyers, asa rule, have carefully abstained from engaging m anything of a speculative character, anti with the exception of kerosene, no specialty has been prominently noticed Operations m kerosene oil have, however, been con- ducted on a largo Beale, though transactions come far short of last month's sales. Yet they have been of a nature to fully enBUre the success of th¬´ speculation, though no ad- vance on last month's quotations could be established, but on the contrary a concession on the trade rate thon given had to be made to induce the heavier buyers to operate Tho Balea effected in quantities amount to over 26,000 By tho Californian mail ad- vices from New York have been received to 24th, which state that the departures for Melbourne aro the Akbar, Etta Loring and the Chattanooga, having 18,100 cases on boord, the It J Moulton which left for Sidney, had 3 400 cases , while the Olustie loading for Adelaide, had 12 000 cases en gaged \\\ ith the exception then of the busi ¬ªe8B reported in this oil, transactions other wise have been of no account whatever, and on the present occasion we can attach no blame whatever to the weather, as the only appearance of Bummer with which we have been fa oured thia year at all has occurred during the present month. Nevertheless, Ino indication of an im ?".¬°J'l demand has been noticeable, but on [tbo contrary, the utmost dulneBs has preva√ºed in all branches of trade Nor can we at the present moment pretend to see any Prospect of achango for the better. Stocks of all descriptions of merchandise are accu- mulating, and shipments are still coming torward much in excess of requirements, and while that continues it is nnposBible to ex- pect anything like an improvement, more ¬´specially |with a market so restricted and circumscribed, as must be always the case iinder the effects of a policy so destructive w a nation's prosperity as protection haB ¬´ver been found to be In the face of ¬´his we have reason for congratulation that i,ra i?im ¬∞'ber respecta continues sound and uealthy Not a single failure in the city has occurred during the month, though we can not Bay 80 mucn for the country trade, the rSual amountof small insolvencies being re iporttd, m addition to which a special meet ing of creditors was held on the 11th ni in the estate of MessrB Wm.

Messrs. B Gouraimouau and Co. roport; Wool.-The business transacted during the month has been above the avorago at such a lato period of the season, the total catalogued at tho salos being 8,010 lalee, of which about 0,000 bales have boen Bold. A few lato shorn lots, or clips which haye boon do* layed In transit, have still to arrive, and probably tho auction sales will continuo at Intervals for another month or six wooka Prices remain about tho samo as last month, and thete 1B ne material fluctuation In any description. T ho wools offored during the past fow wcoka have* generally been in ordinary to a\ crago condition, and thoro lins been good competition both for Bhlpmont and for Bcourlng. In roviovflnglhe operations of tho season now nearly terminated, It Is gratify leg to noto not only tho largo business which baa boon transacted, but also tho almost unlformH steady rango of quotations, moro ospoclally for super lor conditioned lola Iufetlor clips also havo In- variably commanded full competition up to fair value, and wo have notln any forinor season noticed such an even distribution of attontlou to oach lot The smaller Kareela and odd mixed bates, which in provlouayo&ia; avo been dlfllcult to plato at satisfactory ratos, liavo tills season nut with caroful examination, and a clasfl of Inn ora hal o mado it thoir special buslnoss to bid for these parcela In ordor to Bort them Into larger lots for shipment or for scouring Tho very ampio ware- house accommodation avallablo for opoulng out and displacing each halo in tlieso small mixed clips, hal Induced a greater domand for thom, and wo havo noir a clasB of middlemen Bindiar to Iho English wool staplers, who colloct tho lessor lots and prepare thom Into sorts suitablo for the mauutacturor. A want which waa very noticeable has thus boon supplied, and relatively higher rates havo in consequonco boen realised, many of theso Uttlo parcols having boon sold at about tho satuo ratcB which woro obtained for them in tho prov loua ) ear whou quotations woro higher. AB regards tho goneral condition of the clip, wa cannot discern any Improvement ; indocd, In a larger proportion than usual of the noithorn flocks, lighter fleeces aud moro tondor staple has boon evident. Tilla has arisen chiefly through the dry autumn o', last jcar, which caused a scarcity of foeu over n consider- able portion of the Riverine district, and thus im- poverished tho Bhoop. Wo have also had occasion to notico an tncrcaso of burr in many flouks, moro OB pcclally where tho shoep havo boen kept on rich flata ana old fold log-grounds, and frequently to Buoh on citent as to render It almost ImpoBslblo to eratUcato it. Tho flocccB aro thus considerably doproclatod In value; ana it would probably bo advantageous In eovcinl Instances to louee off tho apodal portions where tbo plant is most prevalent, and uio thom for cattle, rather than continue to allow ehcop to hava scctsB to thom. Tilla defect In tho wool has Inmost coses been olHatcd to a cortaln oxtout by , ory freely skirling tho fleeces, and placing tho burry portions with tho pieces', but the buna aro B3 thickly dis i rlbulcd that It is not poeelblo In many cases to clear < hem out, and tbuB the wool Ima to be realised at a i eduction lu yaluo, ovon though It may have bean well washed and otherwlso carefully got-up ; lu fact, the cleaner the wool tho moro apparont aro Us defecto. Tho Western flocks and those from tho hilly districts aro in about the Bamo ordor aa they woro last year, and Burne of tho beet clips may bo Bald to be porfoct. \i e question If In any other part of the world wool coula be hiought to markot in sucli sploudtd con- dition, tho fleeces of theso boing snowy whlto, and combining a soft elastic touch with fineness and Btienglh of ataplo probably net attainable In any other country. Farmers In Europe can s¬ªrcely rcBllso the fact that flocks of 60.000 or moro sheop can bo brought to such a high standard of excollunco, tilla being tho result of unronilttlug caro mid attention, aided by n climate eminently sultod for the favourabio development of tho morlno breed. Wo have noticed an Increasing quantity of coarso wool Ibis season, tho Lincoln and Lolccstor brooda having been largoly adopted In Bomo of the colder portions of tho colony, whoro Bhoop of moro hardy con¬´ ¬´Huilona aro required They havo also been eubstl¬´ tutcd for the morlno on soveral freehold estates wilora tho land Is better than the av orage, and generally tin h o w oil ¬°f feed la abundant, giving not only a larger } ield of wool than the merino, but a noavior trame for Iho butcher. They aro, consoquontly, rnpldly coming into favour willi farmers who own limited aroaB of good land ; and generally, wo boliove, with a more proDtablo result than eau bo realised from merinos, rho latter, homier, must always remain the most suitable sheep for our vaBt areas of thinly -graasod land In the Interior, and thoy aro not likely to bo displaced by any othor breed Tho range of prices during Ulla past season Bliowa a considerable reduction as comparoel with tho previous year, tho decline being moro especially ovidout lu the * liest greasy, Tbis is attrlbutablo not only to the fall 'in the homo ruarkola during tho paat yoar, but also to tho leesencd demand for America, consequent on the depressed Btato of tho woollen trade lu that country. The total shipments to tho United States thlssoaaoa have bcou 6 032 balea onlj, wheroas lu tho previous season over 19,000 bales ¬ªoro purchased. The greater portion of tho clips whie.li In the soasen of 1874 were bought for America havo this last sooson beon shipped to London on growors' account. Wools of thle description havo ruled at a roductlon of ljd- te> 2d, nor lb,, ordinary greasy, Id to ljd. per lb, ; aud washed ilecco and Bcourod, lid. to 2d por lh., as oom¬´ pared with tho reason of 1874 5.

From South Australia 09,100 1x1163 havo been shipped, thus giving au lu troaso of 8,000 bales Thoro will also ho an Incrcaso of probably 2,000 bales from Queensland as tbo pastoral rosourcca of that country aro bein? rapidly developed Assuming that theso returns will approximately represent tho augmented yield, and accepting 10,000 balea os representing tho year's Incrcaso from Now South Wales, wa have thus a total estimated Increase from the four loading colonies of 85,254 bales, or about U_ per cent.-tbo shipments last year being 547,613 bales. Tho yield from Toa mania and from Western Australia will probably remain stationary; and as regarda Now Zealand ive do not possess any rollablo data aa yet on which to form an estim√¢t¬´, the Bboaring in that colony being ono or two montha later than In tho Australian c do- nlee. Tho increaso thus avallablo la less than mi^tit havo been expected, and Is principally attributable to the dry season m tho Northern districts, which baa kept alargo proportion of tho Bhcop in poor condi- tion, and thus lessoned their ylold of wool The drought, wo regret to uoto, continues over a largo ex- tent of country north of the Lachlan, and, although ralna havo fallen in places, there lias not as yot been that general break up in tlia v eather which is so mu.h desired cn tho back BtatioiiB, and already wo hoar uf large flocks of sheep having to bo travelled for focd and water. r During tbo pist lew days tolcgramB havo bcon re- ceived announcing tbooponing of tho Tebrtury salos, and we leam that but a small proportion of tho ships despatched from Australian ports dollv ored tho'r car Roca In time to bo included in tho sories, tho total ' catalogued, Including Cape of Good Hopo woola, bolng reported na only 100,000 bales, against an estimated quantity of 149,000 bales, which it waa expoctod would roaeh London for tho salea from theso colonies alone.
