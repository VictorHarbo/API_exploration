LETTERS TOTH EDITOR i I i A GERMAN VOICE ON NOMINATED y.",". IMMIGRATION. j 'SIR, Tardy justice seems at last about to be dealt by our Government to the recent seUlera~who*havo been Waiting for so many mouths to bring out after them Berthe friends they had to leave behind " until further moneys are provided for immigration purposes." ( Vide Immigration office circular dated May 3, 1886.) Our Premier in his place on Thursday last stated justly that "every £1 spent on their (the German) introduction has been returned to the colony through their settlement amongst us," Mr. Kui bey, with other members and the general public, bearing out ifJils.statcment.. It should not be overlooked that this" prominently, successful result amongst the many ways in which the late immigration vote was spent is due entirely to the care and discrimination with which,, as regards fitness for villa their new home, Germans and Danes were selected in then; country. Some of as well remember the trouble and expense in store at home for the aged, who appears to have come out of this business at heavy personal loss, though no fault of his or ours, i We shall now be very anxious to know how far Government will redeem the pledge their agent gave our friends at Home to be assisted thereafter to join us. At a recent deputation to the Premier we were assured an equal share with others in carrying out this intention, and Mr., Buck advocated a further privilege, one which (already obtains in other colonies with a large German element-«.e"allowing the foreign peasantry, in their communications, with the department, the use of their native language when needed. The want of this has hitherto almost precluded many from the ' advantages held out to others, and kept many Danish and German families away whose daughters alone would have supplied such a long-felt want here, that of useful domestic servants. I Thanking you for space, -Yours, etc.; TASMANIAN COUNTRY SETTLERS ' J . ' FROM'GERM ANY.
