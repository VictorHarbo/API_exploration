The Underiey brings 255 passengers, ' most of whom are under the ixiuuty-warraut, or MI'S Rye's system of immigration. Good health ' has been enjoyed, which may be attributed not ouiy to the good ventilation of the ship nnd her excellent accommodation, but to the supervision of the we". known surgeon-superintendent Dr. Newbold, nnd the clermlluess enforced by Captain Browne nnd his officers, to whom testi monium of n very flattering description i'?Terr 6ccn presented Ly the passengers, i i i Hnnerley, ns previously mentioned, is a new Si.P" i In was built nt Dnncastcr, by the Lime hnip- building Company, and wns ebrislened by Lndy Madeline Bectivc, and is the largest ever built on the Lime.
