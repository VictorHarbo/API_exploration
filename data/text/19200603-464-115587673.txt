Tha .reversion of Sehleswig to 'Den- mark by an overwhelming poijular vote gives renewed interest to that little kingdom. Catholics in that stronghold of Lutberanism are relatively the merest handful of the total population, yet a vigorous and aggressive handful withal. The population of Denmark just before the war was a little less than three millions, having almost doubled since 1860. In the latter year the Catholics numbered 1240; in 1914 they were 11,000, exclusive of Polish Catholic immigrants, an increase al most tenfold. They have, therefore, '? more than kept pace with the total ' population, and, while, yet n.n inconsi derable faction,, hare produced many rr.on of, nota ; and, what perhaps is of'- greater significance, drawn to their rank 8 by conversion others from the front ranks of Danish citiaeiisliip; , HUDGEE'S LEADING ENGINEERS AND MOTOR EXPERTS.
