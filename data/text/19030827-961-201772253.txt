In_ the platform there are six planks, which, summarised, amount to this : Economy in public expenditure, op posing Government interference with pri vate enterprise, undue Parliamentary do mination of the Labour Party, and .resist ing the nationalisation of industries and land. A good old reactionary platform! * # # A New South Wales representative- of capitalism; said in the Federal House last week that the Socialistic boast when it came to a fight was : '' I want to destroy capital.'

In 1891 the party got 5000 votes' at the elections ; in 1903, 29,000 votes, which, considering thd manner in which voters are terrorised at the. polls and the results falsified, speaks volumes. In 14 districts the. Socialists wore so disgusted at' tho refusal of the authorities to assert the law that they broke- the ballot boxes. The party ha.s a number of weeklies- with a total circulation of 35,000, but no daily. The Socialists aro represented in many communes, though not in Parlia.me.nt. Tlic parly has a. largo following among the agricultural labourers, and is chiefly recruited from the prole tariat. The printers aro the most activo workers. — ''Justice.'

Socialism is no colony scheme. Many people have been kept away from Socialism because tiiey thought it was communism. Communism stands for common ownership of everything, tho common ownership of private property, household stuff, and all that sort of thing. It stands for a common dining-room where people must eat together. Socialism stands ; for the public ownership of those things) ( only winch must be publicly owned m . i order to. remove exploitation. It stands ! for private property in everything that is ; used privately. It stands for the mosts \ complete, individual liberty. Capitalism. j claims to stand for individual liberty. ; Socialism proposes to- give the individual i ' opportunities for privacy and siclfrdevolop- ' nient that are practically unknown among ' ' the masses to-day. Exploitation and its ! consequent widespread effect, poverty, | j compel people to herd together like cattle. Socialism will give* them the wherewithal ' to be indebendent in that respect.
