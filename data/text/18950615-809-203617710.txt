A lady, rather above a medium position, who shortly after marriage became sickly, and every day complained of sonic kind of complaint until her young husband hccamo tired of hearing her troubles, nnd after trying many doctors nnd specialists— which was, . after all, the dlfforenc medicines she hud takou_ ;to .\uo good purpose— and, after five years' suffering ami trying every new remedy advertised without success, ut last gave up nil thoughts of ever recovering her health, being very unhappy, with her hnibapd -ap. psrently getting tired ot her, until sho said to' her hu#« band, "I am sorry I ever married you, seeing- 1 hnvo brought you so much misery, nnd t wish I was dead and snvo you further misery." " My dear," said tho husband, "I have to admit you have brought me much unbappl- noss, and I thought when I married yoit would add to my comfort and inako tne happy, but now, after trying so many skilled doctors and specialists, nil to no purpose, it seems useless to try any other treatment." "Yes, I think you nre right," she snld, " It will only be spending mora money, and such bad times wo cannot afford to try any more, as 1 fed sure I am declining fast and there will soon be an end to both of our miseries." "My dear,'' said the husband, "do uot give up, so long &a; there la life there is hope. £ met a gentleman the other day who asked for you, and after telling of your bad state of health lie strongly recommended me to try a herbalist who has a shop in Bourkc-street; Meulipltiy ntul Son is the narno he tells me. lie has been very successful in curing tunny diseases after nil other treatmoot had failed. Suppose you give him a trial as the last resource; hu may euro you." "No, my dear husband, it seems very kind of you, but 1 feel sure I will never bo cured." "Well, suppose 1 call on him and see whnt he has to sny. If it doeB not seeni right we have nothing to pay for advice- only for medicine it I take it for you. There can be no harm done in that case. I will let you know what they think of your case before Inking any medicine." Thegentlemnn called, explained hi# wife's sufferings, and in a very short time Mentiplny k Son, of 193 Bourke- street, told him that his wife only suffered from disorders of both liver nnd kidneys, which was the rouse of all her trouble, and sho could be cured In less than two months and restored to perfect health. With this assurance he consulted his wife, and she agreed to try our treatment. Hereaaebeingan unusually bad one, it took 12 boxes of our Liver and Kidney IMlls to cure her, the coat of which was thirty shillings (30s.). The husband told 11s that it must havo cost him for advico and medicine not less than two hundred pounds (£200). His wife now en joys the best of health, and has given birth to a tine strong son, tho first of her family, and that is how she be- came happy. Her husband now goes home to meet a happy looking fneo nnd a loving wife; and how tnafiy, -hundreds aro there who suffer from the same and other complaints and live unhappy because of diBeaso, and spend their money without deriving any benefit, and afterwards have to consult YY. Mentiplay and Son before finding any relief? I cite this case, being only one out of hundreds under much the same circumstances. Our Liver nnd Kidney Pills nre the most beneficial and reliable medicine under tho sun for male or female adults und children or in fants of any nge. They do not purge thn bowels, there fore net on the liver and kidneys, and I must hero assert that any medicine that purges tbe bowels does oot euro tho liver. The following is one more success added to the number of cures of hydatids, without operation; nnd why should the public, when such facts aro forthcoming, bo sceptic, Mr. W. HUNT, of Eyru Farm, Untuinual, , Mr. W. Mentiplay, Dear Sir,— I beg to tender you my sincere thanks for your successful treatment of my son, whom you have completely Cured of Hydatids. Prior to him visiting you ho was under the care of two doctors, neither of whom knew what ho suffered from. Ho was also an inmate of the Bcndigo Hospital for four months, when the Burgeons performed an operation un successfully upon him. 1 then took him to you, and after six months course or your treatment I can truly sny he is now CornpUrtoly Cured. I write this latter in the interest of those suffering from hydatids. You aro ot liberty to make what use you think lit of this. I remain yours very thnokful, yv. hunt.
