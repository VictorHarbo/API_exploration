A WORD TO FARMERS. IN connection with the immigration movement, advices liavo beon received to : the effect that good opportunities exist, from timo to time ot inducing agriculturists from Northern Europe to make their home in New South Wales. The question has arisen whether it would bo advisable to hold out any offers to this class of farm labourer, in view of the fact that the men would bo unable to speak the language, and might, therefore, on arrival, have diffi culty in securing employment. There is no doubt that the agriculturist of Northern Europe would make an ideal settler of New South Wales, and if the difficulty of his employment cohld be got over, a considerable advantage would accrue to the Stato by his settle ment here. German, Danish-, or Scan dinavian land- holders who would bo willing. to employ men of their own nationality are, therefore, invited to make the fact known to the Director of the Intelligence Dopartmont, Sydney, when tho matter of securing immi grants from thoso countries would bo considered. ,
