Collision it 8ea— The Wonga Wonga (s.), for Melbourne, left ihc Ccmpsny'B wharf at 8 o'clock on Thursday, and after clear ing the beads about two houis, ran dnmi the briganttne Viooroy, and sank lier. Cagitais Trouion, of tho Wonga WoBgn, has refiolccd making any statement until the cue has been Investi gated. Captain R- bcrt Fuller, of the Viceroy, has kindly fur nttbed the following particulars of the casualty. The Viceroy cleared Sydney Heads on Tuesday last, biund to Newcastle ; the wind being light from the southward, and current running over four knots, caused tho vessel to drift below Botany. At the lime of tho collision (about 8 p.m.) Sydney light bore W.W. by W., distant eight miles. Tho steamer's light was ccrn by tbe hands on board the echooncr steering; N N.E , who dbectly took in the gaff topsail, trussed up the mainsail, and stood away, going about six knots. The oaptain was on deck at the time, although it was tbe mate's watob, and states tatt t-otb lights wire flxedin tbelr proper places. Tbo Viceroy went down in less than five minntes after «be waB struck, but providentially all bandB were saved. Seven of the crew escaped by clinging to the steamer, and one man vtbb picked up floating by tbe support of a life buoy. At the time of the accident it was very dark and brpy. The viceroy Is fully insured in a Melbourne office. Tbe captain arid ell handB have lost everything, there being only suffi cient time to save thrmeclves.

The ship was completely gatied, her boiler? and engines thoroughly over hauled and refitted, the boll painted icside and oat, and the hold coated with cement, to counteract the effects of Eca water.

The barque. Mary Agnes, 282 tons, Captain Darby, arrived In harbour last evening from Sydney.

She. sailed from Sydney on the tlb instt.nt, nnd had heavy weatber and strong gales from the S,£, neatly all the way across. On Saturday night last, whilst about 20|i miles to the westward or tho Three Kings, experienced the full force of the hurricane wblch Drcvaikd here. Tbe vessel wae running under clew reefed topsails uad staysails, tbe wind blow Ing hard from the N.E , when in an instant it shifted round to the eoulbward, striking the veswl with Rrcal force, eplitliogall tbe canvas to ribbons, and sweeping the decks. For several boure it bl-w with fearfol violence, es much so that the clore reefed fore-topsail wa* blown clean out of the boll-roues.

ConsldiTing the weatber cipcticnocd, tbe nulmnle on board hare arrived in splcnded condition.— Southern On, March 26; ? WRECK OF THE PANAMA. (Frm the Itoelhamiiton LMitin, Uth ISarrh J It is with deep regret that we have to record the total loss of the barque Panama, 414 tons, N. U. Hahlg, master, which was wrecked on the Diebtof Friday, tho 18th Instant, near Sandy Cape, at the north-west end of Fraeer's (or Great Sandy) Island, oH the entrance to Hervey's Bay. The Panama, it will be re membered, left Part Chalmers, New ZcaUnd, on the 10th Feb ruary last, for Kockhampion, with 150 dtggoraon board, who were proceeding to the Peak Downs gold-Seld. Sbc arrived in Krppel Bay on the 27lh, after a quick passage of seventeen days, ai,el It ft again on tbe 5th luBtant, bound to Newcastle, New South Wales. The sad intelligence of her shipwreck was coinmunicatsd to Captain Ourpliey, of the steamer Queensland, by Captain Uabig, wbowBE picked up in a boat by the former on Wednes day lust, at four o'clock p.m., a few hours after the steamer left Maryborough on herway to this port. In tbe same boat aloag with Captain Habig weie the second mate of the Panama, tbe stcuurdrta. of tbo vessel, the coast pilot (whom the explain bad shipped at Duncdin), and four sailors. Captain Habig infoimcd Captain Curphey that from the time or hia leaving Eeppcl Bay until the moment of tbe vessel suiting, he I'.ad to rifle weather, and never once sighted land, and that for fourteen days the (hip had been knocking about along tbe ooast without anyone on board— not even the pilot — baving the least idea of Ibrlr whereabout*. In fact, not long before the catas trophe happened, so far from bavlig any knowledge of his being lo the vicinity of such a dangcrouB spot as Breaksca Spit he be lieved he was off the coast of New Calodonia. Captain Habig only became aware or the txlremc peril his vessel was in wben, at six o'clock on Friday evening, tbo )8lh, he first caught eight of the breakers on the Spit. Deeming it Mill possible to save the barque, which was then cspostd to the full fury of the violent galo that commenced on the afternoon of that day, aud which was driving her ashore, he immediately altered her course. All that night the pale continued with unabated violence, and great alarm was now felt for the safety of the ship. At about four o'clock the following (Saturday) morning toe wind, which bad been previously blowing from USE., suddenly shifted round to N.W., from which quarter it now came with increased violence The weather was so thick and hazy at the time that it was impossible to see a snip's length from the vessel. About a quarter or an hour after the wind had thus changed the ' barque wasdriven on the beach, and soon parted in two amidships, the sea breaking over her. Io order to rave the lives of those on \- board, one of the crew volunteered id carry a line through the breakers, end in ibis manner got a hanscr ushore. This hazard ous feot wob safely accomplished, and by this means several lives were saved. One pott fellow, however, although a good swimmer, wos drowned whilst attempting to get ashore. His name was un known to tboec os uooril, but he acted in the capacity of second steward during the passage from Dunedin to Rockhampton, Not having any boats to enable them to leave the vessel, the ship wrecked party were compelled to remain, sonc on the wreck, and te.mc who hLd managed to get asbore, on tbe island until one could be made. Tbis done, on Wednesday, the 23rd instant, nt three o'clock a.m , Captain Uabig— taking with him tbe second mate (R. Dlckson), the pilot (Montague Brace), the sUwaidesfi (Miss Julia Jonnson), and four of the crew— left to obtain assistance, Eleven men, among whom waB the chief ffflcer, unainrd behind, Captain Habig promising lo send thenv sreedy relief. Captain Curphey fell in with thi6 boat near Woody Island, at four o'clock tbe samo afternoon, and upon learoiog tbe nature or tbe disaster, at once proceeded to the scene of the wreck for the purpose of rescuing the sufferers. At half-past ten o'clook tbe same night he anchored the Queensland about a mile off the north-wtbt point of Frazcr's Island, and Bent Mr. Roaca (the chief officer) ar,d a boat's crew to the shipwrecked vessel. Contain Habig and four -i1 his men also proceeded to the wreck in another beat, loon their arrival they found one man only, named George Weavers, on the beach near the remains of the barque, Weavers informed Captain liable; that the chief officer acd ill the «6t of tbe crew, excepting hiiuadf, becoming alarmed at seeing a number of the blacks gathering together on the island in the vicinity of tbe wreck, bad hastily constructed a boat, and at noon that day bod all left in it with the intention or gating on the mainland, and endeavouring to proceed to Maryborough. Weave) 6 rerusedto go with them, feeling certain that it would he enfer to renu.iD until Captain Uabig returned with the assist ance he had promised. TbiB man, together with Captain Habig, and those who were with him in the &«at, proceeded on to Glad stone in the QucesEland. The steamer Eagle being at Gladstone when they anived there, they were enabled to proceed in her on to Sydney. The Queensland, on bcr way from Maryborough, Eighted a large ship oS Round Hill. Ebe was thought to be the Prince Consort, from England, with immigrants, bound to Maryborough. By tbe Presto we learn that a severe hurricane had passed over Whitsunday Islands with great violence, levelling trees, huts, ' and e;Ven the men themselves engaged in cutting timber. Pro visions and flour were destroyed, and when the Presto came to their relief, tbe inhabitants were found to be subsisting on the shell &Bb; discovered on the beach.— Port Dmison Jimcj, LATE8T DATES.
