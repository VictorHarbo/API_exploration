The consideration of one hundred and fifty-two (152) applications for further relief has been dealt with by the Executive Committee direct. It was decided during the past year to review the relief previously granted to the more seriously ill, or injured, and to 4/10 relatives of deceased soldiers, with a view to granting further assistance.

This report was presented to the Executive Committee on 28th October, 1903, who adopted it, and authorised the hairiness and vice-chairman to carry out its recommendations on being satisfied as to the necessity of each case. The enquiries were of an exhaustive character, and all cases recommended have not yet finally been dealt with. So far, eighty-two (82) cases have been completed, and there are still some thirty (30) In abeyance. The amounts certified by the Chairman and Vice- Chairman, and subsequently confirmed by the Executive Committee, on the eighty-two (82) cases above mentioned total £3190, and have been paid. The total donations to the Fund since its inception (2nd November, 1899) amount to £52,408 12s 4d, and interest earned and credited £4,432 17s 5d. % Grand total . £32,11118 0 The Executive Committee have again to thank the authorities for their courteous assistance In investigat- ing iqipIliMtions from the country districts.
