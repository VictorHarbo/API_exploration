In reference to the foregoing figures (wo sholl tako au opportunity of going into detail some other time) we may mention that thoro has been no falling off in the quantity exported of articles of colonial produco, bu: on tho contrary a gradual increase, the decrease as shotvn abovo boiugaccounted for by thofalliug off in the exportation of homo Imports to the neighbouring colo nies. Dui lng the past month, dating from our last sum- mary, business generally hasprcserved tho same aspect of qutotudoos hosboon noticeable forsomo time past, not only in tho import markets but also in tho markot far colonial produco. Tho only exception to this romirk is wool, in which some activity has been perceptible, though sonio buyers kept out of tho markot pending the arrival of the November mail from England, the telograms from Aden, November 2nd, havingproduejd Somo uncertainty. However, no ohango took placo in prices, and sales, generally speaking, havo boon effected without muoh difficulty. As is usual at this t'mo of tho year, tho timber trade lias boon inactivo, .iho whalers for the most put havo been doing woll, and the tako this soason will provea fair avoia_o. .Thoro havo boon no arrivals of importance tho lost four weeks, and things gonorally aro very slack. Out though business has boon so dull for a long time put,' yet commorcial matters hero aro conducted on a soual basis, as exemplified by tho absence of any insolvencies among the morcautilo community, whilo at Melhourno and Adclaido failures havo followed failures in rapid succession."-Mercury. " LAUNCESTON, January 14.-At the present timo, when our export of grain and flour is so limited, tho result of sales by auction is the best criterion of the real valuo of this description of produco. At Mr. Lewis Cohon's Bale of colonial produce, at his mart, on Thursday, thero woro no purchasers at satisfactory rates, but the quotation for parcels of good quality is about £17 per ton.

MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRICES CURRENT. Our monthly report is, we regret to say, ncoossarily a gloomy ono. Tho condition of our market may bo described as disheartening and hopeless. Tho latter part of tho year 1859 was characterised by a steady decline In' tho valuo of nearly all descriptions of im- ported goods, and heavy supplies, accompanied by nu- merous failuros, and the present year has not oponed moro brightly. Thoro havo been, as yet, fotvorfallures, and tbo surfaco of. business matters appears smoother, but it Is to bo foarcd that tho present lull may be pre- monitory of a galo. The only prospecVof business again. assuming a healthy, and, wo may say, its proper posi- tion, must arise from a cessation of tho unparalloloi heavy shipments of all descriptions of goads now making for this market, which, judging from the sup- plies, appoars in the oyes of the world to bo capablo of consuming any amount of goods. It is to the credit of our mercantile community that the extraordinary shipments being mado to this colony havo not originated at their suggoition, and tho fact thatj numerous ordors forwarded havo been cancelled pre- vious to tholr execution, should have beon an indica- tion and warning to homo Bhlppors to act with caution, 'The losses which must inevitably ensue will fall to some oxtont on the shippers, who will havo thomsolvos alono to blame for the want of prudence and foresight -displayed by thom. Tho evil has been creeping on for the last two years, and, having become rino, must necessarily burst. Speculation IISB in some instances driven priccB up, regardless of consumption and lui Iiorts. Statistical accounts of demand and supply have icen utterly disregarded in tho endeavour te "rush up" pricos of tho favourito articlo of the day, and with tho mi-Judgment but too ofton wltnossoJ, TI hero any article happons from clrcumstancos to ho in demand, and of conso piont ready sale at "paying ratos," an inordinate Btipp'.y of tho sam J articlo is immediately written for, and the markot becomes glutted. To over importations may bo attri- buted mauy of the failures which havo occurred and aro likely to follow* An anxiety to «oil has induced credit to bo given whero there was no prospect of pay- ment, and however honestly disposed tho parties might»havo boen, being unable to roallso even the prices thoy had paid for their goods, sotting asid; their expenses, what could possibly result but what has and Is occurring-the non-payment of tholr liabili- ties? At tho closo of tho holidays at tho coramoncj inont of the year thero appeared a prospect of a bettor demand, and hopes began te brighten. A sort of feeling arose that shippers must at length see tho folly of con- tinuing excessive shipments, and " things would bo bettor ;" but the arrival of the mail announcing an in- creaso of £100,000 worth of shipments lu October over tho provious month has " tumbled down everything," and wo believe wo aro not exceeding the truth in saying that thoro aro not abovo two or threo urtiolos of import which aro salcablo at rates covering cost and charges, and that not ono exists on which oven tho presont quotations are likely to be maintained. It, must, howovcr, be horne in mind that disastrous and unpropltious as tho condition of our markets is, the losses, heavy as they must bo, will chlofly fall on ths shippers ; and only whero a reckless guarantee has been given ttlll tho consignees suffer; and, therefore, amidst all tho losses and ruin tho mora prudent part of our mercantile body will pass scatholoBS through tho or- deal. Flour, owing tosupplles of our own growth being hardly yet ready for market, and the South Australian farmers foolishly holding back their grain until our nipplies come to hand and prices fall, is steady hi price, and best descriptions of Adelaide, silk dressed, aro worth, and readily ssleablo at prosont, at £10 co £10 10s., and other blands at proportionate rates. ' Chilian is in fair supply, and marketable at from £10 to £17. Tho parcel of 2,000 barrels of United States, ex Oriontal, has beon purchased »y a miller at some- thing abovo 40s. Od. por barrel, but tho exact price his not transpired. Largo shipments have been made of flour front tho United States. Reports as to supplies of wheat and flour from tho West Coast vary much, hut as tho harvests throughout the Australian colonies have boon, boj ond all doubt, generally favourable, ovon without extraneous supplies, there is orory prospect of breadstuffs ruling low in prices during tho current ytar. Tea Is coming In in unboard of quantities, the lato high figures procurtblt having Induced extraordi- nary shipments, and, unfortunately for consumers, quantity, Irrespective of quality, or "as muoh as pos- sible for tho money," seams to havo been tho tenor of advice«, as reports from China «tate that tho purchases maiie for this markst have beon generally of very Inforlor description.

Alo and Beer.-Demand for bulk beers is very quiet, hut as the old season's >upp)y of ale seems to havi been nearly all shipped, better prices may1' be leaked for prior to thd arrival of tho new. brewst coming into tho market. Bulk stout Is in rather better inquiry for bottling, owing to tho inadequate supply of imported bottled stout. Bottled ales are well supplied, and prices consequently easy.

Flour, Grain.-A temporary scarcity of colonial flour has created an improved domand for this descrip- tion, and prices are consequently well supportod, bait brands of Adelaldo soiling nt from £10 to £19 10s. As, howover, the market lWlll shortly bo fully suppliol by the produco ef our own and neighbouring colonies, a reduction In rates must necessarily ensue. The last arrival of Amorican barrel flour has been placed at b3 tween 40s. Od. and 41s. por barrol. Tasmanian sells at £17 to £17 10s. ; and Chilian at £10 to £17. Whait is coming forward but slowly, farmors holding in hopas of stiffening tho markot and getting better prlcai. Thoso are, howevor, unlikely to bo obtained, and as supplies como to hand ratos must recodo, and growara bo ultimately losers by koopiug from markot. Millers aro buyers at about 7B. Od. per bushol, and as thoy can now import from South Australia at about tint llgure, aro unlikely to pay any moro, and as soon as our own crop is fairly in the market, it is not likely that cvon that price will bo procurable. Barley is dull as can bo, aud prices nominal. Cape Is quoted at 2s. lOd. to 3s. ; Californian,8s to3s. 2d. ; English,Ss. lOd. to 4s. Oats.-Stocks continue onormous,and with largo com- ing supplies, which pour in from all quartora, any amendment in prices seems hopeless, and to whit ox trcmlty rates will declino timo alono can show. De- mand certainly is brisk, but the produco of the colonial harvest Is nearly ready for markot, and oven low prices cannot justify speculation.

Groceries.-Teas.-Domand has considerably les- sened, tho trado being generally supplied, and as larga supplies, chiefly of low qualities, aro on the way froJi China, present pricos aro unlikely to bo sustainod. Coffees are becoming light in stock, and good sam- ples of plantation kind aro readily saleable at quoted prices. Sugars, after considerable inactivity and gradual declino in prices, have somewhat ralllod, and for good bright grocery descriptions there is a bettor demand at an advance of about Is.
