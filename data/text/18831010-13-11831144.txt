Under the bill, these commissioners are to hold office for seven years, and not to be removable except on the joint vote of the two Houses, or on the vote of the Assembly alone passed in two consecutive sessions. The Council objected to the overruling power thus bestowed on the Assembly, and resolved that time must be an interval of at least three months between the two sessions. This proviso has been disallowed by the Assombly, and re-affirmed by the Council. It now rests with the Assembly to givo way either in part or altogether. The bill, as sent up to the Council, placed the railway commissioners in the same position as the audit commissioners, and the Council think that a material distinction should be drawn between the two bodies, and will not allow the bill to pass without devising some precaution against the excercise of undue haste. The lîadway Loan Bill has boon passed by both Houses of Parliament Hu« moasuio, which wis announced in tho budget statement, authorises tho borrow ing of £4,000,000 at 4 pel cent Of this amount ¿812 500 is foi tho redemption of the debentures which fall duo on 1st October, 1884, and £1,824,100 is the balance of the ledomption lo in not floated 1 ist July 'lho debentures authonsed by tho Redemption Act of 1882 w ill, to this extent, bo cancelled Tho bill further provides for the lepayment to tho rov enue of tho sums of £125 000 on account of tho Yan Yean supply and £100,000 on account of giants to wutor trusts Thoie is also tho Bum of £1,000,000 "foi the conBtiuction of railways and woiks con nected therewith, as P irliament may by any act direct " Ono of the featuios in which tho bill differs from its predo cossors is that the debontuiea are to run for 30 years instead of 25, m oidor that a convenient interval may bo afforded bo tween the falling duo of our debts m Lon don Again, the bill authorises tho exchange ot tlio m itmmg debentures for new debentures at a price to bo agieed upon lho banks in London are anxious that tina oxpei tment should bo tried and Air Service desnes to take a disci etionary powoi accordingly Tho present mten tion of tho Government is to floit £3,000,000 m Jinuary next, and tho balance will probably bo "financed" lutei in the ye u, w ithout going through the process of c tiling foi tondeis The Harbour Trust Bill was accepted by the Legislativo Council w ithout altoi a tion, and tho Inist has enteiod on its preparations for cirrying out Su John Coode's Bcliemo of put improvement in vigorous stylo Important and necessary pow crs have been bestow ed by Paili imont on the 1 rust Tho Premier has beon asked in the Legislative Assembly by Mi A\ ilkei whether ho would adopt me urn to milco known m Gre it Biitini and Kuiopo the ad\ intages offered by tho colony of Vic tom to intending lmmigiants Mr Service îeplied Hut he communicated with tho agent general on the subject some time back 'lime is no doubt that whilo the other colonies systematically pul themselves before tho public, "Vic tona is falling into < omparativ e obscurity, but tho agent gcncial « ijs that it matters little how you bring the advantages of a particular colony beforo tho Lnglish public unless it is prepared to issist im migrants as do the other eoljnies Mr Murray Smith mentions, howovci that if » hundbook wero supplied to lum ho -ould distribute copies among inquirers, tnd Mi Service has under consideration ho propriety of acting upon this sugges aon The rovenm leturnB for tho farst paaiter of the financial year aro published ilsewhero They mdicrto that the past Hirco months havo been dull, as tho ¡ustoins roceipts nu stationary and the lucre me in the laihv ly incomo nominal A decrease of £12 87" is shown, as com pared w ith the corresponding quarter of 1882, but this is m largo part duo to the abolition of tho excise duty on beor lho vacancy m the representation of Emerild hill, ciused by tho death of Mr Robert Mucgtcgor, has beon lillod bj. the election of Mr David Gaunson SOCIAL A communication has bien received by the Postmaster General of Victoria from the New South Vi ales postal authorities, m connexion with tin Univers li Postal Union question, in winch it is stated that the colony cannot wnive the condition as to separate represen tatton in tin administration of the affairs of the union A fuithir despatch contain» »og «cations lrom the New South Wales Govern ment as to the rate of postage proposed to be charged in that colony on all union corre spondcnce In reply, Mr Berry has forwarded a communication, suggesting the desirability of slightly modify ing the rates proposed to he charged bj Now South Malos with the view of bringing ul out a uniform rate for the whole oi thu Vustriihan colonies joining Hie union Mr Berry expresses his conviction thut con hiderable advantages would result, and many inconveniences hi prcvcntid, by the estab hshment ot u uniform into ol postage on foreign correspondence, as tile pohtal churfies would thereby le snnpliliul to tho utmost possibli extent, and the public interest would be ben e d to mi equal degree A circular le tier has also been forw arded to South Australia, lusniinia and Western Australia, on tho same subject.

Upjohn, the hangman, states that Burns hurriedly confessed to him on the scaffold that he had committed several other murders but no credence is attached to the statement of the executioner, as the gaol officials deny that a confession of any kind was made. Burns, however, is strongly believed to have had something to do with other murders than the one for which he has paid the penalty of the law.
