INTRODUCTORY. At the date of our last summary we were upon the eve of a Parliamentary crisis. The Francis Cabinet had upon the retirement of its chief been recon- structed by the Attorney General, Mr Kerferd, who took the position of Pre- mier, and of course so filled up the vacan cíes from the Ministerial side of the House. This did not accord with the views of a few members of the Opposi- tion, and therefore Mr Jones, in the Legislative Assembly, gave notice of a motion, " That this House considers the reconstruction of the Government and the statements connected therewith unsatisfactory " After remarking that in all probability the more respectable members of the Opposition would de- cline to be parties to what was ad- mitted to be a most factious proceed- ing, and would refrain from voting, we pointed out that Mr Jones's motion had not the slightest chance of suc- cess Our prediction proved correct. The motion was brought forward on the 11th ult. The Government de- clined to enter into any lengthened discussion upon the question, contending that they would have been unfaithful to the majority by whom they were sup- ported had they taken any other course than that they had done, and challenging the Opposition to at once go to a divi- sion without wasting the time of the country. After a debate, which lasted two nights, the motion was negatived, the Opposition declining to call the services of the tellers into requisition. The financial statoment was made by the new Treasurer (Mr Service) on tho 27th ult, and greatly disap pointed the friends of the Cabinet. It had been very generally conceded that the time had arrived when very many of the unreasonable burdens inflicted upon the commerce of the colony by a protective policy might be either greatly reduced or altogether removed, and strong hopes were entertained that the treasurer, who has been always regarded as a prominent member of the free trade party, would do his utmost to secure a revision of the tariff in a free trade direction, and so deal with the incidence of taxation as to secure by means of some kind of land, property, or income tax that a fairer pro portion of the burden of the state ex penses should fall upon those who were best able to bear them. He did nothing of the sort, but on the contrary avowed that, taking for his guide the motto that the majority must rule, and believing that the majority had declared in favour of protection, the alterations he proposed in the tariff were not dictated by his own views and opinions but in accordance with what he took to be the will of the people A reference to the proposed changes in the tariff which appear in detail in another column, show conclusively that this is precisely what the Treasurer has done. He has certainly taken the duty off a number of articles from which comparatively but little revenue was received, but to make up for this, he has actually increased the 20 per cent list by over 20 items, added to which he has raised the duty on ordinary wine to 4s per gallon, and on sparkling to 6s per gallon The debate on the Budget is not yet concluded , but in consequence of the disorganised position of parties, it is not likely that any important action will be taken upon the question, but that, with the exception of such alterations as may be made in committee, the propositions of Mr Service will be accopted, and the colony will witness the spectacle of an ultra freetrader assisting in the admini stiation of a fiscal policy which he will have mado moro protective than it was before. AN with regard to the financial position of the countiy, that, notwithstanding our largely increased expenditure, appears to be satisfactory enough The gross re- venue for 1873 74 was £4,347,030, showing an increase on the estimate of £141,702, whilst the total expenditure was -£4,177,202, or an increase on the estimated expenditure of £5,574 Tho estimated oxpendituro for 1874 7 is £1,478,080, being an increase on the actual expenditure for the pre ceding, year of £300,818, and on the expenditure authorised by Parlia ment, which was £4,471,713-of £6,307 This increased expenditure is largely due to special appropriations and interest on loans, the ordinary estiniated expendíture being £62,906 less than was last year voted by Parliament. The estimated revenue for 1874-75 is £4,259,136. To this has to be added balance from 1873-74, £170,368, recoups £75,679, and the amount due from other Governments on account of steam postal communication, £10,000, making a total revenue of £4,515,182 showing a balance to be carried over to 1875-76 of £37,102. The balance in favour of the current year would have been much larger but that, in accordance with their policy of alienating Crown lands for the purposes of settlement only, the Government did not sell by auction anything like the quantity of Crown land they were autho rised to do, and the income from that source was consequently over £100,000 short. But very little progress has been made with any of the othor questions which are under discussion The Local Govern ment Act Amendment Bill has passed its second reading, and is now under consideration in committee, but the prin- cipal clauses of the measure have yet to be dealt with. Until the debate on the budget is concluded, and the changes proposed by the Treasurer in the tariff have been finally dealt with, it is not likely that any othor business of importance will be undertaken by the Legislative Assembly.

The Government has resolved that at the appeal before the Privy Council of the Queen v Mount and Morris the defendants' case shall be fully represented. The decision will set at rest many points of the greatest mo- ment to this colony relative to the construc- tion of several Imperial Acts of Parlia- ment. The Hon J. G. Francis, the chief Secretary, has gone to Mr Cohen's station Canally in the Riverina district for the benefit of his health He is progressing very favourably. The departure by the Mikado on the 1st of last month of Mr H H Hall, the managing director in Sydney of the Australasian and American Steamship Company combined with the rumours that had previously been current prepared us for the announcement of the breakdown of the temporary Califor- nian mail service. It was not until the arrival of the Tartar at Sydney on the 2nd inst that the exact state of the case became known but the New South Wales Government had previously telegraphed in- structions to the agent general of the colony in London to take steps to enforce the penal- ties incurred by the contractors. All the de- tails of the affair will ere this have reached London from San Francisco and it will be only necessary to state here what arrangements have been made in the Australian colonies for conveying the mails until the permanent service is commenced. The Government of New South Wales has announced that the service as far as that colony is concerned shall be maintained at all costs and the Aus- traban Steam Navigation Company is looked to for the supply of the necessary steamers. The s s City of Melbourne took the last outward mail, leaving Sydney for Auckland on August 29. The New Zealand Govern- ment, from the nature of the advices it re- ceived by cable via Melbourne looked upon the temporary service as practically at an end and announced that in future all mails both outward and inward would be sent by way of Suez. It was stated at the same time that an agent would be sent to Sydney to confer with the New South Wales Go- vernment with regard to future arrange ments, but New Zealand, it was also stated, would discourage all attempts to renew the temporary contract. The New Zealand commissioner, however, has not yet arrived in Sydney. A number of writs have been issued there against Messrs Hall and Forbes on account of goods supplied to the Californian steamers and at a meoting of Mr Hulls creditors a disposition was shown to take steps for the sequestration of his estate. The first section of the Ballarat and Ararat line-from Ballarat to Beaufort a distance of 28½ miles-was opened for general traffic on the 11th August. There was no public ceremony in connexion with the occasion. The amount of traffic on the new line has been of a satisfactory character. There are now 514 miles of Government railways open for traffic in the colony The unsatisfactory condition of the detec- tive branch of the police force and the necessity for an amendment of the existing system, has recently been brought promi- nently under public notice. Captain Stan- dish chief commissioner of police, has forwarded a report upon the subject to the Premier, in which he attributes the decline of the eiliciency of the force to the fact that several of the most experienced and trust- worthy detectives are now becoming old and unfitted for active work. He admits that the force is not up to the standard of past years and offers as a reason therefor that the pay is too small to attract really capable and intelligent men who are required to fill the places of those who ought to be allowed to retire The subject is likely to be brought under the notice of Parliament. Mr John Carter at the end of this month retires from the office of chief commissioner of titles. Mr. Carter has occupied the posi- tion of chief commissioner for 12 years, and has borne the whole responsibility of carry- ing out the provisions of the Transfer of Lands Statute. The annual dinner of members of the Uni- versities of Oxford and Cambridge took place at Scott's Hotel, Melbourne, on August 20. It being the turn of Cambndge to preside, the chair was occupied by Mr Justice Stephen, Oxford being represented in the vice chair by Mr Hartley Williams. Twenty six gentlemen were present, includnig His Excellency the Governor. The usual matriculation and civil service examination for the July term was begun at the Melbourne University on the 31st ult. The examination was under the immediate supervision of Professor Strong, Mr Pearson, Mr Bride, and Mr Pirani. Of the 117 can- didates 15 were ladies several of whom un- dertook Euclid, the first subject on the time table The majority of candidates appeared to be private students, our large schools send- ng up more towards the end of the year. One gentleman gave as his last place of edu- cation a school at Wisbeach, England. A meeting of the senate of the Melbourne University took place on the 11th August when several matters of importance to the University were discussed. Regulations for a degree in master of surgery were repealed being ultra vires. A statute for the affiliation of Trinity College to the University was after some discussion referred back to the council, with suggestions for amendment. A statute for the Howitt Natural History scho- larships was discussed, but the discussion was adjourned for the production of that por- tion of the late Dr Howitts will on which the statute was based. A motion by Mr Irving- "That, in the opinion of the senate, the holding of a matriculation examination in February is injurious to the University and ought to be discontinued -was carried by a very large majority, after the disadvan- tages attending the examination had been explained at some length. Dr Hearn was re elected warden for 1874-5 without opposi- tion. At its last meeting the committee of the Melbourno Chamber of Commerce bad under consideration the character of the proposed changes in the tariff, and eventually the foi lowing resolution was unanimously adopted \- 1 hat this committee records its deep disappointment at tho character of tho an nouueements made in the Budget speech of the bon the Treasurer in reference to the changes proposed lo be made in the existing tariff. The committee while approving of the partial substitution of fixed duties for duties ad valorem and recognising the trivial relief which will be afforded to trade by the proposed additions to the free list cannot but regret that the most objectionable fea- tures of the tariff are to be rather aggravated than mitigated, and that no concession is made to the more enlightened views on fis- cal legislation which have been manifestly spreading for some time past. The committee once more records its protest against the present system of class legislation which tends to the impoverishment of the many for the advantages of the few while at the same time it cripples trade and creates barriers to the freedom of commercial intercourse even with neighbouring colonies. At the con- ecusion of the business the president of the chamber the Hon D Moore took leave of his colleagues, being on the eve of starting on voyage to Europe. Mr Moore and his family proceed to Venice by the outgoing mail tomorrow. An invitation to a compli- menitary dinner by Ins fellow committeemen and several ex presidents of the chamber had been accepted by Mr Moore, but circum- stances made it necessary to abandon the idea. The injurious effect produced upon wool exported from the colony by the practice of double dumping, introduced last year has led to a meeting of the Melbourne wool shippers, at which it was resolved to abolish the objectionable practice. As an illustration of the evil effect of the practice an instance was cited it the meeting in which a por- tion of a clip which had been double dumped realised from 2d. to 3d.per lb less than the remainder of the clip which had only been dumped in the usual way. Both lots were sold on the same night and were in every respect exactly similar except in the man- ner of dumping, Iho sixteenth annual tonveisa lomof the Tioyal Society of Victoria wits held onAiifcUst /! in the society s hall Victoria street Mel bourne His 1 xcellency tho Governor was pieeent lhere was a largo attendunco of | members of tho Bocioty and lodios Tho president (Mr It L J 1 Uery) in delivonng the annual address, alluded with gratifi cation to the fact that the transactions of | the society up to tho end of 1872 had beon published winch enabled tho society to re uprocate with societies whoso publications had been received for years past The papers read during the last year had caused much more general and animated discucsion than before The president alluded to Mr II S Deverell s papers on Ocean wav e i ovvor Machinery and the interest the subject was exciting among naval architects and nautical men m Europe and America The transit of Venus and the advance ma le in the study of meteorological science and the alvantagos to be derived from the establishment of a council of science occupied the remainder of the presidents address Regarding Mr R S Deverell's experiments with ocean wave power machinery, Mr Ellery in his address at the Royal Society's meeting gave the following information :- Some months ago Mr Deverell devised an apparatus by which the movements of a ship at sea could be registered. This was placed in charge of his brother who went to Eng- land in the ship Norfolk for the purpose of making observations with it on the voyage. from the results of these Mr Deverell de- duced the following - The duration of the voyage was 2,026 hours. During that time the ship made 1,701,088 beam oscillations or rolls, and 1,o41,137 fore and aft oscillations or pitches. Thie average number of oscilla- tiona in both directions per minute was 14. The aggregate ar of pendulum registering beam movements was over 15 million de- grees while that of the fore and aft move ments was nearly five million degrees Mr Deverell also considered he had deli nitely established from these observa tions the following propositions :-1st, That between ocean limits the swell of the ocean is unceasing. 2nd That the oscil- lation of a vessel in an ocean fetch is un- ceasing and that the motion of an inde- pendent body within a ship on the ocean is unceasing. Here then was represented an immense amount of conservable energy and the question remained, "Could a practicable method be found for conserving it for use on board ship?" Mr Deverell believed it could, and to a suflicient extent to be useful in auxiliary propulsion. Mr Deverell expected to be in a position in a few months to detail his method of putting his propositions into practice and promised to bring it before the Royal Society of Victoria as soon as it was matured. Mr Ellery mentioned that Mr Bessemer had purchased from Mr Deverell the instrument the Norfolk voyage observa- tions were made with for his famous saloon ship. This fact had probably led to a report which appeared in print some time ago that Mr Bessemer and the Admiralty were build- ing, ships on Mr Deverellss principle but which was entirely without foundation. The propriety of renewing the attempt to acclimatise the salmon is again under con sideration It has been suggested that the California salmon might be introduced into Australia with better chance of success than the European variety as a much shorter period would be occupied in transport and some correspondence has already taken place between the council of the Zoological and Acclimatisation Society of Victoria and the Acclimatising Society of San 1 rancisco The Victorian society is now awaiting further information not only as to seasons at which ova is availablo but as to the means of transport the heavy cost of which forms one of the principal difficulties A tenerous offer has been made in the matter by Mr Samuel Wilson who has intimated that if the council will undertake the task he will place the sum of £1 000 at its disposal for the purpose An adjourned meeting of the delegates ap pointed by the Melbourne City Council and the vanous suburban bodies to consider the report prepared by a committee previously appointed with regard to the establishment of a Metropolitan Board of NVorks, was held at the Town hall on August 31 The meet ing had been adjourned from the 31st July in order that some delegates who had not been fully instructed by the councils thoy re presented might be prepared to act definitely with regard to the proposal Councillor Gatehouse presided At the previous meet ing the necessity for tho foi ma tion of such a board had been affirmed and it was now agreed with comparatively little discussion that the board should have the control of main drainage water supply gas road tolls and tramways throughout the metropolitan area the extent of which is yet to be de cid ed The subscribers of the Art Union of Victoria met at the Victorian Ycademy of Arts Melbourne on August 21 Mr li Twentyman occupied the chair A report was read by Mr R 1 NN allon of an en courapmg nature The Art Union of Vic tona in its first effort did not attempt any thing more ambitious than to give the chance of a prize in the annual drawing 1 arly in the present season an arrangement was entered into with the members of the Vic tonan Academy of Arts as the result of which the committee was enabled to present to every subscriber of a guinea a set of six I photographs from design«, made expressly by members of the academy and the copyright of which belonged to the society The cost to the Art-Union had been so moderate that the committee was in a position to devote a large sum to expenditure upon prizes A schedule of prizes had been arranged under which each winner might select for himself from the vvallB of the Academy any works of art thero exhibited (not already sold) of the value of such prize or he might give a commission to any artist who was an exhibitor up to the value of his prize the prize being m all cases poid to the artist direct by the hon treasurer of the Art Union At the date of the last drawing the Art Union of Victoria consisted of 193 mern beis, now the members number 697 Then £115 3s was apoortioned to prizes This year in addition to the presentation portfolio of photogrophs 38 prizes would be distri buted to the value of £38810s The drawing of the prizes afterwards took place 1 he first prize of 50 guineas fell toi M de Molo of Adelaide Ihe second prize of 30 guineas went to r II Wilson of Sydney His Lx cellency Mi A Musgrave Governor of South Australia obtained the third prize, of 2o guineas NN ith reference to a new Melbourne bishop and the bishopric of Ballarat tho Ballarat Star wnteB -

Several days before the piece was produced the Herald published a para- graph stating that the piece the manage- ment intended to "mutilate ' was the "Prin- cess of Trebizonde " For this the plain- tiffs claimed damages. The defendants pleaded justification, inasmuch as the names of the actors who were to take parts in the piece were known, and the writer was satís- fied that they could not perform the parts satisfactorily, and that a good deal of the music was to be excised. Iheieplyto this was that no opera was ever produced as the composer wrote it, that the original opera could not be put on the English stage with propriety, that the opera as per formed was tho same as that produced at the Gaiety Theatre, London, and the management never intended to produce it m any other shape, and that the music was as sung at the Gaiety It was, besides, contended that a paper had no right to condemn a performance by autlci pation Thore was another ground of com plaint by the management as to a letter published in the Herald, alleging that they encouraged indecent dances on the stage The jury pave the plaintiffs a verdict with a farthing damages on each count An action has lately been tried in the Su preme Court, in which the character of an attorney, a former member of the Legisla- ture, and an ex-Minister of the Crown, was involved Mr James M'Kean, the attorney in question, had acted for the defendant in the case of The Queen v A R. Green charged with murder The Crown contributed 14 guineas towards the defence, the charge being a capital one The trial took place in May last. The witnesses called for the de j fence wero to be paid by the Crown A list , of tho witnesses was presented to the judge (Mr Justice FellowB) for Ina certificate but he refused to sign it without a certificate ! from Bome official in the Crown Law depart- ment This certificate was obtained, and the judge then signed it According to the statement made by Mr Neely, a clerk in the Law offices who has to ceitify for the pay- ment of witnesses' expenses Mr M Kean added his name as a wilness after the judge signed the order Neely having made this statement in the presence of a third person, M Kean brought an action for slander against him. The Government undeitook tbo defence of their officer Mr M'Kean asserted positively that bia name was on the list beforo the judge signed it, but this was denied by Mr Neely and by Mr Morrell, the clerk who had signed the certifi- cate in the first instance 1 here were some persoiiB present at the time the occurrence was said to have taken place, but their evidence was not very satisfactory. Several microscopists who examined the document swore that M'Kean s ñamo must have been written before Morrell s inasmuch as part of the latter s name was abovo M Kean's The jury gave a verdict for the defendant Mr. M Kean afterwards applied to the full Court for anew trial, hut the Court on Saturday re- fused the application The annual ball in aid of the funds of the Melbourne Hospital was held in the Town hall on the night of the 17th August. The company, which numbered about 500, in- cluded His Excellency and Lady Bowen. A slight shock of an earthquake occurred on Sunday evening, August 30, about one or two minutes past 7, accompanied by a noise like the roll of a heavy vehicle on a metalled road. It was felt in several places about Melbourne and Richmond, at St. Kilda, Brighton, and in the Harkaway Ranges, near Berwick. Mr Henry Bowden, of the firm of Messrs W P. White and Co, died on the 11th August, at his residence, Cleveland house, Hinders street, Melbourne Previous to his connexion with the shipping interest Mr Bowden had been a writer on the Melbourne press and in 1851 5, when the Melbourne Moi n xng Heiald was a jou- nal of influence, ho was one of its regular contributors For some time past Mr Bowden had been m failing health, but the end came atlast rather suddenly He died in the prime of life, his ago being only 44 On the 22nd ult, Captain Lindsay, a very old and much esteemed colonist died some- what suddenly at the residence of his son-in- law, the hon William Wilson, East St. Kilda. Captain Lindsay originally came out to Sydney in the year 1823, in the ship Asia, commanded by his father. He was then only 10 years of age, but the Rangoon war breaking out shortly afterwards, and the Asia having been chartered to take troops there, he volunteered to proceed with the expedition. He returned to Sydney in 1828 and was then whaling in the South Seas and off the coast of Tasmania and New Zealand for three years, when he again re- turned to Sydney, and went home to Eng- land as mate of the Glenburnie. Upon his return to the colonies about 18 months subsequently, he again took to whaling, in which he was very successful and was enabled to purchase a ship of his own. He tried round the whole of the southern coast of Australia, and was in many ports which are now flourishing places, long before any white settler put his foot there. When the diggings broke out in 1851, he found it impossible to keep his seamen, and consequently he followed the prevailing fashion-laid up his vessel, and with some companions started for the Forest Creek diggings. He remained there for about 12 months, and was on the whole pretty successful but getting tired of shore work, he again proceeded on a whaling cruise. He was again successful, and gradually acquired more than one vessel, in which he engaged in the coasting trade. A few years since he gave up the active practice of his profession, and invested his money in station property, and at the time of his death he was owner of the Glencoe Station in South Australia, and a large tract of country on the Paroo River, in New South Wales Surprise has been caused by the neglect of a duty on the part of the Government in taking no steps to reward Mr. Densley, the hero of the recent tragical encounter at Bal- Ian. Densley, unarmed grappled with a bushranger, wrested from him first a revolver and then a knife and at last overpowered him, but not before he had sustained serious injuries.. The bushranger was ultimately shot by a companion of Densley named Thompson who had stood aloof during the struggle. In the fight Densley was stabbed repeatedly, once close to the spine and it is now reported that he "still suffers greatly from his back. The wound healed up too quickly and had to be re-opened. Mr. Densley thinks he will have to get one of his fingers amputated as it sticks straight out and is continually in the way. It will take some considerable time yet before he thoroughly recovers. A testimonial in his favour has been subscribed at Ballan and the inhabitants at a public meeting resolved that Mi Densley s conduct should be for- mally brought under the notice of the Go- vernment and recommended for substantial recognition. During the last month several large ship- ments of horses have been made for the In- dian market. The ship Udston took away 276 horses, shipped by Messrs Martin and Vanrennan. These horses were all bred by Mr Martin of GippsLand.They are mostly by thoroughbred horses. Messrs Kavanah and Rutherford shipped 100 useful horses by the Apelles. On the 27th August Messrs Warren and Lalor shipped 161 horses by the ship James Nicol Fleming for Calcutta. A great deal of interest is taken in this shipment alike by horse breeders and Indian dealers Messrs NN nrren and Lalor havo spared neither ¿uno | nor expense in selecting thom, and it waa generad) acknowledged to bo the finest and most even lot of hores that ever left Vic tona The result of this shipment will show if it will pay to breed a superior stamp of horse for the Indian market. Seventy four of these horses were bred by Mr E.M. Bagot, of South Australia. They are from four to six years old, and are by Faxiocious out of strong well bred mares Some of them are well suited for carriage or artillery purposes, or would make fine weight earning hacks. 'TYwo pairs of beautifully matched brown and one pair of bay carriage horseB were v cry much admired Of the others GO were bred by Mr JaincB Tyson, of the Lachlan They are all fine well formed horses, of good bone and substance, 15 are of different brands, in- cluding pairs of grey, brown chestnut, and bay carnage lioises There aro also 10 thoroughbred horses from the stud of Mr NNm Pearson Kilmany park Gipps Land Among them aro Discontent and Vampire, and all are in the stud-book The Beaufort waterworks were formally opened on tbo 11th ult. They have been constructed for the purpose of supplying Beaufort and the railway with water ob tained from Mount Cole, which is about 3,000ft above the level of the sea. The re servoir will contain about one million gallons of water, and to give it this capacity it was necessary to blast 1,100 yards of rock. The cost of the works up to the present time is about £3,000, and it will require about £300 more to complete them. Mr Alex Reid s dour mills, on the Mount Cohteroad, nearGeelong have been destroyed by fire 1 he loss is estimated at £3 500, of which £1 COO ia covered by insurance viz , £1,000 in the National Company, and £500 in the Norwich At Stockyard Creek, live buildings, vi/ , SimmonBS blacksmith shop, M Carthy and Brown's store, M'Phersons drapery establishment, Sparkes' Union Hotel, and JoneB s butcher's Buophave been destrojed by fire A brutal murder has taken place in the Tubba Rubba ranges, near Schnapper Point An old man named John Moriarty, an old servant of Mr Rennison, of the Mornington Hotel, who was known to have £50 in his pos- ssesion, was missed, and after the lapse of a few days was found dead in the bush. The appearance of the body showed that the deceased had been stunned by a blow on the back of the head and then crushed to death The cause of death was internal haemorrhage, the result of rupture of one of the principal blood vessels, produced by great pressure applied to the chest, probably by the knee of the murderer. The breaat-bone was broken, and the chest was full of blood. A man named Shanahan, a mate of the deceased, is in custody on suspicion. A shocking accident has occurred in the No 1 shaft of the Prince of Wales Com pany, Ballarat. Shortly after the relief of the 4 o'clock shift, two miners, named Wil- liam Sims and Thomas Hartley, were sud denly thrown down by a fall of earth in the drive Hartley was killed at once, and Sims was buried further up the drive , when re- covered he was quite dead. Both men leave wives and families. In the Yankee Tribute Alluvial Company's claim, Clunes, a young man named James Roberts was engaged in trucking, when a large quantity of earth fell on him, crushing him to death. POLITICAL The vote of want of confidence in the Ministry, tabled in the Legislative Assembly at the departure of the laßt mad, was moved on August 11, and after two nights' debate was negatived without a division. Some progress has since Leen mado with public business The Local Government Bill-a moat important measure, and one urgently required by the country-has paesed its second reading, and is now under considera* tion in committee Mr, James Service (the Treasurer) and Mr MncDermott (the Soli- citor General) were returned without oppo- sition, and Mr Ramsay (the Postmaster General) was re elected by a large majority over his opponent, Mr M Cormick, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT. The Treasurer (Mr. Service) made his financial statement on Thursday, August 27. He stated that the gross revenue for 1873 and 1874 was £4 317,030, showing an increase on Mr Langton's estimate of ¿141,752, whilst the total expenditure was £4,177,202, or an increase on the estimated expenditure of £5 674 The principal increases were spirits, £23 290 , wine, £5,247 , sugar, £18,024 , rice, £6,309, ad valorem duties, £51292, wharfage rates, £8,873; alienation of lands by lease and licences, £09,373, and railway income, £80.425, whilst the principal decreases wero on '' all other articles," £15 b2», sales of land by auction, £105,149, and postage, £5,193 'J he total increases on the Estimates wero £334 758 and the total decreases £153 484, making the net increaco in the revenue in excess of the estmiato, £181274 The esti- mated expenditure for 1874 75 was £4 478.0S0, being an increase on the actual expenditure for the preceding year of £300 818, and on the expenditure authorised by Paihament, which »as £4 47.,713~of £0,307. This m creoeed expenditure was largely duo to spécial appropriations and interest on Joans the ordinary estimated expenditure being £02,900 less than was lust year voted by Purlin mont Hie estimated revenue for 1874 75 was £4,259,135 To this had to be added balance from 1873 74, £170,308, recoups £75,079, and the amount due from other Governments on account of steam postal communication, £10,000, making a total íevenuo of £4,515182, showing a balance to be corned over to 1875 70 of £37,102 Coming to the form under which the accounts weie now presented, aud winch was introduced by h's predececBor, he main tamed that it did not render the financial accounts for the year any plainer than tho old s)8tem The balance brought down to the credit of the current year was not m the banks at the commencement of the year, nor could bon members deal with it That and more was due to the contractors undoi the Go- vernment Thus the liabilities brought over from 1872 73 to 1873 74 amounted to £211,510, and the liabilities incurred on behalf of 1873 74, which bad to be met during the currontyeai, amounted altogetherto £329,039 The debts on tho 1st July remained just as the) vvere on the 30th Juno, but there was this diflerence between tho old and the now bj stem Under the old the Treasurer on the 1st of July and subsequently could pay these debts, under the now ho could not until tho necessary amounts woro revoted by Parlia- ment This was found to ho vory incon- venient both to tho Government and to the public Hie new system also had tho disad- vantage that tho rush on the Treasury which eiiBiied towards the end of the financial year had the effect of greatly reducing the cash balance at the 'lreaaurei a disposal, which wa» paiticulnrly inconvenient because tho consolidated rcvenuo was often drawn on on account of loans 'Iho s)Btem not only con fuecd tho accounts, but actually londered them mm curate since in order to lessen tho dillicultiCB tindei which contr ictora laboured li) Hie sudden closing of the national ledger on i poiticulor da) tho bouda of dei ai tinenta proem ed advances from tho 'luoBiiry in older to meet payments not then due, but which would bo duo shoitl) afteivvards Hie under treasurer liad BUL.c.cBtcu' a nudillo couiso between tho two ono3ito s)8touiB and that was that tlic votes Bhould bo kept open foi six niiiitiiB after tho conclusion of the )oar Ihe lion malibu then pioceciled to explain the changes winch tbo Governmont proposed to make m the toni) The c1iuii¡,ob wero not specially dictated hy Ina views on liacal polity Ho know that in a dcinociivtic lountiy tho majority muBt lulo, and ho had kopt that fnct in mind Ho found, and accopted tho position, that the country had doteiininod to continue for a timo tbo policy of piotec tion to native industry It was, honovor, admitted that many duties woro now imposed winch were not protective, but simply voxtt tiouB lind irritating, and that objection to the present tariff no liad endeavoured to remove. Goods tho impoits of which amounted to £500 000 per annum and the duty upon which was last year £70 127, it was proposed to take from the ad valorem list, and to impose upon them instead fixed duties which would bring in to the revenuo a similar amount Upon certain soft goods materials m piece and metal ware tho annual impoitb of which amounted to £ Iib oSo mid the tluty collected to £43 158 it waa proposed to remit the imposts altogether, and to redtico tho duty on earthenware-not brown ware-from 20 i er cent to 10 nor cent Tho number of a eaupon winch duties wero remitted was auüut 1 000 Certain manufactured metal goods were transfened from the 10 per cent list to the 20 per cent Tho net result of the operations would show a lo.»s to the revenuo of £17 000 but as it was not proposed to îemit the duties until the 1st of January next, the net loss to the revenue for tho year would be about £25 000 To meet to somo extont this loss it was proposed to mcreaso the duty on wine to 6s per gallon on sparkling w inc and 4s per gallon on other nine The revenue from tins increase for the 10 months of the present financial year woidd, ho esti mated, ho about £11 000 These were tho changes ho proposed It would ho seen that he had not dealt with tho incidence of taxa tion and he had admitted that ho had boon guided not so much bj what was desirable as by what was possible The public debt Btood on the 30th of June last at £12 520 432 the amount actually received from loaiiB was £12 G9S.381 and actually expended £12 674 101 leaving a balance of £123 890 The amount of interest paid for tho year was £709 000 or a fraction ovei 5a pel cent Tho amount vi Inch the consolidated revenuo had to contribute towards the payment of tho in terest on tho railway loan o\ er and above the net railway income had decroascd from over £300 000 in 1871 to £158 788 last year the actual decrease being £152|U13 Ile looked forward to no distant period when the not railway income would of itself be sufficient to meet tho whole of tho interest duo on tho money borrowed to construct them The bon member went on to show the valuable nature of the national property and tho public landed estate with the vieyv of Bhovv ing the perfectly solvent and satisfactory position of the country Mr Langton contended that tho objec tions which the lrcasurer had urged against tho new system of keeping the national ac counts applied with equal forco to the old and pointed out that the system now in forco in the colony was the same as that followed in the United Kingdom The debate was adjourned, on the motion of Sir James M Culloch until September 1 The House then went into committee on certain Customs duties, and a resolution enabling the Commissioner of Customs to tako the necessary steps for the protection of tbo revenue was passed On Tuesday, faoptember 1, the debato on the Budget was resumed by Sir James M Culloch, who condomned tho altciation made m the system of keeping the public accounts by the late Treasurer (Mr Langton), and then proceeded to call attcn tion to the large increase-in round numbers £1,000 000 Bterlint- which had taken place durnij, the last three years in the expenditure of the country Even allowing for tho in creased coBt of the new educational system and the extra expenditure upon account of railwnys thero wns still an mcreaso of over £o00 000 in the sov eral departments which should not be allowed to pass without challenge Ho contended that the countiy could not afford to go on adding to its expenditure in the way it had been doing Ho believed tho Treasurer had over estimated his lovenuo for the current year and that instead of having at the end of the period a balance of some £34 000 he would bo considerably in debt Had the accounts been kept under the old system thero would have been a debit instead of a credit balanco at the commencement of the present year because there would hove boen the liabilities for the present year to be provided for instead of being revoten and enarged to the current twelvemonths The Government and tho House would be forced ere long to readjust the Bystem of taxation, to equalise tho burdens of the people for it was too much to draw from the people through the Customs £1,700 000 per annum Lvou at the risk of losing their seats, the Government ought to havo given full effect to their own views upon thiB important subject Instead of doing this the Treasuroi was admittodly carrying out protectiv o views which he did not behev e in A property tax m Boino form or other must soon be imposed Mr Gillies in reply pointed out that the increases in the various departments were easily susceptible of explanation, and con tended that the real question for members to consider was not had tho public oxpendi turo increased from £3 000 000 to i 1500 000 but did the necessities of the public service require the increased expenditure ' and that question he uiihcsilatiucl) answered m the aflirmative Ho defended tho alterations proposed to be mado m tho tariff agaiu stating that they vi ero mado ii respectivo cither of fiee trado oi protectivo principles and solely with the idea of relieving trado from imposts which w ore not protective, hut simply vexatious and irritating Tho Go vernment nns he arfeuod not justified in undertaking during tho procont session tho re aiiangoment of the incidence of taxation for they could not hav e done so with any probabiht) of success Mr Berry sarcastically complimented tho Government on having changed their viows with regard to protection Ho could not be heve the present Government had sunk so low as to administer a policy which thoy believed was unjust, iniquitous and luiuing tho colony, and therefore ho considered their present action a confession that thoy had changed then viowb with regard to tho policy thoy formerly denounced As it was proposed to expend duimg tho current yeal £200 000 more than the revenue to bo de rived from the ord mai j sources of income ho thought it would he imprudent in any way to reduce the Customs duties Mr Cohen expressed his conviction that the estimate of revenue would bo fully realised and that the remission of duties | would prove most advantageous to tho in dust nea of the colony Mr Higinbotham supported the position of the Government, and expressed a hopo that soon some sjstem of direct taxation would ho established whereby proporty Bhould bear something like a fair pioportion of the public burdens Mr Langton, the late Treasurer in the most brilliant Bpcech dohvorod m the courso of tho debato cnticiBod tho financial stato nient of tho Treasurer Aftoi justifying the couisobehad taken m altering tho B)stem of keeping the ptibho accounts, ho remarked that he did not share in any apprehension that tho estimates of revenue would not bo realised Tho present prospenty of the colony was due to tho nnprecedentedly good seasons lately experienced, the consequent large clips of wool and tbo catisfactory price of wool in tho I ondon market Iho present season bade fair to bo quito as good as the last mid as no wero paid foi tho wool in goods the cstimato of Cualoma dutiea was, ho thought, sure to ho realised Ho certainly, also had no fears ro lntivo to the expenditure Iho revenue could not ho reduced stn o by tho reduction of Customs duties to which a number of bon

Riverina. He came to Mel. bourne with the object of seeing his daughter who is married to the Presbyterian mininster at Ballan. The residents of Deniliquin and Hay were however anxious that he should visit their district and Mr Parkes ultimately consented to do so. Hle left Melbourne for Echuca by special train on Wednesday, August 26 and on the fol- lowing evening was entertained at dinner at the Royal Hotel Deniliquin by about 80 gentlemen interested in pastoral and agricultural pursuits. In thanking the com- pany for the manner in which his health had been drunk Mr Parkes spoke at some length on various topics of local more than general importance.

Immediately after the collision Bhouts vvere heard from the men-" For God a sake save ua , ' and vanous people on board the Oak- worth hove ropes to them , but they seemed to hare been too short, and the men lloated by Some of the crew of the Oakworth rushed to the boat which was on the deck- house, and put it out on the weather side, some coils of rope preventing her being tot out on the proper side The plug waB actually in the boat but it was not noticed, and some men went hurrying about trying to get one The moment the boat was got out three men got into it, one of whom put his finget in the plug hole The second mate said he would go m the boat, bul was waiting foi another oai and rowlock, the Bhip meanwhile having been brought up to the wind The boat had been dragged along abreast for about five minutes when the main yard was laid aback Cries were heard for 10 or 15 minutes after the collision, and people were seen floating by on spars The second mate went aft to the captain to ask what was to be done and received orders to bring the boat round and hoist it up-the captain saying it was too late to do any thing as all the men must by that time be drowned The boat waB accordingly hoisted up, the sails filled, and the vessel went on bei course It appeared that the weather was only a little lnzv that there waB but little sea on and nothing to render it dangerous for the boat to go to the rescue, but it was stopped by order of the captain The veBsel could easily have been put about, as that had been done at midnight pre viouBly and was done the following morn ung, and it was the failure to aflord such assistance as was practicable and necessary which rendered the captain amenable for the collision The reply made by the defendant was, that hearing a noise on deck about 4am, and a cry of " Hard up " he jumped out of faed un dressed, and looking over the port quarter saw that they had struck a boat He remained a few minutes until he saw the result, and heard voices calling out Oh, oh," and hove a rope to the assistance of the men Ordered the helm to be put haTd down Ran through the saloon on to tho main deck, and called out to back the mainyard After he had dresBed he still watched if he could see or hear anyone, and only a short time had elapsed when he heard the men call out from a boat alongside Know ing the danger they were in, the ooat knocking against the side, he called to the second mate to take it round, and he did so, with the painter m his hand, and when he came after defendant asked bim why he was not away, and he enid they wanted an oar The boat was then taken up on the lee side, and at least seven minutes elapsed before he left his place Vi hen the second officer asked him what he should do he said, seeing that such a time had elapsed, " It is no use going now, the men will be drowned ' A south west wind was blowing, the morning was dark, rainy, and haz), when he ordered the boat to be taken up The men knew the danger as well as hirriBelf, and he believed, had he sent the boat away, it would never have reached the ship again The ship was drifting with the breeze at the rate of a mile or a mile and a half an hour T here w ere other lights about, and he was so afraid of having another collision that he ordered the mainyard to he filled and kept the ship out between the boats intending as soon as it was light and clear to go back atom This they were not able to do ni consequence of the state of the weather till 8 o clock There were but few bands m the ship and those he had were not the best men He had been 30 years nt sea, l8 of which he had been master, and this was the first collision he had had He loat his presence of mind, and the power of speech seemed to lose lum altogether, just the same as it might be w ith any of the jury, if the) were sudden)) roused from sleep by the cr) of fire If he had acted wrongly it was an error of judgment and he had not meant to do anythmt wilfully Mr Justice Tellow s in summing up cau- tioned the july atainst being led awa) by any preconceived opinions which they might have foimed from what had occurred elBevvhere, mid atainst any feeling of commiseration foi the unfortunate eufleieis by the accident They had to deni with a plain act of Parlia nient and it w is a rule of interpretation, illhcnble to nil penal laws laid down by lord lenterden, and described hy Lord Alinger as sound ind the only one con- sistent with our free institutions-that they must he construed strictly If the Legisla ture lina not hit whit it intended, the remedy is another act of Parliament and not n forced construction of tbe existing one The hist Merchnnt Shipping Act (30 mid i7 Viet c 85 Bec 1( ), on w Inch tina in foimntion was based, required the master, in case of collision to render to the crew of the other vessel-if and so far ob he could do so without dun ger to his own vessel or crew-snell nsaistance as niif,ht be practicable and ne eesenry to save them If he failed to do so without reasonable cause he committed an ofience The enactment had not yet been in force 10 months and wo had therefore no I lifchsh authority to tuide us in its inter pretntion The offence wna n newly created one and acting on the iule of interpretation to which he lind referred, ho must tell them that before they could convict they must bo satisfied that it was practicable to save one at least of the wrecked crew Tho offence consisted in omitting to do Romething w Inch if done would have been m all human pro babihty attended with success It was prac ticahle, no doubt to search, hut waB it prac ticahlc to sav o ' The jury therefore had to consider four questions-firet whethor the defendant could have sent the boat away without danter to his vessel, crew, and pas Btnters ' second, waa it pmcticablo' third was it necessary ' and fourth, was there any reasonable cause for not sending it away ' Tho last question assumed that the first three were answered in the affirmative and it w ould be well to dispose of that at tho outBct As to the want ot a plug, oars, and rowlocks, that was no excuso, because under another act all these things should havo been ready, and the defendant could not take advantage of his own wrong There was no other excuse suggested, so that if thev should find affirmatively on the first three questions there was no evidence what- ever to justify their doing so on the fourth With regard to the first question, he could not gather that there would have been any danger to the ship m its being hove to or kept under small canvas, for she would not, according to the evidence, have drifted moro than two miles an hour She was at leaBt 20 miles from the nearest part of the Irish coast and it was at the most only two hours and a half to day break It was for them to sa) was there any such danger As to the necessity of sending the boat there could not be much doubt about that It vv ia the only means available and was therefore necessar) But the chief and most important question re monied Was it practicable ' Could they fay that the attempt would have succeeded » Assist mice would not have been rendered by a fruitless search Ab to the crew rushing to the boat, that was no evidence of the I practicability of the assistance The jury must he satisfied that if the) had gone they iv ould at least hav e sav ed one man It might hav e been heartless not allow ing the boat to to but that was not the question The ques lion was could one man have been saved ' If not, it was not practicable The jur) retired After being locked up for five mmutes, they returned a verdict of "Not guilty." ARTHUR ORTON The following letter, from Sir Alfred Stephen, late Chief Justice of New South Wales, in which Arthur Orton and the claimant to the Tichborne estates are iden tilled as the same person, appeared m the Sydney Mormng Herald of Friday, August 28 - ' Sir,-The all but interminable Tichborne case having so many months ago come to its expected end, and the huge im postor who figured in it met at last the fate which he so amply earned, we might be well content to dismiss him and the subject from our minds-with all the reilections, sage or commonplace to which it gives rise-were it not that the infatuation of some supporters of his appears still to con- tinue, exhibiting itself in the recent actual announcement, if the news from Victoria be correct, of an advertised large reward for the discov cry of Arthur Orton It is a rash offer, for the man sought for will assuredly be íeadily found at Millbank or at Portland I take up my pen, offering you that which fol- lows, scarcely in the hope of enlightening the wilfully blind, and ceitamly not in presump luous nvalry, with that maBter hand which hassoskilfully and vvithmore than anatomical minuteness laid bare the monstrous impos ture, but because I have something even yet to add to the overwhelming evidence, and be- cause I am one of those who-in the earlier stages of the investigation, with imperfect knowledge of the facts-was perplexed by the startling ev idences of the claimant's identity the passionately declared recognition of him by the widowed mother, and his own apparent recollection of incidents in the son's histoiy, bo small as in all probability to bavo been remembered b) that son alone The explanation of these difficulties in the case has long since been afforded , and, if doubts at some time possibly expressed by me have tended in any degree to maintain the delusion in this colon) or elsewhere; under which it is said that half England until of late laboured, I hope that this paper will be accepted as my recantation and apology "Whether the Millbank convict be Roger Tichborne or Arthur Orton, confessedly two diBtinct and very different persons, he is un questionably the Belt named Thomas Castro, the Wagga Wagga horsebreakerand butcher, if not also cattle stenier and bushranger Tor the reasons which follow I hold him to be Arthur Orton, and think the fact bo con clnsively established by them as to defy scepticism in any sane mind To an honest seeker after the truth, it appears to me that phjeical demonstration could not be more decisive There was, indeed, evidence of certain marks on Orton's person which cer tamly Castro bad not, and there were wit nesses in abundance disputing the identity of the latter with Orton, or asserting that of Castro with Tichborne I have alluded to other difficulties, but the obstacles which oppose belief in the last supposition, and the circumstances uniformly tending to establish the oneness of Castro and Orton, are too strong to be resiBted In effect the ques non of identification m each ease, although we may separately consider them, is the same ' Arthur Orton was born m 1834 the son of a butchervat Wappmg, in London In 1818 being then 14 or thereabouts Orton went as a cabin boy or sailor to Valparaiso The ship's hooks register him as having no markB on Ins peiBon He had, in early youth, how- ever, been afflicted with St Vitus's dance Both fads as we shall see become eventu- ally of Borne importance He deserted the vessel, and reached the town of Mehpella, where be remained under the namo of Orton, about two )ears In 1850 or 1851 Orton returned to Wappmg, sailing from Valparaiso in a vessel called the Jessie Miller-a fact also matenal for us to notice At Wapping he courts one Mary Ann Loder, with whom he afterwards corresponded At the late ti lal she swore to Castro ob being the man In 1852 Orton sailed for Hobart Town, and there remained until 1855, when he crossed over to the sister colony, and entered the service of the late Mr Poster, in Gipps Land With that gentleman, or with Mr Johnson, at Sale, in the same district, he 8ta)ed until 1858 Up to the latter vear he was known as Arthur Orton only His emplo) menta were butchering and horse breaking , and at Wagga Wagga, where he arrived in or about 1859, be engaged in the same pursuits At that town Orton assumed the name of Castro , and in New South Wales, until his extraordinary claim to that of Tichborne in 186G, he was known by no other But Mr rosters widow recognised lum at the tnal as beyond all doubt her ser- vant Orton , and a Mr Hopwood, who knew him at Sale under the latter name.saw Castro ut Wogga Wragga in 1864, and addressed him there as Orton "In Gipps Land Orton had spoken of hiB Father as a butcher, although he added some- thing about bia being a great man And in W agga Wogga, in 1805, Castro not only told a resident there, whose statement to me is annexed, that his (Castros) father kept a butcher's shop, but that

termination of the defence I had heard that persons m the town knew, or had sufficient grounds for concluding, who Castro really was and on my mentioning this to my friend Mr Baylis the police magistrate he introduced Mr Stewart to me The result was, after what I am afraid must have looked like a cross examination, the latter's delivery to me of a paper on the following day, con taming the statement in question I sent that paper with a note from Mr Baylis, to a friend in England , but I have procured from Wogga Wagga the accompanying copy and note, both of which are published by the

whose place of business was directly opposite the butcher s shop of Castro I used to deal with him One afternoon, not being very busy, I went across to his shop and remarked to him that he had one or ¿wo nice joints left that day He replied, 'Yes Mr Stewart, I have I wns not brought up a butcher, but my father bad a large butchers shop at home, but I did not like the business At the same time I ought to be a good judge of meat as I was a Government inspector of meat in one of the victualling yards After a few more words of conversation Castro asked me if I was from the old country ' I

GOLD AND THE GOLD TIELDS The mining industry has continued during the last month in the quiet state into which it has lapsed for some time past, no new discoveries of quartz reefs or fresh alluvial diggings having been recorded to restore the interest of the public and especially of in v estois of capital m mining property Work is however, steadily pursued in the large number of minea opened out in the colony and judgint from the moat authentic atate menta published with ordinary profitable results in gold )ielding mines Prospecting in quartz claims is also carried on to a large extent and there is no doubt from the dimensions which quart mmint has already nssumed, together with its profitable nature -by far the laitest part of the told being now obtained from qjart/ reefs-that it july requires the discoveries of a few neyv quart? reefs oi improvements in the qualities of those airead) yielding told to create such a reaction in favour of tina branch of industry aa will lead to the

well known numil), ínveetoi and employer of mining labour having been for some timo past in leceq t of an income which is estimated not to f ill fur short of ti 000 a day During the yema 1870 1 ¿ some very larto returns wore obtained nt different times from individual mines at Sandhurst and the total yield of the district waB considerably increnaed thereby but of late with tho exception per liai a ot the claim of the Garden Gully United Corop my, the returns have not been par ticularly heavy from any mine It is therefore exceedingly gratifying to notice that the yield of gold is kept up at the present time to the same extent as it was last year because that can only have occurred through there being more paying mines at work now, or through the claims which )ield the gold having improved in quality It is also a matter of congratula tion from the fact that when there aie so many paying mines in work it is almost certain that one or moro of them will soon meet with extraordinary nch runs of gold in then quartz, such as have been met with ia other claims previously and when such yields are added to the piesent very respect able returns of the diBtnct the total will be higher than any that has yet been recorded Ihe favourable impression which has existed for some lune in favour of the shares m Pleasant Cieek mmea continues and the attention of investors and dealers in minint stock is in a great measure centred on Sand hurst and Pleasant Creek property the ex pectation being that befoie long a good nura ber of the prospective mines in those districts will be converted into dividend pa)ing concerns m which case the investors will soon be repaid their outlay providing the gold obtained is equal in quantity to what is yielded by many of the paying claims now being worked in the districts In Bal larat Last the quaitz miners continue to lind some good payable stone and the impreB sion is held by many people that the Ballarat diBtnct will yet prove as nch in quartz gold ob it has done in alluvial Alluvial mining is however very dull on Ballarat and ap i ears lil ely to continue so unless the W inter s 1 reehold or some of the other large companies who are prospecting new ground can find fresh runs of alluvial reef wash Hie shares of the Winters Preehold Com nany which some time ago vv ere quoted as high ob £r>0 each, have fallen very low, the latest quoted selling price being £8 A nugget of gold weighing lloz 4dwt was picked up in Macarthur street a few days ago the Ballarat Star reports the fortu nate finder being as is usually the case, a poor working man The discoveiy was rather singular It appeared that he was weanng a pair of almost soleless boots and while walking along the street felt a hard BubBtance pressing againBt the bottom of Iiib foot Looking down to ascertain if the cause was a sharp pointed stone he saw the point of the nugget sticking out of the ground and soon unearthed it. The queBtion of whether or not quarts reefs will be found profitable at any consider able depth from the surface of the ground is still occupying public attention Amongst the miners and lesidents on the gold fields there is a settled belief that quart/, lodes may be worked to almost any depth and that what is being done now is a mere scratching comparatively of the surface Indeed the converse of the old theories that quortz veins are mere shallow wedges of stone is widely entertained, and confi dent assertions are made that the miner has only to sink deeper to get richer quartz On the other hand there are still to be found many who maintain that quartz lodes are chiefly gold beanng at or near the sur face, and that as great depths are reached the gold will be found to nearly, if not quite disappear Between these two classes of positive phdosophers there is another class not of a negative character exactly, but which asserts Btoutly that with all the work done here and elsewhere there is not suffi cient evidence to warrant any positive state ment as to the formation of the lodes them selves or the distnbution of gold in them There is, undoubtedly, a great deal of evi dence which goes to prove that quartz lodes become poorer m gold as comparatively great depths are reached Anyone familiar with the mining history or the colony can readily recall a large number of quart.' claims which were nch on the surface or at a short distance from it which have been long since abandoned as unprofitable Even dis tncts once famous have been almost deserted by the quartz miner and the thud of the stampers is no longer heard To these facts some persons reply that the lodes were deserted because the shoot of gold had been worked out and the mineowners had either not sufficient capital or faith to venture upon the deadwork of sinking and driving in search of it In some probably in many, cases this is nn accurate explanation of the facts, but there are many also to which the reply is not relevant the simple truth being, that the claims were left because there was no hope that they could be made to pay On the other side there is also an array of facts of a very instructive character When the Gold fields Commission took evidence at Sandhurst 11 years ago some of the richest claimbolders were most positive in affirming that the lodes would not pay below the water level say abc it 100ft. and the commission reported against the proba biht) of gold being found at great depths in quartz reefs At Sandhurst this view has been proved1 to be altogether wrong Though there was a pause there after the commission reported in the progress of quartz mining for a time consequent chiefly upon the water level having been reached it is now notorious that the e was a revival and at this day he would be ii'ij bold man who would venture to place any limit upon the depth at which the lodes there will be found to be profitable rthe North Old Chum Company Sandhurst have got a fine

in the lower levels and the )iclds of late have fallen very low In Ballarat there are one or two examples of deep lodes which ure exciting some interest amongst those who have studied the question of the depths at which quartz reefs maybe considered to )ield told In the Beechworth district a depth of oOOft has been reached with moderate re turns and golden stone is being obtained at St Arnaud at 4C0ft, at Maryborough and Castlemaine at 300ft, at Daylesford at 460ft. and at Tarrengower at SlOft A summary of the facts at present known as to the depths at which reefs may be expected to prove pay

influence of genial rams and a seasonable rise of temperature In the north eastern dis tncts the land is in a very boggy condition and water may be seen through the grass standing all over the plains Along rue coast the showers have been light although frequent The rainfall has sufficed so far, the evapora. tion up to this period of the season bemg small, but moisture on a moro liberal scale will be needed hencefo-ward m these and many other parts of Victoria and the adjacent colonies In the older settled din tncte the plough is being gradually mw" up Sheep farming is becoming quite general nmongst the smaller landholder as well as amongst the larger ones. As far as their means will allow farmers are obtaining long woolled sheep but as pure stock is too valu able to be purchased in large numbers half three quarter and seven eighth crosses are readily taken, a pure sire being obtained if possible. During the spring sales of stud sheep are of frequent occurrence. One of the most important sales of high class sheep that has been held in Melbourne for many years took place at the stores of the London and Australian Agency Company Collins street on the 28th and 29th August. Messrs Powers Rutherford and Co were the agents for the vendors. The stock consisted of 405 merino rams and 30 ewes from the stud flocks of Messrs J. Gibson W. Gibson and Sons and W. H. Gibson of Tasmania and J. Dowling and Son, Victoria. also 98 Lincoln rams and 50 ewes imported and colonial bred and 235 Leicester ewes and 50 rams the greater portion of which were Tas manian bred. The fame of the sheep bred by Messrs Gibson is well known throughout Australia and when the sale commenced there was a very large attendance of sheep owners. The first sheep on the catalogue were those bred by Mr. James Gibson of Bellevue, Tasmania. The splendid stud ram Sir Thomas excited very great competition; he was eventually secured by Messrs T.F. Cumming and W. Cumming for the sum of 680 guineas the highest pnce ever paid for a ram in Australia. This ram is considered the finest sheep in the colonies, he is well shaped with fine frame showing grand con stitution, short on the leg and with a fine face; his wool ia remarkably dense of good staple and very even all over the body. Last year it is said that Mr. Gibson could have obtained £1000 for him but he declined to sell as he required him for stud purposes. Goldendrop, a full mouthed, magnificent stud ram was purchased by Mr. W. Robertson for 205 guineas. Of the special stud rams from the flock of Messrs W. Gibson and Sons two were sold at 135 guineas each. The highest prices realised by Messrs Dowling and Son's stock was 140 guineas for a four tooth sheep purchased by Messrs. Peppin and Sons of Riverina. On behalf of Mr W Cumming 24 Lincoln rams twoyeaisold bred by Mr Thomas Kirkham vero offered l8 out of which ranted from 50 guineas to 105 guineas On account of the same owner were offered 35 Lincoln ewes of the same age bred by Mr T J W Duddtng The whole lot sold readily at pncea which ought to be remunerative, only two went below 30 guineas the rest ranged from that price up to 70 guineas six having realised from 73 guineas to 70 guineas per head On account of Mr W S Cox 15 imported Lincoln rams bred by Mr J H Connell were offered the prices of these ranged from 21 guineas to 34 guineas live others bred by Mr S 1 Deans were sold at 30 to 31 guineas Ihe annual spring show and sales of stock, draught and thoroughbred horses wero held dunng the third week of August where the following were amongst the sales of thorough breds -Ladykirk 200 guineas Serenader the Tngbsh trotting horse 500 turneas Benedict 150 guineas Dosy by Stockham 150 guineas, ITymg Dutchman 2o0 guineas Little Barwon 300 guineas Several others were passed in the bids not reaching the owners reserve The principal sales of heavy draugnt stock were-The imported Clydesdale Conqueror 2yrs 000 guineas (this coltis gone to New Zealand) the colonial bred loung Clyde 410 guineas Grey Tail ira ported 250 guineas.

arrangements were pending with the view of transferring to the colony the other portions of the department The expenditure for 1875 was calculated at £100.000, leaving a surplus of about £50,000, of

13th, the Premier moved resolutions effect ing large organic changes in the constitution of the colony, by abolishing all the provinces in the North Island, and permanently fixing Wellington as tbo seat of Government by act of Parliament These resolutions have absorbed attention from one end of the colony to the other Town after town has broken out into public meetings and other kinds of popular demonstration With very few exceptions, the press of the colony vv elcomed the proposal ob sound and states manlike and the desired result as something inevitable The journals that took up the question most earnestly recommended that no half measures should be talton and that the Government should boldly sweep away at once and for ever provincialism m both islands The division upon the re solutions-11 to IG-showed that the Govern- ment possessed afar more powerful majority than even their most ardent suppoiters an- ticipated An attempt is to bo made to re open the whole question by Mr lutzberbert, a member of many Ministries, and now superintendent of Wellington, who will moy e that the Governor be asked to grant a a dissolution, in order that the voice of the people may be taken

sides The description of trado asked for and expected hy tho men vanes \eiy little muskets, axes, long knives, powder caps, ball and shot, nav) blue, Turkey red, beads, Ac and a box ' The coBt of passage money varies with the demand for labour-from £10 to £15 per man For the sake of illustration I select the medium of £12 Then amans cost to his employer is, wages £3, passage money £4, return passage monoy 10s (it ranges from 20s to 40s )-total, £7 10a per annum His food does not affect this scheme " It is admitted by all that for the first year a man is w orth very little, the second year he has gained some knowledge, tho third j ear he is really a useful man He is, toa certain extent, skilled , has learnt European ways, may have learnt English or Tijian, but certainly understands when spoken to, he ia also acclimatised I find that the mortality among labourers is almost confined to the year of their arrival, as the change from the misery and starvation of their islands to the abundance which they find hore affects them At the moment when the labourer is most useful the third year ia up, and, in the coses with which I have to deal, he is thrown on the consul's bands,
