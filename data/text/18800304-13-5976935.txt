POLITICAL SUMMARY. The absorbing event of the past fortnight has been the general election for the As- sembly, which took place on Saturday, February 28. All other incidents havo b; 3ii lout sight of in the deep interest evoked by this appeal to the country to say whether or not it would approve of tho Berry Go- vernment and its Reform Bill. Tho decision lias b:3n unfavourable to tho Ministry and their measuro. The Berry Government is now only holding oflioo until its successors aro appointed. Tho plebiscite and tho sixth clause (the 'attor authorising payments on tho voto of tho Assembly alone) aro unequivocally con- demned, and whatever roform takes placo will bo on tho lines of tho Sorvice Munro programme _ Tho general ro sult of tho elections is :-For tho Government, 37 votos ; for tho Oppo- sition, 49. Tho apppront majority is 12, but it is known that many members who voted for tho Government écheme becauso it was tho Government schcrao oro ready and wi'Ung now to assist in passing tho Service propo-mls, to which they wero always personally favourable Tho polling day was ono of intonso oxcitement. In Melbourne business was Bnsponded, and during tho overl- ing some 60,000 people must havo visited The Argus oflico, which was tho centro of tho scone. Melbourne itself cast a Bolid voto for tho Opposition, and in West Melbourne tho ovont of tho eventful day occurred in thu rojoction of tho Attorney-General, Sir Bryan O'Loghlen. Ministora woro in possession of tho two seats for tho district, but they abandoned ono in order to eoncontrato their enorgios upon tho Attorney- General, and no exertion was left iinsparod and no influenco unused in order to seeuro his return. But both the offences and tho blunders of Sir Bryan O'Loghlen iiad mado a deop impression upon the oloctors, and tho majority of 109 which tho candi- dato secured in 1878 was turned into a minority of 301. Tho numbers wore : Orkney, 2,451; MacMahon, 2,410; O'Loghlon, 2,109. Tho valuo of this ver- dict is great, bocauso it indicates a revulsion against the idea of government by corruption, which tho Attorney General advocated and acted upon, more especially in connexion with the public presB. In East Mclbourno tho Oppo- sition placed Messrs. ÍSox and A. K. Smith at tho hoad of tho poll, and this though their voto was split by three men running for tho two scats. Mr. Zox, who headed tho list, received 2,012 votes, aa against 809 obtained by tho highest Ministerial candidato. St. Kilda was another triumph. In 1877 Mr. Dixon, an avowed Berryito, headed tho poll, but now Mr. Cartor (Opposition) came in first with 3,121 ; Mr. Harris (Opposition) was second with 3,074, and Mr. Dixon was third with 2,015, so that tho tables wero turned completely. In Richmond, also, a truculent Govern- ment supporter, Mr. L. L. Smith, was rejected ; and in West Bourke, whero tho Opposition secured a seat in 1879, they now won tho second seat also. In South Bourke tho Ministerial candidate, Mr. J. Fergusson-the member who struck tho | blow in tho House-was defeated by Mr. t Keys, whom ho boat in 1877 ; and | East Bourko returned tho Opposi (. tioniBt, Mr. Ramsay, by tho largest Í' majority ho has yet obtained. On | the other hand, the Opposition Jost a member at Fitzroy, whero Mr W M K Vale just defeated Mr Bhckett, who hid snatched i uctory at a byo election m 1879, when two Government candi dates ran for the one seat and though tlie contests woro severe the Ministerial t memborB hold then own m North Mol bourne and Collingwood Tho surprise of tho day was tho dofeat of Mr J Munro, the leader of tho Corner party, at Carlton, by an unknown man Wlnlo the country at largo approved of Mi Munro s action, and of lus principles of re form, ho has boon unfortunate as regatds his own constituents On the w hole, though the Opposition gamed in and about Mel bourne, their increase of stiength was principally manifested by then heavy polling in constituencies in which in 1877 they had no chance Thus, in North Melbourne thoy increased then votes from 743 to 1,884, and in Tit/roy from 1,048 to 1,085, and so on In the country districts the Opposition bucccbs was decided Tho merni eis who had turned a__,amst tho Berry Govoui ment wore suppoited, and members who had adhered to tho Got eminent wero in many casos defeated Mi Semco was returned foi Maldon by tw o to ono Mi Berry, on the other hand,

Miuistoml mein beis, and tho Opposition w is beaton by two to ono It was expected by the Mimstoiial patty that tho action of tho Smdhurst members m voting solidly against tho Reform Bill would bo ro

Four of the Jate directors of the Provincial and Suburban Bark, and elao the late mana- ger of the same institution, wero placed on their trial on the 19th ult at tho sittings of the Central Criminal Court in Melbourne, charged with conspiring to deceive and do fraud the shareholders and other peraons The names of the defendant directora wero John Hackett, Robert Steel Scott, Charles Morgan, and Isaac R raw cett, and tho name oí the manager waa Richard H Willis The trial took place beforo his Honour the Chief JuBtice and a special jury, and occupied altogether eight da) a Mr C A Smyth, Crown prosecutor, with Mr Billing, Q C , Mr Serjeant Sleigh, and Mr Duffy, appeared for the prosecution, Mr M'larlana defended Scott , Mr Vale defended Hackett and Morgan, and Fawcett mid W'Uia defended themsUvea Although the institution waa termed a bank, its operationa were of an extremely limited kind as compared with the other banliB of Victoria It was established in 1872 with a nominal capital of £100,000 in 20,000 shares of £5 each, but scarcely any of the capital waa then paid up, and tho result of Hub trial showed that at the cIobo of ita career not moro than about £25,000 had been paid by genuine shareholders Tlie principal clmrgea against tho defendants were that the) purchaaed shares with the bank's capital, that they Bold aharea under par contrary to the articlea of association, that they pub habed false reports, balance sheets, and sworn returns , and that they paid dividends otherwise than outof the profita of the bank Tlie defendant WiUia waa not manager of the bank at first, but he was soon afterwards, and the Crown prosecutor in opening tho case, aaid a great deal of the evidence that would be adduced would bo concerning tho acts of Willis, but it vy ould bo contended that it referred equally to the dircctorB, under whoBe control he was-that they, having control over lum, muat be taken to be cogm sant of all tho balance sheets he íaaued, and of nil tho v ariouB acta which were alleged aganiBt lum and them. The Crown prose tutor further Btated that the 101th clause of thcartidca of association said tbat no divi- dend should be payable except out of tlie profits arising from the buBineas of tho com- pany. For four or fivo half years, however, dividends of eight or bix per cent, were paid, though thereweronoprofitsat anytime during the banks career out of winch dividends could bo legitimately payablo, and tho pri- soners issued false balance Bheets! setting forth nourishing and rosy states of things, and mentioning, amongst other mattera, that there were profits out of which they wero entitled to pay dividendo, vvhilat in fact they paid them out of tho money of depositors who lodged their cash in the bank on the faith of tho fictitious balance sheets In the evidence that waB given it was shown that in May or June, 1876, four of the directors, amongst whom wero the defendants Hackett and Fawcett, each took up lOOBharea in older to make the affairs of tho bank look well to tho shareholders and outside public 'Ihey did not pay tho £2 per Bharo then paid up on sliares which had been genuinely issued, but gavo their promissory notes for about £200 each, with an agreement that the notes wero to be renewed when they became due, and were to bear interest only at the Bamo rate as the bank paid in dividends. The notes wero renew ed from timi to time, and three dajB after the bank stopped nackett's and Fawcetts notCB wero discounted by Willis, but the billa then given by them were not to becomo pa>able until May, 1881, or two years from the date of being given It waa charged agaiiiat those two directors that thoy really bought shares with the bank's capital, and aa tho promiaaory notes they gavo from time to time wero uIbo placed na good debts amongst the bills receivable, their actions in that respect formed one of the items of iBBuing false balance ahoets,by making thi good debts nppear largor than they wero Other evidence waa adduced, to the effect that for somo years before tho bank closed no bad debts whotever were written off, but that, on tho contrary, accounts and bills which were known to be hopelessly bad wero retained on the books, and included in the balance sheets issued evory half-year. Tho Btate of the sharo register and of the billa receivable account was nlao proved to bo falsified by making it appear that largo num bera of BiiareB had been sold to various por BonB, when in fact the Bhares had not been issued at all, but had been merely entered on the sharo register after worthless billa had been taken for them The most prominent cascB of that 1 md wero with reference to tho defendant Willis and ono of tho cuatomera of the bank Thero wero 2,700 aharea m tho name of the latter, and he gave his promis 8ory note for £5 100, which was placed aa a good debt amongst tho bills receivable, and bo formed another item in tho charge of falsifying the balance shoot and report9 issued half ) early Willis nominally took 4 000 of the shares by the cognisance of the directors, and gav o his promissory note for them, and afterwards, when a call of 10s per Bharo waa made, ho also gave his promis sor) note for the callB, making his debt to tho bank, although ho was known to bo a comparativ ely poor man, £11 000 The notes of mil» and all tho others, who wero only nominally shareholders, wero also placod amongst the bills receivable and each half year the public were led to believe, from the balance aheets and reporta, that not only was the balk prospering by having its share capital increased, but that its business was also extending, as was to bo Boen by tho large amount of good bills receivable After tho bank closed, the liquidators who wero appointed found that thero was an un usually largo number of bad accounts and bills Ono debt of £2-1,000, owing by Borne persons who had taken a railway contract was considered very doubtful, and tho liquidators cannot sa) yet what will be re covered from it as it will probably have to be brought beforo tho law courts lhat debt alone was about equal to the whole of the paid up capital, because although that capital was represented m tue last balance ah ->t to be £1.>,000, it was not much more than half that amount when the worthless bills of \\\ lilis and tho other nominal share holders were taken into consideration Ac cording to the evidence, the deposita received by the b-uk amounted, when the last balance sheet for tho half)car ended 31st December, 1878, waa lSBtiod, to over £fi8,000, and witnesseB were called to show that the) bought Bhares on the faith of the balance Bhecta and reports being true, and others to prove that they deposited money in tne boult through tho Bame cause Mr Jacomb, one of the liquidators stated that when tho bank closed it owed £75,000 There waa a further call of £2 10s por snare to be made on the shareholders, £210a bein^ the amount already paid up, and the romani mg £2 10a being all tho shareholders were responsible for Iho liquidators, Mr Jacomb Bftid, expected to receive about £12,000 from callB and £10 00O from other assets, irrespec tive of what might he got from the railway contract debt, und he thoue,ht thero would, in tho long run, be about 0s in tho £ for depositors, not counting anything windi might be realised from tho railway contract debt Other evidence which was given, was to the effect that the bank on four or five occasions paid div dends when there wero really no profits, that tho defendonta carried on the bank aftor they knew it was insolvent, that they sold some Bhares under par, and that the manager in the sworn returna published in tho Govern mail Qazitti, omitted to mchido m tho item " notes m circulation, a largo number of noteB held by another bank aa accunty for a debt owing to it by the Hrovmciel and Subur ban Bank The defendant 1 aw cett waa 01 ly included m tho charge of bii)ing slnrea with the capital of the bank, aa ho ceased to bo a director about two ) ears before tho stoppage The defence Bet up for tbo directora was substantially that they wero e'l respectable men, who had not knowingly done aiij thm i wrong , that they bad generally bren guided by the manager and the auditors, and that they were entitled to consider the bah« lee aheets correct after they had been duly audited by two well known auditors The defendant Willis submitted tliathohad never wilfully falsified any documents or accounts, and contended that he would not have been justified in writing off old debts when he con- sidered, ub ho really did, that they might eventually be recovered lhe Chief Justice, in summing up the caao to the jury, pointed out that if they thought tbo defendants had conspired together to infringe the articles of association-to reprr sent as capital that which waa not capit ii, and aa assets that which waa not assets-m order to enable them to tide over a difficulty and bring the bank Bttfely through a threat ened or pending or actual insolvency, thoy were guilt) of an ui'uvviul act Ho then referred to the mam facts of the case, ond in conclusion eaid it was unnecceaaary to em barrnaa the jur) with the different counts, of which there wero 21 Should they find the defendants guilty, tho verdict could be entered on tho counts as agreed upon bj couuacl on both sides 'lhe jury, after deliberating for about four hours, returned a v erdict of guilty agamat all the defendants The
