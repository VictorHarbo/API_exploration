Last Kosovars Found Behind Couch BRIGHTON, Tuesday: State Emergency Services personnel were called to a house in Brighton this morning, where the last five remaining Kosovar refugees have been found wedged behind a couch. The discovery was made late yesterday afternoon, when Dough Klimes, and unemployed car- pet layer, discovered a lump in the seat while watching television. Reaching between the cushions, he found not the expected pen or 50 cent piece, but a family of ethnic Albanians, who had hidden in the cavity between the seat and rear cushions for four months. "Please do not send me back to the inhumanity and squalor of my homeland," pleased family matri- arch Hirani Grchnlp. "Send us instead to the inhumanity and squalor of New Zealand!" Eldest Son Tch Grchnlp, 18, wanted to stay; "I would very much like to stay here in Australia, partake of the conspicuous con- sumption of the West and whinge that education is no longer free. It is so different from Kosovo, where we are thankful if we are not shot through the head if we say the wrong prayers. I want to live in a country where I can constantly complain about minor imperfec- tions, ignorant of the suffering elsewhere in the world. I would like to settle here and one day be able to protest the arrival of people just like me." Immigration officials calmed the situation claiming that the night- mare would seen be over. "Don't worry we'll get rid of them quick- smart." Officials have assured have assured human rights groups that the repatriation will go smoothly. "We have got them a space in the back of a Danish semi-trailer on its way to London," said one official. "They'll be fine".
