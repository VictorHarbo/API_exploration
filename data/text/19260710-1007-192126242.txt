" I have the honour of bringing down a fourth consecutive Budget statement. On this, occasion -the financial proposals \- of. the Government: are placed before lion, members within the first eight days of the -financial year. « 7 FINANCIAL YEAR, 1925-'26. Dcjiartments and services— other than business untlei takings and territories of the Commonwealth: ' EXPENDITURE. -.. The, chief increases in the actual ex- penditure .1.925- '2(5 over the estimate are as: follows:— Interest and Sinking Fund; on War Loans, War- Pensions and other: war services, £311,405; invalid and old- age.. pensions, ;£472, 382; bounties and, .other .special; appropriations, £105, 348;, ordinary .-..votes-, of ' departments, £130,- 752; other increases and- decreases- — net increase, £64,367. Total increase, £1,174,254. . SURPLUS FOR YEAR. " In addition to the expenditure set out above the following moneys not . provided for in the Budget of 1925- '26- were paid to trust fund in anticipation of a surplus in the accounts of the year : — N aval construction, £1,000,000 ; special provision for air. services, £250,- | 000; science ;and industry in vestiga-. | .tious and endowment for scientific; re search, £250,000; special payment for ;debt redemption, £1,000,000. Total, £2,500,000. There remained at the close of the year a surplus, of £2S6, 944, lvliieh it i3 proj)osed to set aside fon-Prospecting for.-, oil and precious metals, £100,000; invalid. . and old-age pensions and na tional insurance, £186,944. REVENUE, i. The chief increases in the revenue were:— Customs and excise/ £1,998,883; i direct ' taxation, £1,064,124; coinage, £207,036; net profit— Australian note tissue, £90,062; other heads : of revenue, £61,S96. Total, £3,422,001. f In estimating -receipts from customs and : excise, the contcmjilated reduction in duties was taken into considerafcion. Reductions in duties do not operate un til the amende.d tariff is passed by Par liament. As the tariff: was not passed before June 30, the reduction in. duties did not become operative, last year. The increase in direct taxation arises- almost wholly from income tax. The normal rate of growth of the taxable incomes — 6 per cent.— was considerably .exceeded, and the position in regard- .to arrears has improvedi BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS. ; The. receipts and expenditure of busir ness undertakings do not show any considerable variation from the esti mate. The actual . expenditure of the Post Office was, £10,654,880, being £38,445 in excess of. the estimate, whilst the revenue vwas £105,251 in excess of the estimate, the actual receipts being £10,815,251. The cost of working the: Common wealth railways was £897;122, br, £3,985 below the estimate, and the actual revenue' was £20,345 less than the amount estimated. ' TERRITORIES OF,. THE COMMON - \- ' WEALTH. . The actual expenditure on the Ter ritories of the Commonwealth was £46,547 less than the estimate. An "amount- of £50,000 was provided for the transfer of staffs and office equipment to the Federal Capital; the general! transfer was not commenced as /was anticipated. ' ' NEW YEAR. The: Budget for 1926- '27 is framed in accordance with the Government's pro-, posals for. the re-adjustment of the finances as between Commonwealth and. States. More particular , reference to; these proposals will be made at a later stage. ' . : ' ESTIMATED EXPENDITURE. When considering the expenditure :to: be provided for it is necessary to divide tlio amount into capital ' expenditure; .-.which is chargeable against - loan and annually recurring expenditure which is correctly payable out of revenue. LOAN1 EXPENDITURE.' ' The estimated, expenditure for works: out of loan in 1925- '26 was £10,279,014; the' amount . spent was £7,682,089. The items of expenditure in 1926- '27 are: — Postmaster General's -Department, £5,000,000;, Commonwealth railways £1,474,500;, Graf ton-South Brisbane rail way, £1,000,000; naval bases/ floating dock, aviation buildings, munitions -sup ply buildings and other defence works, £587,500; advances for . purchase ol wire and wire- netting, £500,000; imuii- gration— advances of passage money, £348,380; River Murray Waters Act, £252,500; subscription . to -capital - of Amalgamated Wireless Limited, £250,-;. 001; sundry works of various depart ments, £117,331; subscription to capital, of Commonwealth Oil Refineries, £50,- 000; loan to Territory of New Guinea for works, £42,0S5.- Total expenditure out of loans for works, £9,622,297. The expenditure on war and repatriation services, mainly Avar service homes, is estimated at £93S, 202, /making a total loan provision for Commonwealth ex penditure of £10,560,499. It is antici- | ipated -that not more than £10,000,000 of this total will- be required. Provision is also made for £3,400,000 for loans for the States for immigration, ,and £2,000,000 for loans for the' Federal Capital Coiiimission. ' v ' SOLDIER LAND SETTLEMENT. . In a-iew of 'the fact, that the losses by the States Avould be greater than was at lirst . anticipated, the Goveru- meut deeided to Avrite off from the loans to the States the sum of £5,000,000, to enable the States to deal fairly with the settlers. The total contribution by the Com- moinvcrilth . tQAA-ards losses amounted to more than £10,000,000. In addition it- Avas deeided to reduce the rate of in terest payable by the States to 5 per cent .after December 31, 1930. SEAT OF GOVERNMENT. In accordance Avith tlie decision that- Parliament shall open at Canberra in May, 1927, proA-ision is made in the Loan Estimates for raising a loan, of £2,000,000 on behalf of the Commis sion. ' MIGRATION. Though the rate of natural iucreasfi in - Australia compares more than; favo'r- ablv Avith that of other countries, the -Government, desires to supplement it by the- gradual absorption of desirable set tlers" from overseas, more particularly from Great Britain. A combined effort bv Great Britain and Australia is be ing made through the migration agree ment to achieve this : result. . . With the . exception: of tNew South Wales, alLtlie States have accepted, the terms of the .'agreement' Avhichcontom- plates an" expenditure of £34,000,001 and the absorption of 450,000 migrants in ten years. To examine a nd r epo Lt upon tlie schemes submitted, to frame and submit proposals for other, under- ; takings, to ; consider the best means of developing our resources, to investi gate the condition' of- existing indus- ,< tries, and tlie possibilities of establish- I ing neAV ones, the Government proposes to -appoint-- an expert Commission. NATIONAL DEBT— REDUCTION OF WAR DEBT. The outstanding feature of the na tional debf ; operations in recent years is the systematic reduction of the - war debt. Though ucav .borroAving is in creasing, tlie anion at , of gross debt Australia lias £28,500,000 less Avar: debt to-day than four years ago . In the.- same period the net debt fell by £160,000, despite the faet tlmt the Post Office created over £16,000,000 of neAV assets during that time and. many other necessary public Avorks v/ ere pro- Added. The gross debt at June 30, 1 026, I was: — AVar' debt, £304,546,643; debt in- j curved for the States, £83, 40S, 859; other debt, £70,4S8,135. Total, £458,443,637. | : ' The net debt of the Commonwealth is lioAA £4/19/6 per head less I nan in 1922. These statements sIioav clearly the improvement in the position of the Com monwealth. GROSS DEBT. Of the gross debt at June 30, 1926, £2S7,14S,652 is redeemable in Australia, £S6,86o,SS2 is due to the Government of the United Kingdom, £69,017,616 is redeemable in London, and , £15, 411;4S7 in New York. SINKING FUND AND DEBT REDEMPTION. ; Substantial contributions were again ;made last year for the redemption; of the public debt of the Gommoivwealth. The contributions from reA-enue Avere:— i'For payment to the sinking- fund, in cluding special contributions of £1,000,- .000, £2,796,722; for payment to the Brit-, fish Goa- ernment, £1,231,723. .

AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCIL. The. loan operations of the ' Common-' r. wealth -and of tlie States: other than; New South Wales. Avere undertaken: dur-: ing the past year m accordance with plans, made by the Loan Council, which was formed in order that the Joan: busi ness ox - the a'arious G o vorinnencs migh t - be carried on; Avithoiit clash or cmi- p'etition. Experience 11:13- shoAvn that the Treasurers, acting in concert-, can secure better terms than if tliey acted independently. No deeisinn of the Loan Council binds any Treasurer until .his GoA'crnment has consented. , . The CommonA\realtli floated four loans 1 la-st year. The first of -the scries- -was., the simultaneous borroA\Ting of £15,000, - /000 in New York and £5,000, '.KiO in -London, and was dealt; AA'ith in my last Budget speech.

Com- monAvealth Loan on behalf: of the States was announced. The rate of interest offered AA7as 5i per cent, or i per ccct beloAv the rate of tlie con\Tersion. loan. This operation also Avas successful, the loan being over-subscribed.

The Savings Bank branch of the Commonwealth .Bank; shows- remarkable expansion.' In 1915, the deposits amounted "to £7,400,000. On December 31 last , the ; deposits . am'ounted" to nearly £44,000,000: In 1924 Australia passed through a .very seiious monetary crisis. The Cen- tial Bank, under a Board of Directors, rh.ad.just been established andwas (f aced with.. a i seriously .threatened hold-up of the sales of wool and other prim ary pi oduce. It was estimated that, during; the following months; Australian pioduets of the value of £140,000,000 would .be available for. sales overseas. Alieady piimaiy pioducers were being compelled -to.. aceept :£95 in- Australia- in respect,- of. every £100 : secured oversea; ; by. th e.vsale of -th eir. .goods, and . in some cases - exporters were; buying/ exchange J oi ward, receiving only £93/5/ for each £100 in London. lr. addition ihfv lost mtoicst amounting to a, considerable sum because -they" iceived the money in Australia .twro -or -three, months Ler . foie they could use it. The difficulties of exchange, had become so acute that a -/empoiaiy stoppage of soles seemed imminent. If this, had oceiu- ' r edy riot only wmuld prices have'- slump-.;; ed, but jiioduceis. would have, been compelled/, even :on tlieir; lower- returns,; to submit to, an exchange charge of about 10 per cent. This serious posi- i 1 <">n was averted by the decision of 'the new 'directors1 to lend notes to the otliei banks up tof £15,000,000 to em- able them to finance', exports. Tins action immediately enabled ' sales of produce to be' continued. a The saving to the community arising out of the so handling of the situation by the Commonwealth. Bank can seuicely be irrdiealed in figures. Theievis no doubt that it amounted to"1 many millions of pounds. The . banks did not: avail themselves of their full rights under the arrange ment.
