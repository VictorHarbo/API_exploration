' Its Instinct is usually right, and in the matter of common ailments yon may profitably pay heed to the opinion of the majority— which in times of sickness pots its faith In the efficacy ol Beechnut's Pills. Nor has that trust been misplaced. An annual sale of 6,000,000 boxes proves the universality of the belief In the vain* ol Plffi Many preparations, miscalled remedies, claim impossibilities. They conid not reasonably make pood much that is claimed for them. No exaggerated state ments are put forward respecting Beecbam's Pills.
