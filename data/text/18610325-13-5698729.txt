Both these vessels are now loading. The following is the classification of immigrants which arrived yesterday by the ship Ascendant, from Southampton :—Single women, 144 ; single men, 3 ; married couples, 20 ; children, 29, The Government immigrant ship Ascendant an- chored in Hobson's Bay yesterday morning. She brings 223 Government immigrants, who have had very good health throughout the passage, only one death and five births occurring during the voyage. The ship is remarkably clean, and reflects credit on her officers. The barque Pons Ælii left Hong Kong on the 20th January, and passed through the Straits of Sunda on the 9th of the following month.

In reference to the reported wreck of the Topsy, cutter, mentioned in our issue of yesterday, in a paragraph in which we stated that the craft had drifted ashore just above Bruni Lighthouse, there is now too much reason to believe that Mr. Domminey and all hands are lost, the Allison, which came up from Lady's Bay yesterday evening, reporting that during the heavy gale of Thursday night the crew of the Allison saw the Topsy dragging across towards Bruni Lighthouse with no sail set, and that of the hands aboard (four), one was stowing the topsail, two were stowing the jib, and one hand was at the tiller, and that, next morning no trace of the cutter could be seen, and no tidings have jet been heard of the boat on the other shore.—Hobart Town Mercury, March 19. The Harp, Captain Fisher, which sailed hence on the 8th February, in search of guano, returned to port yesterday. The schooner has been cruising among the islands in Bass' and Banks' Straits, and has made an unsuccessful trip, returning with only about 50 tons of the article in search of which the schooner was sent out.—Hobart Town Mercury, March 19.
