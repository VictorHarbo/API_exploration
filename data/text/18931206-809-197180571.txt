M'Whao. brokers : John MWhao and Co., Tho Exchange, Melbourne ; Alfred Tolhurst, Queen-street, Melbourne ; G. W. Staples, Oolllns-struet, Melbourne. It Is proposed to form above company with a view to working tne Maritana Gold Mining Company, situated at Hunnau's Rush, Western Australia. Tho property con sists of 12 acres, containing an ironstone hill about 200 feet high, and, as will be seen by attached reports, is of a most valuable nature. Thu promoters ore confident that » rich and prosperous future is ia store for the Maritana KEPORT ON THE MARITANA GOLD MINE. Hannan's Find was discovered in Juno lost, about twenly-tivo mites east of Coolgardin. From the alluvial many thousand ounces of gold havo beun taken ; also a considerablequuntity from rich quartz leaders and reefs, The country for many miles in' length and over two miles in width has betn proven an auriferous belt forma tion, having iron of every kind, mixed with quartz, run ning in regular band, diagonally through the formation. I might better define it as u net work of leaders, and on many of thorn I havo seen fabulously rich stone— ou the Maritana sontuof tho richest discovered. The lea? No. 37 is 12 acre in extent and encloses the highest bill (over 200 fc.)ou tho line, near tho Reward claim. laaw little country rock in any of the workings, but a considerable quantity of ferruginous aud other iron and quartz in laminated form, with good gold often seen or produced by crushing/ There are soveral leaders of quartz and iron on each slope of tho hill running diagonal to the formation, those on tho N. 15. Bidn dipping west, while those on the S.W. side unditrlio east, all converging Into what I consider the Main Kerf. The Main Reef, which isof crescent form, is caused uo doubt by upheaval of tho hill. , On every make of stone good gold is to be seen, and at reef 2 ft! thick with very rich coarse gold suitable for treatment by dolly. At the other shafts sunk good stono has also been dis covered. Thero has ntso been a tunnel driven from western base ofhiil for over 70 ft. with the intention of cutting the main reef at this depth, also the intermediate leaders. mis should be contiuueu, and will, when cut, give a treat height of reef, and can bo cheaply wrought. There J ts an abundance of wood ou and near the lease for all \ mining purposes. A shaft is being sunk for water by the Government on a I reserve adjoining thu boundary lease. i There ure also extensive water sheds for catchmont, and what appears very good holding ground for tanks. J Considering the short time this field has been found, soil the very extensive auriferous formation showing goou gold, i do not hesitato to believe there is a great future for mining here, aud from every appearance the "Mari- 1 tana " should take a very high position amoug the uiiues of the district. WM. OATS, Manager, Frozer South Gold Sitae, Southern Cross. Southern Gross, W.A., 22nd November, 1893. THE MARITANA G.M. LEASE, No. 37. 1 havo very much pleasure in giving a short report of the Maritana Lease at Colcoola (Uunnan's Find), iu this gold field. Tho llill on which the mine, or mines, Is situated is tho highest in the district, nnd is wholly within tho bouu- - durius of the lease, which comprise 12 ucree. The first ! feature iioticeahle in going over thehill is that it is capped with volcanic Ironstone, the wholo of which curries gold from results obtained hy crushiug. ' Traversing the hill, nnd right through tho centre of the I/easo, there is what 1 commler the main lode or reef. On the surface it is a mixture of quartz and ironstone carrying gold, and if cut at a depth, will, I am certaiu, be found rich in gold for the following reasons, viz:— That on thu N. E. aud H.W. side of the hlli there is a network of reefs und leaders, all carrying gold, and making to the centre of the hili. and the tread of thu reefs on the N'.E. is different to those on i tho 8.W., showing that they connect with thu main lode. On the B.W. sido the present owners are working a well defined reef, which is remark ably rich Iu gold, judging from thesp?cinicnsl have seen, anu the gold dollied from the stone. This reef is running diagonally into the hill, -and connects with the main lode near the northern boundary. At present the work ings on this reef are 30 feet deep, and judging by the quantity of void in the stone, the deeper the reef is suuk upon the richer it will be. The wholo area surrounding the Marituna Is taken up under Irunc, nnd on all these holdings payuhlo gold has been found in reefs to leaders right up to thu Mnrituua boundary. Rice, on the H.W. boundary, has a shaft down 40 feet, where tho reef is 20 inches wide, well de fined, and rich in gold, going straight into tho hlli near tlie centre. Feat, ou tho N. w. und, has a rich reef also makiog into tho Maritana. A tunnel 70 feet in length has been driven into the hltl by the prcscut owners, und this, if continued to thu mala reef, should at once produce profitable reulis. ROBERT OLEDDF.N, Mining Surveyor.
