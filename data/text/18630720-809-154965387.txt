COMMERCIAL. Am: On- lor., Saturday Evening. j Thoro wore 110 export onirics passed for gold at tho Customs to-day. Tho gradual improvement porceptiblo in tho im port market, previous to the arrival of tho English mail, lias boen completely lost dineo its delivery. Tlio past week having emphatically beon a quiol one, almost ovory description of goods lmvo boon unduly doprossed, aud tho vorv few articles of which the shipments apprised aro at all light, havo been so influenced by the genoral stagnation, as iu the moantimo to bo doprivod of tho benefit generally conferred by a cirouuistanco so desirable. Tho downward tendency in bulk ales has not yot beon stayed ; larger quantities, howovor, havo boon quitted than formerly. Bottled stout has not im proved. Caudles have decliuod ^d per lb. Flour and wheat havo attracted a good deal of notice, at improving rates. Speculative purchases have boon made in blasting powder. Buttor is firmer. Hams and bacon liavo suffered nnothor reduction. Rico lias givon way, and thoro is no desiro to invest manifested by tho trade. A good business lias been done in teas, at improved pricos. Tobacco con tinues to bo looked on as a favorito artiolo. Wiuos and spirits are heavy, a slight reduction on tho latter having beon conceded. Tlio British and foreign arrivals comprise two vessels from London, one from Bremen, ouo from Sweden, ono from China, ono from Now York, nnd tho mail steamor. Ale and Stout. — For trade purposes bull: alo continues to receive but limitod notice. During tho past week, however, heavior sales than forsome time previous aro reported of Bass's and Allsopp's, which it is liopod may bo tho forerunner of some improvement in an artiolo hitherto so much de pressed. Bass's No. 3 is offered freely at £7, for parcels, nnd sales havo boon mado at that rate to £7 os for small lots. Of Allsopp's, 300 hhds aro stated to have changed hands nt a price not dis closed ; 50 hhd parcols have beon told at £7, aud smaller quantities at £7 5s. Marian's meets with a moderate trade demand at £7 7s Od to £7 12 Gd. Joule's is not offered under £8, nt which but a limited quantity has been quitted. Sulo of Cnrlislo Com pany's havo been mado nt £7 15s, below which it is not oft'ered at present. Colonial Company's sells at £7 to £'7. 10s, aud Ind, Coope, and Co.'s may now be' quoted at tho same figure. Younge's Edinburgh has boen disposed of at £0 10s to £0 12s Od. There is no change to report on Stout : Taylor, Walker, and Co.'s finds buyers at £7 5s to £7 7s Od. Wliit bread's is £7 2s Gd to £7 5s, tho demand not being heavy. Bottled ale is not in increased consump tion : Bass's and Allsopp's are maintained at 10s to 10s 3d ; Joule's at 9s Od, and Colonial Company's at 9s to 9s 3d, sales having been effected at our quotations. Bottled stout is vory sparingly asked for. Homy White aud Co.'s has not been placed at moro than 10s 3d ; Machon's brings 9s 9d; Dunphy's is not readily disposed of at 9s 3d to 9s Od ; Byuss's sells at 9s 3d, ovor which buyers will not go. Hibbort's realises a like rate. Edmond's pig brand is wanted at 10s 9d. Shipments of bulk nre equal to tho high average of the first three months of tho year. Bottled, on the other hand, aro considerably less, tho former being 3822 hhds, and the latter 10,921 eases. Bagging. — Corn sacks aro without alteration, tho demand being small ; but stocks aro light ; 17s Od to 18s is a full quotation. A damaged parcel sold for 13s at auction. Shipments aro about 120 bales. Woolpacks are not iu much request, buyers preferring to take thoir chance of getting into stock when tho season opens rathor than pay 5s Od, tho figure now asked ; damaged realised 4s Od. Shipments wo equal to 58 bales. Candles. — This market continues to bo pressed by damaged lots, at ridiculously low prices, which, combined with tho heavy export for April — May, completely destroys any hope of recovery for tho remainder of tho win ter. Our quotations, of courso, aro nominal, most dealers being able to supply themselves amply at auction. Bolmouts are offered, aud havo been sold at Hid, and as no salos of Halo's, Ogilvio's &c.;, aro roported under, we retain- for tlieso brands tho same quotation. Tho Neva Sioarinc Company havo re duced their prico to Is. Faulty parcels of full weights have been sold at lOd to 10.]- d , and badly damaged at 9Ad to 9|d ; light weights at 7gd to 8,£d, and 7jd to 8gd. Shipments advised aro 120 tons, exclusive of those from, foreign ports, which are nearly as heavy. Cement. — Portland is hardly so firm, for though there is little in tlio importers' hands, thoro is yot an appearance of weakness evinced. Our quota tions, howovor, wo do not yot alter from 25s. Ameri can plaster is in bettor 8 up ply, but wo understand somo portions havo arrived damaged. Trade, salos are mado at 25s. Coffee. — A fair demand, has been experienced for plantation, salos having been made at, lid. Native can be bought on rather easier terms, say UJd to 10d., and best Java lOd to lO.Jd. Chicoby. — Wo still quote 4d, but salos aro limited. Confectionery maintains a steady trade demand without alteration on prices. Assorted sell, at lid, ' jujubos at is. Candied, peel is saleable at 13Jd, supplies boing rather short. Cordage presents no. appearance of improvement. Manilla assorted remains at £47 to £10. Europe Manilla £48. Sewing twino realises 15d. Tlio Prins Carl, just arrived from Calcutta, has. a. parcel which has lately been very scarce und wanted. Chemicals. — Soda crystals bring £8 15fi-.at which sales arc boing made ; but soda ash at £10, caustic soda at £20, aud carbonate of soda at 21s, aro in no demand, and prices are almost nominal.

Sultana raisins bring 7jd to 8d ; elemes, 7d ; I0030 muscatels, 6d to 0?,d ; layers, O.^d to 7Jd; small packagos, 8Jd; elemo figa, O.Jd. At auction, salos wero mado at 5Ad to GJd. Dried apples havo been sold at Od in bond for ship ment. Flour and Grain. — Considerable activity has boen displayed in this market, eliioily amongst largo buyers, and a reaction which lias chocked tho pre vious downward tendency has set in. Several hun dred tons are stated to havo changed hands in one line at a very full price. Trade sales of ordinary silk-dressed Adelaido have also been effected at £14. Victorian, Moyno and Merri Mills havo been sold at £13 to £13 IO3. No sales of Hart's aud Magaroy's aro reported, but these ore held for £14 10s. Adelaide country brands are quoted at £13 10s. Several transactions in wheat havo taken placa at an improvement 011 rates formerly ruling. Adelaido has been sold as low as 5s 7£d, but is now hold firmly for Os. Tasmanian likewise looks better ; good samples would bring 5s Gd, if not more ; and, Victorian, 53 3d to 5s Gd ; feeding, 4s 9d. Barley is easier for feeding descriptions ; 4s Od would bo taken for fair parcels ; offers have been mado at less, but we have heard of no eulos under. The damaged ; ortion of tho Peter Symon's cargo, consisting of 3500 bushels, brought 4s not. Malting is valued at 5s 9d to Os. Colonial oats, of fine quality, tho market is still barely supplied with ; such would be freely bought at' 0s, for milling purposes ; unclean farmers' lots are worLh 5s Od ; fine Danish are valued nt 5s ; Scotch and English aro held for 4s UJ ; Calcutta, in dealers' hands, sell for 4s lOd— a puroel in tho Prins Carl is not yet disposed of. Shipments from England havo very much decreased, but foreign still continue to bo sent on ; a Bremen cargo of 15,000 bushels arrived this week. Maizo is a shade firmer, aud fine descriptions may be quoted 4s 4d to -Is lid ; inferior, 4s. Bran sells at Is 2d to Is 2Jd ; sales of Adelaide have been mado | at Is 1 ji on tho wharf.

Shipments for tho week arc 580 cwt., very much less than tho average of tho provions three ; 011 tho other hand, wo noto an equal quantity shipped during tho fol lowing ton days. Malt. — Advices by the mail now in effectually chocked tho improvement manifested in this article ; au export of 40,000 bushels, succeeding three months equally heavy, is not likely to exorciso a favorable effect at a period when our consumption is nt its lowest. Sales are consequently confined to supply ing present requirements at 8s 9d to 9s. Wo do not, however, expect prices to go much, if anything, bolow 8s Gd for bins, as importers in most cases will pro fer the risk of storing to submitting to so heavy a loss as a lower figure entails. Metals. — Pig iron is held for £3 5s to £3 10s ; howatite hns been sold nt £5 5s ; corrugated is offer ing more freely, and on easier terms, 20 and 28 guago ; Hamilton's and Gospel Oak we value at £34 ; Johnston's 28 guago, faulty, realised £32 ; Hamilton's 24 guago, £32.

Coleman's whito starch, damaged, realised 3Jd; thumb blue, 3d; brown ginger, 2Jd. Provisions. — Butter, though firmer, is quiot. Shipments are 1500 firkins, upwards of 1000 of which havo already arrived in ordinary circumstances. This fact would havo favorably influenced tho market, but ns yet nny material improvement bus boen pre vented by tho general dulncss prevailing. A firmer tone lias, however, beon imparted, and higher rates demanded, though 110 sales are reported over Is 2Jd. Hams and bacon havo declined.
