MM'CAW and ANOTHER most respectfully return thanks . to their friends and the public fur the very liberal sup port they have received since resuming business, and assure them that no effort shall be wanting on their part to merit its 'continuance:' ' ' ' ' ? :??-??--.-? ? They beg also to intimate that at the request of a number of iulluential stockholders, they have been induced to maki; ar rangements for resuming business as shcep'and cuttle sales men. In making this announcement they wish it to be understood that thuy enter the Held free and untrammelled, having no bid debts in their books, and consequently no hud eiutlmner* to sup port; neither have they any stock speculations (directly or in directly), to clash with tho interests or their constituents; which independent position they mean to maintain, as they in tend to sell for cash only ; and to render account sales 'with atsh at the close of every sale (except in large transactions ? where the vendor himself may think fit to take acceptances, in which case he will do so at his own risk). They arc convinced that this is the true and legitimate mode Df conducting sales. Let the butcher who has not cash to pur Bhasc 10 or 15 cattle, as under the present system, buv 5 or uven 2, (for which every possible facility will be given), and he will thus buy for cash the number he rrnllij watit.i, at the .same price as he can at present buy for crnlit a number Ac tloex not require, and the vendor who requires immediate cash w' ' pocket 2\ per cent, by tho change. Parties favoring M. M'Caw and Another with stock for s a . may depend upon the greatest care being taken in draughting it and preparing it for sale, and every effort being made to rea lise the top price of the day. All slock sent to them will bo duly advertised, and circulars -ent to every butcher in the City and Suburbs, free of charge to :he vendor in every ease where the Commission amounts to 'our times the expenses, M. M'Caw will attend the yards daily, on and after the 1st February, and from his well known ability as a jud'.;e and sales nan of Stock, together with the principles upon which the Firm ?ropose to conduct that branch or their business, they coiifl lently anticipate that amount of support it shall ever'be their mdeavor to merit. N.B.— In consequence of resuming tho Cattle trade, the d-iily lore sales will in future commence at 11 o'clock. These ar angements will not interfere with their private sales, as they lave engaged very able assistance in that branch of their busi less ; nnd their mode of conducting it is simply to fix a fair nakot value upon oieh animal, and neither to ask' more nor take ess, having followed which plan since resuming 'business, it las been found to give the highest satisfaction to both buyer ind seller. ? 22 785 til (*r NrOJ'ICE TO JI111D FANCIERS.— The Subscriber rcNjwet I fully informs the Lovers of Sweet Singing Birds and the 'ublic in general that he has just arrived with 500 Saxony 3ANA1UES raised at the Iluru Mountains, in Germany, and elected by the owner himself for their musical quality.
