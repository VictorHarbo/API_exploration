MBTROPOLITAN^StJBURBAN PROVINCE. POLLING DAY, SATURDAY, MAY 10th, 1024., v Having nominated as an endorsed Na tional Candidate, I respectfully, ask the electors to accord their vote iu my favor thus ???— ' FRANKLIN, J. T. .... .. .. 1 and the 4 other National candidates in or der of your preference. I have been a ujember of, the Perth City Couucil for twenty years, and: at the ex traordinary election held , ou 18th May, 1923, was returned as Mayor, and veeleut ed. at the annual election in November last. ?..-,,....'? ... I have always taken an active interest in publio life, as my record shows. I am a strong supporter of the immigration scheme, feeling sure that it is the only praotioal way by which we can obtain the neoesaary population to .develop our vast resouroea and keep the State,' wnat . we are all anxious for, ' - ' A WHITE AUSTRALIA. \ The group settlement scheme is an ad mirable one, but I would urge the Govern ment to see that all necessary preparations are made for the accommodation of the migrants before their arrival, thus avoid ing unnecessary delay and expense to the State, as they should be placed on their holding at the earliest possible time. I hear that there are a number of migrants kept waiting some weeks for land to go on. This should not be. I think more care should be taken in the selection of mi grants. ' Every effort should be made to bring them from the rural districts of Great- Britain, so that when they go on to a group they will the better understand the work. If this is not done we shall hav.e our towns full of unemployed and sections of the groups vacant. ? , I am strongly in favor of the* resump tion by the State of suitable lands for ag ricttltural purposes, which, at' the present time, are lying idle. and undeveloped, and adjacent to bur railway*, with a view; of cutting up into reasonable areas and sell ing upon extended terms to those who may he arflqous to go on the land. Those in the State should have an opportunity of pur* chasing If theytdasire. This would inorease the revenue of the railways and give the people a nearer, market for their goods. . ' ,'??/ ?? ? ?NORTH-WEST.''- : '?.. M returned I. would give strong support to any practical scheme for the deveibp men of our great 'North-West. We cannot afford to disregard the danger of leaving this, great area unpopulated- ' PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ' ?:;^:. -industries.';:; .(? ?????-. ? W^e must 'give every assistance in the doTalopm«nt and «ite£aw»; ot , oui* . primary quenca, eipand at a pr^poxti^naj tate.

I have at all times ' supported the supply ing of the metropolitan area with HiUs water, and am a strong supporter of the Canning Hills scheme. Thie should have been installed long before , ths war, and could have been constructed for half the 'eost that we will now. have to. pay. The serious shortage of water would then have been obviated. , - J am in favor of, the -work being pushed on so that, at the earliest possible moment, the \people may be assured of a copious supply. The use of the bore water should be discontinued. ? ?, .??. . . TRAMWAYS, .. These should be extended to all suburbs. if , after investigations have been made ' by our experts, the extessiou is recommended as a payable proposition. ' GOOD ROADS. I would support a Bill for the proper oonHtruotion and maintenance of our main roads., Thia,oannot be put ofiE.muoh. longer, as the. increased' motor traffic 'will'' make it compulsory. Every effort must be made to cope with the difficulty. Good. roads will bring farmers more, in touch' with the com fofts of civilisation, give them better faci UtieB for mark etiiig.and railing, and, being cheaper than railways, -will be a lesser bur den on the taxpayer. . Publio utilities; such as water, tram ways, electricity and 'gas, good main roads, etc., should, be administered bv electiy.e boards appoiut6d bv th« ? ratepayers. ' ' J would support an Act if brought in for this purpose, but -!P.ve wouJd have to bo taken to see that the; melropolitan area is not penalised, and that a .fair, pries is plac ed on the undertaking. I am ppppeed ,tp ..... - STATE TRADING CONCERNS..,. Private enterprise could aiid vroUld han dle these industries more economically if they 'were assured that the (?*-verninent were not to be 'corapetii'brs. ' From my exirjeticnce. in the Municipal .Council' I' realise the urgent necessity tor a New Municipal Act to supersede the pre sent obsolete, and in many sections un workable, Act. ? ? : ? We also 'want' a , ' ???&??' . ; , TOWN PLANNING ACT - ?:?,;.' passed. : Both municipal and to wn-plauuing Acts have been . prepared, and promises have been made that they would be brought be fore Parliament, but without result! ? ? If elected I would' use every effort to have them tabled. REDISTRIBUTION .OF SEATS BILL. I would support and aefc with this iu view, as it -would give more equitable re presentation. For example, Menzies has one member to represent 4f7 electors— Su- biaco one member to ^present 9,000 elec tors. I am also in favor of . COMPULSORY ENROLMENT AND VOTING. for both Houses. State ajid Federal Gov ernments should co-operate, thus making a huge saving to the taxpayers. RETENTION OF THE UPPER HOUSE. Abundant evidence may be adduced to prove the superior stability and .practical results secured by having two Houses, as opposed to a single Chamber. Whilst I j am not prepared to defend a nominee or j hereditary Upper House, it is beyond ques- j tion that the sober deliberations of a Chain- ' her elected by practically every house- 1 holder in the State have been uniformly ELECTION NOTICES, beneficial to the ptople of Western Aus tralia. Nveer has legislation of a democratic sharxoter, bean defeated by the Legislative Council in defiance of the wishes of the erencval community. These simple and pa tent facts deserve to bo specially stressed at c time like the present, when regret tabl* dissensions in the ranka of those who view with apprehension the encroachments of tVe functions and activities of Govern ment, have helped to power a party pledg ed to extend and intensify such governmen tal interference to the grave detriment of our industrial and commercial progresB. At %ueh a, critical .'.rncture in the affairs of our State it is imperative . that your re preBcntataives in the Legislative Council should pledge themselves to safeguard the general interests of the people by acting as an ffective brake on those socialistic ex periments which paait experience has proved costly and disastrous.
