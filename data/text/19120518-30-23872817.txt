Will you tell me if there is any way to permanently destroy a disfiguring growth of superfluous hair on my face and arms?. I am 55 years old an'd the growth is very had. My daughter, who is 22, is similarly troubled. I have been told that depilatories r,re worthless, and that nothing is effective except' the electric needle, which I hesitate to try, at I am told' it is painful. I should be glad ii you would pive m syour adsice. FRANCES B. You are wise to avoid the electric needle. It is a dangerous operation, and besides be ingf painful often leaves severe scars.- I have frequently stated in these columns that it is better to endure the annoyance than to suffer the pain of the electric needle. I have also warned inquirers against depilatories, which are worse than useless because they cause.the hair to grow out thicker than be fore. Recently, however, I have received some en thusiastic and reliable reports about a new method (originating in France) which has been successfully used in this country. I do not know its name, but a friend of mine who received a complete cure by its use told me that she would gladly furnish full par ticulars, without charge, to anyone who would -write her. If you will write to Katherine B. Firman (Dept. 1925) 133 Orford-street, London, W., Eng., enclosing two penny stamps for reply. and .meitioning my -advice, she wvill send you, quite free of nil cost, complete informa tion which will undoubtedly enable you to be permanently rid of all trace of the ble inislh.
