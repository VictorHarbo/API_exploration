INTRODUCTION. The month has been spent in recess, but despite the Christmas and New Year's holiday politicians have been busy with their preparations for the general election which is shortly to take place. We have now three declared political parties before the country, as the Ministerial "Corner" has formally detached itself from the Government ; Ins foimed i liberil association, his j uhhshed i programme, and Ins appcalod to tho electors for support lho party adheres to the old platfoim of tho Ministry £,enorally, but aa re0irds reform it opposes tho fivo years noimneo JIouso, and abandons tho pUbibrite, and asks for a House to bo elected by the ratepayers, with a qualification yet to bo determined, deadlocks if they occur to bo settled by a double dissolution and tho Norwegian scheme Tho manifesto de- clares for "conciliation" rather than " extremes, ' and says that tho groa went of its scheme is that it can bo car ned | Mr Munro is tho leader of tho party, and successful raootings havo boon lield at Carlton and Eaglehawk Tho direct Opposition havo also boen active Messrs Murray Smith, Zox, Kerferd, Bent, J G Duûy, Josoph Joños, and other members havo mado a tom oc tho provinces, speaking at CasWomaino, Maryborough, Talbot, Camperdown, etc , and in all places thoy havo beon woll rû ccived Lven in tho Ministerial strong holds a willingness was displayed to liston to the Opposition view of tho situation An cxecutn e committee has been formed by the Opposition to look after tho elec- tions, with Mr Service as chairman and Mr Bent as hon secretary, and arrange- ments aro busily proceeding Ministers havo been comparatively inactivo, and havo only appeared on tho platform at Jytglelnrok. ihoy aro tongue tied to a great extont by tho circumstance that wmlo they havo obtained an appeal to testwhether the House was m accord with the country when it failed to pass their Reform Bul, they mean to abandon that measure themselves Thoy havo indi- cated that the five years nomineo House must be surrendered, and that thoy will {,0 to tho constituencies on the Gth clause (paymont on tho votos of the Assembly only) and the plébiscite. It is obviously inconsistent, however, toformally abandon the bill while the House, which was not allowed to amend it, and TV luch is to bo punished foi rejecting it, is sitting The Reform and Protection Loaguo, howovor, which supports tho Ministry, is actively at v ork issuing manifestoes and selecting candidates On Parliament resuming it3 sittings on Tuesday last the date of tho dissolution was dehnitoly fixed for the átli or 5th of February next Tlio revenue returns for the quarter are unhappily most unfavouiable The gioss amount-£1,059,000-is £243,200 less than the Treasurer's estimato, and is £183,200 in excess of tho expenditure of the quarter The deficiency is all down the line The stamp tax, which is now being enforced, wiU do something to relievo tho Treasury from its embarrass- ment, but tho financial prospects of tho Government are far from cheering Some agitation has been caused by the dispute in winch Sir Bryan O'Loghlen imohed the Government and the banks In June last Sir Bryan, as acting head of the Government, after a great deal of railing and charges of '. con- spiracy," ga'\o a six months' notice to termvnato the contract with tho Associated Banks for tho keeping of the Government account In De- cember the Chiof Secretary, finding that ho nas overdrawn to tho extent of a quarter of a million, dosirod to renew tho contract, but tho banks asked that a twelve months' notico should bo given in future, and that certain bookkeeping changes should bo made. Mr. Berry was obstinate for a month, and thon yielded. Tho banks aro to bo credited with not takmgadv antago of tho money market, and exacting botter terms from the Govern- ment, but their forbearance has not saved them from animadversion, and from threats that tho Government will, as a measuro of retaliation, proposo a National Bank. The harv est is now well advanced, and a heavy yield can bo depended upon Victoria alone it is calculated will havo horn 150,000 to 200,000 tons for export, and this will bo her first appearanco as a wheat exporter on a considoiablo scale m the maikets of the woild SOCIAL Immediately after the last mail left we entered upon our Christmas and New Year's holidajs Tho season waa observed in our DBiial antipodal st) le Tho temperature waa rather warm, but not so oppresaiv e as to deter the people from enjoj nig their customary out of door recreations Christmas D ly itself waa kept m a quiet way There w H divino ser Mee in the Anglican churches and num<>rou9 Sundaj school picnics Crowds visited the shores of the ki), and marino excursions wer j as popular aa ever lhe Intercolonial Juvenile Industrial Lxhibition in the new Taetern Market, proved a novel and a very meat attraction In the evening a variety of sacred concerts were "tien, chief amongst which waa the perfoimanee of the "Messiah" by the Philharmonic Society in ?the Town hall On Boxing Day public patron- age was divided amongst the intercolonial cricket match-Victoria v.

A public meeting waa held in the Town hall on the 9th inst to initiate a fund for the relief of the distress prevailing in Ireland The chair was taken by the mayor, and a considerable number of influential citizens were accommodated on the platform Ad- dresses were delivered by Sir John OShanaasy, Sir Charles MacWahon, Sir Bryan OLoghlen, and Beveral members of Parliament, and several resolutions were proposed and earned without opposition A committee conaiBting of 15 gentlemen, to be presided over by the mayor, was appointed to receive subscriptions from various parts of the colony, and forward the amount col lectcd to its destination Before tho meeting terminated a subscription list waa opened in the hall, and a collection made amounting to over £1,000 Since then donationa have been coming m moat liberally. 1 he aggre- gate amount received to date ia £0,d55, of which £5,000 has been remitted by telegraph to the Lord Major of Dublin The Intercolonial Juvenile Exhibition continues to attract large numbera of people The attendance averages about 2.000 daily Concerts aro given in the building every night, and add greatly to the attractions of the exhibition The large and diversified collection of exhibits calla forth much ad miration The exhibition promises to prove a great aucçeas from all pointa of \ lew During the month we have been deprived by death of Mr Hugh M C Gemmell, an old and much respected colonist He was the senior partner of the well-known firm of Gemmell, Tuckett, and Co., auctioneers and timber brokers, Collins-street. About six months ago he was attacked by disease of the liver and jaundice, and he succumbed to that illness on Now Year's Day. Mr. Gemmell was the second son of Dr. Robert Gemmell, of White-hill and Bourtree-park, near Ayr, Scot- land, and was bom at Ayr on the 1st June, 1827\. He left his native land for Barbadoes in 1846, and became engaged in mercantile pursuits there and at Demerara, at which two places he resided altogether for about 10 years. _ In 1872 he married a daughter of E. S, Christiani, a judge, and in 1855 he re- turned to Scotland. After 12 months' sojourn in the old country, he came to Victoria, landing here in November, 1850 He was connected with the old and now extinct firm of Rae, Dickson, and Co., general merchants and soap and candle makers, and it was not until 1861 that he began as an auctioneer under the style of Gemmell, M'Call, and Co., which firm, in 18G7, merged into that of Gemmell, Tuckett, and Co. The deceased was of a very liberal disposition, and at one time he took an active part in the manage- ment of some of our local charitable institu- tions, but latterly his business demanded his almost exclusive attention. Very great regret has been expressed at the death of Mrs Oeorge Darrell (better known as Mrs. Robert Heir), a lady who had been long connected with the colonial stage. She was the daughter of Mr. James Cathcart, an excellent actor of the good old school, who for many years was well known in the north of England and in Ireland. After a long Illness from organic disease of the liver and kidneys, she died on the 3rd inst., at her resi- dence, Madeline-street, Carlton. 'J he initiatory step for the erection of the Anglican Cathedral, on the site of St Paul's Church, Swanston-street, was taken on the 30th nit , when the tender of Messrs Martin and Peacock for the foundations of a portion of the building was accepted. As the present school contiguous to the church has to be ro inoved before the work can be commenced, it is now in course of demolition. Church bazaars are no more novelties in Melbourne than anywhere else, but there never waa one held m our metropolis by the lewish portion of the community until this jcai. There are two Hebrew congregations in Melbourne, and both have erected laige synagogues at considerable exponso - one being in Bourke street west, and tho other in Albert-street. As the building funds of both vTêïe m arrears, tLSJ determined un noidlng a joint bu¡>aaf, and the Tadiea entered into the undertaking with spirit and energy. The bazaar was opened in the Town-hall on the 30th ult , and was continued for seven days Notwithstanding that it was the holiday sea- son, wo are glad to say that the financial result was satisfactory, and that the efioit vvu¿aàuccèsl , .h 4, , " ," The heroic conduct of Mrs. Maria Boldt, wife of Captain Boldt, of the German schooner Moorburg, has of late deservedly occupied some attention. The Moorburg, manned by a mate, four seamen, and a Chinese cook, sailed recently from China for Melbourne with a cargo of tea. During the voyage intensely hot weather was experienced. All the live stock on board died from the heat, and the four seamen also died one after the other. The captain and the mate were likewise ill, and the only one who did not suffer from sick- ness was the captain's wife. Mrs Boldt, although a thin, delicate-looking lady, proved equal to the occasion. Not only did she nurse the sick, but during a gale, which the schooner encountered after passing the Solomon Islands, also took her position at the helm, and, single handed, steered the vessel through the storm. Handsome pre sentations in recognition of her courage have been given to her by the Melbourne German community and by the insurance companies interested. Owing to frequent riotous outbreaks by the boys of the Jika Kefoianatory a board waa appointed some time ago to inquire into the management of tho institution After taking evidence and inspecting the reformatory, tho board came to the conclusion that the build- ing, being virtually a WI"B 0f Pentridge htoclrade, was altogether uuBuited for re- formatory pur po8eBi ftnd ai80 that a dif- ferent system, 0f management WAS required Hie result nlX8 been that the old superin- tendent lir^ been removed, and that a new man-On ptain Evans-boa been appointed in lils pla ¿Ci The boys havo also been trans lcrreu to some unoccupied buildings at Bal , i which were formerly used aB a lunatic aB5 «im.

The other, Walter White, a deck hand, also suffered severely, but recovered under careful treatment The beer in this instance was bottled by Mesara. 1 lt/gerald and Perrins On the same day Mrs Molloy, the wife of Dr Molloy, o' emerald-hill, fell suddenly ill after drinking some bottled beer, and lay for some time in a very precarious state. In each case tho poisoning seemed to result from strychnine, and strychnine was found in tho liquor which remained in the bottles from which Bush and Parsons drank. The matter calls for, and no doubt will receive, a searching inquiry. Another case of bushranging, compara tively of a mild character, has occurred in Gipps Land. On the afternoon of Thursday, the 15th inst, a French half- caste named George do Thouars stuck up the Holy Plains station, the property of Mr. John Crook, near Rosedale Ho was only armed with a single revolver, but it was sufficient to frighten some half a dozen station hands into thorough subjection. Thouars remained in possession of the station all night, and then departed in the morning on one of the station horsps He was formerly in the employ of Mr, Crooke, at Ina private resi- dence, Toorak, and waa dismissed. It is supposed that lie bailed up the station in the hope of finding Mr. Crooke there, and having revenge for lim dismissal The police have been on the offender s track for several days, but have aB yet been unable to eflect hiB capture On the 20th of December some of the fishermen of Paynsvill« Gipps Land manned a four oared t,ig and went out mto the bay to train for the local regatta Their names were Carstairs, P ilmer, barkley, and Cnnatie Tliey were accompanied by a boy named J CarBtairB as cox , and by a gul named Ada Scott 'Hie water was rather choppy and kept dashing into the boat, and although the fr iii crift was con tinuously bailed elie gradually filled nnd Bank about a quarter of a mile from land All could swim but Christie and the tiri Barkley threw an oar to the former but he seemed paralysed, and sank The tiri also sank twice but Barkley div ed and brought her up on each occasion In the meantime the boat waB righted but again turned over Hie girl and the little boy who had stuck to the boat, were then placed on the bottom of the floating craft and tne other man clung to her, vvhilst Carstairs and Barkley paddled her to ahore with their hands Nothing waa Been of the unfortunate man Christie and the body has not been recovered Christie leaves a wife and two children totally un provided for A tragedy occurred at Emerald hill on the OthinBt A young man named Win Wado, fireman on board the Suva had been paying attentions to a Miss Driver a domestic ser vant, and some quarrel or misunderstanding had taken place between them Wade brooded over the matter, and at last resorted toextreme measures Arming himself with a revolver, he went to the house where Miaa Driver waa employed, and found her alone Ile said, "Me are both going to die and presented the revolver The girl Bei/ed the weapon, and a struggle ensued Lventually she sue ceeded in running away M ade bred after her twice but miBsed, and followed her to a neighbour s hoUBe, where she found refuge ne then returned to her employ er a house, and there shot himself through the head Shortly aftcrwardB he was found lying m the passage, alive but with one side of his head mutilated, and before he could be taken to the hospital he died _ POLITICAL WVtPti trip lnnfc mn.il left Parliament had vvnen tne mae mun leie, luiiuuuuib i adjourned for the Christmas hohdajs, with the intention of resuming on the 20th Janu- ary to dispose of the remaining estimates, the programme being to prorogue about the 3rd february, the dissolution and general election to follow immediately afterwards Parliament resumed its sittings on the 20tn mst, and it was announced that tina pro- gramme would be adhered to A Railway Construction Bill is to bo tabled, though not with the intention of being passed, but a vote for permanent survejs of lines will be asked for. During the month, the note of preparation for the coming electoral campaign has been sounded in various parts of the colony, and thero is abundant evidence that there will be no lack of candidates A signifie mt event has been the formation of "Hie Liberal Association of Victoria ' Ibis body ima been organised by what is known as the "corner" party, and consists ol those liberals who do not agree with Mr Berrj s reform policy Hie follow ing manifesto baa been issued by the association - " Parliament being about to he dissolved, the time has arru ed w hen all who desire the welfire of Victoria should agree to sink minor diftcrencesj and unite for the purpose of securing useful, practicil, and necessary legislation It will be generally admittod that tbiB is not the time lor urging extreme views, but rather for the infusion of a spirit of mutual conciliation, so as to terminate the present criais and restore public confi- dence.

"A very great merit of any scheme of reform in the present critical state of the colony ia the probability of its being carried into law within a reasonable period of time To ínaiat, therefore, upon extreme measures, however captivating they mas' be, without I h? hope of giving them immediate effect, i but another method of prolonging indefinitely tho contentions that hate hitherto operated so injuriously upon our national enterprise and progresa A speedy settlement of this ve\od question ia the fervent aspiration of every vv ellwisher of the colony, inasmuch as every one admita that the protracted controversy upon the question of reform Ima had a very detrimental eûeçt. upon our trade and m dustn, "It is confidently believed that if the electors of the colony will agree to a practical meaBuro of reform, conceived in tho true spirit of an enlightened democracy, and unon the lines of the British Constitution, all that is required can be speedily obtained It ia therefore resolved that the first article of 'platform'of the association shall bç ,-.

departmental accounts in Melbourne, the Melbourne accounts being put in the position of those m the country districts on which no interest is paid Eventually Mr Berry instructed tho under treasurer to prepare an agreement with the banks carrying out the modifica tions of the old contract suggested by those institutions Mr Sjmonda has unofficially communicuted with the banks on the Bub ject It seems

States on the impolicy of that country maintaining the preaent piohibitorj dutiea on the f 1er woola of theae colonies and Mr George Colima Levey was aaked by the Melbourne chamber to make peraonal íepreBenrationa on the subject to the mein hers of the VlajH and Means Committ 2 of the House of Representatives, the body which would have to take the initiative m reduction or removal of the duties By the Californian mail just arrived the secretar} of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce has received several communications on the subject which possess PI interest for w<-ol"rowers Mr Leve} wntea from New \ork that a general consensúa of opinion exists amonffBt o'l men of business thero and at Boston in favour of a reduction, aa also amongst the woollen manufac urers He says that tue representatives in Congress of thoac northern states which aie upon or near the seaboard, including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Mastachusetts, Rhode Islind, Connecticut, New lork, Kow Jersey, and Pennsylvania, are in fuvour of reducing the duty from the present rate to 23, or at most S3 per cent ad valorem but that the members of the Vi ays and Means Committee are very much divided on the question, and some of them represent districts where the majority of the electors favour the retention of the duty, in the hope that in a few years the quility of the wool grown in their localities will be so improved that the manufacturers of the Eastern atatea will be able to purchase from American farmerB all the wool they require Mr Levey expresses the conviction that when- ever the A menean tariff is modified Austra han and New Zealand woola w ill share in the general reduction, but be is doubtful whether the present effort to single out wool will prove successful Ho bos, however, taken steps to bring under tho notice of the Way3 and Means Committee the many reasons why Australian and New Zealand wools should be treated exceptionally An article from the New Yoi K Era, enclosed by Mr. Levey, con eludes thus - " The great obstacle to a large and romu nerative commerce between tho United States and Australasia is the heavy import duty levied by our tariff upon tho wool, by vv hieb, under other circum8tances,our couaina would pay for their purchases in this market 'Ihe value of tho exports laat year from this country to Australia was 7,042 875dol the imports were only 785,733dol Vv ith no other nation in the world, excepting orly Russia, was the disproportion so great And the moat remarkable feature about these figures ia that the Bmallness of the imports is cauäed entirely by artificu1' causea The wool pro duction of Australia is worth a hundred million dollars per annum, and 95 per cent finds itslway to London, from vv hence it is diatnbuted amongat the woollen manufac hirers of the world, who have long anice discovered that without an admixturo of the fine woola which are best grown in Victoria, New South Wales, and 'Jasmania, it is impossible to make tho better descriptions of cloth Iho mill owners of this country aro juat as anxious as their competitors elsewhere to obtain Aus traban wool but thev are prevented by a prohibitory import.duty which amounts to hrrvppn SOand GO ner cent of the'nine of Oetween ou uncí uci per euu ui ino time, eil the article Without entering upon the vexed question of free trade and protection, it ia Bulhcient for our preaent puipoae to state that no politico'economist ever argued in favour of heavy imports upon raw material The abolition or reduction of the import duty upon wool would stimulate the domestic manufacture of cloth and woollens, would increase the export trade with Australia, and would strengthen the demand for home, grown wool, winch must alwajs form the Btaple with the manufacturera of thia countrv " The New York Chamber of Commerce ap pointed a special committeo to consider the representations of the Australian chambers, and they brought up a report, which was adopted by the general bod}, and which waa as follows - " Rej ort of the Committee on Toreigii Com merce and the Revenue Laws " To the Chamber of Commeice " Your committee, to whom Ima been re ferred the memorial of the Chambers of Commerce of Australia and New Zealand, drawing attention to the great impediment thrown in the way of a mutually beneficial intercourse between the United States and those colonies by the exorbitant im- port duties imposed by our preaent tariff on the staple production of those colonies, wool, do respectfully report that there can be no question of the fact that thoso duties, equalling on ad valoiem duty of from 50 to 75 per centum, form an insuperable obstacle (and we may say the only obstacle) to the natural development of our commerce with those countries, which, like our weaterly coast, havo m our short lifetime risen from insignificant settlements to a high com- mercial and national importance with coun- tries whose common origin and language, and whose wanta would seem to indicate the moat abundant field foran active and mutually bene- ficial intercourse with our country. Your committee deem it unnecessary to enlarge upon these facts, which are so juatly com- plained of by their fellow-BUffercra on the other hémisphère, and thoy may be allowed to point out that this Chamber has on all occasiona where the alteration of our preaent tariff baa been under consideration, andmost notably during the last regular session of congress, drawn the attention of that body to the exorbitant dutieB on wool, aa one of the main grievances, and asa niostonerous de- triment not only to our foreign commerce but also to our large woollen industry and commercial marine 1 rom the fact that a project of a new tariff bill, which was sub nutted to the House of Representative at the last re-ular session but w Indi failed to pasä contained n sensible reduction and a moat mil ortant equalisation of those duties your committee feel encoura ed to hope that the general amendment of our tanti which it is to be hoi ed ,vdl be carried out at the comm session, wnl include cflective relief on ti e o 1 remises Your committee therefore recom metida the adoption of the folio» nn reao lutiona -Resolved that tina committee fully acl nowlcd"C3 the justice ot the com plaints 01 the

Agricultural aud Horticultural Society The long and difheu't operat on of judging took place last week in the ce"ars underneath the new German Club There is one fact which waa emphasiaed over and over again, and that was the marked improvement which is taking place in the character of Australian wines We say Austral an because the ex babilion was not limited to South Australia, and because New South Wales baa carried off severo' important pnzea Indeed, in the lighter deacnption of white wines the parent colony well nigh monopolised the awards The cup, however, is kept in the colony, and has fallen to the lot of Mr Joseph Gilbert of Pusey vale 1 his prize, which ia given for a different character of wine each year, waa this year offered for the best sample of 200 gallona of light red There were eight entries, und the judgeB selected as the best a wine made by Mr Gilbert in tho y ear 1873, from Scyras and Carbenct grapes The judges were, however Bomewhat disappointed with the

Hardy B wine being made m 1870 from the Dorad 'la grape grown at li'itara, and Mr Auld a in 187G, from the Verdeilho, Palomino, and iokay grapes, grown at Aul daua These were very satisfactory wines 'lhere were Borne good full bodied vvinea shown Messrs S Smith and Son and W Salter and Son, of Angaston, 1 Hardy, of Banl side, being the principal pri/e takers In thia department there waa a little con fusion in the exhibits, some of a claret or burgund} tjpe being placed among the full bodied vvinea, and vice vaia In several instances the judges transferred them from one claas to another, but in one par ticular inBtance an exhibit got shut out of all classes, and so lost all chance of win- ning a pme A remarkable fact waa brought under our notice-namely, that Messrs Davies and Co s wine, which carried off the pn/e in class 19 which required the ex- hibits to be full bodied red, when tested only registered 11 per cent of Bpint It was made in the } ear 1878 from the Hermitage grape, and was undoubtedly a splendid wine, though most judges w ould consider it contained more than the quantity of spirit just mentioned A white sweet wine made by Salter and Son. of Angaston, was greatly appreciated, ana was regarded aB a perfect wine for ladies 'Hie gre itest interest centred in the exhibits shown under c1 isa 8, the pri/e m which-a silver medal-vtaa offered for the best white wine

Cess- nock, New South Wales, was greatly ad- mired for its brilliant amber colour and ita dehcioua bouquet, and m the opinion of two or three connoisseurs it waa thought to be moat worthy of the medal It was made from the Pineau grape, in the Hunter River dia trict, m the yeal 187G, ond the exlubitora giv e the follow ing information in their certi- ficate as to their mode of manufacture - " W e principally adopt the German syatem m wine making We prune the vines low to the ground, and allow tho grapea to shrivel before we begin to pick them for wine mal rag \\\ e use an ordinary crusher for bursting the grapes, and an ordinary lever press to separate the juice four samples from Mr Aulds vineyard and two from Mr Hardys were deserveiUy commended It seemed, however, clear, from the various ex- hibits brought to"ether upon this occasion that aIthout.li our vvinetmkers can make a good light vv me, y et the palm for thi3 descnp tion of wine will have to be conceded to New South Wales while for the fuller bodied wines South AuBtraba will permanently re tam the pre eminence T he difference in the climate of the two colonies will fix these special characteristics of their winea A sample of

through The preaent month, however, baa been somewhat of an exception in that reapect aa during tlio last fortnight at least a considerable amount of activity has been noticeable, which may bo accounted for in a great measure by the revival from the loat two yeara depression, which has been steadily going on, consequent on the improvement and revival of trade in England and America, the splendid harvest and the rich crops with which wo have been blessed, the riso in wool, and an anticipated cheap money market all of which combined are quite sufficient to give ua a taste of returning prosperity, despite anything a Berry Ministry could do to destroy our commerce and our status amongst the other colonies The publication of our trade returns of the past year shows that the ímnorts at the port of Melbourne for the vear ending December 27 amounted to £11,677,565 while the exporta were £10,904,509 During the previoua year the imports and exports wore respectively A12.98G.777 and £12,751,579 It will thus bo eeen that there has been a heavy falling off in both branches of trade, the total amount- ing to over £3,000,000, but though the decline ia BO very considerable, there ia some con eolation m tho fact that the balance is on ti e n "ht side, and that our incomings are larger than our outgoings Tho revenue retnrna for the laat quarter of the year naturally enough become of interest, in tho face of the last half y ear s new taxation in a protective direction lo estimate pro perly the signal and comple e failure which these returns BIIOW, it muat not be forgotten that the best if not the only time to obt_.ui revenue from protective taxation ia when the imposition is first made, as merchants at that period have not had sufficient time to stop the importation of gooda affected in that direction, or open up new chau ids in which to operate W hat then do we find disclosed in the Becond quarter of the Berty Govern ment s new tan'l ' W tiythis,thatthequartera

referred to waa £J0 030 less than in the laat quarter of 1S7S and aa the decreaso in tho whole of this years Customs revenue as compared with last was £1117 J, it ia -nut unreal on able to attribute the whole of that deficiency to a tariff lgnorantly designed hy the Govern- ment to raise rev enuc, rather than to check ita inilux-and that too in the face of the enormoua amounts paid into the Treasury in anticipation of an alteration m the duties, which mifcht tell on the firat quarter of ita operations, but scarcely at all on the second A peruaal of the gold returns for 1879, which appear in another column, will doubtless ali ord some interest With a harvest so bountiful as the present is, and which places the colony m the poaition of being enabled to export grain largely, our means of exportation have, naturally enough, formed the subject of discussion, and here, also, the destruc- tive nature of a protective policy has become apparent, for as it is the intention of auch a policy to restrict Bhippmg from visiting our ports, the consequence is, when tonnage IB required, we have not only to nay extreme ratea, which we bav e no objection to when our neighbours bave to do the same, but the worst orawback is the difficulty of getting slims at any price, and while waiting for their appearance, stocks accumulate, the market ia pressed, heavy loatcs are incurred, and thus the hopes of the farmers, taught to look for better things from a Byatetn which, w hilo it certainly could do them no good, ha3 done and will continue to do them an im \- _.,.._* i-",a ".""i Willi mense

Business has been moro active, the companies dealt fa more Humorous, and vciy largo advances in market value havo been established. Tho improvement is mainly duo to con. tiuued good yields in tho Band and Albion, and fuither discoveries on tho same line at Sebastopol (Ballarat), to good prospects at Mount Greenock, and to the rich yields of tbo Kew Chum Consolidated, and the opening up of a new lino of reef in the Johnson's, Sandhurst. At Balls1 at great activity has provailcd and a limber of new companies aro rapidly putting down ehr'ti to prospect for the continuation of tbo Band and Albion lode, whilo at Sandhurst the com- panies north of JoliDBonV, which havo been merely shepherding for j ears past, aro now resuming active operations. The new plant being erected at tlio sout bom shHtof the Garden Gully United, and tbo drainage of tho Uno now being effected bj* the Londondcrrj*. will enable much moro work to be done In the South Garden Gully claims. Taken altogether, tho pro* specie at Sandhurst and Ballarat aro decidedly better. Talbot, Majorca, and Homebush all promise well. Stawell continues very depressed. Littlo change In price or business doing In the shares of mining com* panics of other districts. Tho market for debentures, bank, and gas shares has been firm, and transactions of moderato extent. Debentures command previous ratea, and are in abort supply. National Bank shares have been in favour, and risen ; not much change hi other banks. The shareholders of the Australian and European are to receive at tho rate of 32s. per sbaro (either in Commercial Bank shares at par or in csah os ananged), and interest at same rate as Commercial Bank div idend from 1st Octobor last. Tho rates of interest and deposit continue unchanged, but money is coming into tho banks moro freely, and it Eccmcd probable that thoso would soon be in a position to reduce the rates of interest oii'deposlts. in consequence, however, of tho Bank of Kow South Wales having withdrawn from the foiut a^reomont u iib the other .b.^oks. tho reduction is now less certain. Little chango in Insurance shard, except a small rise in Southern, and that tho Colonial Mutual have prrcbased the business of the Victoria Perma- nent lire.
