The ship is in good order and very clean, thus accounting in a g'eat measure foe.- the healthy state of the passefigfiM. J.'iring one ?.f tb« licnvy N.W. squalls tlmt visited Hobson's Day on Friday night, tho ship Glencoe drove foul of the barquo Solaria, carry ing away the jibbootn and doing other minor- damage. Tho Glencoe suffered more, having carried away a considerable portion of the bul warks nnd stancheons on the starbonrd side, na also studding-sail booms. During the afternoon- of tho (lay previous the ship Donald M'Kny lost an anchor and thirty fathoms of chain ; and several vessels drove considerably. The barque A. H. Badger, from Cnlcutto, has brought, in excellent order and condition, for the Acclimatization Society, the following ani mals : — Two axis deer, two hog deer, four Indian pheasants, and four grey partridges.

Collision and Loss op Life. — The Hobart Town Advertiser states that on Thursday a colli sion took place in Half-Moon Bay, between the brig Relianco and schooner Salcomhe Castle, - both vessels just arrived from New Zealand. A portion of the bulwarks and stanchions of tho Salcomhe Castle, and the jibhoom aud cutwater of the Reliance were carried away. Pilot Bleach, who at the time had charge of tlie Snlcombo Castle, alleges that the blame must be attached solely to the master of the Reliance. This Cnp- tain Riddcil denies, nnd nn investigation will take place. A young man named James Faesse, a- native of Denmark, aged 22 years, whilst clear ing away the wreck from the bowsprit of the Reliance, fell overboard and was drowned. The barque Harrietts Nathan, after a - run of seven days, arrived from Melbourne, on Thursdny, with a cargo of 300 sheep. Captain. Lloyd reports that on Friday, the 17th instant, at noon, W'aterhouse Island being distant twelve miles, passed n portion of a wreck which hnd evidently not been in the water any time.

To Captain Ollard, of the barquo Bosphorus, we are indebted for Mauritius papers to the 23rd. of June. In a mutilated copy cf one of the 17th of J une, in speaking of Madagascar, states that tho wife oi tlie lato king is now reigning, and that the ad dutiable rates on imports and ex ports are to bo again levied, thus entirely ex-, eluding free trade. The Bosphorus has hnd strong NAV. gales since passing Capo Leuwin. Captain Ollard reports, that on the dny of his departure from Mauritius the P. nnd O. Com pany's mnil steamer arrived, hut ivas placed iu quarantine, the rumoured reason assigned being that smallpox had made its appearance amongst some of the passengers. The Minna was loading cargo at Mauritius for Melbourne at our last advices. The brig Racer arrived at Booby Island- on tlie 19f.h May, at five p.m., landed one bag of bread, saw two ships leaving the island, found by tlieir reports on shore to- be the English ship Racer, bound to Bata via, nnd the French ship Veloro, both from Melbourne.
