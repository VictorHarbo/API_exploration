StUIinjc and Co. _ ' MISCELLANEOUS. ?The St. Do'stak.— The time occupied by the SL Dunstan in clearing the English Channel was 51 daya, consequently when this is considered her \- chance of making a smart passage was lost by such detention. She was 00 days to the Line, having after leaving the Channel experienced un usually fine weather, which is reported to have predominated during the passage until passing the longitude of Cape Leu win, since which period it hasbeen unsettled. THE Ismyr.— The Ismyr is a very fane bngan tine, which arrived from Port Louis early on the morning of the 17th. She is laden with sugar, and called here for orders. Captain Summers favoured the press with later papers. The Havilah.— Captain Saunders has expe rienced fine weather throughout the trip. He . reports passing the steamer City of Sydney off Cape Northumberland on Wednesday morning. She was boarded at an early hour on Friday morning, and shortly after daylight she steamed over the 1)ftr. Tjb* ClaramoJjt.— The London pilot left the above ship on October 1*-, and during the voyage out, in consequence of meeting with light, variable, and unsteady winds the vessel's progress 'las 'been considerably retarded, although the passage was completed in less than the average number of days. Captain Mclntosh has on several occasions visited the colonies, having been at Adelaide last hi charge of the Oriental, a ship which brought out immigrants. The following vessels have been communicated with during the voyage:— Oi November 11, in lat, 6' 51' J$., long. 24* 55' W. ; signalled the American shin. Edward, from Liverpool to Calcutta; on 'Noveniber 14. in lat. «* 21' E, long. 24' 38 W., \- signalled the barque Victoria, from London, 30 days out, bound to Kurrachee; on November 15, in tat. 5* 2' N., long. 25*41* W., theDanish ship George F. Hurlbert, from Cardiff, bound to Monte Video, 42 days out; on November Id, in lat. 3* C ? N., long. 2*27' W.. the ship Nepaul, from Cardiff, and the ship Lobelia, outward bound, destinations unknown; on November 19, in lar. 3'31'S., long. '31*4' W:, the British barque Brothers, 41 days out, -fiom London, bound to Buenos Ayres.; on No ?berber 25. in tat. 21* 5' S, long. SS* 2T W.. -'signalled the Dutch barque Sch#onderloo, from Rotterdam, bound to Batavia, 58 days out: same ? 'day the British barque Granton, from London, 45 days out, bound to Cape Town; on December 3, ? Irilat3l'r2' S., long. 20' 49' W.,the Dutch barque Herman, outward bound; on December 15, in fat. 3r3tf S., long. 12° SO' E . spoke the bng Bertha, from Bergen, bound to Hongkong, 97 days out ; on December 2L in lat. 30'4:r S., ipnz. 34' T E.,the British barque Chillingham, 7o days out, from London, bound to Madras. . Thk Main.— This vessel was towed to Lights Passage on Friday morning, and will be moored .in :harbour without delay, having received orders to discharge cargo here. . . -? The AmaKD a.— Orders have been received ior the above barque to proceed into harbour. The . pilot.boarded her last evening in order to prepare tar the morning's tide. -..-.. ' The Loss of the Oscab.— Ib the enquiry into . the conduct of Pilot M'Tagzart, in connection with the Ios3 of the Oscar, at Invercargill, Captain Stewart gave the following evidence:— The engines were stopped when the pilot came on board, and the Oscar was going about two knots. t 'Whea I saw him on deck, I ordered to go quite slow, and gave up the command to him as soon as ? lie came on the bridge. The first command he gave was to starboard the helm. I told him he ?*» wrong, which he saw at once, and gave orders to port-.Tie said 'port' repeatedly. The beacona for crossingthe outer bar were then open. I asked Mm twice whether the vessel was not too far over on the north side of the channel, and if he had — been sounding the channel well. He told me he had, and that were in the we deepest water He then . fold me to go full speed, and the vessel had got full speed, at least eleven knots an hour, not over there minutes when she struck. We got a stream-anchor away with a hawser, from the starboard, hove it well t»ut with the capstan; we reyaned tb*;«igui«« full speed, but could not get her ou a point to the southward; but I don't tmnk .the vessel ever moved. I waited till after high water, when, seeing there, were n$ hopes of getting her off thatSae, I went for assistance. Met the lighten on the rarer, and got then to lighten thaStesselr I fjeturned about. 8 p.m., jand RBPTtlj afterwards wjs called by the chief engineer into trjf main hold, to sec a butt that was started, and the water nLshing rapidly into the vessel. I also found two ot the main beams forced up ; the stanchions much bent, the keel much up, and I ma tc myself sure the ship's back was frokeii. Happening to have two master- mariners on' board, I called tliem down, and they surveyed the vessel. While engaged surveying, we found another larjre rent on the port side, apparently from the keel up as far as the main deck. Seeing there was no chance of saving the ship, or getting her off again, I ordered all the passengers off, and landed them by the boat*, except a few who volunteered to get out stores, &c.; I had ? been in the river one rOya^e before, and was not so conversant with the channel as to pilot my own ship. I knew, how-': ever, that the course was decidedly wrong. The1 Oscar was totally wrecked, and is Iving about her own length ahead of the pilot station, on what I call the North Sand. As far as I could see, the pilot was perfectly sober. He told me he was well acquainted with the channel; and his order to go ahead full speed gave me more confidence, as I thought he had teen soundinp'the channel care fully. Directly the vessel struck, I had the engines stopped. Had I had no pilot, I could have taken the vessel to a safe, though not the usual, anchorage.' _ VESSELS IN HARBOUR.
