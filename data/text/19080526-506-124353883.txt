Fairly large stocks are on hand, but lipht supplies are anticipated during the week, owing to the rough weather along the coast. There wa3 very littlc_ Hunter TCiver lucerne on tho wharf. 'Quotations were unaltered, prime selling nt £i- to £5 15s. At auction the quotations £4 6s to £0 10s. The South Australian Commercial Agent wired from London on May 21 to his Government: 'February ship ment of wheat hold for 3Ss. ; quiet ; ? firm.' ? | In the Melbourne market at the end of last work, business in wheat was slow, with the strain quoted at ?!.; 6=Jd per bushel.

Gorman boot (89 per cent.) sugar is quoted in the Home market at lis 2d nor cwt., showing a recovery of id on the week; while first marks granulated f-o.b. Hamburg aro 13s per cwt., being 4d lower. Tho supply of local chaff was hardly equal to tho domand, with the result ?that important cuts wers easy of clear ance. Local chaff was quoted £o to £6 10s, Adelaide to £7 10s, and Vic torian to £7 5s per ton. Potatoes and onions sold firmly at unchanged rates.

Professor Angus, giving evidence be fore the South Australian 'Wheat Com mision said tho adoption of tho olcva tor sy.stnm would mean a great saving in handling for railage and shipment, and everything but the amount of capi tal required was in favor of tho al teration. Even if it cost £100, OCO to fit up Ports Adelaide, Wallaroo, and Pirio with elevators, ho believed it would be an advantago to do so. The Tasmanian apples by the Sue vic havo been sold in London from 5s Gd to 8s Gd, but tho Cox's brought from 13s 6d to 14s Od.

Canada's exports of wheat in Janu ary wcro 4,793,CS1 bushels, making the total since April 1, 1907 (ten months) 38,451„770 bushels, of which 38,035,000 bushels wore sent to the United King dom. Of flour tho oxports in Janu ary were 192,329 barrels, and for the ten months 1,089,013 barrels; the total of wheat and illour for tho 10 montli3 ended January 31 is, therefore, 050,000 buslieb, or 5,75G,000 quarters, which is the largest total for this period over recorded. According to cables from London the wheat markets arc depressed owing to large arrivals off coast, and the line weather now experienced In England. Prioes nominally are fairly steady, but thero is 110 activity in the de mand. For Victorian January ship ment 37s 3d is asked, while for South Australian February shipment tho quo tation is 37s Gd por quarter. For an April steamer parcc-1 37s 2d has been I'did. Thero is a fair demand for Australian wheat on spot at 39s to 40s. Flour is dull. Australian 011 spot is offering , in London fullv Is lower on tho wcok at 26s to 26s Gd per sack.

Speaking 011 the European wiieat outlook, 'BoDrhohm,' of April 16, said : — ,'It seem'; reasonnhle to think that we havo got over the pressure of the .Argentina surplus, and that we are nc)w entering a period of smaller ship ments. It is qu;tr- within the bounds of probability that the South Ameri can Republic will not he able to ship more than 450.000 quarters to 475,000 quarter.-; per week to Europe during the coming three to four months; it is also, we believe, likely that tho ship ments from all other countries, except America and Canada, will not exceed, if they reach, ^10,000 quarters; thus, if the supply is to be kept equal to tlie demand, America and Canada would have to furnish about 4.'0.r;J0 quarters per week, n quantity which appears to be entirely beyond their powers.' A large batch of agricultural labor ers, who have been granted assisted passnges by the State's immigration agents in the United Kingdom, are to arrive by tho R.M.S- O route,-, which is expected in Sydney on May 30. The Intelligence Department has' for somo time pnst been taking stops to obtain reports from employers with whom assisted immigrants have been placed, and although farmers, as a general rule, have little time for correspond ence, some of them have gone to con- j side-able _ length in .. expressing ? their. 1 appreciation' of ' the men whom they | have obtained in this way. There is ! every cvid^co 'now that careful selec tion is being made by the Immigra tion agents, and that tho right stamp of man is coming forward. Agricul turists who are in need of farm hands are invited to communicate at once with the Intelligence Department, in order that their names mav be noted for supply from tho Orontes shipment. In giving evidence on the wheat standard before tho South Australian Wheat Commission. Professor Angus expressed the opinion that it would, perhaps, be better to put the fixing of the standard above suspicion by placing it in other hands than those of persons interested in the corn trade. IT a special independent wiieat stan dard committee wore appointed it would be more acceptable to the farm ers who would then perhaps not be so indifTorent in the matter of sending samples. He had been informed that in New South Wales there was more competition between wheat buyers than locally, and in South Australia ho believed thero had been less com petition during the past two vc-ars. The arrangement between the mer chants would account for the unifor mity of prices paid . to farmers, and also for tho fact that Victorian farmers got 5d a bushel more- for their wheat, which was much superior in color and weight ; and a chemist of the Agricul tural Department had said that Tt had a greater flour strength than tho grain of the eastern States. The cost of handling and freights might make some small difference in the prices in the other States.
