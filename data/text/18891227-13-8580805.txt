SUMMARY . FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. The most important political occurrence during the past fortnight has been an address by the Premier to his constituents at Kew It has not been the practice in this colony for Ministers to appear on the platform in recess unless during times of excitement, but Mr Gillies was drawn from the seclusion which he is wont to enjoy after a prorogation by the necessity for dealing with the question of the condition of the finances-a question to which 2/ie Aiqtts has drawn serious attention Just before the close of the session Parliament passed a loan bill for 41,000,000 which was unexpectedly submitted by the Government, and it was then ascertained that the Treasurer had been dim mp largely on the fixed deposits in the banks and on the trust funds to enable him to meet engagements 'there was no time for a full debate on the situation, but no mediately afterwards The Argus published a series of articles on the subject, which caused much discussion It was proved that on me-; to the m correct manner in which the Treasury accounts li vd been stated for many years the surplus brought forward from the last he met in peal to the current year was very much smaller than was set down Ilia nominal surplus was £1 701,000, but for that amount had to be deducted £1,200,000 on account of pi) ments properly chargeable to last year being charged to this Those pay ments were £'o42,000, for interest on loans accrued in the list quarter of last year, but paid on the day after that quarter closed, and £058,000 c\ penditure above the estimate, in curred in curing it lander revenue than was anticipated on the things The second most important point was in regard to the largely increased late of borrowing to which the Government had committed the colony, the amount of loan expenditure burn the 000,000 per annum now as compared with £1,500,000 a few years ago these were the principal questions to which Mr. Gillies addressed himself He admitted the facts, but justified the conduct of his Government in the first place, he asserted that he followed the practice of the previous recessions in the chin wing forward of items of expenditure and interest, and then said that that practice was legitimate live more than twelve months' interest was paid in any j ear, and if he advanced money for interest in one ye to an account in a coming year has held a good asset" in the book entry which set forth that that had been done lins argument seemed to appeal tothoporsons in the meeting, but it has since been pointed out by The viz 76s that the hon. gentleman was not happy in his illustra tion-tltatitwtsdocidcdlv incorrect to call a " li ability in asset " On the other point as to cover borrowing, he said that all the works for which loans had been authorised up to the present time were absolutely necessary, and most of them were required, so as to enable the rail ways to earn a larger resolute And he contended that our material wealth justified us in continuing to borrow, and that we could not overrun the constable so long as the money was expended on reproductive works SOCIAL AND GENERAL His Excellency the Governor, the Earl of Hopetoun, has attended the breaking up ceremonies in connection with several of the educational institutions of Melbourne, but has intimated that for the future he proposes to adopt Sir Henry Loch's party of visiting one of the chief schools each year. His Excellency, in the course of the addresses which he has delivered, expressed his up preciation of what is using done in the colony for the higher education of women, and also for the mili- Hi r training of July while at school His excellency presented the prizes won at the hue meeting of the Victorian Rifle Association at the Town-hall, and spoke of the necessity of a defence system on the occasion He said that while treaties were a safeguard for Governments and tor come mere?, the fact of a nation being in such a position that all others know that it was a dangerous thing to attack; it, was a better safeguard than all the treaties in the world. His Excellency has been presented with several additional addresses of welcome, and entertained at dinner by members of the Australian and Melbourne clubs Mr Joseph Harris, the member for South Yarra in the Legislative Assemby), before leaving on a visit to the old country, last week was entertained by a large party of gentlemen at Scott's Hotel, the health of the guest was proposed by Mr R. Murray Smith, and all joined heartily in wishing him a pleasant and sale voyage Mr Harris ex Seems to return to the colony by the end of une. A complimentary) dinner was tendered to Mr. N 'Thornley, M LO, the chairman of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, by the members of that body, at the Jung Hall, on the 19th inst In responding to the toast of his health, the guest of the evening alluded to the improvements which the trust had effected since its establishment 12 years ago, and said that within 18 months there would be fully 20ft of water around the piers at Port Melbourne and Williamstown, and in three years time there would be 125ft. from the be. to the entrance to the proposed docks He expressed regret that the Metropolitan Board of Works Hill had not been passed last session, as the trust uns annually put to a large expense dredging the silt and light out of the river which was carried into it from the sewers and mum drams of the city and suburbs The, Premier Permanent Building, Land, and Investment Association was compelled on the 20th Inst, to suspend payments to depositors, for some me past the affairs of the institution have been known to be in an unsound position, the cause being that due DPH the recent land house " the limits of legitimate building society business were exceeded, and risky speculations in land were indulged in. At the annual meeting of share holders on the Kill that. it was reported that last) year's valuations had been over-estimated by JL'13,02!), said that during the last 18 months £1,401 had been lost on foreclosed properties. It was explained that the directors had been placed at great disadvan take through the Guy of Melbourne Bank demanding the retirement of Mr. James Mirams from the position of mining last year, and through his successor (Mr. William Doherty) becoming ill, and requiring sick leave. When the directors came to prepare a financial statement of the affairs of the association they found that it was absolutely impossible to do so owing to certain records being UUBB ing, and the services of an actuary had to be obtained. It was represented by the directors that the society was in a perfectly solvent position, and that Colonel Temple- ton had been called in by them as consulting accountant to make investigations, and report its exact financial position, Depositors, however, became uneasy, and several withdrawals were made from the savings bank connected with the society. The City of Melbourne Bank, with which the society dealt, finding that it had exceeded its legal borrowing powers, declined to make any further advances to it, and the result was that payments Were suspended. This step was taken on the advice of Colonel Tempju|uu pending the result of his investigations. The Hospital Sunday Fund for the current year has been dealt with cheques being issued to the medical charities in the following order Melbourne Hospital, ¿'2,1185 4s. 3d.; Alfred Hospital, £1.111 7s. 6d.; Benevolent Asylum, 372 a. 10d.; Women's Hospital, £654 6s. 10d.; Hospital for Sick Children, £'1,30(1118.

The institutions which received special votes were the Convalescent Home for Women, £100 ; Convalescent Home for Men, £100 ; Collingwood Dispensary, £100 ; Richmond Dispensary, £00. The total sum voted was £10.00. The tender of Mr. P. Ellis, of Sandhurst, has been accepted by the Railway Commissioners for the manufacture of a double bogie first-class carriages, The work was let in two lots of 25 carriages each, and the total price was in one case £2,025, und In the other £28,175. It was stipulated that the carriages should be built in the colony, and on the premises of the contractor. They will be on the double bogie principle, and will each comprise seven compartments, giving nearly double the accommodation of the ordinary style of carriage. In the case of each of the two CUIUIUÇCB now let, the line three cut ridges are to be completed by next July, and the remainder little rate of two per month, so that the whole 25 shall be delivered within 18 mouths of the execution of the contract Messrs. G. W Burston and H R. Stokes, who left Melbourne last year for a bicycle tour round the world, returned on the 14th mar, Their journey was through India, the Holy Land, Europe, Great Britain, and America, and they were able to make con- siderable use of their bicycles on it 'They have ridden them for 10,000 miles half that distance being travelled in Great Britain Their average distance a day was SO or 90 miles, but on one occasion in India they rode 132 miles The bicycles were not used for the purpose of making any astonishing records, but simply as a practical means of thoroughly examining the countries which were visited , nevertheless, Messrs Burston and Stokes loved-one something exceptional in the annals of amateur bicycle riding An interlocutory injunction has been granted to Mr W. F Dix, preventing the committee of the Stock Exchange of Melbourne from taking any steps for his expul- sion from the change until an action against the committee for a permanent injunction and damages is decided A condition attached to the rule made by his Honour is, that while the plaintiff's membership of the exchange is not to be affected, he must not take any personal part in buying or selling shares in the exchange room the case arises out of the extraordinary transactions which took place in Round Hill shares in October last. Mr Dix alleges that he was instructed to "boom the market by Mr 1 gerald Moore, another member of the exchange, and that after he had bought a large number of shares lit extravagant prices Mr Moomdeclu ed to recog use him as his agent By the rules of the 3 exchange brokers are always looked upon as principals, and therefore Mr Dix was placed in the position of a del Joker He repre seemed to the members of the Exchange that he was acting on behalf of Mr Moore, but the committee, after inquiry, came to the conclusion that he had failed to make out his allegation A meeting of members of the Exchange was therefore called to consider the matter, and as Mr Dix's expulsion was involved he applied for the injunction to prevent the meeting being held until he had an opportunity of justifying his position in a court of law An appeal has been dismissed in the action taken by the Attorney-General to set aside the grant of three acres of land on the north bank of the Yarra. The circumstances in connection with the case were that Mr. Williams purchased the land at auction in 1890, but there was a condition in the grant that the Crown might resume possession on reply) ment of the purchase money (1300), with 10 per cent interest, and with compensation for improvements, to be fixed by arbitration it not agreed upon. Mr Williams complained that the insertion of this condition was a breach of faith with him, and after some negotiations in 1872, surrendered that Crown grant and obtained another one without that obnoxious condition A caveat was subsequently lodged on behalf of the Crown against Mr. Williams dealing with the land, but nothing further was done till 1868, when Mr. Williams sold the land to Goldsbrough and Co Limited for £25,000, and that company took steps to assert their right to the property 'The Attorney) General then brought the action to set aside the Crown grant of 1872, on the ground that it had been illegally issued. The case vvusheard4iefore the Chief Justice, who held that the issue of the Crown grant was not illegal, and even if it was, by the Land Acts lob!) and 1884 the Crown could not take advantage of the illegality), IIB those statutes provided that ever) grant should, BUbjectto us conditions, be valid and effectual as well against Her Majesty as against all other persons. The report of the Mining department for the quarter ending the 30th September, last!), shows that the amount of gold obtained in the colony was estimated at 157 l)."ie/. 15dwt. 2gr. being an increase of 2,140u/_ over the quantity produced during the preceding quarter, and an increase of Tile. Lldwt life. compared with the yield for the corresponding quarter of 1888 the largest yield was obtained in the Ballarat district, namely), 57,')27o¿. 14dwt. 6gr. During the quarter £132,520 10s. 4d was paid In dividends, being £2 710 7s 10d. more than the amount paid during the June quarter The quantity) of quartz crushed during the quarter was 104 lil falls 1 "cwt ; the field trout which was'J2,710o/ l!)dwt.7Kr, being an average of 14dwt. reaching. her ton. 'The Secretary of Mines (Mr A. E. Howitt) considers that, upon the whole, there is an improved tone in mining, and trusts that increased returns will be followed by increased energy and perseverance in following out ke inmate mining enterprises. In regard to musical m waters it is to be mentioned that Mr. Solomon's Comic Opera company, under the immediate direction of Mr. Henry Bruce), have completed a successful season at the Alexandra 'I theatre, the principal works produced being "The Beggar Student" and "The Sultan of Mella" Messrs. Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove have secured the right of representation in Australia of Gilbert and Sullivan's latest work " The Gondoliers 'The management of the Victorian Orchestra has tried the experiment of a plebiscite concert, with the result that the following compositions were chosen for performance:-bympliony, "The Pastorale," beethoven , overtures " Tanu hauser" and Henry," Wagner , Largo, for organ, harp, and strings, lender, Prelude and Entr'acte, "Lohengrin," Wagner ; uno "Rhapsodie Hongroise" No 4, Liszt. A series of open-air concerts has been commenced by the orchestra on the Melbourne Cricket ground. A highly successful entertainment was given by the Melbourne Liedertafel at the town-hall on the Hills line, the most important composition performed being Mendelssohn's " First Walpurgis Night." Madame Marian Burton, late of the Carl Rosa Opera Company, made her last appearance in Melbourne at this concert, and made a favourable impression. His Excellency) the Governor and the Countess of Hopetoun were present, and were elected honorary members of the society. MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL. The Argus Office, Thursday Evening. The period now to be reviewed has been broken by the occurrence of the Christmas holidays, and, so far as commercial affairs are concerned, there is little to report. The monetary position has continued to be rather strained since the last fortnightly summary, the demand for accommodation being heavy) 'The exchange market on London continues to be anomalous in character.
