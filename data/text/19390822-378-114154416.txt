"But Scandinavians who learn about your conditions of entering the country are not convinced. A large sum at money is needed-lmuch mote than these peoinle can afford. Under the existing ponditlons, you could not expect Danes to come in. The Â£200 that each has to find is a big ob stacle. "They feel that the Australtan door for migration has not yet been opened in. Scandinavians generally believe that Australia, with her vast tern-' tory and small population, shoUld ofer many opportunities.
