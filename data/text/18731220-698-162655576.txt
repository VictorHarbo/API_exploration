Summary of English and Foreign, PER P. AND O. CO.'S MAIL STEAMER NUBIA. Telegraphic News. GENERAL SUMMARY. October 31. UBEAT disappointment was felt in JjondGn when the failure of the experimental shipment of frozen meat became known. Numerous gentlemen con nected with Australia were at the South Dock to board the Norfolk on her arrival, and looked very blank on learning that the meat had all been thrown overboard. Mr. Harrison met with much sympathy. He attributes the failure entirely to the hurried way in which preparations were made, the ship having started without afford ing an opportunity of testing the apparatus. On getting to' sea the leakage of cold brine, on the maintenance and circulation of which success depended, became excessive, and owing to the surrounding cargo the leaks were not accessible. On the thirty-fourth day, nine teen tons of meat were thrown overboard; the remainder was sacrificed when off the Azores. The failure is considered only temporary. Mr. Bell, a Glasgow butcher, is bringing over twenty-four head of cattle weekly from Canada. The first consignment of Queensland sugar to test the English market, was sold by auction last week, the prices realized being considered satis factory. ... Large quantities of Australian tinned meats have been forwarded to the West Coast of Africa.

'rho oiiomud nf tVia T.iharal nn.nriiiia+.aB of Tiof.Vi and Taunton greatly disconcerted the Conserva tive party : a long series of Liberal electoral defeats had intoxicated the Tories with confi dence and certainty of victory. This reversal of their career of triumph is largely due to the indiscreet letter, full of political invective, of Lord Grey de Wilton. Mr. Brighton accepting the appointment to the Duchy of Lancaster, published an ad dress to his constituents^ which declares that he has not changed his old principles, that rather than be unfaithful to them he would retire from office.
