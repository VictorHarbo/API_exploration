Success is shown in cadi case before payment, on easy term, is arranged. ' Madame Frokjar places all hor experience at the service of her clients, and s- ' holds herself fortunate that in nine years of testing her remedy -she has relieved huudreds of women of annoying and disfiguring hairs. Dannebrog is now. operated in the principal cities in the Commonwealth, and talented women who have tested it state that there is no better remedy, or one more plensnut, and at the same time destructive in its effects.
