A WORD TO FARMERS. In connection with the immigration movemVjut, advices have been received to the effect that good opportunities exist from time to timo of inducing agriculturists from Northern Europe to make their home in New South Wales. The question has arisen whether ic would be advisable to hold out any offers to .this class of farm labourer, in view of the fact that the wen would be unable to speak the language, aud might, therefore, on arrival, Jiavo diffi culty in securing employment. There is no doubt that the agriculturist of Northern Europe would make aii ideal settler of New South Wales, and if the' difficulty of his employment could be got ' orer, a considerable advantage would accrue to the State by his settle ment hero. German, Danish, or Scan- , dinavian land-holders who would be willing to employ men of their oivn nationality are, therefore, invited to make the fact known, to the Director of the Intelligence Department, Sydney, when the matter of securing immi grants from those countries would bo considered.
