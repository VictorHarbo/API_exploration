An Immigration incident As moBt people are aware, Westralia's Agent - General in London has been authorised to select a certain number of suitable emigrants, and despatch them to the State in batches. Before embarkation these people are informed that arrangements have been made with the authorities here for their reception on arrival at Fremantleâ€”a very necessary provision, as a number of the immigrants are foreigners hailing from Denmark, etc. Satisfied with this assurance, the 27 odd State-aided passengers who arrived in the R.M.S. Oroya the other day were surprised on the steamer coming alongside the Victoria Quay to find no one attendance to meet them. For several hours they waited and 6till no official aterialised. Eventually tbey came nnder he observation of a friendly pressman ho took immediate stepB to have the uthorities apprised of the fact that five Danish dairying experts and six families were awaiting the arrival of some responible person to take charge of the party. Then, and not before, it is alleged, the gricultural Department woke up, and despatched one of its officers to attend to the new comers. But when this worthy arrived on the scene a further delay had to take place, aa the office had not provided him with the list of the immigrants. Now, such humbug as this is inexcusable. It must be remembered that first impressions of a new country go a long way with some people, but if this is the kind of treatment they are to receive on touching our shores we need not ba surprised later on at hear' ing unfavorable remarks as to our alleged readiness to welcome settlers of a suitable kind. If this immigration business is to be of any benefit, the authorities must see that every facility is placed at th6 disposal of the new arrivals, to get on the land with the utmost expedition; otherwise it would be better to abandon immigration altogether.
