COMMERCIAL. A atf. Opvrrr. Saturday Evening. There were no export entries passed for gold at fin Customs to-day. Business generally during the past week has not Been what could have been wished. A decided im provement over the pi'1- viou.s fortnight has, howevoi , been experienced, though as yet confined to but a iow of tho staple articles. Bulk ales have again suffered a further decline. Woolpacks have ad Tnnced, and, being scarce, are still looking up. In cement, A1''''1111 plaster is easier. Coffee has been in improved demand. ? Tho flour market, though quiet, shows signs of a reaction. Maize is lower. Considerable transactions 'have taken plnce in malt. Fruits have been firm, but listless. All de scriptions of provisions have given way. Rice at tracts no attontion. A fair trade has boon done in sugar, privately ; little or nothing having been sold at auction. Tens have been quite inactive. Timber has been languid ; the business transacted has been very small. Tobacco is thought well of, and re ceives further favorable notice. AViuos and spirits nro heavy, and almost stagnant. Tho arrival of the steamer with the May mails was telegraphed from Adolnide this forenoon. Ship ments for the month amount to £522,782, showing an increase over the previous of £263,640, arising principally from soft goods and wrought leather. Oats and butter are light, while provisions, candles, hardware, paints, oils, casks are stated to bo in ex cess. The commoncomont of tho wool sales showed a decline of Id to lid on March sales, which, how ever, was subsequently reoovercd, rates being, on an average, equal to the sales named. The bank rato of discount was 4 per cent. ; Victorian securities, 6 per cent.; 'April and October quoted 110} to 111 J. Thirteen vessels had sailed for Melbourne from Eng land, ono from Rotterdam, aud one from Charente. Considerable uneasiness has been created amongst his creditors by tho continued ahseuco of a whole sale dealer in town, whoso hills have been recently dishonored, but who, notwithstanding, was expoctod to have paid his ' legitimate' creditors in full. Tho British and foreign arrivals comprise two vessels from London, two from America, and ono from China. Ale and Stout. — Bulk ale continues much do pressed and neglected, and though a concession hns been made to induce purchasers to como forwurd, trade sales to a very limited extent only can bo effected. Byass No. 3, in some instances, has been offered as low as £7, aud though most holders still quote £7 10s to £7 15s for small lots, vory fow do sirous to disposo of pnrcols would ho inclined to ro fuso tho first named figure, as stocks continue to ac cumulate rapidly. Allsopp's lias also been sold in large parcels at £7, but for small lots £7 10s is asked. Marian's, in liko manner, lias been reduced to £7 7s 6d to £7 12s 6d, sales having been made at the latter rate. Of Joule's no purchases have como undor our notice at less than £8, below which the ngents just yet refuse to sell. Carlisle Company's realises £8. Ind, Coope aud Co.'s is not offered at a lower figure than £8. Colonial Company's brings £7 to £7 10s. No sales of best Scotch brands have been reported, hut under present circumstances wo have no doubt consignees will bo quite disposed to submit to a reduction on our Inst quoted price of £7. Youngor's Allon can bo bought ut £6 6s. Ttvylor, Walker nnd Co.'s stout is unaltered, small lots being quitted at £7 5s to £7 7s 6d, and Whitbroad's at £7 2s 6d to £7 5s, in prime condition. Bottled ale finds buyers at former rates.- Buss and Allsopp's 10s to 10s 3d; Joule's nnd Colonial Company's, 9s 6d ; Younger's, 9s 6d. Bottled stout is slow of sale at 10s 3d to 10s 6d for Hy. 'White and Co.'s ; 10s for Blood's, at which a parcel now land ing has been cleared off. Dunphy's is moro diffi cult to quit at 9s 6d; Byass's realises 9s 3d to 9s 6d, trade sales having been effected at the latter price ; Hibbert's, 9s 3d; a parcel of Edmunds's pig brand has been disposed of as high as 10s 9d. At auction Dunphy's has been sold at 9s l}d. Bagging. — Corn sacks are in small request at 17s 6d to 18s. Woolpacks are scarce, nnd holders' demands have advanced to 5s 6d for 101b pneks, 5s being askod for 9} lb; faulty, at auction, brought 2s lOd to 4s 7d. Candles. — Again have tho wants of the trade been amply snppliod from damaged pnrcols offered at auction, 3000 boxes having beon quitted at lOd to lOJd for full weights, and 7gd to 8gd for light weights ; as may bo supposed, therefore, it is almost impossible, ill the meantime, to disposo of sound ones in any quantity. Our quotations are, for Hale'B and Ogilvio's, 11}-1 ; Belmonts, Is ; Goudas have been sold at Is ; Brandon's and Cramer's, Is to Is OJd; ordinary foreign brands, 11 jd ; light weights, 9}d. Cement. — Portland is firm at 25s, in tho absence of parcels pressing on tho market. A decided decline has taken placo in American plaster ; ono parcel of 200 barrels brought only 2ls 9d, and dealers ask 25s for trade lots. Roman evinces no sign of im provement. CoNFECTiONEnY, is dealt in to n moderate extent, former rates boing obtainable on somo, and a slight advance on others. Assorted boing lid. Jujubes, Is ; while 13}d is generally asked and obtained for candied peel. Coffee. — A vory much improved demand lias been experienced, and considerable sales have been effected at rather under late quotations. Planta tion has been sold at lOfd, hut is now held for lid by some, while others refuse to quit under ll}d. Native lias been parted with at lOd to 10}d, aud Javns at lOd to 10Jd. Tiie parcel of ICoomda Mountains, sold last week at auction, has this week changed hands at an advance of a penny per pound. Chicohy has not beon in much request, but' we have no alteration on our quoted price of 4d to report. ConDAGE. — Manilla rope is quiet and without much appearance of being better ; £47 to £49 is wanted for assorted sizes. Europe Manilla is no minal at £50. Tarred rope has been sold at £34 10s, laid cord at 10}d per lb ; red twine at lljd to Hid per lb ; seaming twine is not over plentiful, and brings 15d. Chemicals. — Soda crystnls command £8 15s.

Flour of sulphur in little de mand at £22. Sulphuric and other acids at present quite neglected. Fish. — Sales of herrings continue to bo effected to the trade at 27s to 28s for half-barrols, and 10s for firkins; rod herrings in tins bringing 34s. FnuiTS. — -Currants have not beon in much request ; prices, however, are not likely to give way. In the meantime tho few BaleB eftected have been at G}d ; faulty brought 5|d to 5}4. Loose muscatel raisins are offered at rather easier rates, Gd to Old being the figure now asked ; common to fiuo layers, Old to 7}d ; layers, in small packages, 8}d ; elemes, 7d ; sultanas, 7}d to 8d ; elemo figs, Ggd ; French prunes, 63d to 8d per lb. Flour and Grain. — Indications of a very much better feeling has pervaded this market, and if numerous sales have not been effected, it is not cer tainly for want of offers for large parcels, and that not so much under quotations. Rumors, however, have been current of several hundred tons having changed hands in one line. Several outsido parcels of Adelaide have been disposed of at £13, hut at tho same time we know of this figure having been refused for a very considerable quantity. We therefore do not make any change on former quotations, which are— £14 10s for Hart's and Mugarey's, £14 for ordinary silk-dressed Adelaide, £13 10s for countrv brands, £13 for wire-dressed Victorian. - In trade lots, Moyno Mills, silk-dressed, brings £13. Merri Mills hns been sold at £12 10s to £13. Faulty parcels, ut auction, sold for £12 5s to £12 10s. Adelaide wheat is worth Ds 9d, but is held for 6s. Tnsmanian is valued at 5s 3d to 5s 6d, and Victorian 5s to 5s 3d. Fowls' food 4s 8d. Barley, for feeding purposes, brings 4s 6d to 4s 8d, and for malting, 5s 9d to 6s. Best colonial oats, for milling, are scarce, and would readily bring 6s; farmers' lots realising 5s 6d. Best Danish would sell at 5s. Scotch 4s 6d to 4s 9d. Calcutta 4s lOd. Sales of faulty parcels of Dutch have been made at 2s Id to 2s 4d, and 3000 bushels sold for 3s Id to 3s 2d. Fine samples of maize nro disposed of at 4s 3d to 4s Od. Gram, nominal, at £14. Bran has been sold at Is l}d to Is 2d. Colonial oatmeal is reduced to £31 ; Scotch, £27 10s. Colonial pearl barley, £36 ; Scotch, £28. Gunpowder is slow of salo ; best blasting being valued at 7d per lb. Hops do not command a ready sale; best 62's bring Is lOd for small parcels, though a consider able concession would be mado to induce larger purchases. Malt has experienced a brisk speculative demand, most bins now landing having been bought up at 8s 6d, 8s 7}-1, and 8s 9d, and at present there appears to he nothing offering wliieh has not ineurrred storing charges, and for which 9s is asked. Thoro has not been much demand from brewers. Metals. ? Pig iron lias again been sold at auction at £3, a figure holders generally feel inclination to accept. Corrugated has come forward more freely ; prices, however, remain firm at previous quotations of £35 for 26 gauge, for Hamilton a, Sloiifn's, and Gospel oak brands. At auction faulty realised £31 to £36. Shoet lead brings £29 to £30. Zinc, £30 to £31. Smiths' bellows havo been sold at 24s each. Spades at 30s to 38s per dozen. American brooms, lis 9d per dozen, Carpenter s rim locks, 30s per dozen. Oils. — Linseed is slack at 6s 6d. Castor realises 6s for' trade lots. Kerosene has been more active, a fair business having been done for consumption at 3s Id to 33 2d for Couzzen's nnd Downer's, and 2s lOd to 2s lid for Oriental, besides several pnrcols having been picked up hy dealers at a fair margin on these rates. At auction, Philbrick's was sold at 2s 6d. Arrivals, however, have of Into been heavy, which may havo the effect of checking any immediate improvement. Colza and olivo very littlo doing in. Tui- pciitino sold for lis per gallon. Oilmen's Stores havo had reasonable attention. Pickles have been disposed of at 7s 9d to 8s 6d, no cording to brand. 1 lb jnuis are not very abundant vet, and tend upwards ; 12s is asked in most cases, but wo hear of 12s 6d also being wanted. Bottled fruits realise 13s to 14s. 1 lb mustards liavo been sold nt 9s 3d ; half-pounds at 6s. Quarts vinegar at 7s lOd. Quarts salad oil, 2ds ; pints at lis 6d ; linlf-pints nt 7s per dozen ; and mace at 14}d per lb. Halves sardines are difficult to move at 9s 3d to 9s 6d ; quarters, 6s 6d to 6s 9d. 1 lb salmon, 17s.' Provisions. — Butter has been rather iunotive, and saleB effected at a reduction on last week's rates ; in most instances Is 2}d hns been accepted for large lots. This however being ono of the two articles specially named as light in tho telegraphic advices of shipments advised by tho present mail, wo doubt not a reaction will take place, and higher pricos bo obtained. Hams and bacon havo been tending downwards, inquiries being far from brisk ; hitherto Is 4-l and Is 3d has generally been demanded for Sinclair's, but we believe they could now ho had for less money, Cooy's being in a similar position. Fine North 'Wilts cheese realises Is 2d, and fine Duu lop's are saleable at Is Id. Quicksilver salos are very limited at Is lOd for California, and 21s for Spanish. Rice presents no signs of liveliness, there being an evident disincliuationon tho part of dealers to buy largely. Recent sales havo beon effected nt £23 to £23 10s according to quantity. Tlicro is no Java in importers' hands ; fine is scarce nnd inquired for. ' Salt. — Coarse is yet difficult to move at anything liko fair prices ; quotations nro nominal at £3 5s to £3 10s. Fine realises £5, no sales having been ef fected under. Sugar. — The. market this weokhns bnen freo from much prossure, tho auction sales having been con fined, to the disposal of 750 bags damaged, ex Danube, nnd 700 hags, ox Amazon, which brought fair pricos, condition considered. A good trade, how ever, lias been done privately in rations at £23 to £25, and first counters, nt £32 10* ; yellow crystals bring £33 to £34 ; good white, £37 to £38; and best white, £40.

Tho fine teas ox Diana woro offered on 'Wednes- day last,- hut tho auctioneers did not sneceod in placing any. the prices obtained by dealers not being sufficient to enable them to offer importers even cost for this season's fine teas. Trado parcels of ordinary congou have beon sold at 2s Id; half chosts, ex Lessing, having brought 2s 3}d. Tobacco continues in good repute. Sales have been effected at advancing rates. We hoar of no Northern tens how offering under 2s, while many brands bring over that figuro. A parcel of 80 cases, tons and .halves, was placed at full market rates. Our quotations for trado lots range from 2s 6d to 3s 3d for tens, 8s to 3s 6d for halves, 4s 6d for aromatic halves, and 4s 9d for twist.

Government debentures and hank shares have boen chiefly in demand, and havo attracted most money. Business has been with tho object of permanent investment, buyers for a speculative riso boing few. Although not many shares of Gas or Insurnnco companies havo changed ownors, there is a considerable inquiry for thorn, and prices are well sustained. Every day brings complaints that tho field for share investments is so narrow. At tho same time, projectors of now enterprises feel that there are so many prejudices to ovorcome, and so much risk of opprobrium in case of failure, that thoy hesitate to attempt tho launching of now undertakings as much from a droad of tho moral, as of the money responsibility to bo incurrod. Mining companies have beon neglected, with tho exception of Hustler's Roof, of which somo largo parcels liavo been taken.
