PATENT OALOBIO ENGINE-The undersigned invite the attention of manufacturers and others who require the application of motive power to this novel and successful propeller, whereby the common atmosphere is practically employed as an agent Of propulsion without the aid of cithorwator or steam. 1\. Within the limit claimed for this motor its power Is certain, uniform, and entirely sufficient. 2\. The machine is not attended with the numerous perils that attach to the steam-engine, and make it so uncomfortable and dangerous a servant ; but, on the contrary, it is absolutely free from danger, 8\. It requires no engineering supervision, as it is not liable to much tear and wear, or to got out of order, and may be kept in action by any workman, or boy, without interfering with other duties they may have to perform, 1\. Its consumption of fuel is very trifling (ab at 37 percent, of the steam engine), and It does not increase the rate of Insurance. The caloric engine is no longer a subject of experi- ment, but exists as a perfect practical machine, dall r at work (chiefly in America) In numerous and diver rifled uses with undeviating success. It is employed f J : job printing and printing daily newspapers, working hoisting gear for warehouses, docks, and ships, mills of various descriptions ; pumps of all kinds from those used in raising water in houses for domestic use, and those employed at railway stations and mines, and! for purposes of irrigation and supplying villages with water. It is practically employed in bakeries and tanneries, also by bookbinders, cabinetmakers, and orders, for wood cutting, for elevating grain, grinding quarts and paints for wood turning for sawing and planing timber, for tobacco cutting and pulverizing, for soda- water manufacturers, bone crushing, mait- inashlug» roasting, grinding, and pulping coffee, for grinding corn, cutting feed, domestic sawing, and for the various operations of farms. To the agriculturist and squatter this engine pot sesses peculiar advantages, not only from its being harmless, but especially in country districts, when mechanical skill is not easily procurable, and where it is sometimes inconvenient and expensive to supply the water necessary for a steam-engine. The engine can be worked either portable or stationary, and can be attached to the ordinary portable > thrashing-machine, and at same time drive all the other machines in use on the farm or station. For further particulars apply to R. TOWNS and Co, 28 William street, Halboarno.
