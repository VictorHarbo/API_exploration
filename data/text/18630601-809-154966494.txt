COMMERCIAL. Age Office. Saturday Evenincr. ? There were no export entries passed for gold at tho Customs to-day. i On roferring to tho following detailed report of tlio import market, it will bo found that vory few changes have taken place, and that the effect of tho recent display of loyalty has not yet been recovered, business throughout tho week having been charac terised by great dulness and inactivity in almost all goods, with vory fow exceptions. Tho inquiry , for breadstuff's has been moderate, and when the market might havo been benefited by advices of increased firmness and an advance in prices in Adelaide, a total cessation in business was caused by the un certainty regarding tlio cargo of the Potor Simmons, from Valparaiso, which, we believo, consists prin cipally of barley, but of which a needless mystery was mado. In provisions, a fair demand for butter was experienced, while the scarcity of bacon and hams and choose still chocks all business in these. In liquids, bulk ales coutinuo to show a slight de cline. Our quotations aro for trade lots, but for largo parcels wo have no doubt a suitable concession would bo' made, all holders being anxious to quit. In port and sherries an increased trade lias been done. Except for palo, tho demand for brandy lias been trilling. JDKZ Geneva has been in improved inquiry. Tobaccoes are receiving considerable notice. Tho sugar market lias not yet recovered from the effect of last week's sale. Tho British and foroign arrivals comprise ono vessel from America, two from London, and ono from Calcutta. alb and otout. — mo continuous uociino to wnicn all bulk ales have been subjected is likely to be checked when onco they reach a figure under which they cannot bo sold without showing a loss, but not before, as importers will not till then prefer storing in anti cipation of a better market to submitting to any further reduction, more especially as any concossion hitherto has failed in inducing extensive operations to bo entertained, and tho trado demand has dwindled down in an extraordinary degree. Bass's No. 3 is offering at £8 5s. Sales of Joule's have been made at £8 7b Cd, and of Marian's at £8 5s to £8 10s ; for Allsopp's, £8 5s to £8 7s Gd is asked ; Carlisle Company's has beon placed at £8 us. Ind, Coope and Co.'s, aud Colonial Company's, command £8. Scotch alo (Youngor's and Fulton's) will not bring over £7 10s. All these quotations aro in a great measure nominal, as, to offect large sales, a good deal less would be accepted. Wliitbroad's, and Tay lor, Walker and Co.'s stout realiso £7 5s to £7 10s. Tho prevailing cold weather lias almost annihilated tho demand for bottled ales, small as that was ; but wo havo no alteration in prices to report, which must still bo quoted 9s 9d to 10s 3d for Bass's triangle and Allsopp's, 9s Gd being got for Joule's and Colonial Company's ; other brands, 8s Gd to 9s. Holders of bottled stout have this week been more anxious sellers, supplies coming forwurd very freely. On Henry Whito and Co.'s, and Maclicn's, there has been no change, tlioso continuing still to bring 10s to 10s 3il; but Dunphy's, reporlod iu line ordor, is offering at 9s Gd. Sales of Bynss's liavo beon mado at 9s 3d, and we hardly think anything over that figure could bo got. A large parcel of this brand, to land, was stated to have chiuigad liands, but tho price was kept quiet. Hibbert's meets with buyers at 9s 3d. For the Colonial Company's 9s | Gd is asked, and for inferior brands thero is no in quiry. Baogino. — Corn sacks have been In bettor ro-' quest {or malt requirements, suit sales have boon made at 19d. Woolpacks aro saleable at 4s 6d to 4s 9d, but though in many cases more is asked, no business can be done at over our quotations. Gnnny bags sold at auction brought lis per dozen. Candles do not show tho slightest sign of im provement; there aro no speculative buyers, ond tho trado demand is insignificant. Belmonts have been sold at 12Jd. Cramer's aro held at 12 Jd ; for Brandon's 12|d is asked, whilo 12d would be taken. Other foreign and English brands arc held for Is, belowwhich we hear of no sellers. Confectionery is in better supply, and a steady business is done at unaltered rates. Assorted at lid; jujubes at Is ; and candied peel at 12d to 13d. Cement. — Roman continues neglected. Ono parcel, nearly two years iu the colony, sold for 7s Gd. Portland is firm at 25s, at which it is likely to remain. A parcel of plaster (American), sold for 25s, the rate for trade lots still being 30s. Chicory has quietly settled down to 3Jd to 3}d, the price to which it was pushed by tho recent spe culative purcliascs. Coffee does not meet with so ready a salo at the rates now demanded ; it is, however, firmly held at 13d for Plantation, lid for Native, lOJdfor Java, and 10;d for Manilla. Cordage. — Manilla rope is dull and heavy, at tho nominal value of £47 to £19 for assortod sizes. Islo of Man rope sells at £50. Calcutta lines, just arrived, sold at auction for £44. Seaming twine is wnrfli 1AJ./? fn iMrl Chemicals. — There is not a heavy stock of soda crystals, yet there is no improvement in the market, £8 5s to £8 10s only being realisable. Carbonate of soda is again quiet at 18s Gd. Muspratt's caustic soda sells slowly at £21, and other brands at £20. Soda ash is almost nominal at £12. Flower of sul phur is inactive at £22 10s. English sulphuric acid is worth Gd ; colonial, 4d ; tartaric, 2s 3d per lb. Turkey opium is inquired for, but at tho prico asked, 19s, no sales havo been effected. Fruits. — Though arrivals of currants have been more frequent, tho price has, been maintained at 3$d in bond ; dealers, however, are unwilling buyers at over a farthing less. Eleme raisius havo been dis posed of at GJd, duty paid, anddamagedat 4d to 4.}d, for shipment. Capes have been in request, but are not to be met with in bond. Muscatels aro improved, G^d'to 7d being now asked. Supplies of dried apples [ are just to nana, wiucu are held lor ujd. lags are not saleable over GAd to 7d. Fisii. — There is almost no demand for ling, and very littlo is offering. Herrings bring 27s to 28s for barrels, and 10s for halves. Flour and Grain. — Business lias been strictly confined to supplying a very moderate demand for trado purposes, advices of increasod rates in Adelaide proving ineffectual in imparting any impetus to the market during a week of groat dulness. Silk dressed Adelaido flour maintains previous rates of £15, Hart's and Magarey's being liold at £15. 10s ; Moyue Mills and Adelaido wiro-dresscd realising £14. Adelaido wheat has been sold at Gs 6d to Gs 8d, and Victorian at Gs ; a very fino sample would bring Gs 3d; feeding sorts have been placed at over 5s. Outs are in slow sale at 5s 3d to 5s 9d for colonial, 4s 9d to 5s for Scotch, and 5s to 5s 3d for Danish; a parcel of 1600 bushels (faulty) Scotch brought 4s 3d to 4s 4d. Feeding barloy is expected to improve, but cannot yet bo quoted over 4s Gd, malting being worth 5s Gd to Gs. Bran is dull, at Is 3Jd. Maize is saleable at 5s 8d to 5s 9d. Oat meal is in better request, at £28 to £29 for Scotch and £35 for colonial. Pearl barley is also looking healthier, at £29 to £30 for British, and £37 for colonial. GuNPowDEn is very dull, and inanimate at 7d to 8d for Kaimes's and Sliarpe's blasting; Hall's, damaged, sold for 4d. Hops have been sold in trade lots at Is lOd to 2s, for G2's. One considerable parcel was disposed of privately at Is 8d ; at auction, Is 8 Ail was obtained. Malt. — During the past ten days arrivals havo been extremely heavy, and the prico has again de clined. For trade lots 9s 3d may bo got, but for bins not more than 8s 9d will bo given, at which I price several have been placed, but even at that low figure there are few buyers. Metals havo not beon extensively dealt in, but the slight advanco realised on corrugated iron has been maintained. Hamilton's and Skaife's is va lued at £35 for 2G gauge, and £34 for 24 gauge. Smith's corrugated 2G gauge sold for £34 5s, and plain 28 gauge, for £35 los. Scotch corrugatcd 28 gauge, £31 10s ; damaged sheet iron realised £31 ; and faulty black fencing wiro £8 10s. Vory little sheet lead is offering ; it would bring £27. In small lots zinc is worth £31, a shade less money would buy a parcol. Pig iron is firm at £3 15s. Collins's curved picks are scarce and wanted. Shovels aro in good request, with a strong upward tendency; Oils. — A fair trade demand has been experienced during the week for kerosene, at 3s 6d for the best brands, 3s 3d for Oriental, and 3s for the commoner English descriptions. Linseed is firm at 5s Gd. Castor is scarce, aud wanted at 5s Gd. The Pudel's lot, just in, was sold some tinio ago to arrive, at 5s 3d. Chinese has been placed at 4s Gd. Olive and Colza remain dull and neglected. Oilmen's Stores. — Bottled fruits aro mncli, in quired for at 12s, tho market being quito bare, lib jams aro also in short supply, being valued at a liko figure. Pickles are not in much demand, at 7s Gd to 9s Cd. Sardines are firm, and saleable at 9s 9d for halvos, and Gs 9d to 7s for quarters ; lib salmons at 17s Gd. Provisions. — Butter has been disposed of at lGd, a fair trado being done at this rate. Hams and bacon still continue in request, business being greatly checked by want of supplies, parcels coming in being at once picked up at Is 5d for tlio former, and Is 4d for tho latter. Cheeso of fine quality is very scarce; either largo or small would bring Is 2d to ls2)d. Quicksilver is nnaltered at Is lOd to 2s, and vory difficult to quit. Rice has attracted very little attention ; a fow solos have been mado to the trade at £24 10s, but on tho whole the market is very inactive. ' The Pudel's cargo was offered yestorday, but was with drawn, as importers' limits were not obtainable. Slates. — Countesses, 20 x 10, realise £1G. i Salt.— Coarse, still influenced by heavy ship ments, is quite immoveable, thero being no sellers at tho rates offered by would-bo speculators ; we can hardly, therefore, give a quotation. Fine realises, in small trado lots, £5 to £5 5s. Sugar. — This market lius not yet recovered from the effects of last week's salo, when tho largest quantity we can remember, at one time, was offered — 17,000 bags — and cleverly disposed of, entirely amongst the trado. Portions of the finer descriptions have since been placed at an advance, most holders refusing to sell under tho rates previously ruling. Wo consider good counters worth £32 to £33 ; fine, £34 to £35 ; yellow crystals, £35 to £36 ; greyish yellow, £37 to £38 ; good grey, £39 ; and white, £40 to £41 ; No 1 Cossiporo is nominal at £48. Timber. — Since tho salo of tho Otto's cargo of deals at old delivered in New Zealand, no heavy transactions liavo taken place. A portion of the Australia's cargo was sold by Messrs C. S. Ross and Co., consisting of 1108 deals, 11 x 3, which realised 5d for 9 x 3, all faults; 1G5G battens, 7x21, 4Jd to 4Jil do ; 506 battens, 7 x 3, at 4Jd do; and 550, 9 to x 3, 5d ; likowise tho following doors and sashes, ex Wm. Pock, 1403 piccos sashes, at 5s Gd to 12s, according to size ; and 500 doors at 5s 3d to 23s. Tobacco continues to look very healthy, moro especially for tho finer descriptions of Southorn leaf. Tlio principal holder of ^halves of this sort is at present out of tho market, while Northerns aro offering at 3s to 3s Gd ; and tons at 2s Gd to 3s. A rise of fully Is is asked for uromutic halves, which cannot bo oblainod under 4s. The following salos at auotion aro roported : On Wednesday, half-pounds at 2s 6d, tens at Is lOJd to 2s 8£d, some being slightly mouldy ; on Thursday, superior qualities at from 3s 2d to 4s Gd per lb, and lower qualities at Is 2d to Is 8d per lb in bond, snuffs at 5s 9d per lb ; on Friday, Lion brand Swiss tobacco 4s 3d per lb, Eagle 3s 9d, Chieve's 3s 3d to 4s 4d, Crest 3s lid to 4s, Black Diamond 4s id, C'anier Doro 3s 7d to ?la, Monarch, half-pound lumps, Is 9d to Is lOd, Irene Is 8d to 2s 2d, Sherry Is 4d, Unique 3s Id. Teas, considering the previous activity in this market, may be said to have been quiet for tho week, though trade sales have been numerous aud frequent of ordinary to good congous at 2s Id to 2s 3d. 700 half-chests and chests, ex Algernon, Lady Agnes Dufi', and Notos, brought 2s lAd to 2s 3d ; half chests are still scarce and inquired for. Wines and Spirits.— Considerable sales of fairish port wino liavo boon effected at £28 10s. Com moner sorts liavo been sold at less. Ordinary sherries havo been disposed of at £42 to £45, duty paid ; anu good medium qualities at £40 in bond. Amontillado is asked for at £100. Geneva is quiet, tlio stoclc of secondary and inferior brands is enor mous ; JDKZ, however, is really in vory small supply, prices, however, do not advance, from tho disinclination evinced by dealers to purchase moro than is actually wanted, large quantities being known to bo afloat, and now nearly due ; low duties of the brand named havo boon placed at lis 3d, though aomo importers aslt lis 6d. Other brands aro en tirely noglected. In brandies, tho principal demand ii for pale, but ia tlio Iftco oi expectodllarrivula holders are moro easy sellers. Martell's dark has been sold at 12s ; palo at 12s Gd. Otard's pale is held for lis 6d ; dark, 10s 9d. U.V.P. pale, lis 3d ; dark, 10s Gd. Renault's dark 10s 6d, to lis 3d for pale.

Chatenetis held for 7s Gd palo. In case, Hennessy's commands 34s. Martell's is only offering to arrive. Otard's, 2Gs Gd to 28s. Renault's, 27s Gd to 28s. U.V.P., 28s Gd. Vinogrowers, 27s. C.V.P., 2Gs. Leger Freres, 21s ; aud Clozeau, 21s ; mediums being offered at lGs to 20s, and low, 12s Gd. Whiskey in bulk is quiet at 3s 7Jd. No low duty caso being found in importers' hands, dealers insist 011 lis Gd. The principal holders of 10. o. p. rum being out of tho market, wo can hardly give a quotation. Some stray lots aro, how ever, offoring at 3s to 3s 3d, aud 30 per cent. o.p. ut 4s. Colonial Produce. — Transactions in wool call for no notice. Business in tallow has not been large, prices remaining unchanged. Beef, £33 to £35 ; mixed, £34 to £3G. Mutton, £39 to £43. Hides in shipping ordor may be quoted at 12s to 14s, aud stocks aro accumulating in curers' hands for want of an outlet.

Immigration. — Tho number of persons arrived at tho port of Melbourne by way of seaboard for tho past week, is 182, specified as under :— Colonies, 156; United Kingdom, 11 ; Calcutta, 13 ; Boston, 2., Tasmania. — We take tho following from tho Hobart Town Mercury of 27tli May : — Tho firmnoss in tho wheat market assumed a more decided form to-day, and ono or two largo parcels were quitted at 5s 6d. In other grain 110 salos wore reported. Very little hay was offered, and excepting the sale of ono or two small lots of pressed, and for shipment, there wero no transactions. In other colonial produce thero was nothing doing. The following is from tho Cornwall Chronicle of the same date : — Flour and wheat have again advanced here. The former is now firm at £13 10s per ton, and wheat ranges from 5s 3d to 5s 6d per bushel. Feed oats remain at 4s 9d to 5s, but there is a brisk demand for soeu' oats for homo consumption. Prime parcels arc scarce, aud prices roogo from 5s Od as high as Ci per bushel. Bran is steady at Is 3d per bushel. Hay remains scarce at £7 per ton. New Soum Wales. — Wo take tho following from tho Sydney Morning IJcrahl of 23rd May The amount of gold coin issued by tho Sydnoy branch of the Itoyal Mint during the week ended 22ud May, has beon -10,000 half-sovereigns. Tlio qnantity of gold-dust imported into the Bamo esta blishment during the week for tho purpose of coinage has been 9319 ounces. Tlio escorts arrived during the week from our several gold-fields have delivered at tlio mint 11,809 07. 9 dwt 14 gr of gold dust. There lias been a fair amount of business transacted iu tho share market this week. The demand for some shares still continues — prices havo gonernlly an upward tendency. Bank of Now South Wales, £49 per share ; Australian Joint Stock Bank, £13 5s per share ; Australian Steam Navigation Com pany, £28 per share ; Sydney Insurance Company, £3 5s per sharo. Government Debentures continue firm. Terminables havo sold at 101 and interest. Tho loss of the Modway by firo, with a cargo of 8000 bags of sugar, falls rather heavily on the in surance companies ; the cargo being insured by tlio Sugar Company for £19,500 in the following offices : New South Wales Marino Assurance Company, £6000 ; Sniythe's Insurance Oilico (Underwriters), £6000 ; Pacific Firo and Insurance Company, £4500 ; and General Assurance Company, £3000. As about 120 tons of tho cargo wore landed before the fire broke out, the loss will not be much moro than two thirds of tho amount insured. The vessel was not insured. Since our summary, wo have no alteration to notice in our markets, with the exception of flour, which is very firm. Tho millers havo advanced their prices 20s per ton, the quotation for fino flour being £15 por ton. Stock and Share Market. — Tho past wook has been remarkable for an unusually small amount of business. In tho boginning of tho wook, tho out going English mail and Queen's birthday occupied everybody ; aud latterly, whilo thero have been a fair number of inquiries about tho more favorito stocks, fow transactions havo boon completed. Tlireo rather important financial events, now pond ing, have contributed to produce tho stagnation .re ferred to. First in importance is tho issuo of £250,000 of Government debentures, for which ten dors are to be received at tho Treasury till noon on Monday, wlicn they will be opened in tho presence of tho tenderers. Then comes the issue of 10,000 shares, on the Victorian rogistry, of National Bank, for which tenders aro to be roceived till noon on Monday, 15th June, when they will be opened in tho presence of tho tenderers, the minimum rate having been previously announced. Lastly, there are tolorably well authenticated rumors respecting the placing of tho Melbourno Railway Company on the market at from £220,000 to £240,000, in clusive of £115,000 debenture capital. The approaching issuo of dobenturos has had the effect of preventing investments generally, from' a natural curiosity to ascertain what tho event will reveal with reference to tho state of tho market. Many-who havo no intention of tendering say, with reference to concluding purchases, ' I should liko to seo how these Government Debentures go.' Early next week we shall havo got rid of this obstacle to busi ness. Tho announcement of a further issue of shares in the National Bank came upon tho public very un expectedly; and, consequently, produced a strong revulsion in the foeling3 of those who had been seeking tho stock. This will probably soon be overcome to a considerable oxtont, but the sto.ik will probably range Is to Is Gd lower than before tho announcement, until tho parcel has boen ab sorbed. Of course it is more guess work to name. the proDaoxe minimum, but, judging by past ex perience, tenderers aro not likoly to havo any advantage over buyers in tho open market, except in tho matter of qnantity. With respect to tho offering of tho Melbourne Railway Company, various opinions are expressed, but until tho statistics on wliish tho offer is to bo based arc before us, it would bo prematura tn nf for in opinion as to the probable success of tho attempt with tho general public. We hope there will be a good solid foundation of ascertained figures, instead of estimates, for a basis. The sales roported by the brokers of the Stock Exchange have been, on Monday — Collingwood G as at £6 2s 6d ; Colonial Insurance, at lis; Minmi Collery, at £3 5s ; Achilles (mining) , at 21s; New Chum (mining), at 8s, and St Arnaud (gold mining), ? at £21. ' On Wednesday, Colonial Bank, at £6 19s, and John son's Reef Mining at Gs. On Thursday, Melbourne Gas, at £4 12s 6d for £5 shares. On Friday, Minmi Colliery, at £3 5s. Hobson's Bay Railway, at £50 10s, and Johason's Roef, at Gs. On Tuesday, and this day, tho brokers did not meet. Banks. — Colonials havo been offered rather freely at £6 19s, and there have been sellers who would have takon less to realise ; but buyers are not easily brought to book. In addition to the ordinary re action on a rather sudden rise, tho agitation re specting the Melbourne Railway Company has had a'disturbing offect on tho Btock. Nationals, which last week wero firmly hold for £1 15s 6d, aro now obtainable at Is to Is Gd less, but buyers keep at a respectful distance. Tho bank minimum is not likoly to bo under £4 15s por sharo. Bank of Now South Wales are quoted at figures much too wide to give any hope of business. Bank of Victorias aro somewhat easier, and buyers and sellors aro far apart. If buyers would advanco to £37 10s busi ness would ensue.' Gas. — Ballaarats and Bendigos havo been in steady request, but thero do not appear to bo any sellers of either stock in tho market. Castlemainos are' rarely ~ offered, and readily command £3 2s Gd. Colliugwoods are inquirod for in moderate parcels, but aro remarkably well held — £6 2s 6d is easily obtained when any parcel offers. Melbourno Gas are oscillating between £4 12s 6d, and an eighth more, with but few shares offoring. Insurance. — Australasians continue very dull. Small parcels would bo taken at 46s, but as thoro aro no shares pressed on the market quotations are rather wide, and no salos can be effected. Alliance would bo taken at 10s, but aro hold for 10s 6d. Colonials are in a little bettor favor, though at low rates. Thoro i? a strong probability that tho directors will meet tho shareholders at the annual mooting with a moro satisfactory statement than is generally looked for, and a proposal which will placo tho company on a thoroughly satisfactory footiug for tho first time. Victoria Life and General aro timidly asked for at 20s. Victoria Fire and Marino aro supported at £25, and £1 more is obtainable for limited parcels when not pressed. Tho United Fire and Marino Insurance Company of Sydnoy have opened a branch in this city, and their advertisement appoars in another column. Miscellaneous. — Bondigo Water Works aro still offered at 223 6d, without any appoaranco of business. Melbourne Exchange shares are a little duller, in consequence, it is said, of tho Government leasing the building for threo years instead of five years, as had been anticipated by recent purchasers. The shares are held for £25. Minmi Colliery shares contiuuo iu fair domaud at £3 5s. The fortnightly deliveries of this company continue largo, and its prospects generally havo beon very encouraging. Vic toria Coal Company and Victoria Kaolin Company's shares aro offered at low rates without bringing out any buyers.' Railway. — Hobson's Bay shares, after being held firmly all week for £51, wore sold yesterday for £50 10s cum. div. Sorious objection is takon to the course adopted by tho directors with reference to tho approaching dividend, which has not boen without its influence on tho market prico. Deuentures. — Business in debentures has beon ontirely suspended. Government Debentures have been offored at £108, with hints that if a shade less wore offered, business might follow, but buyers were not to bo coaxed. Melbourno Railway 8 por Cents., are obtainable at 102 to 102J. Melbourne Gas 7 por Cents.'and Colligwood Gas 8 per Cents, not offered. Dividend Mines. — Achilles haveboon sold at 21s, but tlio inquiry is not vory steady. Shares are not pressed on tho market. Agamomuons have not changod hands yet ; holders set a higher value on the shares than buyers are pro pared to concedo. Albious aro inquired for at Is. Beehives aro not offerod at recent rates, and buyers aro not sorry to fiud tlioy do not press on tho market. Catherine Uniteds do not find favor among buyers. Clunes, quartz, supported at £600, and probably if shares woro offered at £650 they woul d bo taken. Enterprise, Maldon, obtainable at £1 '50 offer. Hustlers aro in better favor, in consoqur ,nco of last return showing over 1 oz to tho ton. Headers hare raised their limits, being indi*poaocL to sell until tho result of next crushing is known Tho manager reports favorably of tho prospccts. John sons aro still taken when offered at £Gs. Nelsons hang very heavily at 4s ; little disposition to buy at any price. Tyson? unsaleable. Victoria Clunes offered at lower figures. Progressive Mines.— Eagleliawk Unions havo not attracted any attention from buyors this week. Tho M'lvor Caledonia Company hold an ordinary meoting to-day, but wo havo not heard what took placc. Now Chums aro quiet again, hut the pros pects are said to be good. A telegram from Saudv Creek 011 Saturday gave the result of tho Poverty Reef Company's crushing as about 2 dwt to tho ton. Star Reafn would find buyers at about 2s. St.' Arnaud Gold Mining dull, best offer' £20 ; a littlo moro to bo had for small numbers. St. Mungos not receiving any attention from buyers at present. Star Reef Company, Sailors' Gully, Bendio'o. — C. Davidson, manager, to Gavin G.
