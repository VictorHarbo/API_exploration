;WHAT FIGURES SHOW I - — ' W Growth o! South Australia .... ? -' . ? J ' : . j Manv people in; inries There are those who will allege that every statistician must be a romantic sort of person, for the simple reason that he deals in figures, facts, and columns, and reports as dry as bone dust and as arid is a desert. ' Probably they are quite correct, for we have it on the sure word of Shakespeare that Jacques, could 'suck melancholy out of a 6ong as. a weasel sucks eggs.' It should be said -»t once in favor of ilr. Charles S. Wickens, . Commonwealth Statistician, that, he does his .'work well, but one doubts seriously whether he revels in the pastime of compiling his quarterly summary of Australian statistics, just Lssued. It is possible that lie has all the fun he Deeds in conning the details of the annual 'Year Book,' but it is a sorry task for a reviewer to ,wade through 88 pages of figures and tables, without any introduc tion, with no appendices, and with only i-lifit of priced publications on the back cover of this gem of industry, fact, and figure. - There are sections dealing with popu lation and vital statistics, production, shipping, and commerce, finance, railways, lircraft, and motor vehicles, labor, and industrial, statistics, retail price- index numbers, and so forth. Truly a wealth of information for the' person who intends keeping his finger on the pulse of the Commonwealth from, quarter to quarter, and while the ages run. State Population It is interesting to note the growth of South Australia. The population as set put in the census of 1921 was 495,160, but the estimated population at the end of last rear was 575,771. Of this number there is an estimated Adelaide ' population of 327,686— more than half the inhabitants of the State. ; i^j*l&l;!SI The estimated population of the Com monwealth is set down at 6,234,854, and of these 2,916,247 are resident in the capital cities. Estimated natural increased population (excess of births -over deaths) is given for South Australia as 6.264, as against 6,606 in 1926 and 7,293 in. 1922. For this State the excess of immigra tion over emigration for last year -was, 3,103, but in 1926 it was 8,155. The total estimated increase of population in this State is set out as 9,377, and that for the Commonwealth is given as 124,340. For the year ending December 31, 1927, South Australia recorded - 11,402 births, 5,128 deaths, and 4,501 marriages. There were nine more births than in the pre ceding year, but the figure for 1922 was 12,001. The birth rate for each thousand of population in South Australia was last year, 20.12, but it was 23.71 in 1922. Marriage Statistics Marriage rates a thousand of mean population in South Australia are set forth as 7.88, as against 8.19 in 1922.

Swedish, Rus sian, Swiss, American, Afghans, Arme nians, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Malays, Natives of India and Ceylon, Siamese, Syrians, African, and American negroes, Papuans, Polynesians, and Mela nesians. The total non-European arrivals is set down At 1,571, and. the departures at 1,577. The average yield of wheat an acre is estimated' at '7.69 bushels for South Aus tralia, as against 14.29 in the season 1923-4, and -Tasmania -shows a lead- on- all States with 24 bushels. - Erfiry;..pb:ase. .of rural, activities and manufacturing work is set out, imports and exports are analysed, and there is a fund of information to be gathered from this production by those who revel in statistics. Yet when . the publication is laid aside one wonders whether there can be any high romance in compiling tables of facts and drawing graphs.
