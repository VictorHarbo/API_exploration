HLARKE'S WORLD-FAMED U BLOOD MIXTURE. PILARKE'S WORLD-FAMED BLOOD "MIXTURE. D. Moulham Villas, Swanage, Dorset, England. " March 6th, 1SS2. " I have long felt that I owe you an ac knowledgement and many grateful thanks for the benefit conferred upon my wife and daughter through the use of your Blood Mix ture. A swelling in my daughter's neck, so very gradual that we scarcely nolioed it coming, at length became so large and un comfortable that medical advioe was called in. The child was tiien at a critical age, and the doctor thought that when the change be came settled the neck would get well under treatment. Finding little improvement wo called in a physician, who at ouoe agreed with the other doctor that it was a case of Goitre, needing great care and greater patienoe. He recommended an immediate change to the sea-side, and certain treatment, all of which was perseveringly tried, but without success. On the return home, of my daughter we had another medical attendant, who endorsed the previous verdict — i.e., that the disease was Goitre. As, however, he did not effect improvement, my wife mentioned to him Clarke's Blood Mixture, and after examining a bottle, he assented to its being tried. I can only most thankfully say that (under God) it was the means of effecting , a perfect cure, and that now there is not the i slightest sign of swelling, nor anything to I remind us of the disease. We used about equal to two lis. cases. Then my wife had a severe attack of rheumatism (so the doctor called it) atthe hip joint She was confined to bed for use time, and every kind of out ward application kept at the Military Hospital, oeride other remedies, was tried in vain. I cannot but look upon it as wonderful that a few bottles, certainly not more than four—Ithink only three—completely removed every sign of the affection, and there has been no return. I feel sure that it will be useful in an eminent degree to make known the efficacy of your medicine in Goitre, and also in the other case, where; in both instancies, the usual medical treatment had completely failed. You are at liberty to make whatever use yon desire of this letter, simply reserving my name for private information. " Yours, very faithfully, H. N.
