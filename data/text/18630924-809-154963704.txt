VIR AND MRS KEAN AT THE PRINCESS'S. The brief fortnight is over, and Mr and Mrs C. Kean have terminated their farewell engagement at lie Princess's, not to re-appear in London till they lave returned from- the Australian colonies. In the ihort time of their sojourn among us, how much has )een done ! ' Hamlet,' ' Othello,' ' Tho Mer :hant of Venice,' which are threo of tho principal ilaj-s bequeathed to.ns by Sliakspearo ; the portion -f ' Honry the Eighth ' in which the genius of our ;reat tragedian is most prominently shown ; ' Louis ?CI,' naturalised upon our stage by Mr Kean's excel ent acting : and Coleman's pleasant comedy of ' Tho rcalous Wife, 'represented with such exuberant humor hat it is almost impossible to identifypoor Mr Oakley md his tyrannical spouse with the Danish prince ind liis conscience-stricken mother. These pieces, vo say, represent no small amount of mental or ?hysical labor to bo performed within eleven days, ivery ono of tho principal characters severally put orward on the list belongs to the highest depart nent of art. Mr and Mrs Kcan have left us amid tcclamations and hearty wishes of success in a new md untried region, fairly earned by many years' oil endured in tho best of causes, the maintenance if tho national drama ; and their admirablo per ormance during the last engagement at tho 'rincess's, newly impressing so many vivid images in our minds, renders us more painfully aware of he magnitude of our loss.
