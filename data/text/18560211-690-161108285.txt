The NowBi.— This little steamer, lately built by and launched from Mr. J. Cuthbert's yard, teofe a trial trip down the harbour on Monday afternoon, for the pHrposeJof testine her engines. A fuii description of the vessel has already been given ; we have, therefore, only to state that the engines and machinery, which are entirely of eolonial manufacture, are from the workB of Messrs. P. N. Russell and Co. They eotsist of two ten horce power oscillating cylinders, and plain flue boiler. We understand they are the first attempt of the kind in the colony, and, notwith standing the engineers think them rather smali for the size of the vessel, a speed of about 9 knotB per hour was obtained. The owners and several otter scientific gentlemen were on beard, who complimented both the builder of the vessel, Mr. J. Cnthbert, end alto the Messrs. Bussell, and stated that 6he had exceeded their most sanguine expectations. There was not the slightest vibra tion when the veFsel was going full speed. As we have before stated, the Nowra is built on the diagonal principle, and csmbineg great strength, with a very light draft of water. The order for both vessel and machinery was given on'.v three monthB ago, and she is now ready for sea. She is intended by her owners to ran on the Shoalhaven River, and will shortly be de.^atchej to that nlaco. ~ The Hellespont.— The Engineer of the Steam Navigation Board,— Mr. E. Moriarty,— having examined the machinery of this favourite vessel, both in dock and while en a trial trip on Mon day down to Bradley's Head and back, has proEOunced her in perfect order, and recommended the usual certificate of the Beard. She ie to sail on Saturday, and is advertised to take passengers at a reduced rate. Some of the cabins are already engaged for Singa pore, and the applications for berths at Melbourne are greater than the ship can accommodate. This is a favourable opportunity for posting letters and newspapers.
