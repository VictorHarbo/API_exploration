SYDNEY. frEdll OCR roRRESPOXHBlCT.1 Srdnrr, February £9. 1S60. In consequence of ministers having been defeated in the House of Assembly on Friday on the bill for making the Upper House elective, a rumour of their resignation has been freely circulated, but up to tbe present time is not cnnfirmecL The balance on tbe motion for tbe second rending of the bill was toler ably even, being 29 to 56. TrntL to tell the pnblic' generally cure very little about the ine si-3 pots, for He change has-been so often made without any sood result, that there ia no bope of ameadmtjot from! shuffling tbe cards. It is usual when' collisions of thW nature take nliee. for the minister* to make no 'explanation;' and this was lnoked fir in both Houses yesterday, when Mr. Foniter. being closely pressed on the subject, stated that be would divulge ! tbe Intentions of himself and colleague* to-morrow. Erery day adds to tbe exciting reports relative *o ?vhT'newry discovered gold field at the Snowr River, which, to a)! present appearance, nill torn out to be tlie largest deposit of the precious metal hitherto known. The accounts, although they may be iome wbat highly coloured, afford sufficient evidence that gold is distributed over a vast area Rt Gibson's F'ains and tbe defiles of the Snowy River, in tbe south of this colony, and is obtained, for the present, with comparatively little labour. Ko wonder then -that tone thousands cf ardent diggers have resem bled there, vigorously applying themselves to tlie search far gold, many of mhom have been rewarded witb good success. So long ago as 1852 tbe Bev. W. B. Clarke, 8 geologist of no mean repute, gave it as his opinion 'to tbe Government, after a careful personal survey of the locality, that gold was there extensively distributed over tbe extensive area of nine to sixteen thousand square miles! That he bad good ground for that opinion is indicated by the quantity of gold already raised there, under all {he disadvantages of hasty movement, want of proper tools not being the least. Tiiese drawbacks are. however, fast disappearing under the influence tS_ speculation, wbich is developing itself in every way that the art and wants of man can devise. Access to the auriferous deposit is no longer difficult a Use of steam and sailing vessels bsTng established from Syducy to Twofold Bay. which ply daily. Thence to the diggings. 135 miles, is necessarily a land roo to: bat tbe impetus of gain will very speedily open a coach road thereto, instead of the track being {as now) indicated by vetches cut iu the way-flide trees. The time is fast approaching when (as its uaine implies) the Snowy Eiver soil will bo rendered imponrious to tlie efforts ef the most reso lute labourers by tbe presence of ice and deep suotr; -but tf they can subsist during tbe winter montlu, they have tbe prospect of wealth bc&irc; them When spring approaches. Even now, witb the conviction of hardships awaiting them, there is a nub of people towards tbe land of promise. Men are selling off their effects and abandoning their nsnal occupations to manipulate witli ths pick-aie and apade. iu the bope of bitting upon nnggcts. It seems almost :&bnlous; to those Who are acquainted with ouZy'tiie wanner districts of Australia, that any thing jjke ??BSr'«ouiE^n jlalitoBe: bufsneb is nndoubtedly'thT iabl ; and Gibsan'a Haiiis beisg three or four tlions and Teat above the sea. snuicicntly accounts for it. if personal experience did not attest the' fact.

One of the beat antiieuticated reports from tlie seen* of actinn is that of Mr. Kofabr. who bu bad the ex|ierienee nf five years at Aadone and the Ovens. He gives it as his opiiaon titat the new diggings are (to use bis own phrase) ' without donbt the richest yet dis covered iu the colony: the gold is easier got at. is m larger nuggets, and is more plentiful than in nny diggings with which I am acquainted.' He adds that to his knowledge many parties are making £10 to £50 per man per week; and that tbe largest nugget be had seen was over 4Ibs. This was not said by way of inducement, for he thinks -it will be impossible to work during the greater portion of six months,— from March to October; no one would dream of breaking new Rimind «t so late a period as this.' Mr. G. W. Wilson, who is well qualified to give an opinion, thas writes tinder date February irtfa:— 'Though then is plenty of gold here it u useless to come now. as we must all leave in six or seven weeki this place being covered in winter with ?now to the depth of twentv feet and more; but I belies that next spring 'they will be tfas best diggings in the country.'
