Crossing still has its difficulties. The following mobs of fat cattle have passed down since our last: 240j Liscombc ; 200, Macldnnon aud Lydiard; and f)C, Dawson. To day 304, Peters’, in charge bf Mr Walsh, crossed safely ; and 170, Sweeney’s, in charge of Mr Clarke, crossed with the loss of 2. Other mobs between here and Hay are approaching. Mr M’Evoy bus crossed 900 store cattle, and Mr Scott’s 11,000 store wethers—sold to Mr Hugh Glass —will cross to morrow. No fat sheep have passed. About a dozen teams laden with wool have passed through within the last few days. Shearing operations are extending, and, as the weather for the last three days has been warm, bright and summer- like, we ex pect to hear soon that such is general throughout the district. Opr Echuca correspondent reports that no cattle crossed there either on Wednesday or Thursday; Reid’s 1300 and Peters’ 2700 sheep had crossed safely. Our Wsntworth correspondent reports a mob of fat cattle, 400, from Meuindio us being on its way to Melbourne, aud that a flock bf fat sheep, Jamieson’s, had crossed; for the same destination. Our Euston correspondent states that Messrs Burkett’s 2500 fat sheep were to cross last Monday. —Pastoral Times, September 26. Geelong. —Business has been very dull, and prices have not improved in any respect. Victorian flour stands at £14 to £14 10s, for finest wire aud silk dressed respectively; very little wheat is offer ing, the quoted rates being still 5s 6d to 5s 9d ; maize is in good demand at 4s 9d. British oats are quoted at 4s to 4s 6d, and colonial 5s to 5s 6d; but the exact value will bo tested hero to-day at the announced sale of over thirteen hundred bags of Danish, Dutch and Irish oats.— Advertiser, September 28.

Tasmania. —Wo have our files from Hobart Town to the 28th, and from Launceston to the 29th ult. The JB. T. Mercury of the former date says :— The past week has been one of continued dullness in the import and produce markets, and there is very little to report. Several sales of produce have been made for shipment to Now Zealand, and there has been an increased demand for split timber, but the supply has been fully equal to it. Potatoes have arrived rather more freely, and the demand for them has been fully supplied at quotations. In prices ■there is no change to report, and the list is as fol lows :—Flour, £13 per ton; wheat, 5s 9d to 6s per bushel; oats, 6s per bushel; hay, £5 to £6 for country pressed, aud £5 15s to £6 15s for hydraulic pressed (according to quality); potatoes, £6 to £6 10s per ton, bags included. We take the following from the Cormoall Chronicle of the 29th:— The past week has been a quiet one as far as the Horn* and grain markets are concerned. In wheat transactions have been limited, in consequence of the determination of holders not to quit except at full rates. The tendency is, however, downwards, and, though 5s 3d have been given for small parcels, buyers appear to think that 5s are quite enough. Flour is easy at unaltered rates, namely, £12 to £13. Hay, trussed, £5 to £5 10s; hydraulic pressed, £8 to £8 IQs. Potatoes, £5 10s to £6. Bran, Is 3d. South Australia.— We have our files from South Australia to the 26th ult. The S. A. Register of that date gives the following monthly commercial report:— During the early part of the month the improve ment noted in produce was fully sustained, and sales of wheat in considerable quantities were maqe at an advance on last month’s rates; but during the last fortnight there have boon no fresh export orders received either for wheat or floor, and the conso querice has beon that prices have somewhat re- j ceded. Hardly any wheat has been brought in from the country, and several of our largest mills have been compelled to stop in consequence of their wheat being exhausted. There is a fair stock of flour on hand, but no more than will pro bably be required in the adjacent colonies. There fore there is no probability of any further decline in value. Flour: We have hardly auy sales to note. Prices remain as last quoted—£l3 10s to £l4 for silk dressed. Wheat: Early in the month a con siderable demand for export existed, and sales were effected at 6s to Cos Id per bushel; but, as latterly there has beon no demand for shipment, the price has declined, and the present value is 5s 9d to 5s lOd, although but little could bo obtained at these quotations. The following arc the exports of wheat and flour up to the 19tb September:— Wheat, in Flour, quarters, in tons.

Bran hasf declined in value, and some sales took place at Is Id per bushel. Owing to the scarcity of wheat, the price is better again, and the present value is Is 3d per bushel. Oats and Earley: Hardly any stoclcs left on hand. There is no export demand, and sales arc limited to home consumption. Farm and Dairy Produce: Prices have ruled low during the past month, and the market has been well sap plied with all descriptions. Copper: The last English mail having brought such favorable advices, the price has improved, and soles have been made at £92 per ton at The Port. Wool: There have as yet been no transactions, although largo quantities arc being brought down to Port Augusta for shipment to Eng land. We hear very good accounts of the clip. The weather has been most favorable, and the yield promises to he very heavy. General Merchandise : We are singularly barren of shipping arrivals this month, the only vessels being the Toronto, from Liverpool ; the Murray, from London; the Ada mant, from Plymouth, with Government immi grants, ; and the Qmagh, from Batavia, in addition to colonial arrivals. All classes seem to unite in characterising the month that has just gone by as one of the very dullest ever experienced. Very few transactions in imported goods . have taken place. To effect sales a very considerable reduction on quoted rates, in most cases, would have to be taken; but on the other hand no disposition has been shown t>y importers to press goods upon the market. The consequence is there has been little or no business doing. In addition to stocks already on hand, there have beon considerable importations from Melbourne. The spring demand must now speedily set in, which will, we hope, make matters somewhat better ; but there are a large number of vessels on the way from England which will bring considerable additions to our already heavy stocks. New South Wales.—We have our files from New South Wales to the 24th ult. The S. M. Herald of that date says—“ The arrivals to-day Have been the Peerless, from Liverpool, with immigrants and cargo of general merchandise; and the Macassar, from Java, with 2071 baskets sugar.”
