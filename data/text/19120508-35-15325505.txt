There Beema to be a widespread idea that Beauty Culture is a luxury which lie« only within the reach of those who are blessed with a superfluity of this world's goods. Mile. Rubinstein, the keenest and ablest Skin Spe- cialist in Australasia, on being consulted on this point, unhesitatingly gave it as her opinion that the woman who can only afford to spend £1 or £2 a year on her complexion may do an amazing amount of good for herself. She should first of all provide herself with a jar of Valazc, ' that marvellous skin food, which beautifies the skin. This preparation removes freckles and spots,, blotches, pimples, lines, and wrinkles. > She should next get a jar of Novena Cerate, which ia, without doubt, one of > the finest skin cleansers (without the use of soap and water), in existence. To.these preparations should be added Valazc Skin Tonic, which tones and braces up the skin, a tonic in the truest sense of the word, stimulating and nour- ishing. Mile. Rubinstein provides Valaze Powder In conjunction with Valaze Complexion Soap, should, be used that unique specialty, Voskpasta, and the two invariably produce that smooth, subtle, sat- iny skin that is «o noticeable in all Mile. Rubin- stein's. The price« of the foregoing preparation« 'are aur Îirisingly moderate, thus:-Valaze la 3/6 and 6/8 a ar, and Novena Cerate is 2/ and 3/6, while the Powders are each 2/ and 3/ a box. Skin Tonic is 3/6 a bottle, and* Voskpasta 3/ a jar. Valazc Com* plcxton Soap is 2/2 posted. From Leading Chemists, or direct from Helen Rubinstein Prop., Ltd., Dep.
