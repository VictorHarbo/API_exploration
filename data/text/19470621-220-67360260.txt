[?] I FROM OUR COLUMNIST IN PARLIAMENT HOUSE I Carrying with him 'u haunting fear that .Taiian will rise again before Aus rr:ili;i luis doubled her population'* Inmiiirration Minister Calwell flew to London and Europe a few days ago 'to get ships, ships and wore ships.' Not long ago Calwell, a third generation Australian with a mixed WelshIrish I American ancestry, told a Danish j journalist he would 'never go outside Australia.' Prime Minister Chifley is i sending him 'because you, Arthur, can tind out what lies behind the shipping hold-up in London.' ? So the one-time isolationist, the man who used to breathe fire and brimstone about British Imperialism, the anti eonseriptionist who even during the regime of the wartime Curtin Govern ment objected to any compulsory mili tary service, Arthur Augustus Calwell is now among the dignified of White hall. Off-stage, Calwell is a thoroughly likeable person. His vituperation comes largely from reading the fiery debates of the Federation period 'and his belief that personal invective is the season ing of political debate. Handling Immigration portfolio he has dropped this habit and made friends among the Opposition parties and influenced the most conservative party people. On the eve of this departure I quiz zed him about his hopes. He was, he said, 'profoundly disappointed that the logic of the Australian case for more immigrant ships has not brought better results.' He recalled that when the Prime Minister was in London early in 1946 it was indicated that by the end of 1947 the number of berths wou!d be about 3o,000 for the ensuing year. For each subsequent year the number of berths was to increase until by the end of 1950 Australia would have an excess of 70,000 arrivals over departures. The fact is that now, at the end of 1947, Britain offers only 6,000 berths for the whole of this year while 1S6.000 im migrants are registered in London, hence Calwell's fright and flight.
