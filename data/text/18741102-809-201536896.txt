The hljrcst premium in the gift of the public has again been awarded to the SINGER SEWING MACHINE COMPANY. Read the following evidence : — The Custom House report in the " Melbourne Journal of Commerce" for 1873 supplies the follow ing important figures :— Imported by Messrs. Stanford and Co., agents for the Singer Manufacturing Company ............ .... Cases 6655, value £33,487 Being an increase on the imports of 1372 Cases 1936, value £8582 And exceeding the imports of any other firm by., Cases 2471, value £11,226 These facts speak volumes for the Singer Sewing Machine. This extraordinary success of the " Siuger" has been mainly achieved by tho company's " New Family" machine, which is universally acknowledged to be the most simple to learn, the easiest to work, unequalled for strength and beauty of stitch, and tho most com plete ana pc rfcct in mechanism and accessories for every variety of domestic sewing and embroidery. BEWARE of IMITATIONS of the SINGER SEWING MACHINE. Spurious Singers, made of inferior metal, are in the market, but they can be easily detected by the absence of the Singer trade mark, with the name of our firm written underneath. Any person caught selling a counterfeit machine as genuine Singer, will be prosecuted without further notice. Illustrated price lists sent post free. STANFORD end Co., SOLE AGENTS For Australia and New Zealand, Corner of BOURKE and RUSSELL STREETS, Melbourne. IMPORTS of SEWING MACHINES for 1873. The Imports of Tho WHEELER and WILSON MACHINES Show an increase of over 150 PER CENT., or Four times moro than Singer's, As proved by tho Journal of Commerce. The great success of the WHEELER and WILSON Company Is without doubt due to the superior Ex cellence of their machines, and the LITTLE EXERTION required to work them, which render them the most suitable FOR FEMALES. Theso qualities are owing to the Rotatory Hook System on which they are constrncted, and which combine GREAT SPEED with surprising durability and simplicity. It has been clearly proved that the genuine WHEELER and WILSON MACHINE Will do ONE-THIRD MORE WORK, and has double the durability of the Singer. The new No. SIX, For Manufacturer?, will sew any material from MUSLIN to MOLESKIN, and LEATHERWORK Of all kinds. We warrant every genuine W. and W. Machine to give entire satisfaction.
