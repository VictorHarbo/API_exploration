mtv ^WEDEll . : v :"- •"•."<""" . . (By W. Armstrong, Katunga) We left Hamburg by train at 8 n'filnnlr o'clock in the a ncr/>ninn evening and ar- - rived at Kiel.the German border town, at 10 o'clock. Herewe were all bundled out to go through the usual custom's inspection. We had heard a lot about the strictness of the Germans, so expected something pretty Severe. The official who examined my luggage asked me a number of questions in German,: which I took to. mean have you got so qpd, bo and such and such a thing, to all of which I shook my head and said no. It may have been, right and it may "have been j wrong. Anyhow, it seemed to, satisfy him, for be passed me. We were then taken individually into a room and searched, " the women having a lady in- 1 spector to search them. We j were told that this inspection | was instituted to prevent the j traffic in money and contra-j band articles. Fortunately we! got through without suffering 1 ings. the loss At of Kiel any we of got our on belong- board a steamer and travelled all night, arriving at Foster (Denmark) at 5 o'clock in the morning. The man who examined our passports here was a very offloious individual. Before leaving Australia we made out a plan of our tour, and when getting our passports vised we had to give the probable date of our arrival in each country. We had expected to arrive in Denmark on August ist,. and this was shown on our passports, but we did not reach there till the 4th (3 days later). I do not know whether we looked like criminals or not, but this official certainly treated us as though we were. He pointed out to us the fact that we were three days late as though we were guilty of some terrible crime. He sent for other men who could speak English to question us; a policeman was also brought, and notes were taken of all the replies we gave. They wanted to know where we were going and what was our, business, who did w e know in j Denmark and how long didLwe j want to stay, etc. Fmally they ; took ted us our to passports call at the and police mstruc- sta- • ,tion the following day. WhenJs we did so we had to pay a fine | ;of so much for each day w e I were overdue. I From Koster we travel^ by. tram to Copenhagen (the Danish way of spelling it is Kohenhaven). naven}.

From my obs<-r'iation I think a great many of them have a very substantial "lower chest." UUCSL. I i suciii shall never uc»ci ., forget the first meal we sat, down to in Denmark, as the , table was loaded with an abun- i dance of splendid food, and, after coming from Germany, where we had often eaten the food just to keep us alive and not because we had any relish for it, we could not help mnr ; , veiling at the contrast. The Danes are very and before a man will sit down each other before leaving. Gentlemen take off their hats to each other, and when a man ifrrets a woman I have seen him hold his hat in his hand and stand bareheaded while he hakes hands. s a From Copenhagen we went to Skodsborg, a little village about 10 or 12 miles from the city. It was a beautiful, place, the surroundings being. most ideal. After continuous travelling for so long we enjoyed a week's quiet rest here. We • also received our letters from home and a supply of "Numur- •kah Leaders," which were read with great interest. As. you know, the Danes have a worldwide reputation for their dairy products, and especially butter, which usually commands the highest price in the English market, so it was with pleasure that I accepted .an invitation to visit an up-to-date dairy farm where an average of 60 cows were milked. -This -.farm" was owned by a rich business man in Copenhagen and was managed by a Mr Brown. All the; buildings, sheds, «tc., seemed to have been erected regardless of expense; the floors WAM were all tiled! and everything was kept in apple-pie order.* Mr-Brown first showed TIS their horses, w hich are of the Suffolk Punch breed, and very fine specimens they were, too. They are a good deal lighter in the legs than Clydesdales, but have great bodies, and are said to be very stt>on g - W e next visited tbe pig pens, "" where we saw the Irish c&naries;" tn all stages h w f a g a f ^ f ^ W ^ S S n S tions.

Mr Brown informed me that if he clears 100 kroner out of every 900 kroner received as income he is well satisfied. We saw some -splendid crops of mangolds, turnips, etc. The country is undulating-, and reminded me of ^e land around Maffra, Gippsland. Mr Brown asked us lots of questions about" Australia, a n d said he would very much like to come out here and take! «P land. I think we received * J»ore inquiries in Denmark} about the prospects for new ( settlers in Australia than in any other country. I am not an authority on immigration, but as far as I could see the Danes would make splendid citizens, They are industrious, " thrifty, and highly skilled in the dairying industry and in the produclion of . all root crops. They have" a surplus of population, and many of them are migratmg to America and Canada, While m Denmark r met a young man from Iceland, and in conversation I asked him - how they, lived up there, and what were their industries, etc. He said they carried o n dairying and agriculture about, the same as in Denmark. . I said T always thought that Iceland was a land of snow and . ice. i "Yes," Jie said, "It has a Very cold name, hasn't it?" On our way to Scotland we travelled with a man who was on his way to the Faroe Tslands and Iceland. He told us that at the former place there is" very little in the way of fuel for burning during the winter. All the manure is saved for this purpose, and in summer time birds are shot and dried and thev are used for fuel too' n„, in(> „„„ .

We circled over the city and then set off on our long journey of about 190 mile^. At first you look down on the roofs of the houses below, or the sea, or the rocks, and begin to figure out wljat kind of a chance you would have if anything happened to the plane, but you soon become accustomed to the new experience and get lost in wonder and admiration as you gaze at the beautiful ever-changing- panrama below. We were flying t a height of from 400 to 800 eet, and maintained a speed of round 120 miles an hour. Sometimes we would be flying over a forest, a few minutes later we would be over the sea, and a little later the scene below, would be the peaceful farm with the cattle grazing and the crops just ready to be harvested, Tn the plane we were very comfortable. We had a roof ver us- one sj de was closed in d (though transparent), and on the other side there was about t foot of space through which' du could put your head or your and if you wished to: The trip _ so smooth that I was able to write several cards to my In Australia as we flew We did not experience many humps as you usually In ;a~rkilway carriage.
