COMMERCIAL. Age Office, Saturday Evening. There wero no export entries passed for gold at tho Customs to-day. From tho dulness created in tho import market by tho delay in tho arrival of tho English mail it was fully anticipated that on its receipt business would assume a very different appearance, confirmed as theso anticipations wero by telegraphic advices from Adelnido that the aggregate amount of ship ments from England to Melbourno wore only equal to ubout one-half thatof tho previous mouth, as repre sented by £230,687. Tho Bombay arrived in Hobson's Bay early on Tuesday forenoon, tho letters being delivered lato that evening, and it soon bocamo evi dent, that tho deficient, though eo largo, was chiefly in soft goods, almost every other description being quite ample, if not more than sufficient for our requirements, thus dissipating in tho meantime any chance of improvement, for, with tho exception of tobacco und fruits, every other description of goods has been without activity, or the slightest sign of animation. Ales in bulk have again submitted to a reductiou. Caudles havo lost the slight advance of tlie previous fortnight. Corn sncks are better, woolpacks maintaining tho recent rise. Coffee has submitted to a reduction. Malt is still further depressed by continued largo shipments. In provisions — butter has receded a littlo. Bacon and hams and choeso sustain former rates. Itico is firm at the advanco established. Sugar is without acti vity. Tea quiet. Timber, little doing in. Tobacco attracting additional notice, and prices going higher. Wines and spirits continuing without change. The British and foreign arrivals comprise ono vessel from Rotterdam, three from England, ono from Bermuda, one from Vancouver's Island, and the mail steamer. Ale and Stout. — Bulk ale gives no indication of any improvement, business being limited to tho most insignificant purchases solely for trado pur poses and at lower rates. Bass's No. 3 liaa been Bold at £7 15s, and in somo instances is offered at £7- 12s 6d. . Allsopp's has been placed at £8 ; Mar rian's can be bought at £7 17s 6d for largo to £8 5s for small lots. A parcel of Joule's has been quitted at £8, but in trade lots £8 5s to £8 10s has been paid.' The Carlisle Company's has found buyers at £8 to £8 5s. Ind, Coopo and Co.'s is not parted with under £8. The Colonial Company's would be sold at £7 12s 6d to £7 15s. No Bales of Fulton's Scotch aro reported under £7 10s, but over £7 no sales can now bo effected. Youngor's is similarly situated. Taylor, Walker and Co.'s stout has been cleared off tho market at £7 7s 6d to £7 10s.' Whitbread's is offering at £7 5s. In bottled ales, though very little is doing, shipments come forward so sparingly as not to affect prices, the favorite brands continuing to realise 10s to 10s 3d; Joule's and the Colonial Company's bringing 9s 6d, while brands not in prime order fetch 8s 6d to 9s 3d for ordinary de scriptions* For bottled stout tho demand remain's slack, with little change on former rates. Homy White and Co.'s maintains its position, and sells at 10s 3d. Maclien's is quotod a shade less this week, say 9s 9s. Dunphy's is readily bought at 9s 6d. i Byass's realises 9s 3d ; in some cases 9s 6d is got for trifling lots. A shipment of Bridge's, just arrived, has been disposed of at 9s 3d ; Colonial Co.'s and Hibbert's realising a liko figure. At auction, 500 cases Byass's, seen and examined, realised 7s 6d, with all deficiencies ; another parcel sold, as per sample, at 6s Gd ; a parcel of Dunphy's, faulty, 7s 6d ; and 250 cases of the latter brand, quite sound, brought 6s per dozen. The shipments of bulk beer especially advised for April are very much lighte?, but no favorable impression lias been caused in consequence ; they consist of, in glass, 16,330 cases, and 1260 hogsheads of bulk. Bagoing. — A bettor feeling is ovinced towards cornsacks, a few small', sales having been effected since tlie'mail came in at 19s ; the improvement in woolpacks noted in our last has been confirmed by intelligence of a great decrease in shipments. The price is' steady at 5s 3d for 10-lb packs. .. , ' Candles.— English advices have had a depressing tendency on this market, wliich, in consequence, has been, very languid — sales of any sort being difficult to mako. ? Small lots of Belmonts have been sold at 12£d, and, though 12d has been refused for 500 boxes, we do not estimate tho value of such parcels at more money. Hale's have been sold at lljd. We quote Ogilvie's and other, English and Foreign brands at llgd to Is. The Neva Stearine Co. have reduced their prico to Is OJd. At auction Is was realised for sound, and Is Ogd for damaged full weights. Light weights are not worth over 9£d. Under present circumstances tho shipments advised are much moro than sufficient for our requirements, being 93 tons, besides those coming direct from foreign countries.. ? ? Cement. — Wo have no change to report in this article, Roman continuing neglected. Portland sells at 25s ; American, plaster at 30s ; and English at 20s. Shipments are still on moderate scale. Cordage. — Manilla rope is dull, and without im provement at £47 to £49 for assorted sizes ; Eng lish Manilla bringing £50 ; seaming twine is sale able at 14§d to I5d. Confectionery sells freely at unaltered rates, say lid for assorted, . Is for jujubes, and 13d for candied peel. ? Chicory. — 3Jd is quoted as a current figure, but sales have been effected at 3gd, a fair demand being experienced; '??1 ? . Coffee continues exceedingly quiet, and to make ony progress in sales a reduction has been submitted to. Plantation wo cannot quote over 12d, for Native lOd to 10Jd; 'and for Java 10d.- - - Chemicals. — Crystals of soda have been in more demand; at £8 10s to £8 15s. Soda ash is quite neglected, at £10 to £12. Caustic very dull, at £20 to £21. Flower of sulphur, £21 to £22. Sul phuric acid and carbonate of soda are unnoticed.: Turkish' opium is wanted at an advance, 19s being now offered. Coal$ are without improvement, buyers not feel ing anxious to go over 28s. Fish. — Very little ling offering, the demand for which is not heavy, at 5 Jd for sound and good. Herrings realised 27s to 28s for half-barrels, and 10s for firkins. Fnuns. — Under instructions from London, all the currants in tho market have been bought up, both from importers and the trade, many parcels to arrive having also been secured at 3.}d to 3gd, in bond. A largo advanco has been established since on those figures, a small parcel previously overlooked having to-day been disposed of at Gd. Wo understand tho holder intends fixing his prico at a much higher figuro, feeling so warranted by the smallness of tlio stock now here. A large purchase of muscatel raisins is also reported, upw ards of 20 tons of loose and layers having changed hands in ono lino, tho forrnor at 6d, and the latter at 7Jd ; sultanas aro valued at 7Jd ; figs have been sold at 6Jd to 6.}d ; preserved French figs, at 3Jd to 3jd ; soft shell almonds, 6Jd.

All tho recent arrivals of hams and bacon havo been cleared off at Is 5d and Is 4d ; prices are very firm, and likely to remain so. Fine ! cheese brings fullj rates of la lid to Is 2d ; Goudas realised lOAd to lOJd. Shipments of butter, 1769 firkins ; hams and bacon, GO tons ; and cheese, 36 do ; none of which can be called heavy. Quicksilver| is in slow trade demand at Is lOd for California, and 2s Id for Spanish. Rice, since the advance noted in our last, has not been operated in, buyers not feeling as yet dis posed to give the priccs asked. Advices from Cal cutta are favorable, the Mayotto with a small cargo beiDg tho only vessel sailed in addition to tho Prins Carl and Oxenbridge during tho month. Of thoso advised to follow, the A. H. Badger aud tho Notre I Dame des Victoires, tho former is already sold to arrive. Prices in consequence are firm at £25. Salt attracts no attention, though of lato an in creased consumptive demand has been felt. In one instance £3 10s has been paid for coarse ; £3 5s is however the moro general rato. A disputed parcel sold at. auction for £3 Is. Fine is unaltered at £5 to £5 5s. Shipments are uuprccedcntedly light, being only 213 tons.

Tho week has been productive of little improve ment in business, whilst the urrivals continue to augment our stocks. The prices of carriage remain at our last quotations, with very little loading offer ing ; indeed, it has been ascertained on reliable in formation, that the stock of flour at tho Dunstan ex ceeds 1000 tons, whilst tho computed population is now at most 9000 souls. Purchases havo been made as low as £32 per ton. Tho Lake district, owing to tho good state of tlio roads, and competition with another market, occupies a somewhat similar posi tion, and flour has been sold at £45 per ton, and this . prico has a downward tendency. Tho stock of flour in Dunedin cannot bo less than 1500 (fifteen hundred) tons, a fact which ought to influence further im ports of this article. We havo already stated the bulk of tho stock is in first hands, and if held must realise tlio rising value in other markets — at present thero is little prospect of any rise in prico here, ex cepting for the best brands. Tho stock of horse feed is on the increase. Independent of intercolonial supplies of oats recently to hand and coming forward, the Electric, from Glas gow, has brought a largo parcel of Scotch, a portion of tlio expected shipments reported in a former issue. The price of oats will to a great extent bo ruled by the carrying trade, but if up-country stocks are as heavy as reported, it must have a tendency, for the present, downwards. When it is remembered that a large amount of cash has been drawn out of the pockets of the storekeepers to satisfy the cost of cartage it will be evident to Dunedin merchants that some relief must bo afforded by them and the banks to preserve the equilibrium of prices and to obviate sacrifices to meet engagements. That business is sound at tho core nobody can deny, but it is quito evident a cessation of imports will only bring about an improvement in the market. Up to the present time prices have remained firm, and have proved re munerative to importers, but tho accumulation of stock, especially in certain articles, will have the effect of producing a tendency downwards. The stock of butter is reported heavy at the Dunstan, whilst tobacco is overstocked on the Lake diggings, and supplies in town are beyond requirements. We havo no alteration to quote in prices ; if anything, they may bo considered easier, excepting in first-class pale brandies, which remain firm. Tho escort returns for the week ending Tuesday show a good average. Tuapeka maintains its reputation as a gold-field, and the Wakatipu shows an improvement. The direct imports which are expected to arrive continuously during tho spring and summer months will necessarily react on other markets' now relying on this province for a large .portion of their exports. -The trade will presently find it more to their advantage to re- assort their stocks from theso direct imports ; on the other hand, importers should offer every encouragement to secure custom, which otherwise will necessarily bo diverted to other channels.
