Her cargo was thorcforo immediately discharged, and on Saturday she was placod in Captain Rountroo's hands to re pair. Oil being dookod and examined, it was found that tho koolson and Btringcrs had ull boon butted abreast the muln must, und a heavy oargo being in her, sho hud oponcd at tho butts, and tiiua tho lcakugo accouatod for. To remedy this evil, Captain Rountree has placed fenr sister keelsons, of iron bark, In her, 50 feet long, and 12 by 14 inches square. These arc i bolted through with copper. Two stringers of ta-nc tho length and proportionate thickness, arc pluced under the lower deck | beams.

The whole of this wor^ has been performed in five days, a degree of despatch that reflects . great credit on the establishment. — Si/ lney Utrahl. Dredging Punts. — The plans for the construction of punts for the removal of silt are now lying nt the Ilarbor Master's office. The principle appears perfectly novel, the contents of the vessel being discharged by slides instead of traps, which will allow of the silt being deposited in much shallower water than by those at present in use. When completed they will be used principally in conveying the mud to that portion of the Botanical Gardens which is so speedily being leclaimcd.— Sydney Herald. VESSELS FOR THE FITZROY GOLD-FIELDS.
