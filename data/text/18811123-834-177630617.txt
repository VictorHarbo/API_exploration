TO THE ELECTORS OF THE DARLING DOWNS. /''I ENTLEMEN,— Although in the opinion VJT of some of your number 1 acted im prudently in resigning my seat in tho Assembly as one of your representatives, yet I beg to assure you, one and all; that I was actuated ; by: the highest motives of ipublic1 policy. 1 value, as I think every memoer ought to value, the good opinion of my con stituents, and when a number of my consti tuents banded themselves together as, a representative deputation, and waited on Ministers and stated that I did not represent the feelings of my constituents on a question which had already received the sanction of the representative branch of the Legislature, I felt that an indignity had been cast upon me, and an attempt made to discredit my Parliamentary utterances as your representa tive. Moreover, I found that, not satisfied, with the deputationising business, the same parties were using tho Press and other avenues of publicity to degrade me in the eyes of the electors. Conscious that what I had advocated in the Assembly in the pur chase of the Canning Downs estate was the outcome of conscientious conviction, and »ri honest dosire to serve my adopted country, I felt that it would be better for me to resign' my seat than be made the victim of studied and continuous misrepresentation, instigated by certain members of the Government. ? Having waited some days for a candidate to offer himself to you who would possess yonr undivided confidence, and finding that no such candidate was forthcoming, and. having received urgent requests and solicita tions from all parts of the electorate to offer; myself again to the constituency, I have con sented to do so, and now appeal to you for re- election, and ask you to let me know through the ballot box, whether I still enjoy the confidence you have twice during the past three years generously reposed in mo. 1 need hardly tell you that I am n decided supporter or the Hon. S. W. Griffith, the Leader of the Opposition, and am still pre pared to assist him in his gallant struggle against tyranny and corruption. No Queenslnnder with any patriotic feeling can have the slightest faith in a Government kept in power by 'a solid phalanx ' of ser vile followers, many of whom cling to the Ministry from purely selfish, motives, and are supporting the Government because tho Go vernment support them. The payment of £550 to Mr F. A. Cooper, in direct violation of a resolution of the Assembly, for revising statutes which are now found to be all but valueless, and have to be recalled for amend ment,- illustrates the ., corrupting influences .at. work to obtain support. The financial polioy of the present Govern ment must, before long, land Queensland into a' bogliole or quagmire, from whichit will be difficult to extricate* it... -During the last three years they .'have increased the public debt from ten ' millions to fourteen millions, chiefly expended upon nonrepro ductive works ; while, during the same period, British and German immigration was stopped, and the burden of interest of this large debt consequently falls upon a sparse population. They are now alienating the best portions of the public estate on Peak Downs an;d elsewhere to their friends and supporters at from 10s to 15s the acre, in very largo blocks ; while, at the same time, they are charging men of small menus, and cultivators of the soil, £4 and £5 the. acre for eighty-acre blocks.' The interest on our publio debt is now nearly £700,000 a year,' or; more than one third of our annual revenue, and the colony is drained of this cuormous. som annually to be sent to London to pay the interest on our debentures. In the face of these facts the public money is frequently frittered awny. For instance £2000' was voted to Mr Landsboroughfor his exploration, of the Western country, while the claim made by Mr, P. . O'Sullivan for the grant of £500 to the widow and orphan of a public officer, who was murdered in the performance of his duty, was scornfully rejected. To prevent a serious crisis, they will have to go on, year after year, borrowing not only tomeet tho payments of the interest, but, to cairy on useless works beyond the re quirements of our small, and, I am sorry to say, decreasing European population. Gentlemen, do not bo led away by the Premier's boasted prosperity of the colony. The lavish expenditure of the borrowed mil lions among our small population must of necessity create a kind of fictitious pros perity ; but the re-action which is inevitable will fall most heavily npon the taxpayers in the settled distriots, and particularly upon, those who have made Queensland their per manent homo. My political opinions on all the great ques tions of the day are pretty well known to you, and I shall not trouble you with a recapitulation of them here. I leave myself confidently in your hands, feeling assured from your past treatment of me, I shall receive justice. I have the honor to bo, Gentlemen, ' ;: Your obedient Servant, FRANCIS KATES.

Ryan, Farm Creok GENTLEMEN, — I thank you for the \JT honor you have done mo in requesting jno to stand for tho Darling Downs Constitu ency.' I may say when somo of your number first proposed-this I was surprised and unprO' pared to give an immediate answer; however, I consider it now my duty to accede to your roquoat, and if elected will do my utmost to further tho interests of tho colony in general, and this district in particular. In order to be useful to the Electorate, I do not think it advisable, »-ir hdvo I any desire to act as a violenb- political partizan, but while giving a fair and general support to this or any other Government which may bo in power' Election Notices. would at the same time 011 any vital matter hold my own viows and act independently. There are not-at present, so far as I can ob serve, any burning questions agitating the country, and tho difference between political parties appears so undefined as to seem almost non-bxiatcnt. I therefbro do not appear before you either as a Nominee of the present Go vernment or as an Opposition Candidate, nor .when I consented to stand had I any communi cation with' the Leaders of either Party. I !am a resident among you, and on this Electoral Roll my interests are bound iip with your own ; and as President of tho Warwick School of Arts, tho Eastern Downs Associa tion, connected with your Turf Clubs, and as Committee-man of tho. Toowoomba Royal Agri cultural' Society I may say I have already identified myself with the district and its welfare. .,, Although the time will no doubt arrive on the occurrence of some great question when every man in Parliament must take somo de cided stand on one side or the other j at pre sent I do not consider this position is de manded. ? -Therefore my main object meantime (should you return me) would be to exert my self! to my utmost to benefit this Electorate That it has not. received the attoation it de serves is patent to us all, and any party which denies us fair consideration will receive but little support from 1110. Among many other matters that require immediate attention, I may mention the fol lowing : — The Lunatic Asylum at Too woomba, the Post and Telegraph Office at ?Allora, and the Hospital at Warwick ; for all these the money has already been voted, it is in the power of the Ministry to grant, and in the province of your Representative' to demand, and if elected, I shall certainly undertake to do this at once. A Refreshment Room is also necessary at the Warwiok Railway Station for the con venience of passengers between Stanthorpe and Toowoomba. Tenders require to be called for the line from Highfields, and also for the line from Warwick to Killarney, these I believe I can undertake to have immediately proceeded with. In the matter of the claim of the Govern ment against the Corporation of Warwick for the Waterworks, it will be my duty to have this modified to some extent. As to the Exchange Lands at Allora, I consider, in the face of two bad seasons out of three, that some extension of time should be allowed the purchasers ; should they require it, this I would adovcate. 1 am also in favor of a line (which I believe would be remunerative) from either Greenmonnt, Clifton, or thereabouts, pro ceeding thence through Clifton Back Plains to Leyburn, and thereafter via Westbrook Homestead Area to Oakey Creek. I may state as tho subject is now being mooted, that I have had some experience of Coolio labor. I will vote and work strongly against the introduction of these people into Towns and Stations or anywhere beyond the boundary of Sugar Plantations, and even then if they are to cost the country one shilling. I regret that I am not sufficiently acquainted with some parts of the Electorate so as to be thoroughly conversant with the wants thereof. In the event of my election, it will be my duty and interest to visit these portions and obtain tho necessary knowledge. I will also, previous to the day of Polling (the 29th instant), visit as many of the centres of population in the constituency as possible, and meet and addreas the Electors thereat. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, four Obedient Servant, WM. ALLAN. Public Notices. NOTICE. AUSTRALIAN JOINT STOCK BANK. REMOVED to NEW PRBMISES, corner of Ruthven and Margaret Streets.
