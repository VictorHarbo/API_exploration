FOR NORDIC MIGRANTS r - Australia To Advertise From Our Special Representative CANBERRA, Saturday. Any suggestions for in- ' creasing the flow of Northern European migrants to Aus tralia, which may follow the publication of the Overseas Settlement Board's report in England, will be welcomed by the Commonwealth. There is no possibility that the Commonwealth will announce any special inducements to nationals of one or more foreign countries, com pared with those of' other countries. Actual conditions laid down to govern the admission of aliens must apply generally. However, It is felt that, by taking steps to advertise to. Northern Euro peans the advantages - offered to migrants by Australia, tliey. would corne here in grentcr numbers. Conversations already held with the Danish emipfation authorities by llie Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) are a start in this direction. Sir Earle probably will make simi lar approaches to other countries, such as Holland, Norway and Sweden.
