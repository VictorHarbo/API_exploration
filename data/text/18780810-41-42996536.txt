MlSCILLANKOCS. The R.M.S. Siam. which has rained the reputation of being the fastest steamer of the P. & O. Company's fleet between' GallA and Australia, exceeded all pre vious performances by the trip just closed from Galla to Glenelg. She left Galle on the 24th July, at 9.30 p.m., and experienced light S.3.E. winds, with fine weather, to the Equator. From thence to latitude 22' S., fresh trade winds, with high seas and fine weather, prevailed ; after which to King George's Sound fresh and strong N.W. winds and rainy weather were fallen in [with. The Sound wa* reached at 1.32 p.m. oa August 5, and left at 5.20 p.m. on the same day. During the passage to Glenelx moderate' and \- fresh N.W. -winds with fine weather set in. Cape -?' Borda was passed at 5.35 p.m. on the 8th August -' ' within a mile and a half of the station, and the Siam : ?_ was discerned off Glenelg at about 2 a.m. on the 9th. -VShe anchored well inside the hulk at 2.15 o'clock. ' ' The run from Galle to King George's Sound occupied \- 11 days 16 hours £ minutes, and from the Sound to Glenelg 3 days 12 hours 11 minutes, the voyage having occupied 15 days 4 hours 3 minutes, including the stay at the Sound. The news from . England is under 35 days old, so that the passage throughout is Uie fastest on record. The Siam not having been reported »t Cape Bordt was hardly expected so early by the officials, notwith standing that Commander Hector had telegraphed \- from Uie Sound that he would be at Glenelg at 2 a.m. on the 8th. The weather was rather thick, bat it . being moonlight favoured the outlock for the steamer, and the watch therefore had very little difficulty in ' picking her up on the westerc horizon. The Fairy .was promptly alongside, and as ths Siam was settling ' into a' position the outward-bound R.M.S. Tanjore got under way, and with a . full ~ head of _ steam headed * down the - gulf and was soon out of sight, The Siam's m&Qs; were lauded at the jetty about 3.30 a.m., and, reached Adelaide by special truck shortly after 6 o'clock. The steamer y.leanor and tne lighter York were busily engaged for several hoars transhipping cargo for Adelaide, which was unusually heavy ; owing to the P. A O. Company Ti«rTng w^nr-Ai^ ^1ti» fr»»fght fmm something like £13 ? per ton to from £A 10s. and upwards— a tariff recognised by the Orient line of steamers. At the most the cargo by the P. & O. boats has not been usually more than » few score of packages, but this ^trip nearljr £00, packages were landed.' There was a ~rauier heavy sea running during the stay of the Siam, but trie work- of transhipment was executed without delay, and the steamer was able to leave the Bay.at a .. quarter-past 14 a.m. .' ? l»22!3 taw''? \- 1: .. ?

London, July 5.— During the past week there h« been very little alteration in the freight market, but there is still a fair enquiry for steam and sailing tonsage for Cape potts, the East, and the Colonies, both from London and the coal ports, and the rat js last quoted are in consequence dimly maintaineil.
