Gentlemen, Having completed the largest portion of my canvas^ 1 am glad to inform my friends that on every occasion* when I addressed the electors I received an enthu siastic reception. and was accorded a vote of con. fidence as a fit and proper person to represent the diatrict in Parliament. I have now to ask my friends' to exert themBelvee and put me at the head of the? poll, holding as I do the following principles: I am in favour of continuing the selecting clause o!' the Laod Act 1869, without which, along with the> residence clause, not more than one-half of the present - selectors would have secured suitable land to make homeB for themselves. Of thespeedy issue of leases without the railway clauses sought to be inserted. Of constructing railways through the most impor tant centres of population in the Wlmmera. Of constructirg water reservoirs where most re quired. Of supporting a reasonable system of im> migration. Of a gradual return to free trade. 01 an alteration in our taxation, so as to remove' some of the burdens now on the working rlamno. and making the ltnds and other property pay its fair Share to the expenses of government. Of competitive examinations for entering the civil service. Of federation and intercolonial free trade. Of taxing land at its natural or marketable value* without the improvements tbereon. Of coming to reasonable terms with pastoral tenants to have those 110th section reserves sur> rounded by selectors made public reserves. I am against all kinds of penal legislation, the > bursting-up taxes, taxing what is called the unearned increment of property, and other kindred proposals* now before the public. I am your obedient servant, JAMK8 MAQBAIN. TO the ELECTORS of WARRNAM BOOL. Gentlemen, I thank you for the honour yon have done me in.-, again electing me to represent your district in the Legislative Assembly. I am much gratified at the distinct evidence which my unopposed return affords of yonr marked approval of my past conduct, as well as that of the Govern ment, and also of the policy which I have submitted': to the country. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JAMES M'CULiiOCH. Melbourne, Bth May, 1877. rPO THE ELECTORS OF WESF X BOURKE. Gentlemen, It is with extreme regret I have to announce my withdrawal from the present contest, owing entirely to the tact of finding so many of the electors already pledged. I take this opportunity of thanking all those of my friends who have interested themselves in my behalf, and beg to Intimate that it is my intention to place - my services at your disposal the first vacancy thafr may occur. I am gentlemen. Tours very truly, W. J. LOBR Judicial and Law Notices. TpDWARD HENRY COLEY.
