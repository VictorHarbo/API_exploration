Dr. Malouy, aur m : : 1 )U YOU THINK MY WIFE WILL EVER I RECOVER HER HEALTH? as asked of us by a gentleman o'no day. He said, my 1 fo ims long boeu a sufferer, and sbo is now very ?veak, id lias been gsttlog weaker for a long time, and no edicino will do her any good. She is now unfit to be — oved from her bed, and very much enlarged by I ropsy. I Well, Sir, I said, what I will first ask you Is; will you do i K direct you 7' 1 will, he -said, and I am sure that my I fe will do anything iii reason to regain hor health. For ' ur years she has been complaining, tbreo years of that L no being very I)!, and in great misery. Your advertise I ent in last. Saturday's Age referred to a case very much J re my wife's, only she must have taken your treatment \ an earlier stage of hor complaint than my wife did. J I could haily. tell you how many doctors attended my ife during her illness. Some agreed, others differed, , it no mediciuepreicribedeier did her the slightest good, j ftersoiueyears'-irial, and'flnding no. improvement, I ought 1 ' Would try herbalist, aud con iiued for .some months ..under his treatment, ithouft1 deriftilg any' benefit from it. After this v >th liiy wife ¥n dning her health, . Boeing, that shewn still increasing ? 1 size with tho dropsy, aud being in a very weak state, I ;ain scot for a doctor; who said there bras only one hope, id that was to tap her and remove the water, but ring so very weak sho oauld not stand tapping. At this time she ceuld scarcely breathe, tho dropsy had " ctondedsofarupthebody. About this time I met' a mtloman who asked after my wife's health, and on tell ; >g htm how she was he Immediately advised mo . to con- tit W. Mentiplny and Son, of 190 Bourke-street. ; After J Ring my wife what 1 bad been advised to-do she at uco consuutcd to try onco more as a laBb resource. Now, Mr. Mentiplay, I have told you . my wife's; condl- on, nnd I want you to be candid with me ; do you think 1 ly wife will ever regain her health. My reply was j rrtalnly, if you will attend to my instructions. Then gave htm for his wife' our Liver and Kidney ' Ills, with Instructions to take 4 pills 4 j iines per dpy alternately, or before each 1 teal and at bedtime, and. If she did not improve a little < itblo ono week then to inqrease the dose to 6 Pills each ' imo. The Gentleman said I am afraid my Wife will not 1 a able to take so many, because aha U so very weak, fow, Sir, ) said, you promised to follow my directions, nd I may tell you that the more Pills your Wife takes bo sooner she will regain her health.' 'Now, Mr. Monti ilay, seeing you so thoroughly understand all diseases, an you tell me the cause of my Wife's illness ? I believe can, I replied. " For many years your Wife has suf cred from disease of the Liver, which has .affected . tho Cidneya to the extent of Brieht's Disease, although not or advanced "; but she took medicine that Is advertised o euro Brlght's Disease, but it did not do her any good, tod, therefore, you must learn to treat such puff in the naoner it deserves. That, Sir, fa t&e; cause of your Wife's llness. Well, Sir, be replied, If you can cure tny Wife- you will |o what NO OTHER man in this World could do, and I issure you I will pot forget you, and will make it known araodwlde for the benefit nf other sufferers. I have jcen a resident of Newtands, Ooburg, for 35 years, and im respectably well known In that district, and any jeraon doubting the substanoo 0! this testimony apply ,0 Mr. JOHN ENDERSBEE, Newlands, Cobqrg, ind I will be ploaned to give any information required, This case is like many others the doctors call hopeless which is curable by prppor treatment. They still persist In deluding the publio by telling them there is no hope In curing hydatids only by operation. Now 1 am prepared to deposit £50 against any doctor's £60 that I can cure hydatids without operation.
