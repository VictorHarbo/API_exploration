B.uique Lon* ir Fihe off Lady Eluott'b Island.— A telegram from Gladstone -was received by the Government on the 20th February, announcing that the steamer Sonoma had arrived in that port, and that the captain had re ported that on the night of the 19th instant, at 10 o'clock, he passed a large American-built vessel in flames, about fifteen miles off Lady Elliott's Island, in an easterly direction, and from Saiidy Cape noitb by ytctt thirty miles. She was burnt to within three feet of the water, with the exception of the bow, ¥hich appeared to be that of a clipper ship, painted black. The fipure-head had fallen off, and the bowsprit was still standing, but the masts bad gone by the board. The Soxonia steamed round the burning vessel, and remained beside her for about an hour, but no appearance of boats or crew were visible, and owing to the stern being in flames it wap impossible to make out her name. The -wind was easterly, and the water very smooth, and it is the opinion of Captain Page that the crew bad got off in the boats, and run for Lady Elliott's Island, and that the wreck could not float more than an hour after be left her. Although the Eaxonia passed within a few milee of Lady Elliott's Island, no effort was made by the captain to dis cover whether any of the people from the burning vessel had. taken refuge there. On the receipt of this intelligence by the Premier, he at once telegraphed to the Flatypns, Captain Cairn crefF, to proceed without delay to the scene of the disaster, and also to Mr. R. B. Sheridan, portmaster of Maryborough, directing him to use evcrv tffort to discover some further particulars con cerning the ill- fated vessel, or to render assistance to the survivors, if any there were. The agents of the Australian Steam Navigation Company were aim requested to help in the matter. Great fears were entertained that the unfor tunate vessel was the immigrant ehip Sultana, bound for Kcppcl Boy, v ith near five hundred passengers, and -which vessel is now due. We arc very glad, however, to be able to set those fears at rest. The following telegram was received lant night, by the Premier, from Mr. Sheridan, and was kindly forwarded to us for publication :— ' The burning vessel proves to be the barque Loda, 447 tons, Henry Warde, znuswr, bound from Melbourne to Shanghai, with coal. She caught fire 100 rhilcs north-east of Breuksta Spit, and was dismasted in latitude 17 6., loruntudc 161 E. The crew arc all 6avcd.' We may mention that immediately after Captain Caircross receiving the telegram* steam was got up on board the Platypus, and no time lost in acting upon the in structions he bad received.— Queensland Guardian, February 22, The following is from the West Coast Times of February 12 :— 'A special messenger to Mr. M'Intyre, of the firm of Morrison, Law, and Co., arrived hi town from the Grey late on last Satur day night, with the information that the steanuslip Star of the Evening had gone ashore on the South Spit. Mr. M'Intyre at once started for the Grey : and all day on Sunda; extraordinary rumours were in circulation respecting her position, amount of damage done, &c.; Towards evening, however, a party arrived from the Grey, with the intelligence that the Star of the Evening was high and dry upon the beach, close to the steamer Nelson. If this should prove correct, her position is most perilous, bat hope it will prove as false as many other reports which have lately reached us from the Grey, we shall doubtless hear the truth of the matter to-day .'

The well-known clipper ship Jason arrived early on Thursday, after a splendid passage of 79 days from Plymouth, having on her present voyage eclipsed all her previous performances by beating every vessel that left London for this port during the month previous to her departure. She left Start Point on the 11 tb. of December, crossed the line on the 31st, and ran down her easting in latitude 48- ; on February 17th, passed the meridian of Cape Lcuwin ; rounded S.W.capcof Tasmaniaon the 22nd,andwasoff ' Jcrvis Bay on last Saturday morning, 75 days out ; from thence to this port light E. and N.E. winds prevailed. In latitude 32-16 6., longitude 27-38 W., spoke ship Hecuba, from Liverpool to Calcutta, short of water, her tanks having leaked, supplied her with €00 gallons. The Ethiopian, for Melbourne (since arrived), was the only vessel spoken connected with the colonies. The Jason is still under the comiuand;of Captain Birnic, who, although a young master, has already acquired a professional reputation for seamanship and kindness to his passengers second to none trading to this port. The Jason will follow the etrathnarer on the berth for London. The VriganUnc Escort arrived on Thureaay from Melbourne, is originally from Lataadoro, and brings on a portion of her original cargo. She ie a remarkably smart looking craft, and we believe will le offered for sale.

Abbivai. of the Soicuatb. — Tcsterday morning a telegraphic signal was liolstcd at the Observatory, on WlcKham- terrace, showing that the coloaial moil steamship Souchaye had returned from her experimental voyage to Batavia, evidencing thereby that the promise of her captain, on starting, had been kept. As a matter of course, the steamer, drawing too much, could not possibly come up to the wharf at Brisbane: but the anchored at the bar about 5.36 yesterday afternoon. We are indebted to the Undncee of Captain Blick far obtaining the following particulars Vilh reference to this ship :— The Soudkve left the anchorage Ss Mtveton Bay at a pan. on the 6ih January, and discharged pilot Cooler at 7 .40 off Moreton Island.

WHM.-K of tui. Borcabme.— On the 21st instant, while off Kent's Group, the Anglo-Saxon, from Sydney, was boarded by a boat from the lighthouse, with Captain Black and the crew of the schooner Boscarne, which was wrecked on Erith Island on Janu ary 20. The subjoined particulars of the loss of the Boscarne have been furauhed by Captain HlocK.late master of the onfor liinntc (schooner. The lioscame left HokiUka for this port on January 13, and had N. and K.W, winds to the 20th. On the morning of the 25th it came on to blow hard from tie S.W., and the schooner bore up for shelter to Kent's Group, and anchored In the West Cove. On the following morning the wind suddenly shifted to N.E., and blew very hard. At noon the gale mode rated, and the (schooner got under way, but an passing the West Point, )-hc was struck by a heavy squall, which headed her off. The anchor was let go, but -would not hold, and came home ugoin, and the schooner drove on shore. The kedge anchor was got out, and with some exertion tbe echooner was hauled afloat again, but the wind and sea kept increasing in violence, and the rope having Knapped, the went on shore once more, and became a complete wreck, the sea »'»Mpe a clean breach over her. On the following day, 27th, Captain Black and the crew were taken oft' by the lighthouse people, and remained until the 22nd itsUnt, when they were taken on board the Anglo-Saxon, bound from 63 dney to Melbourne, Captain Black speaks in grateful terms of the kindness shows to himself end crew by the people of the lighthouse, and alpo by Captain Homans, who brought them in bis vessel hirv.—Jrgut, February 25.
