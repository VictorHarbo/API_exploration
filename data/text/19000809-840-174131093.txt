We herewith beg to- state to all concerned that no, tho undersigned, alone have Power to Purchase Horses in Australasia for the IMPERIAL GERMAN GOVERNMENT, nnd that nobody but such Agents as may bo appointed by us for tho purpose of buying Horses have the right to not for us on behalf -of tho Imperial Germao Government. So for only tho following Agonts havo been appointed by us : — MESSRS. PITT. SON, & BADGERY, of Sydney, for New. Sontli Wales MESSRS. CAMPBELL & SON, of Mel bourne, for Victoria MR. A. J. COTTON, of Sowen, for Queensland, and their Authorised Sub-agents. AVo .are-forced to bring this matter undor tho-notico of horseowncrs, as we are informed that a false report-is current, that a special buying commission was to come out. AVo also hear of unauthorised agonts iput-ohasing horses -on tho pretext of buying : for the Imperial German Government. As thus owners do not. get tho full value for their horses, it is elearly to -their advantage to only deal with the nbovomentioned authorised agents. Tho total quantity of first- class sound Military Horses wanted is only 2,000 — not 9,000 as stated in tho papers— of whioh 500 huve already been shipped, or are ou the .point of being shipped.
