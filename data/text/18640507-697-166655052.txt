Captain Mnegrove, sailed from tbie port on 12th Novem ber, 2863, on & voyage to the Auckland lela&ds;, near Sew Zea land. She bad four months' provisions on board, but nothing has been heard of her eioce, cither by the owner or agents, Boyal Byjwey Yacht Squajdron,— The usnal monthly meet ing of the club was held on Thursday afternoon, at the club rooms, and although three of the yachts arc absent on & cruise to the northward, there was an exccllcct attendance. New members eligible for election were bnlloted for, and several other gentle men proposed for the next meeting', to be held in June. By telegram trom Grafton the manager of thoC. and R. R. S.N; Company has just received information of a heavy sea rolling in all along the coast. The Ur&ra; was unable to croas the bar, and ft was very Improbable the Gr&fton; would be able to leave the M&cie;&y;, Captain Gray, of the barque Isle o* May, informs as that while on tbe p&eeage; to London from this port, on 6th August last, and vhen about 100 miles north of the Cape of Good Hope, ho was boarded at 2 a.m, by an officer from the Confederate war steamer Alabama, The night was beautifully hue and tbe Islo o1 May was under full sail, Captain Gray being anxious to make up for time lost previously by the carrying aw ay of his topmastB, The first notice received of the Alabama's approach was the firing of a blank shot, The captain was below asleep, and on the steward reporting that a 6tc&mer; bad fired he replied, 11 Let him fire away,*' thinking that it was probably some vessel wishing to be reported, and be not being willing to lose time. Captain fiemmes was, however, not to be done ; almost immediately another shot w&b; ;fircd, and, like a dart, the Alabama dashed alongbide of tbe vetsel ao closely that the yard ends wore but a few feel apart. An immediate order followed to 11 back the main yard,' which was done, and the first lieutenant of the Alabama, with & boat's crew of ten men, all armed to the teeth, pulled aloegttide the vessel. The lieutenant examined the ship's papers, and questioned Captain Grey as to whether he had seen any American vceeels south of the Cape, to which question he received a negative answer ; be then left, and the Alabama steered to the southward. Captain Grey described her as a most beauti fully modelled vessel, and *' tremendously fast.'— Hobart Town JUercttry, April 28, NEWCASTLE.

The Act is for the most part a corsolidation of former Acts, but several important amendments have been made. One of the most mate rial of these is — that whereas by the present law the agreements for service can only be made at the shipping Office,— now tbey con be made on board ship without going to tbe Shipping Office. The alteration was made in consequence of complaints on the part of tbe captains that they loft so much time in taking their men to the Shipping Office and that on their way the men were met by crimps who persuaded them not to enter into agreements. We proceed to notice 6ome of the more important provisions of the new Act. In the first clanre the Act is styled the ' Seamen's Laws Con solidation Act of 1864.' The interpretation clause specifies two descriptions of 'ships— an '* intercolonial 6bip' being defined as a ship engaged in trading between any port in this colony and any other Australasian colony, including Tasmania and New Zealand ; and a ' foreign-trade ship' meaning a ship trading to any other part ofthe world. 'Hcfcrlion' is defined to be 'the absence of a seaman or apprentice from his ship without leave for a period of forty-eight houra without lawful cause or excuse, or any unlawful departure or absence from bis ehip with the iatention of not returning thereto.' Tbe Act is to be administered by the A5 iuister for Finance and Trade. 7 he Act is then divided into eeven parts. FartL authorises the appointment of 6hipping Masters, and the taking by them of fees for tbe duties tbey perform. Shipping Meetere are to be appointed at any port that the Governor may think fit ; and, by direction of the Minister, the Officer of Customs st any port where there is no Shipping Master, shall be deemed a Shipping Master. Fart 11. relates to Apprenticeship, and prescribes bow indentures are to be executed, attested, and recorded. FartllL which regulates the engagement of Seamen, contains some important alterations in the pre-existing law. It tret defines who znay be employed in engaging teamen; restricting tbem, in point of fact, to the ownets, the master, and the mate of the ship, and the bono fide servant of the owner. It is then made incumbent upon the masters of all ships except coasters of lea than eighty tons, to enter upon an agreement in the pre sexsbed form and manner; that manner being — that the seamen shall either be engaged at tbe Shipping Master's office, or on board tbe ship in which tbey engage to serve. In all casee one of the duplicates of the agreement, duly attested, is to be left with the 6hipping Master. In no case can any seaman be engaged unless he produces at tbe time of bis engagement, and delivers np bis discharge from his last ship, or a license to 6hip,— which discharge or license to ship is to be given to tbe Shipping Master, at d kept by him. No seaman is to be discharged from any ship without the master giving to the seaman, in the presence of the Shipping Master, a discharge, or sending such discharge to tbe Shipping Master, who is to give it to the seaman on hie application for it. Then followB a provision (eimilar to one in the Imperial Act) with regard to ships not belonging to tbe colony and that have agreements according to the laws of other plncee,— allowing the seamen to tigs such agreements, a copy being given to tbe Shipping Master. There is also a provision for tbe retewal of agreements without giving discbarges ia cases where seamen continue to serve in the same ship, upon a certificate of the renewal being sent to tbe Shipping Master. In csbcs where a seaman has lost bie discharge, or wants to become a teaman, there is a provision for his obtaining a license to ship. 'With regard to foreign-going ships, tbe masters are required to make reports on the character and conduct of their seamen during the vovage. Pert IV. relates to 'Wages and Discharges. It is required that in the case of intercolonial ships, wages are to be paid within two days after tbe termination of tbe agreement, or at the time of dis charge, whichever happens first ; and in all other cases wages arc to be paid within three days after the cargo is delivered, or at the time that the seaman is discharged, whichever happens first. There is a proviso attached — tbat this is not to apply to vessels employed in the whale fishery, where the seamen are paid by shares in the profits. Nest follow a series of pr ivisions with respect to taking charge of the effects of deceased seamen dying on tbe vovage and to the distribution of such effects; also provisions lor tbe recovery of the wagC6 of seamen lost throagh the lose of the ship, or when left behind on the ground of being nnoble to proceed on the voyage. Part V. relates to Protection, and contain? provisions for the punishment of masters leaving seamen behind, for expenses of medical attendance, and for penalties for overcharge and for solicitation by lodging- house keepers. Part VI. relates to Discipline, The provisions for punishment in cases of desertion or absence without leave differ considerably from the law of England, and also from the pre-existing law in this colony. Hitherto it has been discretionary with the magis trates to imprison, with or without bard labour, and to forfeit the wages; now there is only the alternative of doing the one or the other. The pre-existing law has also been altered in respect to putting a seaman on board his ship, instead of sending him to gaol, it being now provided that be shall not be sent on hoard unless he consents. Tbe sections of the old Act arc also omitted, enabling captains to apprehend deserters without warrants and to convey them on board, and also to get them out of gaol without their serving sentences. Part VII. consists ©f 'Miscellaneous Matters.' The Governor has power to moke regulations to carry the Act into effect, which are to have the force of law. Parlies' applying to the shipping office ate to be supplied with all the form* required. The wages or penalties, ordered to be paid by the master or owner, can be levied by distress on the skip. The whole Act extends to all sbips registered in the colonv, except pleasure vacbte, and excepting, so fares imperial legislation affects, such ships when they are out of the government or this colnny. With regard to pleasure yachts, the provision as to obtaining end giving dischargee is to apply, and nothing else. As to British ships registered in the United Kingdom, or any o:her British possesrions other than this colony, tbe whole Ac; operates, excepting so far as imperial legielation applies to them. No part of the Act applies to ships of war, British or foreign, Tbe first schedule specifies the Acts and parts of Acts that arc by this Act repealed. It repeals 4 William IV., No. 7, see. 44, under which seamen found in tbe streets without a pass, or out between nine o'clock and sunrise, ix,ay be apprehended. It next repeals tbe whnlc of 11 Victoria No. 'IS, which contained regulations as to who might act ia procuring seamen. It aleo repeals the whole oflS Victoria No. 28, known as the ' Merchant Seamen's Act ' It likewise repeals 17 Victoria No. 36, sections 3 to 14, 17 to 25, S7 und muchcf 29 as extends to or affects ships moored to any wharf, that section requiring that every ship in b&rbour; shall have a seaman on board at night as a watchman, which was found to be exceedingly oppressive with respect to ships tbat were moored to wharves, This latter Act, which was an amendment of the Water Police Act, and which es tablished a ey6tcm of lodging-houses for sailors, is hereby re pealed; as tbe consequence of which tbe 19 Victoria, No 8, which extended that code to Newcastle, is ateo repealed. The Act lastly repeals the 28 Victoria, No. 11, which introduced a provision for enabling aailors to serve io any two or more vessels belonging to the same owner. This is repealed, but is re-enuotcd in the body of the Act. . „ , , Tbe eecond schedule prescribes the form of declaration to be made by the Shipping Master. The third schedule states tbe fees to bo paid to the Shipping MaBtcrforthe engagement and discbarge of scameu. Those for the engagement and discharge of seamen are regulated according to the tonnage of the ships ; the fee for the engagement or dis charge of 6fiamcn, separately, Is two shillings. Io each ca^e the sum of sixpence is to be deducted from the seamen's wages by way ef partial repayment of the above fees. The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth schedules contain respectively, the forme— tbe agreement by crews te serve on board ships— a seaman's allotment note— of a certificate of dis charge — of a mutual release when tb^ seaman is discharged in the presence of a Shipping Master— and of a master's report of the conduct, character, ana qualifications of his seaman, VESSELS IN HARBOUR.

The place jrom which any vessel may arrive is signalled as soon as it can be ascertained, and before she enters tbe port ; aod tbe entrance of tbe vc&eel; into port is denoted by tbe hauling down of the ball at the yard arm, and her anchoring by the lowering of the whole of the flags. An emigrant ship is denoted by the numeral pendant hoisted above the pilot's report. When ttoops ore on board any vessel amving, tho numeral pendant is hoisted without the pilot's report. When a vessel returns to port, the white numeral flag is hoisted alone, under the descriptive flag. When the mail sicamer arrives at Adelaide, the P. and O. Com pany's flag is hoisted at the semaphore-mast head, and kept flying one hour : when she arrives at Melbourne, the same flag with a ball under it is kept flying the same time. At any lime on the arrival of the Governor, the UniOb Jock is boieted at tbe Ecmaphorc-maet head alone, aud the numbers on the usual place. Note.— The numbers on the flags may easily be known from their being compored of as many stripes, or stars, as they are In tended to represent. When any number higher than nine is to ba represented, one flag is hoisted over the other, as 8 over 4 is St, from China; the substitute flag being used as a duplicate— for in stance, No. 8 over the substitute flag would be 33, from Calcutta. Notice is also given, that paragraphs 2,3, and 4 of the 51st clause of the Port Jackson Harbour Regulations have been ex Sunged, being ut variance with the regulations of tho Steam avigfltion Board. Cautiok to Coaetebs.— In consequence of the negligence die played in many instances bv coasting vessels with reference to carrying side lights, the authorities have determined io futare to enforce the full penalty of £20 in all cases where vessels neglect to show tbe usual lights during the night in conformity with the existing regulations. Not fok Eveb ? During a marriage ceremony the bride wu sobbing immoderately while the knot was being tied. ' What ia the matter, my young woman }' ' asked the official. ' Oh, sir !' replied the bride, 'it's because its for ever.' 'No, no,' rejoined the parson, ' that's a mistake— a great mistake ; it's not for ever : Death puts an end to the engagement.' On bearing this, tbe bride dried her tears, and was con Spied. ®a?ctte ARRIVALS. April 99. Aim SiMderwm, brif , 9M tons, Captain Doble, from AdrtaMe nth iDitiiit Willi*, M(hy( tnd Co , igenu.

I From the lleral J'» Newcastle Correspondent ) TOTAL WRECK OF THE GRECIAN, AND LOSS OF ONF. On the 99ih ultimo Intelligence wee received that the htlg Grecian, of Uobart Town, aud last from Sydney, was a total wreck on the Nine Mile Reach, which lies between Red llcadand Lake Marquartc. 2'he first mate aud pari oft be crew walked iutotovc, ' a -U»ienre of between six and seven miles It appears the Grecian, brig, Ifrflfcjdnty, on v0tb,sboui one o'clock, boundlfor this port in ballsst Captain Grant stood well out to sea, and afterwards tacktd aud ran in towards the laod, the weather being very thick, and bloaiig a terrific galf, with heavy sea. About three o'clock , ou eatutday morning the mate fancied be heard an unusual sound, and gave order* to wear the vessel, but before the order c mid be I xi cuicd she struck, and the nrxtsca drove her well on the sandy beset. The crew and two female passengers —one tbe captain's nil ce and the other the wife of one of the women - managed to get eafrly on thorc Captain Grant greatly exerted himself in stvlng the lives o! the females, and bad blmarU got on shore all right, althrugb much fHtlgued. He spoke to bis sou* observing to him the femaha were all tsfc ; at tbu moment the boom of the vessel i struck Ca pain Grant, throning him Into the earf; be was never II cn again. The females had on merely their night- dresses The niece was with difficulty restrained from going into the sea after her uncle. It was a fearful morning. When daylight came, Ibty proceeded, barefooted, through the bush some little dist ance until tbeycame to Uarpur's* where it la needless to say every atuntion was pild to their wants as far as lay In the power of the I- matte The piece of Captain Grant, 1 regret to say, has eufered severely from the shock. She had several fits while staying at liarpur'e. They were brought into town ©a the 1st instant, under the charge of Mr. Boyce, who bad procured clothing for tbem and the ere w, atd had sent out a conveyance to bring them into town. The wants or I he crew were attended to by Captain Allen, bar bouT-marier, and Mr. BcotY, P M. The shipwrecked mariners' fund is kept In s boa in the barbonr-master'e office, but one day last week tome villainous thief broke open the box, extracted the eouUDia, and threw the box under some trees near the statioa tnaaui's house* Although the crew and females got onshore safely, it was not without getting considerably knocked about and oruiff d ; the mate and one of the females received some hurts, Tt«s all hud a most Providential escape from a watery grave. On Monday morning, the mounted troopers went to the scene of the wrt ck of tbo Grecian. The vessel bad entirely broken up, the dtbiis being strewed along the beach for some considerable distance. No trace of the booy of Captain Grant oould bo seen. 1 Wc arc liiforn.cd that the Grecian was owned partly by her ctmmaidcr (Captain Grant), and Messrs, Young and Evans, of HobattTown.) FOUNDERING OF THE BARQUE PRINCE ARTHUR. ONE HUNDRED MILE* FRO* LtND. It 1b somewhat remarkable that while one shipwrecked crew was recrivltig the hospitality of Mr Harpur, another so soon should seek shelter undtr the esme roof— all within a few hours. Yes; this somewhat romantic and isolated dwelling, standing on a ridge overlooking the vast Pacific Ocean, became the temporary abode of two shipwrecked cr»ws; for, scarcely had a portion of the crew of the ill-fated Grecian made themselves comfortable for the night, when the captain and chief officer of the equally ill fated barque Prince Arthur ai«o demanded shelter from the piti lees storm which was still riglng with unabated fury. With regard to the loss or this vessel it appears she left thin port on the 21st ultimo with a cargo of 700 tons coal, boand for Duncdin, N,/. bbortly after leaving the vessel began to leakia the after part of the ship, which gradually increased, and Captain Welch, finding the water continued to gain rapidly, and being some 8-J0 miles ofl the land, deemed it prudent t-o endeavour to return to pott. The vessel was put about; the crew manfully working at the pumps for 10J hours, without intermiasiou, until itey became exhausted; the water gained so rapidly that It was found expedient to get the longboat ready to leave tbt ship. With a bag of bread and eeven small casks of water, tke captain (who was the last to leave the vessel) and crew left the vessel on the 29th ultimo, at whioh time upwards of five feet of water were in her hold. Within twenty minutea after, when the boat was abont a hundred yards off, the unfortunate Prince Arthur* borque, went down stern flrst, some 10b miles Horn land, a 8.E. gate was blowing, accompanied by bt-Bvy rain end a terrific sea. It was only by the greatest care the boat 01 nld be managed to live in such a sea, Early on the morningofSOth tbeycame up with a ecbooner, in ballast, bound for this port. They signalled with a light* which was answered ; the schooner, however, wore round* and they saw no more of her. 1 bey afterwards spoke the schooner fitar of Peace, which was lying-to, the master being under the impression be was off Nobova. Captain Welch* seeing it would be dangerous to attempt to toard the schooner, in consequence of the high sea running, and believing they were near this port, determined to wait lor daylight and rut. in: when daylight came they found tbimtclvts off Bird Island; they then made for Lake Macquaric, following the track of a ketch which had previously entered, but In crossing the bar the boat wenttoo much to leeward, a heavy sea struck her throwing out the whole of the crew ; fortunately the boat belonging to tbe ketch immediately put off and rendered assistance in getting the poor fellows into their own boat again; the master of the ketch hid previously warned th- tn to make (sat everything in tbe boat which they fortunately did, or they would have list their all. The captain saved bis chronometer, watch, and a few charta* aud tbe crew their clothes. Both the captain and crew speak in tbe highest terms of the kindness and hosptality they received from the inhabitants of the Lake, aud aleo at Harper's. [The Prince Arthur was of 420 tons register, and for some time had been in the Melbourne trade, usually carrying abont 690 tons coal, bat on ber last unfortunate voyage bad 700 tone on board, Bbe was North American built, and after receiving coDBidcrebicrepairs in Melbourne only a short timeElnce, £1800 was refused for her by hcr^owners. Tbe vessel and freight is infiored in fimytbe's fiydneyJMarinc Office for £1800* and tbe cargo in tbe Pacific Office for £350.] The Jamee Pater son (e), left Rockhampton on Wednesday, 37lb, and Gladstone 28th ultimo* arriving here at ll mm., on find.

The Elleemere* barque, sailed from this port for San Francisco on the 27lb ultimo. She had moderate weather until the 30th ultima. When she was about ninety miles to the eastward of tbe port a heavy gale then eet in from the E S*E. ; the vessel made bad weather of it, aud parted ber pott main rigging near the masthead. The heavy eeas breaking on board smashed oae of her boats stowed on deck. Some of her stanchions aad bulwarks were carried away, and the covering board split, when, to increase ber disasters, she commenced leaking badly : under these circum stances Captain Gahan bad no alternative out to bear up for tbo pott again, arriving on 30th nlu Tbe ship is evidently overloaded* and adds another to the already numerous lists of casualties and total losses attributable to this cause* From tho reck less manner in which vessels are daily being overloaded, especially in tbe coal trade, it is only surprising that they can live at all in tbe heavy weather constantly met with on this coast, and It is to be regretted that some stringent regulation is not enforced to prevent, as far as possible, tbe sacrifice of human life and loss of valuable property.

At noon tbe gale and sea still increasing the anchor and cables were got amidships. Wind now veered to IL and E. by N. ; got ber on the port tack, but it was certain that, with the leeway the was making, she could not weather Cape li&wke; on the one or Crowdy Head on the other tack (though neither, visible from the rain and haze), and tbe heavy water shipped deadening what headway she oould get, 2 p.m., knocked the forccabin bulkhead down, and got up some of tbe cargo and threw it over board ; this greatly relieved ber, and she got more headway, and at 4.30 she just weathered Seal Rock Point. 9 p.m., eea and gale still increasing.

Masz*x Insurance '8upb '—The chambers of commerce have made a move in an effort to legalise the 'slips' given on taxing out policies of insurance. Tbe initiation of tbls agitation for an amendment of the lew and practice seems to bave origi nated w ith Mr. Greig, of Lloyd's Whether Mr. Greig's propo sition ol making tbe insurance slips legally binding on the oon tt&ctit-g; partita by affixing a penny aump upon tbem could be csiritd out under the present system is open to doubt. Mr. Greig contemplates making these slips a legal contraot for all insuience puiposes, until tbe policy is filled in and duly stamped, Tbat this impost would not be felt by insurers is quito certain ; but we have yet to learn what the underwriters generally and the insurance companies have to say to this new regulation. Tbe Chancellor ot tbe Exchequer may contend tbat the legalisation given to these slips would defeat the raising of revenue on stamped policies. To meet this objection 01 tbe evasion of tbe law* it is suggested that eeven days after the underwriting of any slip might be fixed as tbe limit to its being legally binding, do far, perhaps, this would meet tho case; but as regards short vojsgeB by steamers, there would be no necessity to have a full stamped policy, unless in the eveut of a casualty. Tbe steamers to PpalD* France, Btlpium, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Nor way, and fcwedto* make their passages in from a few boara to four days, aud as Ibtie is telegraphic commonio&iion; between England and all the continental ports, it would net be iudfapen rabJe, in« Jsrgcnumbcrof transactions, to go totbe expense ofa second stamp duty. These factB would probably be urged against acbsngelntbe direction here indicated, though there is little force in tbem, for no respectable underwriter, or public company, would countenance any fraud in the revenue of this character. As & matter of course^ the policies would be filled up and stamped irrespective of tho shortness of the voyage and the inutility of a second impressed document Before any such simple and effective plan can be recommended for adoption by Parliament, the Chancellor of Ihe Exchequer wonld have to take the opinion of the leading uncerwritera on tbe question. It must be remembered that when the particulars are given for filling up the slips, and when it may be said the contract morally commences, in a majority of cases the premiums are not paid, therefore the underwriters may demur to giving a legal instrument till the policy is financially completed These slips are not now repudiated if a lose takes place between their issue and tbe proper transference to a duly stamped policy ; it is open to an underwriter to refuse payment of & claim, and there is no remedy for such breach of faith, in a su perior court In a discussion of this character we must look to the two titiea of tbe question, for if the merchant and shipowner re quire protection the some must be conceded to the under writers, whose business is conducted very largely on & system of credit, and who have to deal with wealthy and long- standing firms, and likewise with leas wealthy brokers or agents, who may receive and not pay premiums, though the latter are exceptions to the rule ; and even in their behalf excuses may be made, for they, in their turn* have their losses. The whole system requires reformation. Is it not practicable to fill in a policy at euce, and to make one transaction of the whole affair, If these antique wages of a century were swept away! The practice has become un eutiedto these days of steam and rapid Locomotion; and were less officialism thrust iuto these maritime operations, stamped policy-forms ought to he as easily procurable as postage-stamps, or svamped billsof lading ; and we oannot see any forcible reason why the entire business should not be carried out instauteroR payment of the premium,— MitchelPe Bteam'Shipping Journal, February 13.
