OVERSEA MIGRATION Movements During August Gain to Population Statistics ol' Australian oversea migration tor August last have been made available by tho Acting Common- wealth Statistician (Professor L. F. Gib- lin). The arrivals during thc month (.1,100 persons) exceeded the recorded depar- tures (2,305 persons) by 855. During August, 1931, the arrivals ? (2,570 per- sons) exceeded thc recorded departures (2,422 persons) by only'151. The result for the eight months ended August 31 ¡last tun excess of 4,754 departures) shows a decided improvement over the ' result for the corresponding period of 1931, when the excess of recorded depar- tures was 10,049. The Improvement was due to u decrease of 10 per cent, in the recorded departures, the arrivals for the period being almost identical with those tor 1931. About half ot Australian migration ls with New Zealand and the Pacific is- lands, about one-third with Europe, and most ot tito remainder with the East. Arrivals during August from New Zea- land were 990 and departures to New Zealand 043, while arrivals from Great Britain were 669 anti departures 648. For the lirst eight months o£ 1932 arri- vals from New Zealand and the Pacllic islands totalled 14,555 and departures 10,828, while arrivals from Great Britain and Eurolie were 6,140 and departures 14,251. Arrivals from the East were 4,284 and departures 3.7S4. During August last SSS immigrants intended to reside permanently In Aus- tralia, and 723 Australian residents de- parted permanently, showing a perman- ent gain to the population of 105 per- sons. During August, 1931, only 035 Immigrants Intended lo reside perman- ently, while 992 Australian residents departed permanently, showing a per- manent loss of 357 persons. For the eight months ended August 31 last the number of Australian residents depart- ing permanently (10,810 persons) exceed- ed the number of Immigrants Intending to reside permanently in Australia (6,120 persons) by 4,084, which is less thun halt thc loss shown tor Hie corresponding period of 1931, viz., 10,160. During the eight months 8,212 Australian residents departed temporarily, compared with 10,118 and 7,290 during the correspond- ing periods ot 1930 and 1931. Although tho 1932 figure, ls considerably below normal, it shows some revival of travel abroad over 1931. During the eight months ended August 31 last 12,709 tem- porary visitors arrived in Australia, compared willi 13,100 and II.6S9 during tho similar periods nf 1930 and 1931. again showing some recovery of normal travel.
