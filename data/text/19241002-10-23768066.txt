inhabitants were thr'ung and progressive The condition of Ccvlou was a contrast to the very backward state of the main land of India Tho educational sy stem was equal to that of any white country m the woild, and a great number of what he might call the permanent population were hereditary students of Oxford and Cimbndgo universities On the lowlands were the rico fields and palm groves, above them the cocoa and spice planta lions, higher up the lubbci zone, aud above that again the tea gardens com menced The high peaks, rose to 7 000 feet, and were the most valuable sanatoria m the tropics

present time Apart from the peron mai turbulence of countries like Afghanis tun, Pel bia, and North Afnci, the recent outbreaks in Madris and in outwardly peaceable Jan, traced to direct instiga tion by Hadjis from Mecca, which was becoming a hot bed of Bolshevik propa gindi, showed the continued menace of anti Christian hate and jealousy which I only aw aited the signal from some Mahdi 1 or Messiah to set two continents aflame Nor had the recent policy of France in triining the most warlike and fanatical African tubes to meet m arms the vi lute men on their own ground diminished the menace, whilst the action of Turkey in thioiymg open to ambitious rulers the succession to "the Caliphate might easily provide the match to fire the magazine In view of these contingencies, the indus
