That when in my seventieth year someone sent me 1-aville's little translated treatise on the subject, I instantly perceived that he understood the subject, I took his medicines, which are simple and easy of application. I was cured completely, and utter nine years' trial I can affirm that they are a perfect specific aud an Innocent and beneficial remedy.
