THE LAND AND THE PRODUCER. ADELAIDE WOOL SALES. THEIR INCREASING POPULARITY. When auction sales of wool were in- t suggested in Adelaide some years ago even the most sanguine broker did not clearly foresee the extent of the popularity, both with buyer and seller, that they would en- joy. In the 1903-4 season, for instance, when 58\. 83 bales constituted the aggregate said, they- did not dream that the sales of one firm alone would within eight years exceed that quantity by nearly 1,000 bales. Yet this is what has happened for this season. Messrs. Elder, Smith, & Co. have disposed of 76.043 bales out of a total of 83.5175 bales offered by them. After a sale there is always a certain amount of passed wool taken by buyers, so that the figures published previously have undergone modifications. The official figures supplied by the Wool brokers' Association show that records have been broken all along the line. Most brokers have broken their own records, and the aggregate of scales reaches the high-water mark. Every year of late has established new figures, and nothing more complimentary to the Adelaide mar- ' ket and its brokers can be found than the steady advancement recorded. From 85,496 | bales in 1905-6 the aggregate steadily increased year by year, until in 1909-10 it reached the respectable total of 138,757 bales. This year again eclipses that meritorious achievement, as the wool sold amounted to 143,174 bales. Brokers' Operations.

Elder, Smith, & Co. during the past six years, are appended, and they are valuable inasmuch as they afford an opportunity of showing that the season just ended, despite the uncertain movements, has been quite up to the average for profitable returns, particularly for greasy wool.

A _ table is appended which shows the destination of the wool sold in Adelaide during the past three years. It will be seen that the United Kingdom takes nearly one half, and France over one quarter. "Considering the amount of dirt and grease in wool-the average clip will not give more than 41 or 42 per cent, of clean wool-one might naturally ask, "Why pay freight on this waste? Why not have it scoured and save freight and provide work?" Another even greater question arises. Why, in a progressive country like Australia, where the annual wool clip is 700,000,000 lb., should only U per cent, be manufactured? Other countries buy Australian wool and send it back as finished woollen goods, so that for this year imports of "apparel" exceed £13,000.000 in value. Surely the time is coming when Australian manufacturers will supply their fellow Australians with all the blankets and woollen goods they require, even if they do not bid for markets farther afield. The woollen trade in English and Continental centres has been booming, and while this is satisfactory to the primary producer, he would not suffer if Australia became a potent force as a manufacturer. This change would necessarily mean greater industrial, activity and would set up a flow of immigration, helpful to future settlement. As far as South Australia is concerned, the woollen manufacturing industry, although established, is only in its infancy, for of the total of over 143 000 bales sold during the season, only 14.427 bales were divided among local and inter-State scourers and manufacturers and speculators.

A good deal has been said in the past, about the value of the English market for Australian eggs, but a profitable export trade has not been established. It has yet to be demonstrated that regular supplies can be successfully consigned to the old country. It is interesting, however, to note that during last year there were increased shipments into the United Kingdom from other countries, the total for the first eleven months amounting to 16,821^)10 great hundreds, against 16,00 195 great hundreds in the same period of 1909, and 16,652,510 great hundreds in 1908. Deal- ing with the British egg trade, the "Lon- don Grocer," of December, makes some interesting statements, which throw light upon the way in which operations are conducted. After pointing out that the feature of last year was the great increase in imports from Russia, which in eleven months sent 531, 452 great hundreds in contrast with 6,701,861 great hundreds two years ago, they say: Denmark and Aus- tria-Hungary have increased their exports, but most other countries represent a deficiency. On the whole, prices have been, more favorable to consumers this year, but the uniform dearness of bacon is held in some degree to have interfered with the sale of eggs. There have been large quantities of eggs to deal with, but owing to the dearness of most provisions which have yielded little or no profit to retailers, the latter have been less disposed to reduce their prices of eggs, consequently the demand to importers has been frequently disappointing. In the producing countries prices are maintained at the high level reached within late years, and for this state of affairs importers have themselves mostly to blame as he bidding freely against one another to secure goods for this market the force up rates to a pitch which leaves little profit on this side when the goods are sold There is too much speculation in the import trade or business to be on a satisfactory footing depart from the question of speculation, it is very unfortunate that prices are rushed too high by over anxious people This was the case with Kunian corn eggs this year there was too much anxiety to secure fresh goods which might be held back with the expectation of making higher prices These have not been maintained, and nearly every speculator in Russian goods has worked very hard for nothing. It is reported that in Russia stored eggs have lost heavily through some having to be replaced and a large amount of waste has been thrown away, making the business unremunerative There are only small stocks at Riga-about 30,000 cascades very much smaller quantity than at this time last year These goods are being held back for higher prices, but according to quality can scarcely go into the high class trade to show a good profit In August and September, there were numerous complaints of faulty parcels of Danish, which had been bought by speculators, being placed on the market, and while it proved a paying game to the sellers, the eggs gave much dissatisfaction to buyers It behoves buyers to be careful on a rising market as then kept goods are unloaded " EGGS FOR EXPORT To the Editor Sir I see that eggs are now quoted at 63d. per dozen in Adelaide. Here we are paying over 20 a dozen for new laid eggs, and all others proportionately dear. Be fore I left South. Australia Major Norton, the Trade Commissioner, was lecturing on starting egg circles, and showing the necessity of co-operating and exporting the surplus, so as to regulate prices. Of course, the opponents of co-operation ridiculed the idea, and tried to prove that over-sea ex- porting was unnecessary. Can they now explain why eggs should be so cheap in Adelaide when they are worth so much here? It is a pity the producers did not continue to act on Major Norton's advice. He proved conclusively that South Australian eggs could be put on the London market, and the prices in Australia regulated in that way. It would be interesting to know what has been lost to the producers I by giving up the egg circles, and not export- ing a portion of the eggs year by year. As a co-operator, I have a great belief in the producers co-operating, and welcomed Major Norton's visit to South Australia, and the interesting lectures he gave in the country districts. In my opinion it will be a great loss to the farmers if they give up the egg circle system and do not export their surplus eggs each year. It requires to be done regularly that consumers here may know they can procure a supply at that sea son. There is no country in the world which can produce all kirks of produce as cheaply as we can in Australia, and in England there is a regular market, where we can depend on getting fair prices am, c, CLEMENT GILES. 15, Leadenhall-street, London, E.C. FRUITGROWERS' ASSOCIATION. A meeting of fruitgrowers and market gardeners resident in Payneham and Mar- den was held in the institute on Friday evening to form a local branch of the Market Gardeners' and Fruitgrowers' Assoc a tion. There were about 30 present. Mr. Donaldson (president of the Athelstone and Campbelltown branch) occupied the chair. Mr. H. E. Pitt (secretary to the central body) explained the objects of the association and its rules. Mr. A. E. Pitt, one of the delegates to the conference of fruitgrowers lately held at Hobart, gave a resume of the business transacted, and described the benefits that would accrue to the fruitgrowers by forming themselves into an association. He moved That a local branch of the Market Gardeners' and Fruitgrowers' Association be formed at Payneham." This was seconded by Mr. F. T. Pitt and carried unanimously. Mr. C. T. Fisher was appointed president and delegate to the central association, Mr. B. Golding vice-president, and Mr. E. G. Gwynne secretary and treasurer. The following were elected committeemen : Messrs. C. Johns, F. G. Levi, F. T. Pitt, R. Taylor, and H. Wicks. All those present joined the branch. CROPS AT HORSHAM. HORSHAM, January 14. Harvesting throughout the Wimmera is being pushed j on, and the results are exceeding the most ; sanguine anticipations. At Jerouk, Messrs. Wright Bros, are stripping from 18 to 24 bushels to the acre, and Mr. G. E. Kendall, | of Carrie, 14 bags to the acre. On the ? Yarriem.bea.ch Creek, Mr. E. Nuske is harvesting 14 bags, and Mrs. Star prick from "10 to 13 bags wheat, whilst Mr. F. Adler expects a j yield of 15 bags. Near Wfllanea, Messrs. Geddes Bros, have an area of 2,000 acres cut I tivated. UfUf has yielded eight bags of j Federation wheat. The remaining half will j average about 10 bags. Mr. F. Jende, of Beulok, expects 7,000 bags, and Mr. G. I Erhardt 3,00.0 bags. The crops around ; Sea Lake are the best ever grown in the I mallee there, and it is estimated that 200,000 bags will be delivered at the Sea | Lake station this year. Around Lake Buloke an average of 8 bags is being obtained, Yandilla King is giving good returns, the sample being a good one. Fede ! ration has not yielded so well as last year. MEDALS FOR POULTRY. NHILL, January 16 The Rainbow Agricultural Society have received six gold medals donated by the Department of Agriculture for poultry exhibited at their late annual show. The winners are: Mrs. L. Flicker. Buangor (pair of birds for export Mr. Snell, Hopetoun (ducks); Mr. G. H Bartlett, Gerang (Orpington) and Mr. R. Kiefel, Natimuk (Leghorn, Dork- ing, and Wyandotte). LONG DROVING TRIP. Charleville, January 10. The mob of over. 2,600 Lissadell and Argyle cattle have arrived here from Western Australia in charge of the drovers, Messrs. Williams Brothers. The cattle look leg-weary, as they have travelled nearly 2,000 miles. The drovers have had a long and unpleasant trip. They had a great deal of fever in the camps, and one poor young fellow, Thomas Stafford, a Charleville native, died of the fever on the borders of Western Australia and the Territory. The drovers are quite , satisfied that the risk taken, when con i pared with the cash made out of the trip, j constitutes this a journey they will not I ' again undertake. The cattle are the pro- perty of Mr. Durrnclc and executors of the late Mr. Lamley Hill. They are to be auctioned at Charleville. FOXES AT WAROOKA. WAROOKA, January 16. Foxes are numerous. In the surrounding swamps five grown foxes have been captured in one day. Last week a party of four men secured two brushes in a couple of hours. Two have been caught on Mr. A. F. Murdoch's farm, one being in the wire-netted poultry enclosure. Poultry have been disappcaringrapidly and farmers fear, trouble in the lambing season. Stripping is completed, and carting is in full swing. Mr. n.;Kocnnecke lost a valuable milch cow by dry bible last week. FOXES AND POULTRY. CLARENDON". January 11. Some time ago farmers were worried by foxes. The residents made a determined effort to ex- terminate the animals, and a number were killed. Last week they again wrought havoc in poultry yards. On Thursday night Mr. M. Kenny lost one fowl and 10 eggs, which the fox had sucked. On Saturday night reynard entered Mr. D. Mitchell's ' yard and carried off 10 valuable young 1 fowls and nine ducks, and left three other ducks dead in the yard. The foxes do not seem to destroy the rabbits, as they, too, are increasing in number. During the holi 1 days many visitors from Adelaide have I been shooting in the hills, but they have I frightened the rabbits more than hurt them. AGRICULTURAL BUREAU CONFERENCE. Narracoorte, January 10. At a meeting of the Narracoorte branch of the Agricultural Bureau on Saturday, it was decided to hold the annual conference of South-Eastern branches of the bureau at Narracoorte on March 29. Government experts and members of the Advisory Board will be invited to be present. All the South-Eastern branches will be asked to send delegates and exhibits. A committee was appointed to carry out the arrangements. TUMBY BAY HARVEST. j TUMBY BAY, January 14. Most farmers will finish harvesting next week The yield is up to expectations. Wheat is coming in freely, the average daily delivery being about 2,000 bags. The price has fallen to 3/5, and all buyers are on this level A large proportion is being stored, there being a general impression that 4/ per bushel will be got for it. A quantity was sold before the holidays for forward delivery at 3/8. The quality is good, but the Federation variety is weighing lighter every year. The wheat coming in weighs under three bushels per bag. Growers who will deliver over a thousand bags each in fade Messrs. N. J. A. and N. J. Lawrie, Joseph Nankivell, Joseph Provis, Charles Darling, Nankivell Bros.. E. J. Barrand. Hudson Bros, Blacker Bros., H. Brougham, J. and G. Darling, J. Gibbons, C. B. Koennecke, C. Hilton, S. Scott, and A. B. Wishart. These growers are reaping 12 to 30 bushels per acre. MURRAY BRIDGE SHOW. MURRAY BRIDGE, January 15-The show committee met at the Bridgeport Hotel last evening. The president (the Hon. J. Cowan, M.L.C.) occupied the chair, and there was a large attendance. It was decided to hold the show on Thursday, March 23. The secretary of the flower show in October (Mr. T. H. Provis) reported that the income had been £27 and the expenditure £34. The debit was reduced to £1 by assets worth £5. Sec- tional committees were appointed. The officers of the society and one member from each of the five committees constitute the council. The chairman said additional sheep and cattle pens must be erected, and tenders for 10 additional cattle pens and 43 hurdles are to be called. A section fours event was added, for which Mr. J. A. Jaensch gave £4 47 and Mr. J. G. Jaensch £2 2/. The secretary said he had received a trophy valued at £10 10/ for horses in action. KINGSCOTE, January 16. Mr. C. J. May brought into the township on Saturday six onions which measured over 6 in. across and 20 in. around. Several other growers report heavy yields of onions, but the long cartage over bad roads make it impossible to grow larger acreages. Mr. R. Snelling cut a splendid oat crop for hay. It was over 6 ft. 6 in. high, and yielded over 3 tons to the acre. CLARENDON, January 11. The fruit picking is in full swing. The gardeners are rushing in their apricots, which are in great demand owing to large orders from Melbourne. Crops are not up to the usual standard, as the old trees are very scantily laden. Potato digging is almost suspended because the wholesale houses in the city are too full to buy. This will entail serious loss on the farmers if it continues long, as the potatoes are quite ready. APPILA YARROWIE, January 16. Harvest operations are almost completed. Most farmers have finished stripping, but others have a considerable quantity to do. The weather has been a great hindrance Some heavy crops are reported 25 to 30 bushels being reaped, ye not the average for the farm has been 13 bushels Wheat carting is in full swing GREENOCK, January 13 Harvesting operations are nearly over, and the farmer is able to come into the township again The results are not as good as anticipated, and farmers are able to dispose of empty cornsacks In one case a farmer, who expected to fill 250 bags, has 100 empty ones for sale The reason is the take-all " An average of 16 in of rain per annum is all that is required to make farming successful in this district. The fruit season is in full swing Apricots are scarce, but last year they v yielded a crop equal to two years' picking Apples will be good, and the codlin moth is not noticeable
