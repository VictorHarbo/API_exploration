Australia 'Ghases' Migrants MELBOURNE, Mar. 12. The permanent head of the Department of Immigration (Mr. T/ H. E. Heyes) will leave tomor row to visit main Euroowm countries from which Aus tralia is drawing migrants. Announcing this today, the Minister for Immigra tion '(Mr. Holt) said fhe visit was made neces sary by the changing condi tions in overseas countries which created new prob lems in the recruiting of mi grants. The unsettled condi tions of the immediate post-war years hi Europe had* now largely dis appeared, and the fear of war was receding, he said. These factors, together with the general improve ment in economic conditions in Europe had removed some of the earlier strong incentives for ' emigration. COMPETITION At addition, Australia now faced keen competition from Canada and the USA in the recruiting of mi grants. It was necessary, there fore, to keep immigration procedures' under constant review hi order that the best results might be ob tained for Australia.
