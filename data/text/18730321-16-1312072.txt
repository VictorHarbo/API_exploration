FOR EUROPE. SOCIAL. QoEEh6LA>D is to have a monthly mail all to herself We are notified of the foot by telegraph. Through the agency of Mr Daintree, the Government have accepted the tenders of Messrs, Mactaggart, Tidman, and Co , of London, to bring a monthly mail from Java, via Torres Straits The amount of the tender is variously stated at £20,000 and £25,000 per annum, and although almost without confidence in the route, either for expedition or for opening up trade, we are willing to hope that the larger sum will not be wasted in running a steamer monthly for one year The scheme is an old and favorite one with many sensible people and although the former attempt to establish the line was disagreeably like a failure, there are features in connection with the present arrangement which may bring about a different result The principal of these is the establish men of more regular and satisfactory communication between the Northern ports and the capital. Twelve months should prove whether the line can work an improvement in that respect, and meantime the best manner of profiting from the service of the mail steamers should be embraced by the ports concerned, for the success of the line must depend to a very great extent upon their exertions There will also be opportunities for getting varieties of plants and seeds from Java, Singapore, Ac, suitable to this climate Our American exchanges, per Californian mail are filled with the lamentations of the American people over the sudden death of Horace Greeley It does our cousins credit that, just at the conclusion of a bitter political contest they as one man join in the great national grief for the loss of one who was in the front of the contest, and whose honesty of purpose was his only recommendation It is questionable whether any American has been so universally regretted as Mr Greeley and it is not in America only that his vigorous but ever kindly words will be missed, nor even, as Henry Ward Beecher said at the funeral ceremony, " over two continents " Sir Greeley has many admirers in Australia, who looked upon him as one of the few who did the right whate'er betide Twelve months ago it was generally understood that Parliamentary government in this colony depended upon the will of the "Ipswich phalanx,' which comprised six of the thirty two members of the Legislative Assembly Latterly there has been a division in the camp Since the completion of the railway to Brisbane has been determined upon, the members for Ipswich and West Moreton no longer sink their independent convictions in a " Bunch" policy As regards the local Press, the Queensland Times, which has hitherto consistently sup ported the party in power for the time being, is by no means vigorous in support of the present Ministry The other paper, the Ipswich Observer, is quite and Ministerial in its tone On March 11 it stated : " We have been lately told by a certain journal that whatever may be the faults of the present Government it is the most honest we have yet had We are not quite sure as to the meaning of the word honest if this statement be correct We have heard of dishonest and honest Governments, certainly, but to say that the present is an honest one is a piece of irony too strong even for its friends to swallow The Government that could turn round upon its supporters in the Legislative Assembly when charged with having abandoned every principle On which they know ci Force office who could laugh at their own supporters while they sold them by adopting the policy of their opponents must be an honest Government indeed The Minister who could at one time propose to tear up the Warwick Railway as a swindle, and could some time afterwards preside at a banquet to celebrate the opening of the same line, must form a pleasant ingredient in an honest Ministry A Minister whose control over his department permitted of deeds of grant being issued without his knowledge, and the lands included in which he swears were obtained by fraud, must form an excellent guarantee to the public for the possession and existence of an honest Ministry At any rate, the experience we have already had of this honest Ministry must make us somewhat chary with regard to their future progress A Government that has no policy excepting that of sticking to office is a dangerous one for the colony, and we mistake very much the feeling of the country if it mil much longer submit to be befooled by our present Ministers " It must be very gratifying to those gentlemen who for years past have taken an active interest in the progress of the A cell matisation Society to find that at length their exertions are meeting with that appreciation which they so well deserve That such is the case is clearly shown by the continuous increase of members from all parts of the colony, and the general interest which is now mum fested in the proceedings of the society Apart from the primary objects of the society, which consist in the acclimatisation and distribution of trees and plants obtained from almost all parts of the world, the improvements recently made and still in progress at Bowen Park are of such a character as to render it more attractive than over to the general public, and to those who have even a slight knowledge of botany the place is full of interest The op pearance of the grounds, the healthy and vigorous condition of the plants, and the great success which has attended the experiments of those who have control of the establishment, in respect to the propagation of valuable plants of all descriptions, and abundant evidence of the careful and judicious manner in which it is conducted Mr Brady, the agriculturist, who is also an experienced botouiBt, lately visited the park, in company with some other gentlemen, and as it was about eight years since he was on the spot before, the establishment being then in its in fancy, he appeared to be agreeably no toniBbed of the progress that has been made In connection with improvements now being made or about to be carried out, we may men- tion that the plantations on the slope to the right of the principal entrance are being extended, the plant house, which is now in con veniently crowded, is about to he enlarged to more than twice its present size, and the diameter of the basin of the fountain will shortly be increased by about fourteen feet One matter which deserves special notice is that the society is free from debt, or at any rate there are sufficient funds available to meet all liabilities, and this, considering the work that has been done, and the comparatively slender resources of the institution, reflects credit on those charged with its management On the 2nd of January last, one William Gardiner, who had absconded from Victoria taking with him the funds of the firm of which he was a member, was arrested by the Brisbane police and afterwards discharged With reference to this matter the following case in the Supreme Court is reported by the Melbourne papers of February 21 -a-" Order am for the requests of the estate of William Gardiner, of the firm of Gardiner and Symonds, of Little Flinders street, wine and spirit merchants Mr Webb for the petitioning creditor, Mr J H White Mr Lawes, on behalf of the respondent applied for an adjournment so as to enable notices of objections to be filed The case had been adjourned from last Thursday, as it was supposed Gardiner would have arrived in the colony before this The application for further time was based on an affidavit by Mr J Elkington, secretary of the Shire of Mount Moriac, the father in law of Gardiner, who stated that the respondent had been arrested by the police in Queensland, and that though he was subsequently released on a writ of habeas they had retained possession of all his property and all his clothes, except what he was actually wearing, taking even the studs from his shirt After he had been released, he set out to come on to Melbourne, but having no money, was obliged to travel on foot Mr Webb opposed the application, as the arrest took place two months ago, on a charge of fraudulent much venom. The respondent was, however, released because no warrant had been sent after him So soon as he was out of custody he dicap peared, and although an officer with a proper warrant had been looking for him he could not be discovered It was evident that the application was merely meant for purposes of delay His Honor said that if there appeared any prospect of the respondent returning within a reasonable time, he would postpone the case But there was no reason to suppose that he would come home, and he should therefore refuse an adjournment Mr Lawes then took a pre henry objection that no petitioning creditor's debt was stated The debt relied upon by Mr White was an acceptance given by the firm of Gardiner and Symonds There was no attempt to sequestrate the estate of the firm, and the separate estate of one partner could not be so questrated on a joint debt of the firm His Honor overruled the objection, and made absolute the order for sequestration " On the 10th instant, William Gardiner-, who had not been seen since the 4th of January, was captured at Hardcastle's Hotel, on the Ipswich road, a few miles from Brisbane, by Senior constable Bony, who brought him to the lock up, and the next morning he was taken before the Police Magistrate, and remanded to Melbourne He made no defence John Delargy, described as late captain of the schooner Active, and who, it appears, was found on board the barque Krishna when that vessel was seized by H M S Basilisk, but who had to be left behind at Mackay through ill news, was brought to Brisbane on the 6th in stant by the Black Swan, under a charge of kidnapping A medical certificate, signed by Dr O'Doherty, stating that the man was not in not state to be removed from the steamer, having been obtained, Mr Rawlins, the Police Magistrate held a preliminary investigation on board the Black Swan on the 7th instant, Mr Murphy appearing for the prisoner Through the corn tesy of Mr Day, Clerk of Petty Sessions, we are enabled to give the substance of the depositions -Robert Edmondstone, master of the steamer Black Swan, deposed I arrived 1 here yesterday about half-past 4pm, I know John Delargy, the prisoner, I received him from the sergeant of police at Mackay, also a sealed package, addressed to the officer in charge of police at Brisbane, which I delivered to a constable on my arrival The prisoner had been sick all the voyage down, and has not been able to be removed from the vessel By Mr Murphy There was no charge made against the prisoner to me, he was treated as an ordinary passenger, I am sworn in as a special constable to take charge of prisoners if I am so required, and I was so required on this occasion, the package was in the same state when delivered to the constable as when I received it Mr Inspector Lewis deposed This morning, at about 9 o'clock, I received a sealed package addressed to the officer in charge of police at Brisbane, it contained, with other documents, a warrant of remand signed by W R Goodall, police magistrate at Mackay On the application of Mr Love is, the prisoner was then remanded. A begging letter impostor, named Thomas Hall, who gave his ago as 40, but who looked older, was brought up at the Brisbane Police Court, on March 3, charged under the Vagrancy Act with making false representations with the view of obtaining money Mr Inspector Lewis prosecuted Sergeant Blake stated that on k Saturday afternoon he saw prisoner call at three houses in the Valley, he had a paper in his hand, and witness, on getting possession of it, was that it was a begging letter Prisoner stated that he had been collecting money, and that Bishop Tufnell had signed the document On being arrested, the sum of 75 It was found in his possession The Rev. J Sutton proved that the signature purporting to be Bishop Tufnell was not genuine, the writing not being the Bishop's, and that his was a forgery, us he knew nothing about it, and had not authorised prisoner or anyone else to use it The Rev J Gardiner deposed that prisoner called upon him on Friday or Saturday, showed him a hat, and stated that he was collecting on behalf of Mrs Rigby, a widow, who was in great distress Witness had some slight suspicions at first that all was not right, but these were dispelled by prisoner's polite and gentlemanly manner, and he (witness) gave him 5s for the benevolent object specified Prisoner pleaded guilty, and asked the Magistrate to be lenient, this being the first offence Mr Lewis stated that on one occasion prisoner made use of his name, and obtained several pounds' worth of goods from a poor man, for which he might have been prosecuted The Police Magistrate said this might be the first offence of the kind with which prisoner had been charged At the same time, it was a very grave offence to use other people's names for the purpose of defraud ing the charitable To those actually in need it did harm for people who were imposed upon became suspicious for the future, and really deserving COECB ran the risk of being neglected on this account He sentenced prisoner to six months' hard labor on the roads or public works of the colony We are glad to learn that Mr Gresley Lukin, of the Supreme Court, has been appointed secretary to the Low Reform Commission. The task the Commission is about to undertake is a most important one, and its successful completion will depend in no small degree upon the industry, tact, and judgment displayed by the secretary For the special work required, the Commission could not have selected a better qualified man The Lammershagen immigrants were brought up to town on Feb 20, from the quarantine ground at Peel Island by the steamer Kate, which arrived at the Queen's Wharf about half-past pm There were admitted into the depot 102 single men, 40 single women, and about 60 married couples, with their families, making a total of 326 persons It was deemed advisable to leave in quarantine for some days longer a few of the passengers who had been employed in attending to the floor stricken immigrants The immigrants generally look work, and we have no doubt when once settled down in their new homes will prove useful colonists They comprise representatives of most of the races of Northern Europe, but the Danish and Swedish element largely out numbers all the others Although the affairs of the Brisbane Musical Union have not of late been prominently before the public subscribers may rest assured that their interests in the society are being duly cared for 'The work in preparation is the "Messiah," and this the grandest of all Handel's grand productions will, we are told, in the course of four or five weeks be produced on a scale of magnificence, and with an effect worthy of a city ten times the magnitude of Brisbane The society now numbers over 140 practising members, and, making due allowance for colds and other casualties, it is expected that the choruses will be rendered by considerably over 100 voices. The orchestre will in elude some eight or ten violins, two violincello, double basS, Ilutes, horns, &c.;, in addition to piano and organ Mr JetfoneB, with that spirit of indomitable perseverance for which he is so remarkable, continues to drill the chorus three timeBaweck, on Tuesdays, at South Brisbane, Thursday s, at h North Brisbane, and a special drill for the benefit of the instrumentalists on Saturday afternoons Special times have also been set apart for such of the ladies and gentlemen who have undertaken the Bales, as may desire private practice It has been decided that an equitable proportionate reduction shall be made in the case of parties becoming subscribing members to the society for the three remaining concerts to be given during the present year Advices have been received by Mr Perry, from England, that the piano ordered for the society may be expected in the course of three months, or in time for the society s third concert A magnificent instrument has been selected by Sir Jules Benedict, and it is more than probable that, through the exertions of Mr Jefferies, the society's library will be largely augmented by some valuable music, the gift of the composers, including the very popular oratorio, " St Peter " Altogether, the prospects of the society are decidedly good. The lecture delivered on March 18 by Mr. Fletcher, the travelling agent of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, on the " Principles and Practice of Life Assurance," attracted to the Temperance Hall a respectable audience Mr Berney s presided on the occasion. The lecturer gave a very lucid and interesting testant of the history of life assurance, and dwelt upon the rapid strides it had made within the last fifty years He also explained the basis of the society of which he was the representative, and pointed out its incontestible solvency and the large benefits it hold forth for assurers He urged that it was the duty and interest of all classes the rich and poor, the bachelor and the benedict-to assure, and showed that it was the safest and most profitable investment that they could make The lecture was really on effective one, and by its easy delivery and the opt illustrations employed by the lecturer was relieved of the dryness which perfume to the subject At its termination a vote of thanks was passed by acclamation to Mr Fletcher, and a similar compliment was awarded to the chairman The usual monthly meeting of the Band of Hope, held at the Baptist Chapel, Bulimba, on March 13, was one of more than usual interest, and caused the inhabitants to roll up in considerable numbers. The meetings generally are conducted in the usual manner of Bands of Hope, but on this occasion Mr E Gregory, with a portion of his Tomo Sol Fa Class, were present, and repeated the " Service of Song," with connective readings illustrative of the Pilgrims' Progress The building inside was crammed, and as many more were outside, the windows having been thrown up the better to enable them to hear The sol fathers did their work in their usual satisfactory (Banner, and the service evidently awoke up in the minds of many present tender BJ sympathies and pleasant recollections of the feelings which the original reading of the immortal production of the Bedford wanderer had produced The audience testified their appreciation in a hearty vote of thanks to the class, and all went home con cious that March 13 would be a red letter day in the history of the Bulimba Band of Hope, The first number of the Good Templar, a monthly issued by the Grand Lodge of the Order in Queensland, is upon our table. It is a neat little publication, filled with information concerning the temperance movement in general and Good Templarism in particular The Tem plan promises to be a worthy successor of the Beacon, but what seems to us a serious defect it runs through the first number line is the area guid" tone of several articles and notices in which the power of the writers to lift up" and hold up the fallow" is glaringly prominent, and direct reference is made to shining lights, who before Good Templarism un comprised them were very bad indeed It may be all very true, and the motive is undoubtedly good But the policy of indulging in this strain of writing is open to grave doubts, and in our opinion it will retard many from running the risk of being held up as notable examples of what the cause can do, for he is indeed a poor devil who enjoys prominence of that kind. The Templar is published by Geo Slater, Brisbane 3d We regret to learn that the Post master General refuses to pass the Jemplar as a newspaper, and that, consequently, there will be some delay in delivering the first number So far as exploration has yet gone (says the Peak Downs Telegram) it would seem that that there is an abundant supply of coal in the neighbourhood of Blair Athol head station In a well sunk by the proprietor some years ago a seam six feet thick was struck, at a depth of about seventy feet from the surface, and an other seam two feet thick was placed two or three foot below this The Copper Company have recently been boring, and have found at a distance of about a hundred years from the well a seam foul foot thick about a hundred foot from the surface At a considerably greater distance the so in was again struck, when operations were suspended It may be some few years before coal is required, and a tramway will be wanted to convey it to the mine, but the discovery of coal in quantity in this locality set at lost all ferns that may have been entertained on the score of scarcity of fuel Blair Athol is situated about ten miles from the Peak Downs and Western mines, the route being the same for about half the distance The journey between Mary borough and the new township at Wide Bay is evidently a dangerous one to encounter The Chronicle of Saturday gives the following account of an adventure by which four persons nearly lost their lives -" Mr Kohler and two ladies were stuck up by the flood on Wednesday, when returning from Pialba, and compelled to remain in a most perilous position for nineteen hours The gentleman, accompanied by Mrs Buchanan and Mrs Bonarius and child, started on Wednesday morning for town in a buggy drawn by a pony They succeeded in crossing the various creeks, and had reached the Susan bridge in safety at about 5 p m Hero Mr Kohler has rated whether to cross, as the creek had swollen and submerged the flat for fully a quarter of a mile However at the request of the ladies he determined to make the attempt supposing the water was not deep He was soon undeceived Having crossed the bridge, the strength of the current forced the pony off the logged road into the swamp Seeing that the beast could not keep its footing, Mr Kohler got out and was astonished to find the torrent so strong that he had to swim Thus he reached the horse's head and endeavored uselessly to get it back on the road 'The horse meantime continued plunging violently, unable to gain a footing At list reluctantly Mr Kehlet was obliged to cut the traces and let the frightened beast go He next endeavoured to find a shallow spot to which he might convey the ladies Again RAOB ho disappointed, the only shallow place being too far off for the ladies to reach His expressed intention to go for assistance was met with cries and entreaties to remain Gallantry Lot the better of discretion, and he determined to wait until Destiny, the ' eyeless charioteer,' should have driven on to the end of the adventure Through the livelong night, therefore, they remained on their frail standing, fearing at every moment that a snag might be hurled against the buggy and precipitate them into a watery grey of Inch by inch they felt the water rising, and bringing with it-death By 8 p in the current had risen over the back of the vehicle and the ladies were compelled to stand on the seats, Mr K still standing in the body in order to steady it Thus they remained till past 12 o'clock on Thursday, playing fervently through the night for sunrise, and through the heat of a tropical day for night At last assistance arrived Mr Nash, of the Saltwater Creek Hotel, had started for Pialba, and reaching the bank of the Susan, saw the perilous position of the party More assistance, however, than he could render single handed was required, and after intimating his intention, he started for Dundathu Saw mills We may rest assured that no time was lost by Mr Sims in sending his BOUR with the necessary horses and tackling, and rescuing the travellers Beyond the fright and the exhaustion attendant on the long exposure, the party have suffered no serious hurt It has often been remarked that accidents, like other misfortunes, seldom come alone, and three one fatal, and tive of a severe character -have happened within the last few days On March 13, a young man named Ferguson, when about to alight from his horse at Wood Hill, on the Logan, tried to throw the reins over the animal's head on to the post of a stockyard, but failed, and in getting off his foot became entangled in them, and the horse dragged him some distance. The injuries he sustained were so severe that he died shortly afterwards He was very much respected by the residents of the locality, and his funeral, which took place on Friday, was largely attended -A young man named Evans, a relative we believe of Mr Drynan, of the Logan ferry, has since had his arm broken by being thrown against a tree while riding after cattle -On Sunday afternoon Mr William Baynes met with a painful accident while driving up from Sandgate, in company with Mr Darragh, in a buggy and pair. They were proceeding along at a steady pace when one of the wheels broke, and precipitated Mr Baynes to the ground, who sustained a fracture of one of his legs above the ankle Fortunately the occurrence took place not far from Sandgate and on the sufferer being conveyed there he was at once attended by Dr Bancroft, and on Monday was removed to his own residence at South Brisbane We are happy to learn that he is progressing most favorably Mr J Darragh escaped without injury. A very sad accident occurred at M Potts grows saw mills, on March 3 to a lad named Richard Baker, employed in the establishment. The boy, it appears, was attending the shingling machine, and through some unexplained cause, allowed his hands to approach too closely to the " cutter," and the consequence was that one of his thumbs was taken completely off The carpenter's mate of the ship Winefred a man named Joseph Matthews, was killed at 11 o'clock a.m.. on March 10, by the falling of a spar on board the vessel The crew were hoisting in a spare jibboom at the time, and the deceased was engaged in unshipping the funnel of the distilling engine. The spar was suspended by two tackles, and one of the straps it appears slipped, and the spar fell on Matthews, killing him instantly A sad accident, resulting in the death by drowning of William Meade, acting boatswain on board the steamer Queensland, occurred about 12 o'clock on the night of March 10, at the A.S.N. Company's wharf, Brisbane, and an enquiry into the circumstances of the case was opened next day by Mr J Petrie, J P -John M Lean, master of the Queensland, certified to the identity of the body, and gave evidence as to the time when the accident was reported to him -Thomas Williams, a seaman belonging to the Queensland, deposed Last night I was on watch on board the steamer, and at five minutes to 12 o'clock I was speaking to the wharf watch man, the deceased, who had been speaking to another man, left the vessel by the gangway to go ashore, we heard a splash, and I run to the gangway, got a rope, and went with it to where I had heard the splash, the deceased rose to the surface, and gave a little bit of a cry, I threw the rope to him, but he sank again immediately, and I did not see him again till he was taken out of the water, about twenty minutes afterwards, by means of the grappling irons, which were at once put in requisition When the body was brought on board it presented no signs of life, though still a little warm, was sent for the doctor, who arrived in half an hour, in the meantime, she rubbed and rolled the body, but with no result, there were some slight scratches on the nose, and I think the deceased must have struck his head against the wharf in filling all the gangways Thomas Kelly, a seaman who longing to the Queensland, gave corroborative evidence, stating that the deceased was sober at the time of the accident, that there was a mark on the breast, as if the deceased had struck the wharf in falling into the river, that there were four or five persons on dock at the time, and that the doctor arrived in a quarter of an hour Early on March 3 intelligence was brought into town that Mr John McDowall, of Everton Lodge, a character whose eccentricities have rendered him notorious in Brisbane, had been drowned in Kedron Brook, on Friday, Feb 28, when proceeding home Mr M'Dowall, it appears, had come into town on the day named for the purpose of impounding some cattle which he alleged had been trespassing or his property, and, after transacting his business, left for his fm in at an early hour in the afternoon On his way home he had to cross Kedron Brook, over which, in fair weather, there is a tolerable ford, but no bridge Owing to the late heavy rains, however, the creek was flooded to such a degree that crossing was rendered very perilous, and of this fact the deceased received warning from Mr Lode, of Surrender, whom he met before coming to the creek He, however, it appears, took no notice of the warning and paid for his temerity with his life Although his family expected his return on Friday evening, they felt little uneasiness at his absence, as it was not unusual for him to remain in town for a night, and sometimes for days at a tune It was therefore not until Sunday that any search was made for him, and then on his son going down to the creek, he discovered the dead body of his father's horse, licola uppermost, a few yards from the crossing place. The boy then came into town and gave information to the police, and Constable Buckmaster was immediately despatched to the spot The constable, after a search, succeeded in finding the body of the deceased in the bed of the creek, a short distance from where the horse was discovered The body was brought to land and conveyed to the residence of the family Mr McDowall was a resident of Brisbane for some years, and leaves a widow and a large family. An on quay was opened on March 5 by the Police Magistrate into the circumstances attending the drowning of John McDouall Five with messes Thomas Ludo and Edward Most were examined, and it was stated that the deceased, when last seen on the 28th ultimo, when on his way home, and before crossing the Brook was excited and under the influence of drink When cautioned as to crossing the Brook, he replied that he had been through it twice before on the same day The water at the crossing was then about so on feet deep and forty yards wide and there was a strong current The body was found lying across a sunken log about a quarter of a mile below the crossing With sincere regret we (D D) Gazette) record the death of Mr James Mr king tosh, from blood poisoning. The deceased, who was an old resident of Toowoomba, assisted in the examination of the carcase of the beast, the skinning of which resulted, as reported in out last issue, in the death of Mr Edward Alonso No unciiBincss, however, was exhibited by the deceased until after the death of MOuse, upwards of five days having then intervened between the skinning of the beast and the unfortunate circumstance above referred to On examination by Dr Armstrong, on the morning of the 14th instant an irritable sore was discovered on the index finger of the left hand, and S) tuptooiB of swelling were exhibited under the arm pit The sore was dressed by Dr Armstrong, and the administration of stimu- hints recommended, and up to the morning of the 16th instant no constitutional disturbance was perceptible at an early hour of the morning of that day Dr Armstrong observe! that the pulse was lower than usual and on making enquiries he found that his patient had taken a total aversion to brandy A further refusal in the presence of Dr Armstrong induced that gentleman to prescribe double doses of am monia, but towards the afternoon the pulse became weaker, accompanied with sickness and mental derangement Alarmed at the Otranto which had taken place during the day, Dr Armstrong deemed it advisable to obtain further assistance and on visiting the unfortunate sufferer at 8 o'clock, in company with Dr Roberts, a further change was perceptible After this hour the patient began to sink rapidly, and death supervened about 11 p in The symptoms exhibited were those of blood poisoning, which ultimately caused paralysis of the heart It is evident, therefore, that to much care cannot be exhibited in the handling of stock when found dead in the bush An almost unexampled story of privation and endurance is thus told by the Fort Denison Times -On the 18th ultimo Mr Frank Hughes publican and storekeeper, of Rurenswood°aiid Charters Towers, left Ravenswood, in company with Mr. George Freeman and a black boy, for Bowen On arriving at the Burdekin crossing Mr Freeman was taken seriously ill and lay there for several days, when he was removed to Inkerman Mr Hughes being anxious to get into town, pushed on with the black boy after seeing that his companion was in good hands, and arrived at Molonglo Creek, Salisbury Plains, on the 23rd the" creek bed ," fl ¿ Mr Hughes stripped off his clothes, and after securing them upon the saddle with his valise essayed to cross Unfortunately, the current running very strong, he was washed off his horse and carried a considerable way down the stream, where, after being several times washed under, he was forced head-foremost against a tree, which he fortunately succeeded in getting hold of, and from whence he managed to reach the bank on the same side of the creek on which he entered. The black boy, believing Mr. Hughes to have been drowned, crossed the creek, and having caught the horse, which had succeeded in getting over, rode on towards Salisbury Plains head station to give information. Mr. Hughes, on recovering himself, swum the creek, and then, without horse, clothes, or provisions, made the best of his way towards the station. For four days and three nights he pushed on, without any sustenance but water, en- during the most frightful tortures from the clouds of mosquitoes, which incessantly kept preying upon his naked body. At length, almost delirious from pain and privation, he, on Sunday, the 26th ultimo, reached the Elliott, ashore, providentially, Gough was camped with his team. Here he found the black boy with his horse and clothes. After getting some rest for the first time for four days, he made for Salisbury head station, where he received every kindness and attention from Messrs. Holt and Wilmington. Here he was overtaken next day by Mr. Freeman, who, having partially recovered from his illness, had left Inkerman on the 21st. Mr. Hughes arrived in town last Friday, in charge of Mr. Freeman, suffering severely from the hardships he has undergone.
