MEDICAL CHEMICALS ETC. BEAJXDRBTH'S PILLS, entirely VEGETABLE and Innocent. " What has beonlongcst known has been most considered and what has been most considered is best understood. " The life of the flesh is in the blood. Rev. xvii. 11. It is hurtful to bleed even in Plourisy. Dizziness, or other Inflammatory Affections. Purging with Brandroth's Pills is certain to care ; Plourisy usually in from twelve to twenty-four hours. Apoplexy can always be prevented. But these Pills are the best remedy known both for Apo- proxy and Sun-stroke when attacked. The laws of life are written upon the face of nature The tempest, whirlwinds, and thunderstorms bring health from the solitudes of God. Thaides are the daily agitators and purifiers of the mighty world of waters. What these providential means are as purifiers of nature, BRANDRETH'S PILLS are to man. because their use produces an activity in the circulation which occasions the blood to throw off what is hurtful. And their good effects are not counterbalanced by any inconvenience. Being composed entirely of herbs they do not expose those who use them to any danger ; their effects are as certain as they are salutary. They are daily and safely administered in infancy, youth, manhood, old age, and to women in the most critical and delicate circumstances; they do not disturb or check the animal functions, but rosters their order and re-establish their health. Those who are sick and use a few boxes hardly know themselves afterward. From being dull, they are lively ; from being Sallow their complexions are close from having no appetite they long for the dinner hour. And after their use, all the functions of nature go on with regularity. If the bowels were costive, they are so no more ; if the sleep was disturbed, it is now sound and refreshing ; if there were pains or local affections, they are now gone. Dr. Lull, a distinguished physician of Potsdam, N.Y., who has used them in his practice for thirty years, says : " They are a vegetable compound ; they invigorate, purify, and cleanse the blood, correct and regulate all the secretions, and, by purgations, discharge the whole mass of morbid matter from the body without reducing the strength." GENERAL DIRECTIONS. BRANDRETH'S PILLS are intended, by their purge rive qualities, to remove from the blood corrupt humours which are in reality the occasion of all the aches and pains to which a human body is exposed. The general rule is, to have the medicine operate copiously by the bowels. This will in all cases give relief, and often permanently cured at once. But if the aches or pains continue, the pills must be repeated for a few nights in succession. There is no ache or pain that will not yield to their astonishing influence The ordinary dose is from two to four pills, but in bilious colic, and in all cases where violent pain is experienced of the bowels or other parts of the body, the doctor should be eight or ten pigs, and repeated if necessary. When they operate fully the pain will cease, often before. After large doses, take two or three pills daily until the health is fully restored. TO BE REMEMBERED" BRANDRETH'S PILLS expel the persons or humours which cause us to be sick. Every time one is purged by this remedy he less poison in his system, and relatively more life. % Persons of spare habit and delicate organization gain flesh and vigour while using them. As a rule, the purgation should be continued for three or four days in succession; then there may be a greater or less interval of rest. But in the commencement of this treatment, in cases that have been of long standing, it is of great importance that we purge several days in succession, so that we expel more comipt humours than can be formed in the same time, Every time we rest a few days or weeks from the pur- gation, we make now fluids from our food, which replace the unsound ones that the pills have caused to be evacuated. Each time we repeat this process, we expel further quantities of impurities, which are again replaced by fluids less and less impure, so that in a short time by continuing this treatment, we bring back the whole mass ' of fluids or humours to that state of purity which constitutes health. In many cases where the dreadful ravages of ulceration had laid bare ligament and bone, and where, to all appearance, no human means could save life, patients, by the use of these pills, have been restored to good health.' As Brondreth's Pills cure scurvy costiveness and its consequences, seafaring men, and all travellers to foreign regions, should not be without them, in order to resort to t them promptly on the first appearance of sickness. LIFE IS THE GIFT OF GOD, When we are sick this life is obscured, under a cloud, oppressed with humours. Experience has taught us certain means which never fail for their removal. Shall we not avail ourselves of these moons, and thus restore our health, our life ? This course seems to be our duty. The child receives with his life the seeds of his death. It may take one, or one hundred years, before the seeds boar (hoir sod fruit, but just at sure as the seeds of death ripen, life ceases. Purging is the grand safeguard, because then what fosters the seeds of death are taken away, expelled from the body. The most celebrated purgative is BRANDRETH'S PILLS, which are unerring. Their widespread reputation Eroves intrinsic merit. Nothing but good qualities have placed them in the position they occupy in public estimation. When all hope is gone their use has given blessed health. Let the sick again feel the pleasure of a sound body by their aid. Millions bless the day they became acquainted with Brandrctli's Pills, which cleans, the blood from im- purities. What a. meaning and application that fact carries The liver, the spleen, the kidneys, and the hours are brought into harmonious action, health, long life, and vigour of mind and body are the solid gains. ! DYSENTERY, DIARRHOEA AND CHOLERA MORBUS In those cases give the pills every six or twelve hours in doses of from four to eight pills. The diet should be the " Sheep's Head Broth," or light soup or gruel. For too much eating and drinking the cure is effected by from four to six pills. i In costiveness, headache, bilious attacks, liver affections, colds, influenza, rheumatism, gout, and as an apricot or to purge, take from two to six or eight pills. Should they not operate easily and freely, the next close may be increased one, two, three or more pills. When the bowels are desired to be moved with more than ordinary vigour, and indeed in all cases where there is an obstinate costiveness prevail- ing, break the pills in small pieces and mix with molasses, and give in portions of about four- pills every four hours until the bowels are thoroughly cleansed. Though no especial care or attention is needed, yet it is always of great advantage to have a cup of tea and toast, on a basin of gruel or broth ready, soon after they have commenced to operate. The patient's strength is thus sustained, and the medicine sooner cures by tin's timely assistance. Inveterate sickness of the stomach is usually occasioned by matters which produce fevers, or are the consequence of contusion, of a pressure upon the brain, either from local injury or from fulness of the blood vessels of the head. Therefore, purging-with Brandroth's Pills is tub one okeat NECESSITY. One or two days' vigorous enforcement of this practice will save days, perhaps months of sickness ; nay, often life is saved by this simple method. To allay the sickness of the stomach, place a mustard plaster over the upper part of the bowels. TO REMEMBER! ! A dose more of BRANDRETH'S PILLS than required will never hurt you ; but not taking a dose of when required may cost you your life. As to the Dose of Pills, I refer to D. D. Wright, Esq., corner of Houston and Lewis streets, New York, who has sold Brandreth's Pills at his store for thirty years, and who administered to a patient whose bowels, for a week, had resisted the united efforts of the medicines of three physicians, and who left her to the last con- solations of religion. To this patient was given Brand- roth's Pills in doses of four each, broken up and mixed with molasses, every two hours, until they operated. He gave, in thirty-two hours, Sixty-four pills, and thus saved a valuable life. The patient was restored to health immediately, and became more healthy than she had been for years. REV. THOMAS BONSALL, M.A., on the Qualities and Reputation of Brandreth's Pills and Allcock's Plasters, Mr. D. BRANDRETH, ESQ., HYBRrOOL. " Wissett Vicarage, near Halesworth, Suffolk. " July 29th, 1872. " My Dear Sir-Please forward me some of Brandrotli's Pills and Porous Plasters to amount of enclosure. I may here state I have been in the habit, for the last thirty seven years, of administering these remedies to the sick with great success. I have been well acquainted with Dr. B. Brondicth, of New York, for nearly forty years, and can certify that he gives constant employment to upwards of one hundred persons preparing these com- modities alone. Brandreth s Pills and Allcock's Porous Plasters are the household remedies of nearly every family in the United States and throughout South America. We all know that many persons take medicine when they do not need it. It is, therefore, of importance that the medicine should be incapable of hurting. Now I know Brandisth's Pills to be perfectly harmless from long experience of their effects. Yet, when the bowels or thin blood need cleansing, they are a thoroughly energetic medicine, housing all the interior organs to healthy action. In colds, colles, and costiveness they give relief immediately, and those who give them a trial will find them a safe and most reliable remedy I am, yours truly, " THOMAS BONSALL, " Late Curate of Linstead Magna and Parva, Suffolk."

WESTON'S WIZARD OIL was first introdnecdt«tin Australian public in 1861, and the wonderful and mysie, rious influence it exhibited in stopping the most excruciating PAINS, ACHES, and INFIRMITIES in a few minutes after its use is well known. Its miraculous power in raising the bed-ridden, crippled, rheumatic, neuralgic divesting the system from all suffering from pain, inflammation, and weakness, touring in a few days the sickness and diseases of months and years, giving instantaneous EASE and COMFORT in all ordinary pains and aches, either internal or external all cramps, spasms, conger tions. In fact it fully verifies the verdict given by the millions that have used it. IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM RHEUMATISM, try a dose of Wizard Oil internally twice a day;, and both externally over the parts affected (using the oil I freely) ; it will not only CURE THE PAIN, but will- move the cause of the disease. IF YOU ARE AFFLICTED WITH Neural, Headache, or Toothttcho, apply to Oil to the parts affected as per directions enclosed with each bottle. IF YOU HAVE DIARRHOEA, WANT OF TONE, OR RELAXED STATE OF THE BOWELS, take a few doses of Wizard Oil and they will soon be restored. IF YOU HAVE A BURN, keep the parts covered with cotton saturated with Wizard Oil ; this will in a short time draw out the fire and cure the pain. IF YOU HAVE A PAIN IN THE BREAST, SIDE, BACK, OF KIDNEYS, bathe the parts affected night and morning with the oil, and take two or three doses Eternally.
