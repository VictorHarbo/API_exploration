It appears that the schooner Notion passed the Heads at about sunset on Friday, and in coming up the west channel grounded about twenty fathoms inside the White Spit buoy. The boat was manned by the chief officer, Mr. Robert Miller, and three seamen, named W. Sweeny, Charles Ed- wards, and John Parry, to take out a kedge anchor to heave the vessel off, when, by some unaccountable circumstance the boat swamped, and, there being no other boat on board, no assistance could be rendered them, although their cries for help were heard on board the vessel. Captain Rolls, per- ceiving several vessels passing, burned torches, and hailed for assistance ; but it was not until after sun- rise that he was enabled to communicate with a vessel—a fore-and-aft schooner (name un- known)—by which he sent to the Swan- Spit Light- ship for a boat. The steamer Black Swan shortly afterwards come near, and Captain Woods sent a boat on board, and on passing Shortland's Bluff, com- municated with Mr. Brown, of H. M. Customs, and Captain Kennedy, of the pilot- schooner Proserpine, who went immediately to the schooner. Shortly after- wards the Monarch, barque, came down the Channel, and Captain Kelly come alongside, bringing the boat, in which were two men, who were identified as the mate, Mr. Miller, and W. Sweeney, seaman. They had been dead for some hours. The boat was found about four miles east of the Light-ship. The bodies have been conveyed to Williamstown, where an inquest will be held this day. A large " Black Ball" ship, supposed to be the James Baines, was sighted by tho Gambie; June 20th, lat. 17° 26' north, long. 39° 49' west. BRUTAL OUTRAGES ON BOARD SHIP.—Yesterday after- noon a diabolical outrage was committed on board the ship Light of the Age, by some five or six villains, who attacked the chief officer with iron belaying pins, and appeared determined to murder him. The vessel was lying at the Circular Wharf, directly oppo- site the Water Police Office, but notwithstanding that the usual signal for police assistance was hoisted at the main half an hour elapsed before they inter- fered ; in the Interim the watermen at the New Wharf, in a most praiseworthy manner, ran to the pro- tection of the assaulted party, and happily succeeded in quelling the disturbance. Foremost in this courageous and manly interference we noticed par- ticularly Patrick Murray and James Richards, water- men at the New Stairs.—Empire, 6th Oct. The steam clipper Istanboul, arrived in Hobson's Bay yesterday afternoon. She left London on the 10th and Plymouth on the 16th July. She encountered light weather lat. 14° north, she being under sail the entire distance ; on the 30th July, the propeller was lowered, and after steaming for twelve hours, the fore- mast bearing of the screw gave way, so that she was unable to use steam during the remainder of the voy- age, thus accounting for her apparently lengthy (pas- sage. Captain Cole informs us that while the vessel was being hauled out of dock, the screw come in con- tact with a vessel's moorings, which must have strained it considerably, and that he was not made acquainted with the accident until she broke down. The follow- ing vessels were spoken during the passage : Septem- ber 8, lat. 43° 24' south, Ion. 21° 12' east, Harvest Home, barque, from London to Sydney. October 4, lat 40° 53' Ion. 130.20 east, Mary Pleasant, ship, steer- ing west. THE ENGLISH MAIL. To the Editor of the Aryus. Sir,—I am sure you did not intend to create any alarm when, in your issue a few days back, you ex- plained that amongst other causes for the non-arrival of the mail from Europe was the fact, that the ex- pected steamer would be travelling a portion of the Indian Ocean at a period of the year when the mon- soons were shifting. Had there been no disturbance in India, and if I had had friends on board the ex- pected mail, I should, indeed, have been alarmed at the mere insinuation of her being caught in one of those hurricanes, which are not at all uncommon in the Indian Ocean at the period of the year the mail might be traversing its waters. I have been in a typhoon in the China Seas, in a two thousand ton ship, and have witnessed every mast go by the board from the effects of its fury, and I have also in lat. 20° S. and long. 90° E. (nearly the course of the mail) been in a cyclone or hurricane in a vessel which also lost every stick, and never returned to Europe, being too much shattered to attempt it. I have witnessed the fearful raging of the two—the typhoon lasts from twelve to twenty-four hours ; the cyclone of the Indian Ocean may remain with you for two or three days, depen- ding upon the position of the vessel when the cyclone commences. I do not want to add to any alarm, or to enter into particulars of typhoons and cyclones, nautical men and shipbuilders will, no doubt, prepare for emergencies of this description. I only want to offer my individual opinion that the mail ship must have been taken for troops for India ; because, in the first place, the British Government asked permission of the Pasha of Egypt to be allowed to convey troops through his country, and what is more natural to suppose than that a telegraph mes- sage was sent to Malta to despatch troops instanter for India via Alexandria ; from Alexandria across Egypt to Suez ; and then, what more probable, than to em- bark the troops on board the first and any steamer they might there find. Simply, then, it may be asked, —why did the British Government ask permission of Egypt for troops to e allowed to pass through the country, except to go to Suez ? and what were they to do at Suez if there were no vessels to convey them from thence ? and lastly, what vessels of any note could there be at an insignificant place like Suez, except the East Indian and the Australian mail ships. In spite, then, of my knowledge of the fierce hurricanes of the Indian Ocean, I, for one am quite satisfied that the mall ship is safe, as far as Australia is concerned, and that she is now resting on the waters of the Hooghley, at Saugur or Diamond Harbor. Hoping this letter will tend to satisfy all who feel anxious about the delay of the mail as my deductions satisfy me. I am, Sir, yours very obediently, NAUTICUS. Collingwood, 10th October, 1857.
