JEi 260-89 GOOD, TOMS, & CO. ^CADEMY OE MUSIC. Directress — — Miss Annis Montague. COMMENCING MONDAY NEXT, OCTOBER 15. First Appearance in Adelaide of the MONTAGUE-TORNER: ENGLISH OPES A COMPANY. Headed by the Unrivalled Prima Donna MISS ANNIS MONTAGUE, And the Great English Tenor, MR CHABLES TORNEB, Whose enthralling performances have caused a perfect furore in the other colonies. ; To the music-loving public of Adelaide the Management regret their being unable to obtain the Theatre Boy al, tor which they have tried for the past two years; but as arrangements have been made for the appearance of Miss Montague and Mr. Turner in England, and their time being so limited, they have been prevailed npon to give a Season in the above hall as the best suited place after the Theatre, where every possible attention "will be given to fch© convenience and comfort. of the public. Miss Montague desires it to be strictly, understood that all that is advertised will' be. carried out, and that she will be supported by Artists who possess voices that she is confident havefnever been excelled in Adelaide in English Opera; knowing the Adelaide public are fond of good music and singing, and also are good judges, she will ho,proud to meet them. The Melbourne Argus says:—"Miss Montague possesses a voice of rare beauty, soft, round, and meiliflous; it has been highly cultivated, and she manages it with accurate tr-sie and atWjhertriUs. aiouiciu-actraisnnctae th*> nngtug^r-Ehver oeus. and the prolonged swelling notes 'lengthened sweetness long, drawn out' they seem, indeed, the soul of melody;'both in speaking and singing her articulation is clear and sweet. It is a. musical treat of ho ordinary kind to listen to Miss Mon tague's vocalisation; it is not alone as a perfect vocalist that we have to speak of this lady, but a3 a lyric dramatic artist of great intelligence and such sympathetic manner as reach the hearts of . all hearers; it is to bet lionorto be saidthatas anartiste she becomes greatest wherein most is expected of her." „ . Of Mr. Cbarles Turner, the Argus says:—' Me is certainly the finest English tenor we have ever beard in Melbourne, with a fine commanding pre sence. His voice is as clear as a bell, and capable of giving forth sounds strong as a trumpet, or soft as the softest tones of a violin; it is also of groat register, reaching the highest notes of the music with the greatest ease; there is no straining or effort; he is a magnificent singer. We feel certain that there are not two artists south of the equator who can excel Miss Montague and Mr. Turner. The Sydney Morning Herald says" The success achieved by the Montague-Turner Optra Company is of the most pronounced description, the singing of Miss Montague and Mr. Turner has created quite a furore amongst the music-loving portion of the com munity. Miss Montague's natural taste and love of music renders her singing thoroughly sympathetic; it is no vain display of agili'y or the exhibition of a superb natural organ; it is vocalism appealing to the feelings that brings tears welliDg to the eyes or makes the heart joyous and glad." Of Mr. Turner, the Herald says" He is an operatic artist of the highest order, with a magnificent tenor voice. Sydney Express, Jtuie 4, says:—"We have i Miss Montague's siuging was sublimity itself,«en trancing one and all. Such a storm of bravo s, hurrahs, clapping of hands, beating of sticks and feet; in fact everything available was used to express tbepuhlic'sintense gratification. We have never wit nessed a more genuine or greater success. Mr. Charles Turner's fine tenor voice fairly excelled ail we have heard of him.
