TO TIIB BLECTOltS OF TUB HO UTH 1'UOVINCB. Gr.NTLEMnx,— Having announced iny Intention of becoming a Candidate lor the vacincy iu the repre sentation of your province, cuuicd by tlie. resignation of |he lion J. U. Bennett, I have the honor to submit the following, as my opinions on the subject, which, nt the present time, most pro minently occupy public attention. I am in favor of the snlc of Crown Land 4 by auc tion, believing, imperfect as that system may be, it is less liable to serious nbusc, than any ot her which can be devised, whilst it insures to the state something like a fair value lor the property filfenated." As, however, there cin be no doubt that it is most desirable lor the permanent interests of the colony that agricultural settlement sh'uld bee jc.'iraced, I would support any amendment of the Laud Act which, while cfl'ectua'lv p« eventing the sacrifice of the public estate by fraudulent combinations, will afford those w ho give proper guarantees of the sin- cerity of theirintention of becomfnguctuM cultivators of the sell, an opportunity of doing so without competing. with the more wealthy classes. T look upon immigration as absolutely essential to our wo'faic, and to a wide spread publication of our many advantages as tlie readiest means of en couraging it. The proposed alteration in tlie Electoral Law will, I think, bo of udvuntage. f am in favor of a reduc tion being made in tlie tenure of office of mem bers of tho Upper House, Tlie District Councils Bid will te a valuable enact ment, as tending to (hcantralisation and to the en couragement of an interest in local self-government. It is to be regretted that the Real Property Act has not been effective in attaining the design of its framcrs. I hope soon to sec it so amended as to moke It a workable and useful incasutc. To the at tainment of this I will render zealous ssistanc?. The Education Act, should, I consider, bo worked in the spirit in which it was framed, neither secta rian nor class jealousies should be considered, but any de ects which are obstacles to its proper admi nistration should at oucc he amended. in seeking tob. conic oneof your representatives I must assure you that my only ohjecf is to lend the benefit of that cxperimce to the conduct of pub'ic affairs which a residence of 22 years in the colony has afforded me. I shall he prepared generally to give my indepen dent support to til incisures, irora whatever quarter they muy emanate, calculated to promote, our prosperity. I look upon class legislation as most di stiuctlve of the general go d, and I regard those who, in order to gain ponular favour, attempt to set one class against another, as amongst the worst enemies to the progress of our adqitcd cOuutry. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, c ' J. I'. BEAR. Public Notices. CITY of MELBOURNE.- PUBLIC HOLIDAY.
