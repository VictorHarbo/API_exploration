Thus, then expenditure was £2 3s. a head, while the expenditure in England only amounted to 22 detail, yet the Australian colonists had not the interest of all) debt to discharge, where- as half the expenditure of the mother country went not for the number mee of any efficient force, but for paying the interest of a debt incurred long since He was quite aware that a large proportion of this revenue was derived from a tax on him, owing to the strong propensities existing in the people of Aus-. tralia to consume spirituous liquors Now, he by no means was about to deny that it might he a very good piece of legislation to 1 by a heavy duty on him. There might be abundant excuse for raising such a duty, but sure none whatever in spending it. He knew he might be told that the Government of a colony frequently found itself under the necessity of disbursing a much large amount of revenue in public works than was at all necessary in an old civilized country Looking at the expenditure of New South Wales, he ventured to say that it was the largest and most lavish expenditure in the known world In the year 1639 the Ordinary Revenue of New South Wales was Ci 2,000, and this for a population of one hundred thousand, while the actual expences c was three hundred and forty six thousand, the difference being made up from that which ought never to enter into ordinary expenditure namely, the funds derived from the sale of lands. Thus the expenses of New South Wales imposed an average payment of 2 10s per head This the honourable member observed arose from the application of the sale of lands to ordinary purposes Now, if the interest of the national debt were not taken into consideration, it would be found that the actual expense of this country did not exceed one third for each individual of that expended in New South Wales" He certainly did not lose sight of the great expenditure necessary in that colony for a church establishment and the formation of roads, bridges, streets, of Deducting £70,000 expended on objects not required in England, it left a balance of £2/0,00, the whole exp nurture being -£346,000 Now, in comparing the expenditure of the colony with that of the mother country, honourable members should recollect that the Australians had nothing analogous to our establishments of the army, navy, and ordnance, and yet these three sources of expense swallowed a up £11,000,000 annually of our ordinary revenue The inference from all these statements was, that however great the extravagant c of our Government might be in England, it was three times as great in Australia. It was curious to observe with what cool neither see any addition was made to the expense thereof such a Colony Hue, if there were a proposition for adding five thousand men to the arm) it became a matter of servicing and parent insists gallon but 680 000 additional war cloud upon the Australians with as little ceremony as it none) were not an object of difficult and I ne acquisition Neither was there the test scrupulousness practised in reference to the source from whence the means of this additional expenditure is to be obtained the Government unless timely broke its pledge on the subject of immigration Jjct the house only look at the difference between our Australian and our North Am ric in Colina In the ici the pain lation was ten times as great as in Australia, ml of their direct taxation did not exceed the direct taxation of New South Wales As the house was aware, there existed in Australia a certain kind of slater) but it was the i idlest slate color) match the British Crown, not even excepting Jamaica The population of J an area to as five hundred thousand persons, vi like the expenditure was only L30 000 being one third part of the expenditure of New South Wales, yet they contain no soil of popular control in the latter Colony New South Wales had been made a kind of pu ont lir all the Colonial est blishments in that part of the world To that, amongst other things, he objected He professed himself utterly unable to comprehend why one Colony, howes ci old mill established, should he made to pay the expenses of any other, huts ever nets The conclusion to which he wished to which he wished to lend the house was, that the people of Austialiiouglittoh'iscsoniccontiolosci the serious nature of their own government if they were not indulged to this extent, at least, it would be quite unreasonable to suppose that any people would call e such treatment patient) He had not for gotten that many) people were of opinion that the Australians were wholly unfit for self Not eminent, That was certainly not the opinion of persons best acquainted with their habits and circumstances They were faulty in many) respects, but one obvious mode of improving them would be to grant them some small control in the management of their own affairs. He was not singular in holding this opinion nay, he was supported by the judgment of the highest authorities, not only in the Colony but in Europe There was, in the first place, Mr AXucat thin, a gentleman of the largest landed property in the Colony, and whose family had been amongst the oldest and most respectable of the early settlers, and who was amongst those that are called Tory party in Australia. "xctMi Macarthur was clear in the opinion that the time had quite come when a beginning should be made in imputing a popular character to the government of New South Wales Sir Ed and Party was of the same opinion, so likewise were Sir Robert Mitchell and Sir Richard Bourke he had himself presented a petition last year, signed by nine thousand persons, including all the magistrates. Mr Henry) Bulwer, when he had a seat in that house, presented a similar pc tion, A playing for popular control over the Government, and being very numerously and respectably signed At present time was a similar petition coming from Van Diemen's found, signed by one thousand nine hundred and forty-two persons, amongst whom on one hundred and twenty five magistrates out of one hun- dred and ninety eight He felt then that the house would abandon its duty if they delayed much longer do that which all parties earnestly demanded He saw many) objections toapopulargoieinnientmNcw South Wales. He felt that they were not fit for a representative government immediately, but he felt that it was the bounden duty of ministers to lose no time in taking such measures in the earliest period, as were necessary) in establishing free governments in our Australian Colonies (Hear, hear) He did not doubt the wish to grant them free institutions, but it was the duty of the Imperial Government to take measures for firing them to receive the advantages of being represented Moreover, it was the duty of Parliament not to legislate without reference to the feelings of the people He did not attribute the attention of honourable members U|xm the subject to anything more than a want of know- le age They neither knew nor cared much about the i espie of Australia. He should not then enter i to the general question of the wisdom or expediency of possessing p ii of colonies, but of this he entertained no doubt, that the practice of transporting the refuse of our population to New South Wales ought long since to have been discontinued. In a colony Melding so much valuable produce for export looking in the immense tracts of fine land which it contained he had no hesitation in saying that a wise Government would never have conversed that into an abode for crimes tss which nature li is so admirably adapted for the residence of industrious and colored men Transportation had been petitioned against by the inhabitants of Van Dieman's Island, but those of New South Wales were not so five-part, 'mrconiraeraft that the mile of convicts, Mewed is a supply of labourers, was utterly beside quate to the wants of the colony. He would impress upon the Government the necessity of encouraging the free emigration to our Australian colonies of persons willing to lease this country five years of well conducted c migration would place these colonies in the condition of being fully c in able of t skin" care of themselves, and of enjoying those dec m stitutions without which Englishmen, no matter in what part of the globe, 01 under what circum stances, would never be content Experience had taught them they could not do est Englishmen of the feelings their native country had imbued them with, and that they could not consequently expect to continue the prosperity of their Colonies, it they withheld from the people a voice in their own government Mr Labouchere said, that he did not decline to follow the observations of his honorable friend, through an) disregard to him, or because he did not feel the importance of the subject, but he conceived that no practical result could follow from the discussion in which he had embarked, on an if the house were to come to an opinion upon the several topics it resolved Although there was little of no accuracy in the statements which his honorable friend had made, yet the) presented so fallacious picture to the house, from the circumstance of his having omitted to advert to other matters intimately connected with the subject, that he (Mr Labouchere) felt it necessary in some degree to supply the deficiency, His honorable friend had begun by stating that he hoped the day was not very distant when he should see institutions of a liberal character, and more consonant to the feelings of Englishmen, substituted for the picsentssstcinof government liiXcw South Wales. He could assure his honorable friend that he was far from differing from the general principles he had been cased upon that subject He agreed with him that whatever might be the diffi- culty of introducing free institutions into a colony, there was much disadvantage in requiring English- men to live under a government in the conduct and control of which they had most are (Hear, hear ) Such was his objection to that state of things, that he would be disposed to mu much ha/rd rather than continue it, convinced as he was that it was pregnant vs still the seeds of discontent and danger He agreed with his honorable friend also, that so far from my delay being imputed as a matter of reproach to the G vernment, that, on the contrary, every year brought them nearer to the attainment of that object which he was sure they must all base in view name), of extending to the Colonies of Australia those institutions under which they might hopeful see them permanently satisfied He had always entertained the greatest doubt upon the propriety of making those colonies convict colonies of spreading a seed so bad upon a soil where the produce ss is sure to be so great (Hearhear ) He had always regarded that policy as being open to the greatest objection, and he was glad to be able to state that the Government had taken decided steps to put a stop to the system His noble friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who, he regretted to say, was unable to attend the house that day, had in conjunction with the Colonial office taken steps to put a stop to the export ition of convicts to New South Wales. This can only 2,000, being but half the use a number, would be sent to that Colony, the greater portion of whom would not be long allowed to remain there, but be taken to Norfolk Island, and placed under control as recommended by the committee to which his honorable friend had referred His honorable fr end would see therefore, that the Government were not open to the charge of neglect upon that part of the subject Directions had also been sent out to New South Wales at once to put an end to the assignment of convicts for domestic service and in as short a time as possible, to discontinue the assignment of la boilers without bringing immediate ruin or injury upon those accustomed to that supply that being the state of the question with respect to the exporta- tion of contacts, it was the more incumbent on the G it ei ment., by every practical means, to encourage tliecxpoitation of free labour to supply the deficiency, and enable those colonies to continue in that course of prosperity he would call it, in spite of the speech of his honorable friend in which they had hitherto been progressing, but which they could no longer expect them to continue in unless by the mu migration into the colony of free labour Neither could he allow that upon this part of the subject the Government had abandoned its duty He begged attention to the single fact which he visited in the debate upon the motion of the honorable member for Sheffield-that in 1838 ten thousand emigrants were sent from this country alone to New South Wales, which, as the population was at present but about 100000, must evidently produce not only a considerable effect upon the supply of labour, but also in improving the general mass of the inhabitants, by the infusion of persons who might fairly be said to be persons, generally speaking, of industrious and moral habits So deeply impressed were the Government with the advantage of it, that they had result ed to continue a system of each gillian upon the same scale, and there would emigrate this year also, under the auspices of the Government, ten thousand per sons (Mr (Butler- I " At whose expense' ') Undoubtedly, at the expense of the Colony If this Colony were to define honour and benefits, seen in a financial point of view, from the it circumstance, it was only just that it should have the expense His honorable friend had accused the Gncrnni not with having invaded the 1 said fund, and applied it to other purposes than that for which it was intended He believed he had got" so far as to charge the Government with a breach of faith in raising Molatcd then pledge-at what time made, however, his honorable friend did not sir that under all circumstances, whatever might be demanded for the protection in the same (lines, for religious wish notion and other objects they would keep the proceeds of that fund solely applicable to the purposes of emigration He (Mr l^ilnueheie) denied that the Government had pledged itself, or that it would be judicious to pledge itself, come what might, to apply those funds denied from a source which of course would he always available, wholly or in part, to the purposes of emigration It was quite evident, from the address of Sir George Gipps, that at this moment the finances of New South Wales were not in a satisfactory condition, that there was an excess of expenditure over income, which, if allowed to continue, could not but give the Colony in difficulty and distress At the same time his honorable friend, in commenting upon that fact, should have adverted to those temporary cn cumstances which, to a consider able extent, had given it existence Last year had been a year of severe drought so severe that Sir George Gipps had stated, that so far from there having been a demand for labour, labourers were actually st miling idle in the streets of Sydney, lead and willing to lie hired, yet could not find employment, thereby showing how society had been disturbed by that circumstance alone This calamity hit! moreover in another way a direct effect upon the revenue, the price of all contracts were raised immensely, upon which the house was aware how much expenditure depended All provisions find likewise risen in price, and added greatly to the difficulties of the year At the same time, Sir G Gipps, in laying this statement before the Council of New South Wales, ended by saying that he for one was of opinion, that by meeting those difficulties openly and boldly, and by a start, and unflinching system of economy, in every part of the service w ben c economy could be applied, those difficulties would be surmounted and those colonies would continue prosperous. That was an expectation in which he (161 Labouchere) heartily shared He considered it most fortunate for those Colonies that they had presiding over their councils at this moment a person of the courage, ability), and integrity of that gallant officer, by whom, with the assistance of the council, he had no doubt that those difficulties would shortly) be re moved, and those colonies continue to be a source of strength to the empire. The bill before the house I merely provided for the continuance of the temporary government of New South Wales. The w hole subject must necessarily come before them next year He did not think it would be wiser prudent to hold out expectations which it might not upon deliberation be in the power of Government to fulfil, but he fully agreed with his honorable friend, that it was desirable as soon as possible to give a more free form of government to those Colonies, the state of which next year would, he trusted, enable them to submit to the house some measure upon this subject I Mr Ward said, that since he had given notice of his motion upon this subject, he had seen a treasury minute, which instead of appropriating the proceeds of land sales to emigration, distinctly declared that until the difference which existed between the ordinary revenue and the expenditure in New South Wales should be completely covered by the Colonial resources, no further portion or those proceeds should be employed in emigration The right honorable gentleman had not pushed that part of the question to its full extent He stated that 10,000 emigrants had gone out last year to New South Wales, and thntasinuhu number would go out this year under the auspices of the Government But how was that to be reconciled with this Treasury minute, and the different appropriation of the land fund for which the right honorable gentlemen claimed credit He said it was to be done out of the Colonial resources But he had shown that in those resources there was a great deficit That being the case, he (Mr Ward) did not see how it was to be done without the interposition of Paliament He hoped the light honorable gentleman he would be able to inform them out of what funds that ensign which was to be carried on. He had told them that the report of the dans, port ition committee of last year was now about to be acted upon that the number of convicts to be sent out was naturally diminished, and they, were henceforth to be provided for in Norfolk Island the papuaiUoii lil New South Wales' must prevent the resisting of the revenue and expenditure becoming equal Such a contradictory statement as that could only produce results which he was sure the right honourable gentleman the Under Secretary for the Colonies would be the first to deplore He implored of his light honour able friend not to encourage aspect of jobbing and 1 nish expenditure in the Colony, by throwing the whole proceeds of I and sales into a revenue over which they had no control li he did so he might depend upon seeing its the result, the employment of a number of unnecessary officers, the building of new streets, and a lavish outlay for such purposes, which, while it might create a temporary popularity would have the effect of retarding the permanent government of the Colony itself He contended that it was unf nr to deduct from the amount of land sales the expenses of the system of Colonial Police The necessity for that force entirely arose from our sending so many convicts into New South Wales, and he did not think the Colon) should be charged with the expense of its maintenance He hoped the noble lord, acting on the principle of this bill would see the necessity of infusing as large a portion as he could of pure blood into a body constituted like the paper lation of New South Wales Lord Howick vindicated the application, in part of the land fund to the support of the" police force No doubt, the necessity for that force arose, us had been observed by the honorable member for Shelhcld,fiom the number of cons lets sent into New South Wales, but as convict labour had been mainly the cause of its prosperity, the Colony could not object to defray the expense of those establishments which were absolutely necessary to maintain public tranquillity The bill was then read a third time On the question that the bill do pass Mr C Bullet inquired whether the words "and of juries, which had been inserted in committee, in the tenth line, after " the constitution of courts of law and equity" had been introduced for the purpose of enabling the Governor in Council to exclude cinancipiitists from june 3 If so, he should oppose the passing of the bill No doubt the effect of the clause was merely permissive, but still it was highly objectionable to give the Governor the power of altering in this way the whole constitution of juries. Mr Labouchere assured his honorable and learned f i tend that the words had been introduced, not with the stew he deprecated, but merely for the purpose of enabling the Governor in Council to make such regulations as he thought fit with regard to courts of judicature and everything belonging thereto The bill then passed
