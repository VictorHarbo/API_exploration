COMMERCIAL. WEEKLY EPITOME. Advertiser and Chronicle Offices, Saturday evening, January 12. The week has been very quiet, and merchants have been holding back in expectation of the mail, -which arrived very punctually on Thursday morning. The arrival of the English mail was eagerly anticipated by parties interested in the bread stuffs trade, and as the advice3 speak of higher rates and continued fii*mness in the market, we may fairly calculate upon a good trade. IVeinost earnestly advise farmers to send a portion of their wheat to market, as by selling part of their crop at 4s., they will secure good prices for the remainder. If this course is not pursued we shall lose the export trade, and prices will fall rapidly as the season advances. The difficulty is to get money for purchases, and this difficulty has been magnified by false reports about the Banks. It has been rumored that a meeting of all the BankManagers has been held, at which it was •determined to make no advances whatever upon ■shipments of wheat for Eugland, but v/e can give the statement a flat contradiction. The only transactions of any consequence in the share market have been in Lyndocli Yalley, Paramatta, Euko, and Adelaide Banks, and Poona. Paramatta, 32s. to 36s.; Euko, 3Ds. to •39s. ; Poona, 20s.; Lyndocli Valley, £3 2s. 6d. to £312s. (id.; Adelaide Bank, £3. There was an average attendance at the Government Land Sale on Thursday. The amount realised was £2,404, being an average of £15s. per acre.

Stock Market.—The following is Dean, Laughton, & Co.'s fortnightly stock market report, dated Adelaide, January 3, 1867.—Fat Cattle—Supplies have been moderate, and | chiefly of fair and good qualities. Owing to the holidays business has been slack, though j still equal to the • light supplies brought forward, which met ready sale at" fully " late prices. - Stocks in the hands of the trade are light, both in town and in the country, and unless some extraordinary snpplies come to hand, prices must rule high in this market. We have sold 95 head cattle, middlingto good, from Menindie, at £8 5s. 6d.; 95 do. do., good quality, for Mr. C. B. Fisher, £10 6s. ! Gd.; 11 do. do., middling to good,, heavy weights, £10 14s. 6d.; 15 do. do., at £7 9s.

Fat Sheep—Supplies were not j so heavy as of late; we have, how-1 ever, no improvement to report in the quality of those brought forward, which were generally of an inferior description. These I are only in demand at low prices, and from the I fact of there being no prime sheep in. We quote I prices Is. a head lower this fortnight:—Best wethers, lis. 6d. to 13s.; second do., 10s to lis. We have sold 1,901 at quotations. Fat Lambs still arrive in good supply, though we notice a falling off in the quality of those brought for ward :—Best lambs sell at 8s.; others, 7s. to 7s. 6d. Fat Calves are in good demand, very few are, however, offering. Store Cattle.— There is considerable demand for good sound cattle suitable for fattening; there are but Very few, however, offering. Horses.—This market has been completely bare during j the last fortnight, and we hear of but- few mobs to arrive within the next week or two ; this, together with the lower prices of fodder, will, we anticipate, have a favorable effect on I prices. Farming horses, of a good stamp, un broken, sell best, and are in good demand. Store j Sheep—The demand for all kinds of store slieep ' is still very limited. We have sold 1,600 mixed lambs at 6s. 6d.; 1,880 aged ewes, lambs at foot. Stations—Nothing doing. Latest Melbourne Quotations—Best bullocks, £7 to £9; middling and inferior do., £4 10s. to £7 10s. ; best cows, £610s. to £7 10s.; middling and inferior do.,£4 to £6; prime wethers, shorn, lis. 6d. to 12s. 6d.; good do., 9s. to 10s. (3d. Labor Market.—Mr. W. R; Hunt reports that the labor market opened this week in a I very dull way, but towards the end it has im proved to a moderate extent. Numbers of able-bodied agricultural laborers, shepherds (married and single), and other hands are daily in attendance in search of work, which they are willing to accept at the reduced rates of wages (owing to the small prices obtainable for pro duce) now prevailing. Mr. Morcom says—The labor market this Aveek continues brisk, several j people having been hired for farms, sheep staticns, kitchen-gardens, &c.; A few of the immigrants per Canterbury are open for engage- J ment. An adjourned meeting of the creditors pf Messrs. Youngbusband, Jun., & Co. was held on Friday, January 11, at their offices. It was resolved that the estate should be assigned, and that Messrs.
