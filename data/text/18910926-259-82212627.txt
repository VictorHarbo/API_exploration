Morchead's opinions as we know they carry no weight, and on this occas ion we are ndt severely wounded by his boyish bluster, as no doubt our unswearing adherance to well defined principles is not palatable to the present school of politicians. But we do feel for those of our brother pressman who have trotted around after the gentle Boyd in all his perploxingly crooked meanderings. And now to bo classed as scoundrels 1 " This is the moBt unkindest cut of all." THE KEV. E. Griffith, father of Sir S. W. Griffith, died on Tuesday evening, after an illness of several weeks.

THESE HAVE been weddings in balloons, yachts, and store windows, and Milford Centre, a small Ameiican town, lays claim to the first lawn tennis wedding ever solemnised in the country. Both parues are champion tennis players. One day 200 guests gathered on the Bpacious lawn of the beautiful country place of the father of tho bridegroom. The bride and bridegroom were dressed in jaunty tennis cos- < tumes, as were the bridesmaids and groomsmen. The four finally engaged in an eiciting match. Bight in the middle of it the minister walked out to the lawn of the tennis court and raised his hand.

THE Japan Mail translates the following wonderful snake stoiy from the 17th Kokkai: A Takio called Nomura Tahiclii, 60 years of age, went out with his wife Otora, who was 46,' to pursue his usual avocation of tree cutting in Eoshitamura, province of Tainba. Tho hus. band and wife separated at a place called Matsu-Yama. Shortly afterwards, while en gaged in felling a tree, Tahiohi thought he heard his wife cry out. Running to the place, he was horrified to find that a huge snake, des cribed as being 8 feet in circumference, had Otora's head in its mouth, and was engaged in swallowing her, despite ber struggles. Tahiohi raa off to the hamlet and summoned seven or eight of hiB neighbors, who, when they reached the scene of the catastrophe, found that the snake had swallowed the woman as far as her feet, and was slowly making its way to its hole. They'Wire too much terrified to touch it, and it finally effected its escape unmolested. Mn. M. J. ABUWOBTH, of S. Brisbane, says:-I have great pleasure in writing to inform you what hae been the result of using St. Andrew's Liniment. Some years ago I got a severe wetting, which brought on a bad cold and rhenmatio pains. These have increased as I have grown older, until at times they have, been almoBt unbearable. Wo have spent pounds on doctors and medioines, but with no beneficial resnlt. About three weeks ago, I had a worse attack than ever; my sufferings were very severe. I was confined to my bed, oould not sleep or rest, and was almost afraid to move. Mr. Ashworth brought a bottle of St. Andrew's Liniment, which he said would do mo good. He applied it according to directions, and I Boon got relief, and slept well that night. I have continued lo improve over since, and seldom, or ever feel any pain. I have only used one bottle and commenced a second. 1 strongly resommendit to any oneÂ«uffering from rheumatio pains.. If they will follow the in structions carefully, they are certain to get relief.. Eorinrthor particulars apply to Dev.' Jas. Stewart, New Harm, Brisbane, or John R. P. Adams, 142 Queen street, Brisbane. [ADVT.] A FEW days ago (says the Warren Ilcrald) they were shooting and yarding pigs on Warn biana, when a regular old tusker charged back from the entrance to the yards right at a young ster, about ten years of age, who had incaut iously dismounted and hung his horse up. The boy boeame so frightoned and confused at seeing tho pig bearing down on him that ho did not know which way to turn, andtbeanimal kept on and went straight between the little fellow's legs, and actually took the boy off on its back. The youngster when ho found him self on this novel steed instinctively hung on, and the pig started off across the plain as hard aB bo could lick. Up to this point most of the spectators had been too startled to interfere but when tho boar began to leave, Mr. lloland Todhuntcr gathered up his reins, and sailing after the pig and hiB unwilling captive, soon ranged alongside, and now came the oritical moment. The boy wouldn't let go, and it was a most hazardous resourco to shoot. However, Mr. Todhunter never hesitated much, but tak ing aim with his ride, while still galloping, he, with marvellous norve and prooision, fired, and tho bullet, thus truly aimed, smashed tho shoulder of the animal, and from thence pene trated the heart, and the highly satisfactory result was a dead pig and alivo boy, whereas it requires very little imagination to understand how easily those positions might havo been reversed. Whore tbo bullet struck tho pig was no moro than three inolics from the little rider's log.
