Bread- j stuffs are ogafn lower, tho continued arrivals, 1 soma unexpected, and tbo intelligence of further : ihipmcntB from England, having caused an un- ' easy feeling in the market. Best brands of Adelaide are purchaseable at from L22 to L23. ' 10$, and Tasmanlan at L20 to L20 10s. IVhoht ' has been sold at 0s; kerosene oil, Cozzens' brand, has been placod at 4s 8d ; currants have brought 4d; rice has. changed hands at, L21.
