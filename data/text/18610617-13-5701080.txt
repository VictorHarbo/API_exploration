, MELBOURNE WBOLESALE] JPRIÖJSS CURRENT.. . - tv. ' ' The Argus Offico, Saturday Evening. - ' Business generally throughout the week has con- tinued In such a state of utter inactivity that our re« j ort of prices is neceiiarlly almost a repetition of that if last week. Spéculation seems to hr.vo entirely died cut. Bales, aro made in such «mall quantities that, illbough stocks of gooda aro indisputably becoming-, i maller, tbere is no corresponding increase la their i BIUOB ; and. In the absence of any Increase of popula- tion by Immigration, and an over number of traders of nil classes existing, It is d'fOcult to see whence any do , elded improvement can arise, so long as this Btate of i matters continues. Tbo resumption ot Immigration may do something towards reviving tho foeilnfr of tbo market. With a fixed population, as that of Vlo lorla has been for some month« past, trade lsnatnrally brought to its bearings-, there bclrg no Inducement! cf profit to the capitalist to «pceuilnto on merchandize. Ale in bulk bas rather declined lu value during the week. Decreased consumption In tho winter months naturally lessens demand, and usually roduces prices, and when holders are desirous of selling lower ratos have to be submitted to. Snloa of Bass's (new brow- ing) have beon mado at £8 16a, and other brands at r-roportlonato rates, Draught porter is, as usual at this season, In very limited consumption, but prices are Bteady at qootod rates. Bottled ale is also in lctsoned Inquiry, and easier In price. Stout, in bottle, i (mains in good demand; tbo system now much t doptcd by retailers of selling from tho bottle, instead i f drawing from the hogshead, has much enhanced the consumption of bottled porter, and conse- quently sustains its price. Butter contupes much as last reported, with, if? anything, a ra'hor I otter feeling ; and as colonial supplies fall off during the -winter months, and shipments havo not boen ox ceesive from the home markets, a moderate advauoa i n present rates may probably ensue. Holders ara moro finn, but wo boar of no sales of Cork butter ovor led. por lb. Candles aro oasler In prlcos. Oonslderahlo prices o! Bllghtly damaged sort» havo been placed by auc- tion during the weok, nt.d tended alike to check tho de- mand ter and reduce the price of sound descriptions. Eales ot Bolmonts have been made at from 16}d. to Kid. per lb. The agents lor the Nova Stearine Com- pany quoto their prices at 17id , and composites at lid. to 12d. per lb. Flour stands at hut woek's quo- tations, hut transactions havo been limited, Tho rates i nling In America will prevent shtpmonts to any extont'l ire ra that quarter; but our own supply Is considerable, and any quantity that may bo needed can bo readily Boppllcd from the ample BtockB ol South Australia and Tasmania. Wheat Is dull, not much ofToring, but no anxiety to purebsso Is evinced, and prices romain ai last quoted. Oats are in steady requisition, stooks are, however, although reducing, still large, and tho" »mplo supplies coming to hand from Tasmania chock i ny materi»! advance la prices. Unit is dull, taloa aro not, bowovor, prossod, and the prlco of English Is supported at 12s. 8d. to lus. Gd. per bushel. But little bus been dono In toss, prices, owing to tho firmness ot importers, aro steady, and with management will bo suitalned, as any attempt to force soles would In all grobablllty considerably roduco present quotations, tocha of coffee are working down, and with .hosea- son of greatest consumption sot in, and prospect of light supplies coming, certainly no decline In pro-i Bint prices can he looked for. Sugars continue in limited supply, and small stocks in second bends have compollcd tho trade to submit to further advanced ratoB. A small portion of the Jeanie Oswald's cargo, from Mauritius, about 800 bags, sold by auction, realized an advance of about 40s. per ton on good grocery sorts, and about 20s per ton on crystals, on previous rates. Three vessels with cargeos of Manilla Bugar, for, wo believe, the Victoria Sugar Company, havo arrived during tho lost fow days, vhicb will doubtless bo shoitly In tho market, and, by. lupplying tho demand, tend to esso prcsont rate«. Tticois unaltored In prices, and no Bales of any amount have occurred. In oilmen's stores there Is no change to report. Oonslderahlo quantities havo found buyers 'by auction, at about current market price«, but 1 ave not lutorteroi much with prlvato Bales. The ) rovislon markot keeps stoad}. Bacon of primo qua I ty is but moderately supplied, and In fuir roqucat. Hores aro firm in pr'ce, although inquiry bas been but 1 mlted. Obecto of really good quality linds ready i nie at well-supported prices. IICSB pork has declined In valuo, and cannot be quoted at abovo £4 6a. to £4 7s 6d. por barrol. Salt being almost monopollsod, ?e ontlnucs, in tho absence of arrivals, to find buyers at nott cxcesslvo ratos. £1010s. per ton Is tho prlco do innndcd for Liverpool coario, and a trifling reduction < n that rate for fine. By auction during tbo wook do iiinRcd coarse brought Í7 7s. Od., and fino £7 12s. 01. fir ton for ooah There Is no altération to report In i he market for spirits. Genova appears to bo stoadily. Ircreasing in consumption- of course to tho detri- ment of other descriptions Tho heavy imports of iLii spirit havo rapidly passed Into consumption, and d> rrandcontlnuinfr,pricosofmost preferred brands havo advanced to 10s ed. to 17s per case, in bond. Brandy, despite of errors and mistakes in Stables' tsblos and tended BtockB, remains vory much as It wa;, and i rices havo undorgone but Httlo variation ; as wa J tvo previously remarked, tbore 1» no disposition for sj-cculation. Did any exist, tho dleciepancies latoly n ade manifest would surely havo brought it out in Ibis article. Bum, whiskey, and old tom aro in but limited Inquiry, and unchanged In vnluo. Timber is improving in Inquiry and advancing Blightly In value. The extensive stock of tho lato firm of E. Westby sud Co. (comprising nearly all liotctlptionB of timber) found ready talc and full market prices. Tobacco has fur- ther declined In valuo. Large as the consumption ol this nrtlclo is, the imports havo been so OXCCBSIVO that to effect sales lower rates havo necessarily boon sub- mitted to, and until stocks work down no Improve, ruent In prices tan ho reasonably expected. Wines continuo in vory limited demand, light descriptions are, ofcourio, at this soasonoftho yoarin but little ii quest, and tho only sales making aro good medium fer ta and shorrios In very limited quantities.
