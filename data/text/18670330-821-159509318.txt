COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. MONTHLY COMMERCIAL SUMMARY FOR ENGLAND. Register Office, Thursday Evening, March. 2S, 18G7. We have still to report a constant demand tor wheat, the price of which has remained unchanged during the past month. Some very heavy lots have changed hands, and still every parcel that has offered has been eagerly purchased both for export and by speculators. A very large quantity has been bought by our millers, who are now heavy holders, and there seems little 2>rospect of any decline in price taking place, lluring the last week or ten days there has been very little offering, and for the present a slight advance on the month's rates has been obtained. The demand for flour has been anything but large, but a few hundred tons have changed hands at quoted rates. The following vessels have sailed for England during the month, viz. : —; The Peeress, with 8,966 bags of wheat; the Jessie Isabel, with 7,0S1 bags of wheat ; the Marmora, with 2,300 quarters of wheat; the Cecilie, with 3,540 bags of wheat; the Duke of Sutherland, with 53S quarters, 1,341 hags, and 44 tanks of wheat; the Prince of Wales, with 60 tanks and 1,833 quarters of wheat; the Canterbury, with 71 tanks, 17 casks, and *20S bags of wheat, 755 barrels and 750 bags flour ; the Anne Laity Banlield, with 7,184 bags of wheat and 1,895 bags flour; and the Alpha, with 7,228 bags and 2 puncheons or wheat, 300 bags and 140 barrels of flour, all for London. For Liverpool—The Harvest Home, with 5,4S1 bags of wheat; the Triton, with 4,626 bags of wheat ; the Atlas, with 6,795 bags of wheat; and the Danish Beauty, with 4,4S9 bags of wheat. The following vessels have also sailed :— For the (.'ape and Port Elizabeth, the Orixa, with 4,443 bags of wheat and 550 bags of flour ; the Jane Bell, with 2,720 bags of flour; the Clanalpine, with 1,676 bags <>f wheat and 2,6S0 bags flour; and the Miltiades, with 1,649 bags of wheat and 2,500 bags of flour ; the Sarah, for Mauritius, with 100 tons flour; and the Alexandra, for Guam, with 3,777 bags of wheat. The vessels loading for England are, the Crest of the Wave, 776 tons ; the James Longton, 318 tons ; the Adelaide Baker, 810 tons ; the Anglia, 526 tons ; the Affghan, 620 tons ; the Esmok, S54 tons ; the Ar<l beg, 925 tons ; the Zillah, 342 tons ; the Edin burgh, 698 tons ; and the Sirene, 355 tons. Fi.oirn.—The prices have been maintained, but not much business has been done. The millers have been shipping largely to Sydney and Queensland. Stocks therefore are not heavy. The last sales reported are, town brands, £10 5s. to £11 per ton, and country, at £9 7s. Cd. to £10 per ton. Wheat.—The standing price during the whole month has been 4s. OJil. per hash el. Occasionally sales of large parcels have been made at 4s. 2d. to 4s. 3d. ]>er bushel, but these have lieen the exceptions to the rulo. There are at present buyers at 4s. Id. per bushel, hut very little is coming forward. The following table gives the exports of 1 \ flour and ■wheat from tlie let January to> the " 23rd March, 1867 From Port Adelai*;. j*1™'- k^w?'

The quantity exported iu 1SG6 for a similar period was 11,G72 tons; do. in 1865, 22,110 tons ; do. in 18G4, 32,438 tons. j Bean.—Nothing whatever has been done for export, but it is surprising what an ex tensive trade has been transacted for home consumption. The price has iu consequence improved, and it i3 worth at present 10J. to lid. per bushel. Oats asd Barley.—These articles are much neglected, and no wholesale trade is doing. Prices are unaltered. There has ' been an enquiry lately for English barley, | and some small sales are reported. Farm and Dairy Produce.—There has been a continuous demand for almost all j descriptions. This will continue until the rains set in, when lower rates may be looked for. Copper.—There are no sales to report. Buyers do not come forward. The rates asked by the .Smelting Companies are about £78 to £80 par ton. GENERAL MERCHANDISE. We have to report the following arrivals since out last Summary of the 20th ultimo, viz. :—The Esmok and Harwich, from Lon don ; Hopeful, from Glasgow; Charles Tottie, from Gottenburg; and Shakespeare, from HolmsumL The two latter vessels have since left for Melbourne. There is not the slightest symptom of improvement in tli9 import trade ; in fact, since the arrival of tlie January mail business generally has been characterized by extreme depression. Im ports, on the whole, have been light, and a i few articles have in consequence advanced iu price. We have no doubt a better tone will j ere long manifest itself. Ale and Porter.— Of bulk ale there is ! none in the market. Marian's has been sold j to arrive at £8. Of bulk stout, a few hhds. of Taylor Walker's and Whitbread's (old ] brew) remain ; but the quality is very ques tionable, and holders are willing to quit at a i low price. For bottled the demand has been j moderate, and prices have been fairly main tained. Boots and Shoes.—The past month's j transactions have been limited, but as the | winter is fast approaching a better demand is anticipated. Men's goods are in request, and are a little more saleable; but stocks are ! sufficient for present wants. Building Materials.—Stocks for the i present are ample, and only a moderate demand exists, the building trade not being j over brisk at present. We have had two arrivals from the Baltic, viz., the Charles : Tottie and Shakspeare ; but they have since j left for Melbourne. As under we quote a few lots of timber sold by auction during the month :—Messrs. Townsend, Botting, & Kay sold the cargo of the Camilla—3 x 2, at 13s. 3d. per 100 feet; 4 x 2, at 13s. 3d. do.; 5 x 2, at 13s. do.; 0 x 2, at 14s. 2d do.; 4 x 3, at 14s. 3d do.; 5 x 3, 0 x 3, 8 x 3, and 4 x 4, at 14s. Sd. do.; also, box palings, 5-feet, 14s. 3d. and 15s. Id.; do. 6-feet, 21s.; laths, 3-feet j and 3-feet 6-iuches, 14s. 7d- to 15s. per 100. Messrs. Parr & Luxmoore sold the cargo of the Lookout:—Logs of prime Richmond River cedar at prices averaging from 22s. 6<L , to 29s. 6d.; heavy box palings, 5-feet, 12s. 6<L per 100; G-feet, 17s. 3d. per 100 ; shingles, 7s. Gd. per 1,000, Oregon deals, , 3gd. per foot. Candles.—But few transactions have been made; the present high prices prevent a more extensive business. Stocks on hand are very low, and we have no doubt present rates will be upheld for some time to come. Coals.—N.S.W. are in good supply, and prices for cargoes afloat may be quoted at from 22s. to 24s. per ton. English coke has been placed at £6 per ton, delivered in town. Coffee.—A fair amount of business has been got through in this import. Ceylon plantation moves off in trade parcels at from 10}d. to 10|d. for fair samples, and lid. has been obtained for choice lots. Native is dull at our list price, but for Java and Manila there is no demand. Cornsacks, &c.;—There is scarcely any thing doing. The shipments advised are not very heavy, notwithstanding which there is not the slightest inclination to enter into anything like a speculative purchase. Wool packs—A few bales have been placed at 3s. 9d. The bulk of the stock is in a few hands. Branbags remain very inactivq, and prices are about the same as last mouth. Chemicals.—The market continues very quiet. Soda crystals sell at about £9. Blue stone—The season being now on we may expect a good deniand shortly. For tartaric acid and soda carbonate there is no demand, and with other chemicals the market is moderately supplied. Drapery and Soft Goods.—In these imports trade for the month has been quiet, and the demand for goods limited. The market is full of most classes of drapery, but flannels and blankets are scarce. Cotton goods generally have somewhat declined in price. Dried Fruits are in better demand. Currants in parcels have found ready pur chasers at from 4tL to 4Jd., and stocks arc not very heavy. Eleme raisins, of good quality, are wanted, and we believe a small parcel has just arrived by the Harwich, which will meet a fair market. Figs and prunes are dull of sale. Muscatel raisins are somewhat slow of sale, and there are no Cape in the market. Hops and Malt.—From the advices per last mail it was expected that hops would advance in price, but such lias not been the fact. Sales have been limited to mere retail parcels. lS65's are valued at about Is. 10d., and 66's at from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 4d. for prime samples. In malt there has not been much business since our last report. Only one parcel of about 2,000 bushels changed hands at lis. Gd. The bulk of this article is now in the hands of one holder. Metals.—The numerous articles coming under-this heading continue as dull as last month. The stocks are far above our require ments, particularly hi galvanized iron, with which our market is completely glutted. Oilmen's Stores.-—A few lines have been iu request, and stocks have become much reduced, hut the trade do not operate to any extent. Wliybrow's pint oils are worth about lis. Gd. ; half pints, 6s. 10d. to 7s. ; while quarts are valued at about 21s. per dozen. Colman's No. 1 starch, 43<1\. to 4}d. ; pint pickles, 7s. 2d. Bottled fruits are quite neglected. Oils.—Kerosine has not moved off so briskly as was expected, altbough sales have been moderately active, 3s. Gd. being about the market value. Boiled and raw oils— stocks are exceedingly short in importers' hands. Colza is in better request, and prices have somewhat advanced both for bulk and in drums. Tuipcntine continues inactive. Provisions.—A moderate trade has been got through in cheese, salt herrings, and red iu tins. Sound North Wilts can be placed in parcels at Is. 2d. to Is. 2}d., prime Cheshire at from Is. 3d. to Is. 3JdL Hams and bacon —Stocks are still heavy, and prices low and unsatisfactory. Sardines and preserved fish are about tlie same iu value, aud sales mode rate Rice.—The market is better supplied since our last report, chiefly from Melbourne. Clean Java is saleable at £2G ; while screened Patua is worth £25, and unscreened £22 per ton. Carolina is quite unsaleable. Spirits.—Pale U.V.C. in bulk has been selling at 7s. 9<L, and case lias advanced to 23s. G«L, at which figure sales have been .made. Hennessey's battleaxe is scarce, and saleable at 2Ss. llum—The market is well supplied. Whisky in case is in demand. JDKZ geneva is saleable at quotations, but wc have no direct shipments; the neighbour ing colonies supply our present wants. Soap.—But few sales have been made during the month ; £2S 10s. is all that could be obtained for parcels of Steele's, while a shade lower would be taken for other brands. Sugars.—We have had no arrivals from Mauritius this month, and prices have ad vanced considerably for yellows and whites of which the market is almost bare. We anticipate a still further rise. We are advised of a cargo of about 209 tons, ex Edith Smith, which, on arrival, will meet a first-rate market. Annexed is the sale of the Sarah's cargo on the 27th of February, since which prices have risen fully £4 to £5 per ton for yellows and whites. Messrs. Solomon and Co. sold the cargo, of the Sarah, from Mauritius! at the following prices :—Superior light yellow crystal counter, £3S 123. OA good yellow crystal, £38 15s. and £2$ 12s. 6d. ; finest Vrow.i, £27 15s. ; go^iaen. grain yellow cryyel; £35 and £3S 2-y eih ; finest crystal gyjwn lighi counter, ; finest bold COl graiu \^vius£tfsystal, £41 vrfeitc crystal, £4£ fGfal - finest light yeffoW Grystal, £39 5a. ; srrperifjr lire wing crystal, £40 ; finest liglit ditto; £38 5s. and £3% P2fe. fid. sujierior golden odour crystal counter;, £39 ; good medium coun"5er, £29 15s. aud £219 ; superior white crystal, £42 15s. and £42 fOa.; finest light yellow crystal, £39 12s. ©£. ; bright golden crystal counter, £38 12s. fid.

Stocks for the present arc ample. Tea.—Since the sale of the cargo, ex Mel rose, the market has been quiet, and sales have been confined to a few lots of congou, sold (sea damaged) out of the alxive ship, for which first-rate prices were obtained; in fact, in some instances, an advance on the j first sale. Tobacco, &c.;—A fair trade has been got through in Southern twist at our list prices ; while for Northern only a very limited de mand has been experienced. Stocks of the latter are getting reduced. Wises.—Complete inactivity is all that we cau report in most kinds of wine. There is nothing doing either in port or sherry. Exchange.—The Banks, with the excep tion of the Union, sell their drafts on London at 60 days' at A per cent, premium, and pur chase at same date at 1J per cent, discount. The Union Bank sell their drafts at 00 days' at i per cent, premium, and purchase at same date at 1 per cent, discount. Register Office, Thursday Evening, March 28, 1867. Flock.—The market is dull, and prices nominal at £9 15s. to £11 per ton. Wheat is very scarce. Sales are reported at 4s. Old. per bushel. General Merchandise.—Very -little attention has been bestowed on business matters to-day. Home correspondence and the approaching departure of the mail seems to engross all the available time of our merchants and traders. CUSTOMS RECEIPTS.
