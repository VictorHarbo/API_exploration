HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. ? - ? i The first number of the Hawaiian Gazette, dated 21st January last, was received by the Salsette, having travelled to this colony by way of San Francisco, New York, and London. It is a very neatly printed sheet of demy, chiefly filled with official notices, re turns, &c.;, but with a few itemsof news. The Gazette is to be issued weekly from the Government press at Honolulu as the official organ of the Hawaiian Government. Among the new laws of last session which are noti fied in thi6 number of the Gazette, there are four of which it is important that all persons trading with the archipelago in question should take cognisance. The first of these admits coal free of duty. It was assented to on the 31st of December last, and takes effect from that date. The second — taking effect from the same date — re- vives the law which formerly existed against the removal from the kingdom of any native-born Ilawaiians (as sailors, &c.;). The third — assented to on the 30th of December last, and taking effect six months thereafter (just at the present time) — repeals the old duty of five per cent, ad valorem on rice, and imposes, instead, a duty of one cent (one halfpenny) per pound upon rice in the husk, and one cent and a half per pound upon cleaned rice. The fourth Act, which relates to foreign imports in general, was also assented to on the 30th of December last, and was ordered to come in force at various periods, according to the countries from which such imports might be shipped. Fromports on the Pacific coast of North America it was to come in force in three months from the date of its publication ; from ports in Europe and on the Atlantic coast of North America in six months, and from all other ports in one year from the same date. It will not, therefore, apply to shipments from Australian ports until the 2 1st of January, 1866, being twelve months after its publication in the Gazette before us. Under this law all goods sent from ports within the consular jurisdic tion of any Hawaiian Consul or Commercial Agent must he accompanied — 1. By an invoice containing an account of the market value of such goods, and of all charges, exclusive of any 'discounts, bounties or drawbacks, but such as have been actually allowed.' 2. An affidavit (made before the Cofesul or Commercial Agent), of the correctness of this invoice! 3. A certificate from the Consul or Commercial Agent authenticating these ' documents, and declaring his belief that the state- I ments in question are true. On all goods which may be imported without such certificate — coming from any port where it could have been obtained— ^duties are te be levied on an increased valuation (by way of penalty) of twenty-five per cent. A law has also been passed 'To provide for the importation of labourers and for the encouragement of immigration.' It creates ' a bureau in the De partment of the Interior, to be styled the Bureau of Immigration,' which, among other duties, is directed to devise means for the importation of foreign labour ers to supply the wants of planters and others. The labour required, however, we apprehend, is for mere field work, for which, in such a climate, coolies or Chinamen would be best suited. We add a few statistics, taken from the only docu ments of a statistical character published in the Gazette before us — the Appropriation Act, and the returns for the year 1864 of the CoUestor-General of Customs, Appropriations for the Biennial Fiscal period, com mencing 1st April, 1864, and ending March 31st, 1866\. — Civil list, 39,000 dollars ; permanent settle ments (pensions of 6000 dollars per annum to Queen Emma, and of 4000 dollars per annum to Governor Kekuanoa, father of the King), 20,000 dollars ; Fo reign Department, 21,200 dollars ; Interior Depart ment, 221,961 dollars 38 cents ; Finance Department, 96,276 dollars ; War Department, 40,000 dollars ; Department of Public Instruction, 38,000 dollars; Judiciary Department, 74,625 dollars; miscellaneous expenditure, 23,512 dollars 36 cents.
