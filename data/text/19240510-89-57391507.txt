THEIR INTERESTING HISTORY.^ Ships have histories which colour with the hue of romance. Other handiwork of men, buildings, hotels, railroad cars, all of which perform services similar to ships, fail to combine the qualities of usefulness, and adventure. The low rate of steamship values and earnings in the past year or two has had one result in hurrying- to the scrap pile the most un economical vessels, and in promoting the sale of old but still serviceable ships to other nations where-eosts of operations are lower, making new shipB unnecessary. One typical instance, of each kind, rhows why a ship is something more than a prosaic vehicle of trade. The ship in one way or another serves as a focal point where national, commercial, and human npeds meat. As sketched below, tne Minnesota carried with her the ambitions of a railroad wizard and his plan for winning the best of transpacific trade. Although she failed in these two purposes, the Minnesota paid back to the nation many times her cost by her contribution to troop transportation and freight car riage during the war. The other ship, the foreignluilt Russia, was a trade, weapon in the hands of Russia against Germany, she made her large contribu tions , to America when the melting pot theory was still popular, had a touch of Bolshevik control, of German prisoners on board, and finally goes now to Japanese owners. How much more interest would attach to the to the Woolworth building if it could claim such a colourful record of adventure. The Minnesota. Holder of the title of the world's larg est cargo. carrier since 1005, the Minnesota is finally being dismantled in a German yard for the scrap value \\-l her metal. While her career shows a fairly steady train of unfortunate or unsuccessful events, she more than 'justified her con struction by the work she did during the war. James J. Hill, bead of the Great Northern Railroad, built her and the Dokota in an Atlantic yard constructed especially to fill this one contract. They were to extend the freight lines of the Hill railroad system across the Pacific, as the Canadian Pacific was successfully do ing. Their tremendous deadweight capacity of 28,000 tons, and the passenger accommodations for nearly 3,000 was off set by a slow speed of only 14 knots. The Dakota was wrecked near Japan. The Minnesota in- 1911 broke both propellers 1,700 miles from Yokohama, but her engi neers contrived to repair one sufficiently well to let her crawl back to Japan under her own power. In 1915 she stranded in Japan's inland sea and had to be re leased by dynamiting. In 1016, the In ternational Mercantile Marine Company bought her for Atlantic work. She was successful in the days of high freights, and especially after the United States entered the war, and she. began to carry large numbers of troops in her roomy quarters. After the war, she was success ful at first in the steerage trade but immi gration restrictions removed the best pros pects from that- service, and she was too slow and expensive to be economical. A few snonths ago, German shipbreakers bought Her. En route she stranded on the Dutch coast, but was quickly re leased. She had an interesting if not particularly successful career. The Russia. The Russia was built in the United KTiigdom in 1908, with 8,000 tons and 16 knot speed. The Russian-American line wanted to run her between. Libau and New York in competition for the Russian emigrant trade with German ships. She was fairly successful despite the strong German competition. One assertion is that her agents advertised 'travel by our Russian steamer, and do not be forced to take a bath.' She spent more than six months of 1911 resting on a rock near Libau, as salvage proved a long job but was successfully and creditably performed. Her repairs ran up close to 300,000 dollars. She slipped past the Germans in the Bal tic dunng the first days of August, 1914, and was at Cronstadt, Russia, during the war. After the Czar's overthrow, she was renamed Roosija, in response to the awakened national spirit. Great Britain took her after the armistice to carry prisoners of war to and from Germany and in 1919 returned her to the East Asiatic Company, Copenhagen,* her real owner from the beginning. In charge of this experienced Danish firm, she ran first to South America, where, on one tiin. she was badly damaged by fire in the River Plate. She was laid up for some months, and then came out in May, 1921, to run as the Latvia between Danzig and New York. American immigration restrictions cut into the trade, but she did fairly well, for one thing bringing back to this coun try on one trip, about 1,000 Americans, who had been fighting for Poland. She was laid up in March, 1923, and now has been sold to the Japanese. THE LARGS BAY.
