The Benclbcch was to have been towed out on Thursday, but the state of the weather pre vented her making a start until Friday morning, when the tug was in early attendance, and the ship anchored near the Bell Buoy at 8 o'clock. The Atalante, which left the anchorage on Wednesday, was in consequence of the roughness of the weather driven back during Thursday night, and she anchored away south-west of the station. The Esther, which arrived on Thursday night, is a Hamburg barque of 373 tons, which has brought the first batch of German immi- grants and a general cargo. She hove in sight from Cape Borda on Tuesday night, when the people there took her to be a large ship and telegraphed accordingly; but on nearing the stations on Thursday night her identity was pretty certainly made out, though she was not boarded till Friday morning. The master anchored in an excellent position, and soon after daylight the vessel was visited. Captain Lund reported leaving Hamburg on July 2, and at the start westerly winds prevailed to such an extent that it was the thirteenth day before he reached the Lizard. The course southward was marked by fine weather and light west winds, which took the vessel to the trades. On August 13 she crossed the line in 27° W., and a light breeze supplanted the customary calms and doldrums of that region. Subsequently the south-east trades merged into fresh south-west winds, and on September 1 the captain sighted the Isle of Tristan d'Acunha, and still made favour- able progress till crossing the meridian at the Cape of Good Hope on September 14 in 41° S. Afterwards a higher latitude was reached, but it became too cold for the passengers' comfort, and the master shaped a course to the north- ward, which brought them into a region of milder weather. The dashing breeze continued, and some very good runs were made while crossing the Southern Ocean ; but as usual after crossing the line of Cape Leuwin the wind came ahead, and several days were lost working up for Cape Borda. The Esther was formerly a full-rigged ship, but has been transformed into a barque. She is heavily rigged even now, and having a straight stem, looks something of a ram at a short distance. She has a good character as a fast sailer and a good seaboat. VESSELS SPOKEN.— By the Esther, on August 22, in long. 37° W., lat. 23' S., the ship William Duthie, 40 days out from London, bound to Sydney ; on July 4, in 13° N. lat, 27' W. long., the ship Liverpool, from Newcastle to Singapore, 28 days out ; on August 24, in 28° S., 32° W., the French barque Jean Carrille, from Marseilles, bound to Saigon, 70 days out. When between the Cape and Amsterdam the Esther was over- hauled and passed by a large vessel, which on hailing replied she was bound to Adelaide, but her name and port of departure were not ascertained.
