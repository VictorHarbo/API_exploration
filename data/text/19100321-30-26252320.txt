Ten thousand-of the genuine settlers' class in 1909 were all satisfactorily settled without delay. There are practical ly no unemployed at' the present time, but a huge nnsatisfied demand for agricultural and domestic labour at remunerative wages. Since 1906 New South Wales has assisted 14,009 immigrants, ;the Government guar anteeing work to agriculturists and domes tic servants, and placing them in'satisfac tory employment withinma day of landing. Hundreds of these immigrants made homes on the land, and' are owning freehold, and are now prosperous farmers. All the others are earning about double the wages received in older countries. In the same period 179,594 people arrived in New South Wales and 278;619 jn Australia, from-oveisea."
