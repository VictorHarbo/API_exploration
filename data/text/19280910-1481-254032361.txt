VISIT TO DENMARK. COLONEL LARSEN'S IMPRESSIONS BRISBANE, Saturday.—As the result of Jus trip to Denmark, Colonel Lai sen does not sec much prospect of Danish immigration to Australia. The Dane, lie savs, likes his little bit of freehold, and the conditions required of ihe immigrant coming to Australia and the difficulties of obtaining freehold do not attract him. There are numbers of tine men in Denmark anxious to go abroad, but the bulk of them are going to Canada, where better opportunities are available. The Vfcc-Consul said that his inquiries showed him that Danish produce was as tirmly established as ever on the London market, and he considered tfiat it Mould be difficult for Australia, as a competitor, to replace it. Apart from the natural advantages that Denmark possessed, he said that the co-operative movement, was so strong that only th« first quality was placed in ;; regulated manner upon the market. While he was absent, from Brisbane, Colonel l.arsen visited also Germany, France, Belgium, and Italy. He said ih:ti everywhere ho found people complaining of the hard times, but he did not see much reason for the complaints. Fields and forests looked attractive and farms were clean aud ill good repair. The people seemed happy and contented enough, but they had to work hard.
