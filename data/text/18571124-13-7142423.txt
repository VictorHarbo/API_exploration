COMMERCIAL INTELLIG-ENCE. Argus Office, Monday Evening. une exporc entries pained at the Customs to-day amounted .to' 292 ounces only-25a ounces for shipment in the Blackwall, for Lon- don ; 10} ounces for Liverpool ; and 17 ounce3 for Sydney. To-day has been observed as a holiday at the Government Offices, it being the ii rat anniversary of the proclamation of the New Constitution. The Custom House was kept open for the convenience of the shipping interest There was, however, very little doing. Monday is generally a elaok day in the counting-houses, and to day has not been au exception to this rule. Flour is still very heavy, but confident hopes are entertained that a brisker demand will set in for the supply of the country districts before the South Australian harvest can come into the market. The panic that at present exists in this market appears to be as uncalled for as were the predictions freely indulged in during the last six months, that flour must rise to £60 per ton." At the present time our stocks in the country are not so very much more than sufficient to last until the crops are ready for milling as to cause any uneasiness among legitimate holders. A colony like this should never be without two months' con- sumption, even at harvest time. The present panto is one caused by the fact, that every speculator who rushed into the nour market five months ago, when the value of this article was rising, is now anxious to rush out of it, when the value is apparently falling. Another week will, most probably, give flour a market value instead of a nominal one, as at present. Messrs. W. Easey and Oo. offered the oargo of the Orecian Queen, from Calcutta, by auc- tion to-day. The" prices realised-were-For Calcutta oats, Ss. lid. per bushel ; Patna rica, £1410s. to £15 per ton ; No. 1 Oossipore sugar, £66 to £66 10a. per ton ; Dumma sugar, £42 per ton. The same firm also disposed of Danish oats at £3 10s ; Hayes' Irish blaok oats at 4s. Id. per bushel ; Neva stéarine oan dies at Is, 2id. per lb. The traffic returns of the Melbourne and Hobson's Boy Ballway for the week ending the 19 th November give the number of tickets iSBued at 6,227, and the total receipts at £1,169 Is. Id. The Geelong and Melbourne Ballway returns for the same period give the number of passengers at 8,066, and the revenue from all sources at £87612a. lOd. The weekly OustomB returns for the Port of Geelong are published in the Advertiser. The Customs revenue amounted to £3,84613s. 8d.; pilotage, £7. The imports were of the de» dared value of £21,407, and the exports of £6,014. The deliveries of dutiable goods for consumption were ¡-Brandy. 1,768 galls; mm,816do.; gin, 1,212do.; whiskey, 656do.; cordials, 37 do.; tobacco, 6,782 lbs.: cigars, 427 do. ; tea, 1,640 do. ; coffee, 2,460 do. And the stocks in hand were:-Brandy, 35,690 galls.; rum, 31,183 do.; geneva, 9,935 do.; whiskey, 20,021 do.; cordials, 601 do,; per- fumed, 41 do. ; gin, 15,389 do.; other spirits, 2,162 do.; wine, 6,689 do.; beer, 9,380 do.: tobacco, 213,117 lbs. ; cigars, 2,518 do. ; snuff, 268 do.: tea, 67,454 do.; coffee, .22,016 do, ; sugar, 486 cwts. The prospectus of the National Bank of Australasia has no tv been nearly a week before the public, and we understand that steps are about to be taken to fairly launch the company into corporate existence. The secretary, Mr. Alexander J. Gibb, has re- quested insertion of the following letter, having reference to letters which have already appeared in our columns : To the Editor of the Argus. Sir,-In your issue of tho 19th and 20th inst., there are letters from Mr. Ambroso Kyto and Mr. john Thompson, rospcetively, with reference to the first gentleman's name being unauthorisedly placed in the prospoctus of a hanking project, not yet made public.

The Mauritius news to the 10th October is not of great interest commercially. The co- lonists were complaining, like ourselves, of an inefficient postal service, the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, running between Galla and Port Louis, having met with several mishaps. No change had taken place in the prices of sugars. -. LOCAL MARKETS. Wo subjoin the latest reports of tho provincial mar- kets, as given in the local press.

LABOR MARKET. - There has been little doing in the male department during the past week, owing, no doubt, to the numbers of immigrants lately arrived, the greater portion of whom have been hired at a moderate rate at wages for the harvest season, there- by causing many of the old hands to be seeking work, which, combined with the recent heavy rains, causes an unusual supply of labor for this season of the year. In the female department, although nearly 400 single females have arrived by the ships Jessie Munn and Shalimar within the last two weeks, there seems very little difference in the numbers looking for situations : good house-servants are still scarce. There has been no perceptible change in the rates of wages lately quoted.
