FEWER LANDING PERMITS FOR REFUGEES Australia had stopped issuing landing permits on purely humanitarian grounds, the Minister for Immigration, ' Mr. Calwell, said on Thursday. | In 1946, Mr. Calwell said, about 34,500 persons entered the Common wealth, of whom only 2 per cent, were refugees. , Of these 28,000 were Australians or other British subjects and about 700 were refueees. Of the other 5300 entrants 1,900 yere Americans, 1,430 Dutch, 70 Dan ish, 600 French, 190 Greeks, 60 Nor wegians, 170 Russians, 30 Swedes, 40 Swiss, 30 Belgians, and 100 Yugo slavs. Mr. Calwell said that Australia, in common with other British Domin ions, had been asked to admit some of the thousands of refugees and displac ed persons in Europe. Because of the acute housing short age and other factors the Australian Government could not sanction the admission of refugees or displaced persons who had no relatives to look after them on arrival, Mr. Calwell said. A few thousand landing permits were eranted for persons who had relatives already settled in Australia, and who were in a position to maintain them, and provide accommodation. 'The Government feels that it has gone as far as it can reasonably be expected to go, for the present, in granting landing permits to per sons of these classes on purely humanitarian grounds,' he added. 4I1C issue Ul fJClJIIifaS UM ima uwu.v is now closed.
