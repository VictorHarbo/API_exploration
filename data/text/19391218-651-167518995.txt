MIGRATION STRICT IN FUTURE NO MORE ALIEN 'COLONIES'- CANBERRA. Monday. Australia is likely to emerge from the war with a new immigration policy, de signed to protect Australians against the growth of alien communities in their midst, and to admit into the country in any num ber only those people who have shown their willingness to be assimilated into the national life. The Department of the Interior is taking advantage of the decrease in migration— whicn has been reduced by war to a trickle and should cease in the next few months— to take stock of the alien position in Australia. Subsequently the department expects to be able to make important recom mendations to the Government. 'We now have an ideal opportunity to And out how our policy has been working,' said a departmental officer to-day. 'Officers have been warned that, when the war ends, a complete plan, freed from any of the mistakes that may have existed under the old system, must be ready. Migration will be resumed after the 'war, out it may be a different kind of migration from the present system. Spoilt By The War 'Our immigration from British and Northern European countries has van ished, along with the rest,' the offi cial continued. 'We have everything prepared to bring British, Dutch. Dan ish and Swiss to Australia. We ex pected 5000 Britons alone this year but the war knocked that on the head. 'However, at the end of the war we should have prepared for submis sion to the Government a scheme which should provide for all the best features of our present system, and also practical suggestions for the im provement of the alien stock that we shall receive.' t , J «,, A survey now being made will deal with aliens who have been resident in Australia for some time, and will enable officers to say which are the races most easily assimilated, and which are less desirable. ?
