' is believed by many to have been carried on und r a system deserving no better name than bribery i id corruption in its moat demoralising form. At le head of what may be termed this conspiracy < çainat the well-being of Society stands the Honori ile John Robertson with his colleagues-past and i esent. And if they suc- ceed, as they aim at doing in gaining the support of the Civil Service and our I inking Institutions, a ring will be formed more dangi -ous to our material inte- rests than any American JS w York could .urnisb us with. Mr. Jacob himself has n no unmeasured terms condemned thiB Ministry, i ad with what consistency he now becomes a raemb : of it, each of you can judge for yourselves. One result is certain, th. ; hereafter, in or out of office, he (Mr. Jacob) will te expected to follow his newly-chosen leader. It i for you to say if this course of conduct is in act «dance with your views or interests. I To enable you to expreesfc-our opinion publicly, a contested election is indispensable, admitting that under ordinary circumstnees, when a Minister Beeks re-election, this shoulfi not be resorted to. We consider that the present are very exceptional, and that no one willdi puto lie propriety ol thecourse pursued by us in thus adwessiag you, who, bei g tree, independent, i nd swm-ed by higher motives than roads and bridges and Arsenal feelings towards candidates; are prepared to Jeal with political qu -s tions entirely upon their aerits as affecting the public interests. The time allowed for ti 3 election was no doubt limited BO as to prevent yoi from Riving expression to your opinions. But a i w active minde, seeing the hand of the great parlii uentary juggler in this arrangement, have provii sd an antidote; and although pine d under grea disadvantages for want of time, bave nominated fe ; your acceptance a late member of Parliament, wh , in our opinion, can ill be spared from the councils if the country. We therefore solicit you -vote and influence in behalf of MR. DAVID BUI IANAN. Believing that in securir ; his services your local wanls will be well attend d to, and in legislation for the devalopment of oi : resources by a happy and oontented community not at war, but at peace with one another) you wi . have an able advocate and worthy representative Trusting to your pat io am on this momentous occasion to free you fron being participators in anarchy, confusion, and c rruption in the Govern- ment ¿f the country; and specially we call upon our Catholic brethren to sraember that thb head centre of Orangeism is a eadtng member of the Ministry Mr. Jacob has j< ned, and thus identified himself with your most di idly enemy, socially and politically, We rem in, Your iaithMly (Fi : the Committee), 8160 C.
