War Notes. WAR NOTES In 1902 Denmark offered to sell her West Indian islands to the United States. The price asked was £900000. The sale was ratified in America, but was finally rejected by the Danish Upper House. The islands rae not prospering under Danish rule, the population decreasing under bad sanitary conditions. The United States is lending money to the South American Republics ex- tensively since the war began, as since the London market was closed to them they have been obliged to float all their loans in New York. Argentina alone has borrowed £16,000,000 since the war began. Imports into the States from Argentina now amount to over £20,000,000 annually, whilst American goods to the value of over £10,000,000 go to the Latin Republic, as compared with £5,000,000 previous to the war. Archangel is usually frozen up for six months of the year. From the beginning of November to the end of May. This year the frosts have been extraordinarily severe — harbors in the north of Norway, usually ice free, having been frozen up. Archangel is not a very cheerful place to live in. In mid-winter there are only three hours of daylight. In the White Sea and adjacent harbors no less than 100 ships were frozen in during the winter. M. Longuet, a member of the French Chamber of Deputies, gave the following figures, as an approximate of the French casualties since the war began, at the Labour Conference recently held in Bristol, England : — 800,000 dead, 1,400,000 wounded, and 300,000 prisoners. None of the bellligerents save Britain and Germany publish casualty lists. The estimates of Russian losses vary immensely, and it is improbable that even the Russian War Office knows just how many men have been lost. The birthrate of various countries compare as follows : — Russia (44 per thousand), but Roumania and Bulgaria run her close. Following these come Hungary (36.3), Japan (33.), Italy (32.4), Austria (31.30, German Empire (28.3), Commonwealth (28.3), Holland (28.1), Scotland (25.9), England and Wales (23.8), Ireland (23.0), Belgium (22.9), France (19.0). The death rates are not propor- tionate. Russia is the highest (28.9), but France (17.5), is nowhere near the bottom of the table. German is 15.6, England and Wales 13.3. In Australia, Victoria has the lowest birthrate (25.8), and the highest death- (11.1), of all the States. Western Australia has the lowest deathrate (9.3), and her birthrate (29.4) is but little behind Queensland (30.2), and Tasmania (30.0), South Australia has a birthrate of 29.1, and New South Wales one of 28.9, the respective death rates being 10.8 and 10.9. New Zea- land has the very low deathrate of 9.5. The birthrate there is 26.1. The birthrate of France in 1912 was 19 per thousand. The deathrate was 17.5. Even in the first six months of 1914, there were no less tham 17,000 fewer births in France than there were deaths. Since the war began the number of marriages has fallen off greatly. For the last six months of 1914, these totalled only 43,585, as against 122,754 for the last six months of 1913. This is a decrease of no less than 65 per cent.! From April to August last year, there were one-fifth fewer births in the 26 larger German cities than during the same time in 1914\. The British Registrar-General reports that the birthrate in Great Britain for the second quarter of 1915 was the lowest since civil registration was established. Germany has not been drained of her people by emigration to anything like the extent of the United Kingdom. Men and women are not one of Ger- many's principal exports. The yearly departure for the last decade has only once touched 30,000, and averages about 20,000. Practically all these went to the United States. The average emigration from Ireland for many years has been "over 30,000 per annum, and in the sixty years from 1851 to 1909 the island lost no less than 4,154,986 of its inhabitants in this way. The total emigration from the United Kingdom has reached 500,000 a year, and has averaged over 300,000 per year for the last decade. This means that, after making all allowances for immigration into the country, the United Kingdom has lost over 3,000,000 men, women and child- ren during the last ten years. Un- fortunately most of them do not migrate to British colonies, although for the five years previous to the war more than half went to Canada, Aus- tralia, and other parts of the Empire. But 100,000 and very often even 200,000 have been steadily going to the United States. The nominal subscribers for the last French war loan was 15,130,000,000 francs, but, as it was issued at 88, the actual money obtained would be 13,292,400,000 francs. In English money, at the old rate of exchange, this would be £531,700,000. It was present rate it would realise in English money only £474,700,000. It was taken up as follows :— Subscribed in Paris, 9,920,000,000 francs. Subscribed in rest of France, of ,606,000,000 francs. Subscribed in French colonies 1,446,400 francs. Subscribed abroad, 1,000,000,000 francs. The following foreign countries par- ticipated : — England . . . . . . . . . . . . .602,000,000 francs Switzerland . . . . . . . . . . . 80,000,000....."

When in 1889 the Calliope steamed out of Apia Harbor, Samoa, in the face of a hell-fire hurricane while a dozen war vessels of other nations in the harbor were being pounded to wreck- age, she carried eight middies, four of her own and four belonging to the Orlando, flagship on the Australian station. Of these eight, one com- manded the Monmouth when she was sunk in the Coronel fight; one was in charge of the Hogue when she was submarined in the North Sea; one had the Amption (mined) and the Un- daunted, also sunk in the North Sea; a fourth was Admiral Hood, who went down in the Invincible off Jutland; a fifth commanded the Chatham, which blew up the Konigsberg, and the sixth was in charge of the Sydney when she destroyed the Emden.
