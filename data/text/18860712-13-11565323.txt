SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. The attention of the country is now upon the Legislative Assembly, in which is being debated the Irrigation Bill This is certainly the most important measure which has been introduced to Parliament since the reform period of 1878 81, and its provisions affect a larger number of individuals than have been in terested in any act for many years Mr Deakin, who is the Minister in charge, delivered an opening speech of four hours' length No one in the House will declare against irrigation in the abstract, and very few will be bold enough to oppose the scheme submitted by the Government it is a universal subject, and is recognised as such by the leaders of the Opposition, who want to see the measure disposed of as quickly as possible While it is before Parliament the Government are safe, when it is law there may be an opening on some other point for an attack upon them Hence the anxiety of the " out" for a good lighting question I ho debate, so far as it has proceeded, has shown that members are not yet fully acquainted with all the provisions of the bill It is too complex to be easily grasped, and consequently the speeches have had a general rather than an analytic to tone The Attorney-General had an opportunity on Wednesday last of explaining minutely all that is proposed to be done, and when he had laid the bill open, Mr Patterson, who is one of the strong men of the Opposition, spoilt some time in silos ing what he considered to be its blemishes Unlike most persons to ho have given thought to the subject, this hon. gentleman considers that the proposals of the Government are too severe, in so far as they impose allonger obligations on the factors to be benefited than they are likely to be able to beat He would liberalise the measure by going much further than the Government in the matter of absolute state expenditure, upon which the state, and not the persons solved, should pay the interest lines is practically the principal objection developed up to the present, but the second reading debate has only been contributed to by about six members. The bill, as was stated in our last summary, provides for the creation of trusts for irrigation districts, which are to construct works with money borrowed from the Government, and late the farmers for the working expenses and interest The Government will carry out certain undertakings to be called national works, the interest on which is also to be met by local rating, and in some cases they will give free grants to trusts Die cost of schemes already reported to be possible will be about £4,000,000, for which about 3 212 000 acres of land will be imagined In the meantime, the Legislative Council has not had much to do, but one or two useful bills have been under consideration in that chamber, including an Employers Liability Hill Apart from the irrigation debate work in the Assembly has been confined to passing two small bills One was to amend the Drawbacks Act by requiring all persons claiming draw backs of customs duties to submit statutory declarations that they were notdeiiiandiugmoio money than they were entitled to the subject, however, created considerable discussion, and the Government kept the House sitting until 2 o'clock one morning in order to get the bill through committee, and to break down a stone wall which had been raised on the Opposition side The main objection was to increasing the number of oaths required to be taken at the Customs house, but time was wasted in discussing, as a side issue, the action of the Government in destroying six sheep imported from England by Messrs. K Hamel and Co (of which firm Mr Harper, M.L.A., is a member), and landed in defiance of the express instructions of the Government The second bill was to indemnify certain municipal councillors who had failed to liquidate the bank overdrafts of their councils at the termination of the financial year It was pressed for ward because councillor had been proceeded against successfully in the Supreme Court for failure in this respect, and would have passed quickly but for the opposition shown by Mr Munro, who declared that the councillors had offended with their eyes open, and should not be protected Ultimately, however, the Bill went through all its stages The Government bill for the amendment of the Education Act, which was explained by the Minister of Education (Mr Pearson) on June 30, is an important measure, notwithstanding that the rigour of the free, secular, and compulsory principles of the present law has not been relaxed Changes are proposed to make the compulsory provisions for attendance at schools stronger than before, and, with that exception, the three great principles may be said to be absolutely untouched Infants under four years of age will not be admitted to the classes if the bill passes, and the statute school ago will be made to be from six toll) bars instead of from six to 15 years, as at present At the same time pupils will be required to give 40 attendances per quarter instead of 30 as now, so that the same instruction may be given in the shorter as in the longer term of tutelage These chances are calculated to bring about a sav- ing of £16,000 a year, which will enable the state to grant additional exhibitions for scholars The true mt provisions are to be made more stringent, so as to bring as many children as possible into the schools, and, in order that an all round standard of education may be maintained, inspectors of the department of Public Instruction are to have power to examine pris ate Schools, and to examine children returned in the census as receiving instruction in their homes A novel feature is the proposed establishment of day industrial schools to which children whose parents neglect them may be committed by justices on application by t truant officer They will be fed in these schools at the cost of their parents-at about 3s per head per week and will receive free instruction at the expense of the state teachers at present are forbidden to take part actively in religious services many state schools the law is to be relaxed in their favour, so that teachers may conduct services. on Sunday in any school but his own An opportunity has not yet been given for a debate on the bill and public opinion has, therefore, not been expressed upon An election of a representative for the Wellington Province in the Legislative, Council took place on June 30 I here were two candidates, Mr David Ham and Mr T D Wanliss and the contest was a personal rather than a political one Both gentlemen were residents of Bal Hint but while Mr. Ham had been living there constantly Mr Wanliss had only just returned from a long visit to Linton The result was that Mr. Ham ob t mied 2,709 votes, and Mr Wanliss 1,903 Mr C J Jenner, the senior member of the Council has resigned He had represented the South western Province since lines Mr V Robertson, who was member for Polwarth and South Grenville in the Legislative Assembly last Parliament, will be a candidate for the vacancy these are, after all, only by o elections, but they serve to direct attention to the personnel of the Legislative Council In September a number of members of this House will retire by effluxion of time, and it is likely that there will be contests for some, if not most of the seats So far as has been ascertained no opposition has been mentioned to the return of Mr C J Him for the Melbourne province, Mr Meares for the North Yarra Mr Melville for the Southern; Mr Thornley for the Western, Mr Ormond for the South Western Mr Pearson for the Gipps Land, Mr Brown for the North Eastern Mr Story for the Northern and Mr Coutts for the North Western Mr Graham of the South Yarra, will not seek re-election, and Mr Simon Fraser and Mr A D Michie are candidates Mr Buchanan will be opposed by Mr C T Taylor in the South Eastern, Mr Wet tenhall by Mr Bruce Smith in the Nelson Mr Belcher by Mr M Lourzh for, Mr H Gore, of Mr Wanliss, in the Wellington, and Mr Stanbridge probably by Mr J H H. Buscombe in the North Central Mr W Langton, an old and well known constitutionalist who was one of the can dulacca ne the last general election for West Melbourne, petitioned the Legisla- the Assembly UJ, mist the return of Mr J W Peirce, indicted, for that consti- trench., on the ground that by himself or his agents, he had been guilty of illegal "treating" The petition was referred, recourse, to the Elections and Quahfita tions Committee, md the hearing before them lasted several days It was proved that a Mr Jacob Marks, a supporter of the sitting member, had issued over 300 tickets, entitling persons who presented them at certain publichouses in the electorate on the day of the election to drinks Some of the tickets were it was also proved, exchanged for ducks But it was claimed, on behalf of the sitting member, that Marks was his agent before the election The law here relating to elections is much the same as in England, and, dening the hearing, several English authorities and decisions were quoted Ultimately, the committee found, by five votes to seven that Mr. Peirce was duly elected They unanimously agreed, however, that the petition was neither frivolous nor vera tions, so that each party will pay his own costs lliorovenuo returns for the financial year, which closed on June 30, were entirely satisfactory They are published in another column The estimate of the late Treasurer, in his budget delivered in July last was £b,41C,405, and the actual receipts were £131,097 in excess of the amount and £120,044 more than was recorded for the year 1884 5 In many respects this was astonishing, because the season for Australia generally has not been favourable, and stringency rather than business has been the financial state of the other colonies It was also addition ally gratifying because the dubious calculations made by some candidates at the last general election were bolted The Railway department occupies first place as a revenue producer, for the commis- sioners were able to pay into the Treasury £2,30G,790, an excess of £0,700over their estimate, and £100 000 more than was J paid over in 1884 5 The railways of the colony have more than paid the interest on the vast sum, over £22,000,000, bor lowed for their construction The year just closed was the last in which that result was achieved In most of the other departments there have been in provements, particularly in the Customs, and the only substantial falling off has been in the Lands department, where the revenue was £100,000 less than last year, principally on account of arrears of rent owing by selectors, and also due to some extent to recent changes in the land law Absolute security in the matter of French designs upon the New Hebrides has not yet been obtained. The Rev D Macdonald, Presbyterian missionary at the islands, has informed the church authorities in Victoria that the French expedition which recently arrived from a New Caledonia had established a military post at Havannah Harbour Mr Gillies was approached, and has taken action to apprise the Home Government of what has really been done In asking His Excellency the Governor to place himself in communication with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr Gillies remarked that he was at a loss to conceive why a military post should be established by the French in the New Hebrides, but takonincon Loxton with the introduction of settlers by, as he supposes, v vessels of the French Government, the proceeding had all the appearance of being an infringement of the agreement between Great Britain and France He thinks that the Secretary of State when telegraphed to should be asked to insist that an early date may be fixed for the removal of the forces H M S Opal has already left Sydney for the New Hebrides, and other ships of war are, it is said, to follow her SOCIAL AND GENERAL His Excellency the Governor and Lady Loch will leave Melbourne for Adelaide on the 19th mat and spend a fortnight in South Australia as the guests of His Excellency Sir Will Robinson On July 2 His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by the Chief Secretary, the Minister of Lands and a number of members of Parliament went by special train to Pyramid hill, where His Excellency cut the first sod of the" irrigation works proposed to be carried out by the 1 r trowel Plains, Irrigation Trust His Excellency received an enthusiastic erecting on his arrival the ceremony was performed in the presence of a large concourse of persons.

D Macdonald one of the missionaries at Havannah Harbour, a copy of a the French notice, which was served upon him when troops were posted at the French Company s station there It is evident from the tenor of Mr Macdonald's letter that neither he nor the islanders knew anything of outrages on French subjects, and that the French action was regarded as a deliberate taking possession and peopling of the islands. Mr Macdonald writes -" On returning to the harbour on the 5th June, we were surprised to find a large party of 1 French soldiers established in the Caledonian Company 8 property at Sema, or opposite the anchorage Iheyhud been brought there by the French war steamer, the Dives and landed on the 1st of June, us the enclosed copy of a notice which I found awaiting me in my house, from the commander of that vessel, will inform you We understand that the islands are not yet formally annexed to France but this seems to amount to virtually taking possession by the French Gov- eminent The soldiers posted here number considerably over 100, and a similar note has been established at Port bandwn li, Mallicolo Simultaneously with these soldiers a number of immigrants or colonials have arrived from France to he settled under the auspices of the company in this group, and perhaps mainly on the island The presence of these soldiers here makes it necessary for me to remain at my station, as trouble may at any time arise between the soldiers and the natives, or a 1 French man of war may arrive any day from Noumea to proclaim the annexation of the New Hebrides to France thus I am not going to the annual meeting ntl area, for which the Day- spring has just started from the harbour this afternoon The following is the notice referred to. - [Translation "Government Transport, the Dives "Notice Legrand, Lieutenant of Navy, Commander of Government transport, the Dives, " We make known to the residents of all nationalities established in theNewHebrides, by command of the governor of New Caledonia, "A French military posts has been estab- fished at Havannah Harbour, Sandwich Island, Tuesday, June 1st, 1889, at 7 o'clock. in the morning (Signed) "L LFQUAND, " Commander of the Dives ' Put the sugar crushing season has commenced Most of the mills are at work, and there is every prospect of a heavy yield A Royal Gazette recently published sets forth a statement of the assets and liabilities of the colony on the 31st December, 1835 It sets liabilities at £334,359 2s 11d and assets at £76 000 10s. 4d , excess of liabilities £2">7,757 12s 7d 'to the ordinary business eye, this looks very much like hopeless bankruptcy , but the items show it to be merely a cash account statement.

Trade sales of sardines are ranking at late rates, but no large lines have been disposed of Other descriptions of fish have only had moderate attention at current rates. In the breadstuffs market little has been doing. Flour is difficult of sale owing to the falling off in the demand for export, while the trade, being in fair supply, are operating sparingly. Stocks both in the country and locally are increasing Prices also are lower, holders finding it difficult to place parcels For ordinary brands of country-made from £10 10s to £10 15s. IS quoted, according to parcel, while for town made £11 5s. is the nominal quotation. For wheat there has been a moderate inquiry, and few sales of any consequence have been reported. Millers are in fair SUpply), but in the absence of orders, for flour they do not care to purchase freely. Farmers have fair stocks, but they do not show any disposition to sell freely, and arrivals from the country continue to show a falling off, prices, however, owing to the firmness of holders locally, advanced slightly last week, but have again declined For parcels, 5s. 2d is asked, butchers will not give this figure. The total quantity still available for export according to The Austin alman estimate of the crop, is sufficient to meet all requirements The market has been upset by the receipts of American wheat in Sydney, which, however, should not affect this market materially, as the demand is principally for Hour, and the quantity of wheat exported to the adjacent colonies has been small For feeding grains there has not been much inquiry, but holders are very firm, and look for an advance in values before long Fruits have had moderate attention, but no large parcels have changed hands Currants are moving off steadily in trade parcels at up to 5d, duty paid. Raisins have also had moderate attention at late rates Elemes are selling at bid., while for sultanas up to 5d. is obtained Hops have not had much attention, the demand being confined to small parcels for immediate wants. We have only heard of trade sales of Victorian having been quitted at up to 9d. Other descriptions have hardly been noticed. Colonial-made malt is moving off steadily at up to (is , while for best samples of English up to Us. is obtained. In metals there is not much doing, the demand being confined to small parcels for immediate wants. For oats there has not been much in quiry, and few sales of any consequence has been reported. Kerosene is moving off quietly at agents' prices, high-test oils being in most request Oilmen's stores are in good demand, and fair parcels of the different descriptions have changed hands at full prices. Rice has hardly been noticed, only trade sales having been reported at late rates For suit also there is not much inquiry, and no sales of any consequence have been reported. A good demand has been experienced for sugars, but owing to the firmness of holders few sales have been effected. Stocks of all descriptions are light, while there are no shipments from Mauritius, and exports from Queensland are likely to be light for some few weeks, owing to the rain having interfered with crushing operations. Holders, there fore, occupy a strong position, and as the trade generally are in short supply, holders look for some improvement in values. Prices at auction on Tuesday last showed an advance on previous quotations, which has been fully maintained privately. Whites and medium sugars are especially in short supply, and are readily disposed of us they come to hand. The company's sugars are also moving off freely at their quotations. In teas little actual business has been done, but the trade has been busy the last few days in liquoring and sampling the first arrivals of the new crop, which are to be offered at auction on Monday next The total quantity to be offered is considerable. The quality of this season's tea is superior to that of last year, and the cargo just to hand is one of the finest, as well as one of the largest, ever imported into this colony, consisting principally of fine teas. Quotations at present are nominal, but will be determined on Monday. At the timber sales little business has been done, the demand nothavingbeensogoodrecentl). Prices, however, show little alteration. For tobacco there has not been much inquiry, and only trade parcels of the different brands are moving off at current rates. Wines have not had much attention, the demand being of a limited character. For spirits, also, the inquiry has been confined to small parcels for ordinary requirements, and no sales of any importance have been reported.

PUBLIC COMPANIES. The annual meeting of the Colonial Mutual Li le Assurance Company Limited was) held on June 30, at the office, Collins-street west Mr. F. E. Beaver, chairman of the board of directors, presided. There was a large attendance of shareholders. The report stated that during the year 3.691 policies were issued, of which 3,588 were for life assurance, una 103 for endowments, amount- ing in the aggregate to £1,101,030 The increase on annual premium income derived from new policies was £34,920 Is. 4d. The annual income from interest on the total funds of the year was at the rate of 0 SJ percent Claims had matured b) death and otherwise under 1% policies on 185 lives, which, together with bonus additions, amounted to £03,132 2s 3d , a sum which was within the expectation under the tables of mortality used by the society. A branch office had been opened at Natal, and Mr. C. T O'Connor, who had been for many years in the service of the society at the Melbourne and Adelaide offices, had been appointed resident secretary of that branch. The general manager had been sent to Europe to transact business in the United Kingdom. The accumulated funds amounted to £573,247 0s. 5d. The chairman in moving the adoption of the report and balance sheet, congratulated the members upon the thriving condition of the society. He believed that it had a grand future in New Zealand, the Government of which colony had educated the population to assure their lives. The chairman promised that the members would be asked to decide whether the London office should be continued or not li a majority were in favour of closing it, that would be done. The report and balance sheet were then adopted. The retiring directors, Mr. F. E. Beaver, M.L C, and Mr R. W. Dickson, were re elected without opposition, as also were Mr. J. Macdonald and Mr. L C. Wilkinson, the retiring auditors. A meeting of the directors of the Metropolitan Gas Company was held on July 9, at which the question of the proposed purchase of the undertaking of the South Suburban Gas Company was referred to. The negotiations, which have been conducted with this object in view, may now be regarded as having been brought to a successful termination. The Metropolitan Gas Company will pay a certain sum of money to the South Suburban Gas Company, and will take into their service Mr. Woodall, the engineer, who was recently engaged by the latter company in England. This is regarded as a guarantee that, for the future, the supply of gas to the southern suburbs will be in every respect satisfactory. It is only on this condition flint the directors of the South Suburban Gas Company consent to abandon their undertaking Since the company was formed the supply has been much improved, and it has been represented to them that it would be injudicious to incur the heavy expense of the erection of works and the burning down of mains to compete with the Metropolitan Company, which is now prepared to meet all the requirements of the public As far as the directors of the two companies are concerned the negotiations have ended, but the agreement arrived at will have to be submitted to the shareholders, who will shortly be called together.

The market for mining shares has shown continued buoyancy throughout the past fortnight, and the daily transactions have been numerous, though scarcely equalling those of the preceding two weeks. Further large advances have taken place in the Majorca companies, Kong Meng, Napier, and Chalk's all being largely dealt in, and closing higher. The Kingston companies have had little business, and Madame Berry close lower. Hepburn Estate have had a very fluctuating market, but close about opening price. Band and Albion Consols have receded considerably. The Midas Company have reported a first washing of 122 oz. for four machines, and shares have realised good further advance. Little business in the other Midas companies, but Dowling Forest No came into strong request on report of payable wash being struck, and shares have trebled in market value. The Long Tunnel companies firm, but with few shares changing hands. An interesting event in connexion with the Long Tunnel company took place on Wednesday last when the fifth dividend of 5s per share was declared, bringing up the total amount of profits distributed by this company to the large sum of 111,000,600. it is satisfactory to note that on this interesting occasion the directors and shareholders did not forget their employes, large bonuses being voted to the manager and other officers, and a week's wages to the miners, making together the large amount of £1,200. The New Beehive Company, at Maldon, continued its fine yields, and shares have risen again Blupe payment of dividends The adjoining company-, the Great Western Cymru, have struck good stone at the south end of the mine, and shares had a rapid and large rise, though not maintaining extreme advance ; they expect shortly to open on the New Beehive lode In the north end of the mine V iotory (Charters Tovv era) have had limited business at about previous reduced prices. Sandhurst companies have had an irregular market, those having most attention being Collmann and Tacchi, Golden Pyke, the Lazarus companies, New Chum Railway, and the Shenandoah group, for silver-mining, business has been principally in Broken-hill Proprietary, which were freely taken at rising rates till £48 15s. was touched, and close at £12, All advance of £4 10s. for the fortnight As anticipated in our last, this company has declared a first dividend of £1 per share. Their second smelter is now at work, and their out- put of silver is very large, being IS.OlOor.. this week, and Sl,08foz. last week, when the second smelter was only at work 98 hours. Little business in tin companies, and prices without much change. The market for Investment stocks has continued rather dull, and transactions of limited extent, but during the past few days there has been a slight improvement in the demand, and for bank shares better prices have been realised, especially for Commercial, Colonial, and Federal. Metropolitan Gas have also been in request, and readily taken at rising prices, closing at good advance, with few shares offering. Tramway and Omnibus have had fair extent of business at rather lower rates, but close Inn at quotations. Little change in other public companies. The following are the closing bu) ing and selling quotations and prices of sales effected during the fortnight : Dobontures.-Viotortan Government five per cents , due 1894, buyer £100 10s.
