COMMONWEALTH CENSUS. Population Returns. Interesting Comparisons. However much political economists, may differ concerning the value or otherwise ot Malthusian teachings in their application to old and well- populated countries, every thoughtful Australian recognises that the most essential assets of the Commonwealtli are its people, and that they are far too few to permit of patriotic Go vernments viewuig with complacency a possible return to comparatively station ary conditions. John Stuart Mill observed that 'the countries in which, the greatest prudence is manifested in the regulating of population, are often those in which, capital increases least rapidly.' The ex perience of Australia, in common with that of the United States and Canada, estab lishes the conclusion that the growth of . population— provided that the children are properly educated and trained, and that the arrivals from oversea are of the right class— is more than paraUe) by the inciden tal increase of well-distributed material comforts, and a proportional accession of power to impart benefits to the other mem bers of the Empire, and to the rest of the world. —Official State Totals.— The Canadians are disappointed with tleir census returns, and complain ap parently with- good reason-^that they are unite untrustworthy owing to the defective methods employed in collecting the statis tics. Australians had been led to hope tbat their numbers were larger than ' the result proved, but they have full, confidence in the accuracy of the tables which Mr. G H. Knibbs and his able and industrious staff of assistants are preparing. Census bulletin No. 1 has just been issued, and may be studied with profit as showing the reJa tive positions of the States in respect, par ticularly, of their ability to attract and re tain settlers. It also demonstrates that in recent years, in spite of a low birthrate— which happily is attended by the lo-.yest deathrate of any country m the world Australia has made remarkable advance ment in white population. The official totals of the census are as follow:— New South Wales .. . ? : - J'^'Pf Victoria .. .. r* ~- /*- * -- ? l,31o,5oi Queensland .. ~ .. w. ». 60g.S13 South Australia »? -.- ~ ~ 40S-k» Western Australia —. . ~- — ^'\^ Tasmania ?

In this State the males outnumber their sisters b*y 6,158 only, but m Western Australia there are 41,000 more 'lads'' than 'lasses.' The enumeration of full-blooded aborigines, so far as it could be obtained, resulted as follows:— iSew Sonth Wales, 2,012; Victoria, 198; Queens land, S.C87; South Australia, 1,439; Wes tern Australia, 6.369; Tasmania, 3; Nor thern Territory, 1,223; Federal Territory, 10: Commonwealth total, 19,939, of whom 11,385 were males, and S,554 females. » —South Australia's Steady Progress.— Some curious facts are disclosed in the comparative tables for the last three de cennial periods. For example, the progress of South Australia has been more steady and consistent than that of any other State. From 1881 to 1891 the additions to the population were 39,119, or 14.15 per cent.; from 1891 to 1901, 42,813 (13.57 per cent.), and for the last decade, 50,212 (14.01 per cent.). The largest leaps were made by Western Australia— 20,074 (6757 per cent) for the first decade alluded to: 134,342 (269.86 per cent, for the second; and 97,990 (53.22 per cent.) for the third. A striking proof of what Australia owes to her gold fields! The figures for New_ South Wales are perhaps the most gratifying of all, be cause they— like those of South Australia — are connected with solid and permanent agricultural and industrial enterprise. Be tween 1881 and 1891 the population of that state increased by 374,129 (49.90 per cent.), in the following 'decade by 230.892 (20.54), and in the third period by 293,602 (21;67). Victoria's increases are represented by the percentages 32.30, 5.37, and 9.53; Queens land's by 84.39, 26.52, .and 21.62; and Tas mania's 'by 26V76, 17.60, and -10.86. The num ber of whites in the Northern Territory declined from 4.898 in 1S91 to 3,310 this year! Generally, the tables indicate that the present tide of immigration must rise much higher if it is to equal that which distinguished the eighties' decade. — Arrivals and Departures. — In connection with the census, the latest official migration statistics embody some important and agreeable facts. During the month of October, 1911, the white immi grants who landed at Commonwealth ports numbered 12,365, of whom 11,389 were Bri tish subjects. For the ten months, January to October inclusive, the oversea white arrivals were 106,198, compared with 47,64S who took their departure to other lands. This means a clear gain of 58,550 inhabit ants from the outside world. In the corres ponding period of last year there were 71.352 arrivals and 43,728 departures, the gain being 27,624. Of the immigrants for the later ten months 96,738 were British, 993 Austrian, 299 Danish. 256 Dutch, 1,054 French. 1.987 German. 466 Greek, 1.123 Ita lian, S02 Russian, 1.191 Scandinavian, 132 Spanish, 107 Swiss. 10 Turkish. 681 Ameri can, and 359 other whites. The advocates of 'White Australia' will be gratified to learn that during the period the coloured people who left the shores of Australia were sUghtly more numerous than those who came here, the actual figures being 4,4S3 and 4,451. There were 2.384 Chinese immigrants, but, as against them, 2,4C3 Celestials took then* leave.
