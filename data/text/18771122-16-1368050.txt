The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are frequently shown from the first day of its administration, by a remarkable increase of nervous power, with a feeling of vigor and comfort to which the patient has long been unaccustomed, entirely overcoming that dull, inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience in all their actions.

Full directions for use in the English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Danish, Turkish, Persian, Hindustani, Madrasse, Bengalee, Chinese, and Japanese languages accompany each case. ter CAUTION.- The large and increasing demand for Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne has led to several imitations under similar names ; purchasers of this medicine should therefore be careful to observe that the words " Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne" are blown in the bottle, and that the directions for use are printed in all the languages as above, without which none can possibly be genuine.
