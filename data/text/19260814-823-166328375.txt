OVERSEAS MIGRATION. Tables prepared by the Common wealth Statistician for the quarter ended June 30, which were made available yes terday, suggest that Australia is recover ing its former attractiveness'as a pros pective new home for people of the Motherland. They certainly strikingly uphold the claim that Australia is "90 per cent. British," and likely to remain so. During the three months 26,544 per sons arrived here, and 17,893 left our shores. Of the former, 22,440 were of British race, 850 were Italians, 334 Jugo Slavs, 154 French, 122 Russian, and 403 from the United States. There were 85 Greeks and 73 Germans; otbdrs of European race were made up of Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Mai tese, and so on. Non-European people totalled 1,526, and included 1,145 Chi nese, 104 Japanese, 135 Indians, 58 Papuans, and 38 Syrians. Mr. Wickens gives particulars of the nature and char acter of the migrants. These show that the arrivals comprise 15,307 actual im migrants who mean to live permanently in Australia; 4,893 Australians who re turned from trips abroad; and 6,340 "temporary visitors" from overseas. New South Wales maintains a long lead over the other States in the estimation of immigrants as a desirable place of re sidence. Then, in order, come Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland, and South Australia, with Tasmania a negligible last (there were 3 arrivals and 109 departures from the Island State 1). The South Australian figures are Actual immigrants, 606 males and 458 females; returned Australians, 56 and 57 respectively; temporary visitors, 33 of each sex; total arrivals, 695 males and 548 females; total departures, 346 males and 360 females. Thus this State secured a fairly substantial addition to its population. Generally, the figures for the Commonwealth show a consider able improvement oh those for .the cor responding quarter, of 1925, and the ad vance is even more marked in relation to the figures for the first quarter of the present year. "Evidently," the new Development and Migration Commis sion would experience little difficulty in recruiting useful types of migrants for comparatively unoccupied but fertile areas in the interior.
