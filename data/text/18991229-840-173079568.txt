Since then Dr. Owen has pointed out tho injurious effects caused by taking tho so- called Eitealpvti Extracts which aro now in the market, "internally, or by applying them to a tendor surface, like nn inflamed skin, throat, &o.; Ha reports to the Medical Society of Victoria that a' child living at Eitzroy became most seriously indisposed through thoir uso. In unuthor case a lady states 011 the strength of stututory declara tion that sho suffered cruelty from tho effects of ono of them. To guard tho high reputa tion of our innuufneturo, and to proteot an unwary public upon whom these spurious preparations uro foisted from similar calami ties, wo feel warranted in exposing tho above facts, and recommend to the ptiblio to take oaro and precaution to got Sander & Sons' Pure Volatile Euoulypti Extract and no other, when buying. — Advt, A paragraph in tbo Sydney Daily Telegraph' states: "Tho Catholic congross, it is .an nounced, will not take place quite so early in 1000 us was expected, through tho inability of tho contractors to finish the pavement of S-. Mary's Cathedral within tho anticipated time. Tho original idea , was to open tbo latest completed portion of St. Mary's Cathe dral simultaneously with tha sitting of tho congress. Cardinal Moran bus decided to . ndhero to that plau, and notwithstanding that nearly all tho papers for tho congress are ill hand, he lias postponed the congress until October, 1000, when St. Mary's will be opened with ceremony.'.'
