Desxrters Again.— There seems to be almost & furore amongst seamen from the frequency of desertion, and on Tuesday a couple more instances were reported, though only in one case successful. The mail-boat, on leaving the Yatala on Monday night, was found to have augmented her crew while alengsido, and on the coxswain making the discovery, he at once returned to the vessel to pass the man back to his duty. The second case was that of the Electric, where one of the men several times intimated his intention to desert, but only put it in force yesterday morning when the Young Australian dropped alongside to discharge her wool, and during the period of hurry and bustle consequent on the process Jack managed to get clear on board with bag and baggage. The Adolfh is one of the God'lefroy Line of Hamburg passenger vessels which for many years have periodically added to the population of the colony by well-selected batches of immigrants, and on the present voyage she left with 49 and arrived with 50 souls on board, having one birth and no deaths recorded in the journal. She left Hamburg on October 13, but had barely crossed the North Sea before a terrific gale set in, and for several days the brig lay at anchor in the Downs till it moderated From the time of leaving till crossing the line 30 days elapsed, and after rounding the Cape of Good Hope a fine run across the Southern Ocean was made m 50* S.. passing within sight of Prince Edward's Island, but on nearing the Aus tralian land the usual local winds prevented a quick termination to the voyage, and for several days she lay becalmed when to the westward of Kangaroo Island. She is a neat brig, with a full cargo in the hold, and in it are some sineular con aignmenta, particulars of which are elsewhere. The Danube having shipped fresh hands in place of the deserters, got under weigh from the anchor age last night. The Yatala weighed on Tuesday morning at an early hour, but only made a short distance down the Gulf when she fell in with the southerly wind, which kept her beating in sight of the stations till sundown.
