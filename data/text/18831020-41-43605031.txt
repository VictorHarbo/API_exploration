BROKER: EBENEZER WARD. : This Company is formed to purchase the Steam Brickmaking Machinery and Plant which has been successfully worked by Messrs. Walker & Swan in making bricks for the tunnels and other 'works under their contracts on the Adelaide and Nairne Railway, and to carry on the business of manufacturing and selling bricks, drain-pipes, tiles, and similar goods, and also to purchase about twenty acres ot land, in vicinity of Black wood, being part of Section No. 1042, Hundred of Adelaide, specially selected for the purpose in view, upon which an almost inexhaustible supply of the necessary material of the best quality exists, with power to lease or purchase other lands for the purpose of brick making if deemed advisable. This Company will be considered formed when 10,000 Shares have been applied for, to be paid by calls of 2s. 6d. on application, 2s. 6d. on allotment, and the balance in calls not exceeding 2s. 6d., at intervals of not less than one month. Careful estimates have been made of the cost of erecting kilns and necessary buildings, and it ia considered that £10,000 -will be sufficient for the pnrpose o£ machinery, plant, land, and for the erection of all necessary works, and for working capital equal to the production of 100,000 bricks per week. The bricks made by Messrs. Walker & Swan with the machinery proposed to bo turchaeed, and from exactly similar material to that on the land to be purchased, have been proved to be of superior quality. An agreement has been arrived at with the Government, as set out in the following letter, by which the Company's kilns will be connected with the Adelaide and Nairne Railway, ard the Company will thus be enabled to deliver bricks by rail direct from the kilns to all places connected with the broad-gaupe system of railways.

The vendors of the land and of the machinery and plant accept Shares paid up to 10s. each in payment ot the whole amount of the purchase-money for the land, machinery, and plant respectively.
