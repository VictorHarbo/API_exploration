TO THE ELECTORS OF WEST MORETON. f^ ENTLEMEN,-It is my duty to inform \DC you that I havo accepted tho oBco of Minister for Lands, by which my seat in Parlia- ment as your representative has becomo vacant ; and I have tho honor, at the samo time, to offer myself again as a candidate for your suffrages. The political and financial state of tho colony is in so critical a position, that unless exertions of an unusual character aro rosortod to by tho Parliament and tho people, tho most disastrous consequonces must follow. It must bo ovidont to you, Goutlemon, that tho evenly-balanced state of tho two parties in the Houso of Assembly rondors it impossiblo for either sido to comrnnud a sufficient number of supporters to carry tho strong and offootivo measures which the financial dcrangomonts of tho colony especially require. Tho object in forming tho present Government-composed as it is of mombors from each sido of the Houso .was to establish a Ministry poworfnl enough to meot in l'arliamont any opposition that may bo offorod to thoso measures which aro essential to our credit and stability as a colony. Tho samo principles which guided the formor Macnlistor Ministry on tho land question aro thoso which aro agreed to by every member of tho presout Government. No attempt will bo mndo to roduco tho upsot price of land at auction bolow £1 por aero ; and tho Leasing Clauses Bill, as it is termed, which provides for leasing land to agriculturists, will bo ono of tho first measures which the Government hopo to havo tho opportunity of introducing after tho meeting of Parliament. As an individual member of tho present Go- vernment, I may say, in rofcronco to tho finan- cial arrangements which aro now pending, that I have not changed my opinion us to tho advantages which would havo orison to tho colony from tho issuo of legal tondor Treasury notes, had they been accopted at tho timo that I proposed their adoption, but circumstances over which I had no control havo provontod tho possibility of a bill for that object becoming law. It, therefore, only remains for mo as well as every man who is eallod upon, to assist in bringing about the next best means by which confidonco will bo restored, and tho crodit of tho colony established. It is unnecessary for mo to address you now at grcatlength. I shall have an opportunity on tho nomination day of expressing mysolf moro fully than I could bo oxpoctod to do through tho columns of tho nowspapers on thoso subjects in which you feel great interest. I have tho honor to bo, Goutlemon, Your most obedient Sor vant, 1656 . JOSHUA P. BELL. LOST, from Hawthorn Villa, Gregory Tor race, a small Tan Terrier Bitch PUP.
