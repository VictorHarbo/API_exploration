COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. Argua Office, Sataiday Evening. The export entries of gold passed at I the Customs to-day amounted only to -2J ozs., of which 871 028. were for shipment per Copenhagen, for London; and 6 ozs. for Liverpool, per Shaftesbury. There has been hut a limited amount of hUBiness transacted in this market during the week. The banks are well supplied with law gold, and are shipping lightly : the ex- ports during the week have been 6,013 ozs. to ¡Sydney, and 76,172 ozs. to England, par European and Kent. The reduction of the rates of exchange for drafts on London to rai by the banks has caused a corresponding decline in the value of gold, and present ruling rates are as follows, viz. ¡-Bendigo and Castlemaine, £3 las. Od.; Dunolly, £3163.; Ovens, £3 16s. 6d. to £3 16s. 9d. ; Ballaarat, "8 17s. 6d. to £3 17a. 9d. per ounce. The escort returns show a trifling decline in amount, but, owing to the improved means of conveyance and facilities offered, consider- able quantities of gold, which were formerly entrusted for security to escort conveyance, are now brought in by private hand,-the difference in time in the , transit (the produce of many of the diggings being forwarded by escort only every alternata week) inducing parties to encounter the risk, for the sake of obtaining speedy sales of their gains ; so that the amount brought in by escort does not now really afford any correct indication of the quantity of gold actually produced. The following is a summary of the returns of gold received by the escort on Friday. The asterisk prefixed to the nameB of several of the digging districts denotes that from tho3e places they are despatched fortnightly only : Hame Quantity gold, of gold-field. ozs. dwts.

The amount of gold shipped during the week has been, although by no means heavy, larger than was anticipated, the banks generally being inclined to keep a full supply on hand, in preference to shipping extensively. The rate of exchange on England is now, at all the banks, at par. at>ixty days' sight, which alteration, in the absence of the now long overdue English mail, is hearing heavily on colonial produce, as, with drafts procurable l on these terms, the shipment of wool, or any other produce. The amount of specie shipped during the week is 13,1382., of which sum 2,9382. was forwarded in gold, and 2002. in silver, per European, lot Suez ; and 10,000 in sovereigns, per Charlotte Ann, to Mauritius. The stock and share market presenta no change to report on ; transactions have been I ' limited in extent, and quotations are un- altered. The arrivals of immigrants by sea during the week amount, as per Customs returns, to 561 persons ; but as the passengers per Rox- burgh Castle, Medway, and Shakspeare are not included in this report, the actual number is considerably greater. The Shakspeare, with about 500 passengers on board, has, in conse quence of sickness, been placed in quaran- tine. The passengers arrived by sea dur- ing the week are from the undermentioned places, viz.: United Kingdom, 326; Aus- tralian colonies, 188; Cape of GoodHope, 8; Brazil, 5; United States of America, 34; total, 561. The net addition to the popula tion of the colony by the seaboard during the year, up to noon to-day, corrected by the offi- cial returns of the Immigration Department, has been 40,461 souls. The following are the monthly totals of the returns for the current year :- < Arrived.

Under these circumstances the usual weekly sale3 have lately been suspended, but will be re- sumed on Tuesday next, the approach of Ohristmas preventing the sales being held on the usual day. The Melbourne monthly series of land sales will be resumed on Monday. The lands hitherto disposed of have consisted of small town allotments situate in suburban districts, which have sold readily, at full prices ; the two days sales already effected having realised 4,1162. for about 29 J acres. The sale of the land in the parishes ofMerrknee and Bul- lengarook, advertised to be held at Messrs. Tennent and Go.'s auction rooms on this day, has been-postponed. Some an_ie?y is beginning to be felt for thi Eafety of the mail, while every day's delay adds to the invenienco so generally expe- rienced. Goods have arrived by vessels dur- ing the last few days, bills of lading for which and advices are on the way by the overland mail, now overdue fourteen days. The cause of ita non-arrival is generally supposed to be this:-That the number of veEsels (conveying troops to India) coaling at Point do Galle has prevented the mnil ship getting her mellon board, and thus delaying her arrival. The suggestion has also bean made that the October mall may have bean forwarded by the Australasian, reported by last advices to be ready for sea ; but, with a vessel waiting at Suez, it is hardly probable the directors of the Company would send the mail by sea round the Cape. The revenue collected by the Customs de-, pattment at Geelong to the 18th instr amounted to £768 2s. Id., and waa raised under the following heads ¡-Brandy, 137 galls. ; gin, 626 galla. ; rum, 294 galls. ; whiskey, G7 galls, ; other spirits, 97 galls.; tobacco, 601 lbs. ; tea, 5,476 lbs. ; and colony's sharo of seizure, £10. By the Antelope wo have papers from Sin Francisco to 8rd October. The markets thero are described as being burdened with a large excess of most articles of merchandise, and prices reported to be such as, with rare excep- tions, to prove wholly unremunerative. The following remarks on bread-stuffs, &c;, are ex« traded from the " Prices Ouïrent and Ship, ping List " of above-named date : Broad-stuffs aro languid, and both flour and wheat hnvo slightly declinod. Tho cercab of all kinds prove largely in oxcoss of our wants this year ; and in ro- gar, to feed grains tho surplus is so heavy that with- out the opening up of favor-bio avonues of exporta- tion, pricos must rulo exceedingly low. Grain.-Tho market has boon much moro quiot during tho past two weeks than it was. The rooolpts of now grain have steadily increased, and the move- ment boforo reforred to with respoct to the advanco in wheat has rocolvod a check. Tho demand for flour for tho country has moderated sonelbly, and la consoquonco tho millers ceased buying grain for a time. Wheat carno forward in largo supply, and the ndvanco was sustained with dlflloulty for a day or two, and finally tho markot receded Thoro has boen no chango lu barloy, and vory little demand has ox lstod for the interior, and nono at all for oxport. lu oats somothlng has boon doing for oxport, about 15,000 bags having boon taken during tho fortnight at 2} to 21 cents, per lb. intended for Australia.

WOOL, TALLOW, &c-Tbo; markot for theso artiolos lias been wholly without transactions ; indoed, owing lo tho non-arrival of tho English mall, duo on the fith inst., buyers aro unadvised as to purchasing, and tho firm position assumed by growers decided the soiling brokers to defer tbo usual sales of the wook. 1'he mall, however, not having anived, tho auction salos of wool, tallow, hides, _c. will bo resumed on Tuesday next, at Messrs. Goldsbrough's and J. H. Clough and Oo.'s warehouses; but should tho Emeu not have arrived by that timo thoro is little probability of any amount of business boing transacted. A few salos of wool bave beon effected during the weak prlvatoly, at about tho rates latoly procured by auction ; but in many In- stances tho withdrawn wools have boen shipped on growers' accounts.
