IsüMMARY FÜR EUROPE. ?4 POLITICAL. * Tho two nouses of Parliament being in ;WCM. ond tho Christmas holidays not ' haviim been concluded, the political ". history of tho fortnight has boon very 'it,oh of a blank. The one event has C th« reception of the news ot the 1 failure to float the £4,000,000 loan on the J london market. The messages carno 'ttroiigh with exceptional rapidity, tho Zo occupied in their transmission being ¿bout four hours and a half, and conso "¿ently tho information was well circu- ited before business had comnioncod in ho city on the morning of Wednesday loth . Tanuary. The news caused general surprise, but it docs not appear in any way to have af- fected current business operations. As a matter of course Sir Bryan O'Loahlon has been generally condomned for miling to placo tho loan on tho English market six or eight months ago, « when advised to do so on every sido. It is :'1 felt that to a great oxtont ho miasod his ' opportunity. Nowa was eiibseimontty .' received that tho Stock Exchange con ?, sidored tho minimum too high, and that 1 large operators had hold aloof. The Go ?\ vernmont wero not unawaro of this an I tnoonistic position. For months past the 4 Treasurer has rocoived frequent comtnu I nications from tlio agont-gonoral Mr. It. s Munay Smith and tho associated banks in London, with a view of dociding upon tlio minimum ; and although tho despatches aro regarded as strictly confidential, it has transpirod that about a month ago tlio Treasurer was ndviaod from London to fix tho minimum at £98. ¿e however, doolinod to tako tina stop. Although the loan was the first at 4 per cent, which wo havo endeavoured to place at par, lie hold that it possossod an increased value from tho fact that it could bo iiiEcribod at tho option of tho holdors, sod tho advantago which investors would thus gain would induce thom, it was sup- posed, to regard tho minimum at par as fair. Indeed, it was hopod that aa much as £104 would bo tendered in ¡¡orno cases for tho dobon tures. At any rato, Sir Bryan O'Loghlen ro raftmed firm in his determination not to accept anything under par. Othor causes for tho want of succoss aro pointed to, mid particular prorainonco ia givon to tho fact that Kow Zealand, two days after tho Victorian minimum was an- nounced, advertised that she would placo £1,000,000 on tho market on tho 11th, »earing interest at 4 per cont, with a minimum fixed at £98 10s , or £110s. cheaper than our £4,000,000 loan. Fiuthor, it is known that some difficulty waa experienced hy largo holdors in ¡ disposing of the £2,000,000 4 por cont. s loan of Now South Walos in .Tuly j last. Tlio groator portion of that amount j was subscribed for by a syndicate con I necled with Now South Wales, who gavo £102 10s., and dosircd soon afterwards to placo thobondsat£10ito£105. Thoro j was a disinclination among investors to i touch them, but wlion information was '< telegraphed from Sydnoy that tho stock 1 waa to bo inscribed, tho speculators wero ablo to dispose of thoir holdings. In addition to tho advorso circumstancos tlioio Bhould bo mentioned the recent articles in The Times and Pall Mall Qa-,etle, which did not bear favourably upon tho Victorian loan, and which no doubt had Eomo influence in causing porsons to withhold tondors. Tho tolegram which Sir Bryan O'Loghlen rocoived from tho agent- s' genera! was as follows :-"Ono hundred and forty-threo tondors - £455,DD0 ; kept open till Monday aftornoon at minimum." At a Cabinet meeting hold on tho following Wodnosday morning it was resolved not to dis- turb this arrangement. During tho day the Promior called for n statement of the amount to the credit of the Qovornmont at tho banks, and ho found that it ..as £927,000. This sum is exclusivo of an amount of £2,000,000 which has boon placed to tho crodit of tho Government by the associated banks in anticipation o£ tho floating of tho £4,000,000 loan. During tho current six months, ending 50th Juno next, Sir Bryan O'Loghlon ex- pects to obtain upwards of £3,000,000 from tho consolidated rovonuo, and if the loan is floated in tho moan thno ho will thus havo £8,000,000 at his disposal. Tho maximum oxpondi turo for tho period cannot oxcood £4,000,000, so that Bhould his oxpocta iions bo reaped ho will havo a balanco of £1,000,000 at the ond of tho financial year, which will materially strengthen his hands in dealing with tho other loan iihichmustbo floated boforo the ond of tho year to redeem tho £3,587,000 borrowed in 1859. The Education Commission has re- sumed its sittings, and moro disclosures as to tho gross abuso of political patronage by Major Smith during tho Borry s ('gillie havo been obtainod. SOCIAL AND GENERAL. The Government havo decided that the independent board they promised to appoint to inquiro into the cause of tho Hawthorn railway accident shall consisto! flvegontle men, of whom ono will be an engineer, another a barrister, and throo men of fousineaa. Tho names of the appointees aro withheld until they signify their intention of acting. The lion Ivo Bligh's eleven, just before leaving Melbourno for Tasmania, received a cable meeaago congratulating thora on their victory over the AuBtralian Eleven 1 They can only account for this by supposing that como blunder has been mado in in- terpreting tho measogoB forwardod to the London press, moBBnges probably Bent in cipher, and that the positions of the teams bave been roveraed in giving tho result of the comear.

THE CRESWICK DISASTER Considerable progress has been made with the inquest respecting the disaster at the New Australasian Company's mine at Creswick The inquiry, which is conducted by Mr J C Thompson, P M , was resumed on the 10th inst. On the two previous days the coroner and jury made a thorough inspection of the pit. The most important evidence taken on the 10th was that of Mr A T Walker, Government mining surveyor, who showed that No 2 shaft was 65ft nearer the old workings than was indicated on the working plans of the mining manager, and therefore Mr Nicholas's (the manager) calculations of the distance he had to drive to intersect the old drive were incorrect. In reply to this Mr Nicholas stated that as the new drive waa at least 20ft below the old one with a reef between them ho waB quito juatified in ex- tending the drive, but it transpired that oven the diflerence in the lévela waa unavoidably only the result of an estimate which would require certain conditions in the ground to bear out Again, the new workings wero defended on the ground that culverta had been put in to drain the old workings, and that the stream running through thom waa largo enough to prevent any accumulation of water in the original reef drives It was ad- mitted that the dnnger signal-knocking on the air pipes-waa faulty because in repair ing the pipes they often had to be hammered but nccording to Mr Nicholas, a wiro and bell would be inconvenient to maintain, and Hood Rates might drown moro men than they would save It came out clearly enough that no danger of flooding had been npprohended either by the manager or any of tbo minera who wero examined, although a aoftnoBB and " fretting had been observed in the face for a couple of days prior to the inburst taking place Tho proceedings wore adjourned to the following day, when Mr Nicholas waa re- called Owing to the reports of his prede- cessor, now deceased, touching the liability of the workings to be flooded being put in, coun- sel obtained time to peruse these documents before concluding the witnesses' examination Trom the further evidence taken at that Bit- ting it appeared that Bomo of the men in the north drive had expressed fears as to the safety of the timber a short time before the accident, but repairs were made At no time were the men afraid of an inbnrBt of water, although Borne of those who were engaged in the mine had been employed in the old workings, and knew the direction in which tbey lay The culverts which had been con- structed eat sued them all that these drives were being steadily drained rrom the statement of George TiBher it waa made clear that many, if not all, the men might have been saved if they had resolutely faced the rising water and puBbed on for No 5 shoot, as Fisher, although be turned back 200ft after getting the alarm, waa able to reach the place of safety, The use of a bell as a danger signal, and the erection of Hood gates in the south-west drive, where the water came in, were as BtronRly objected to by the cap tains of the several shifts as by the mining manager, and fot the same reasons The moBt important evidence taken the next day, when the enqa'ry waB further ad- journed till to morrow (the 18th mat ), waa that of Mr Charles Stewart, the inspec- tor of mines, who stated that all the precau- tions demanded by the regulations nnder the Mines Statute had been complied with by tbe company, It would have been difficult lolleep an escape drive open as far as tha end of the main level, owing to the charac ernf I be ground. A gong attached to a stout wire and iloodgatee, which had been succesafully used upon on inburst in a Ballarat company's mini would be useful in case ot an accident 'I lie mining manager, Mr W Nicholas, waa a .cry careful and experienced mau, ana as he wob unable to reach the abandoned No 1 workings bo had made Ihb calculations, upon the onlj practical plan If those esti niateB -riere ri¡,ht he had no need to put borea in ahead to Bee if there waa any danger, aa iho old levels .vero 20ft above the now drive '1 be regulations onlj compelled the manager to bore ahead, and in this case the water carno from the top The mine was, aa far na Mr Stewart Unen, carefully worked, and the timber in the main dn.e waa tho best that could be procured Tho foreman requested that during the adjournment a bore should be 1 ut up, to ascertain how close the south west drive ..ne to tho old workings at the point wlieie the flood occurred It was promised that attention should be gnen to the request, tubjict to a due regard for Bafety in touching (.round ..Inch it ia expected has been honey tombed bj tho water Meetings of tho general committee of the Relief rund wero held in Melbourne on the Oth and 10th inst To the Gmt of these meeting it is icported that the Central Coin nutleo lind ltnowledgo of about £13 000 in subscriptions (of which tuout £1700 has been sent through 'Hie Al /us) but this Bum ..ould be considerably increased as several lie ta were not made up, and a number of en tertaiiimeuts and other mema of raiaing further contributions wero projected None of the berea.ed at Creswick were, it waa stated, m need of help immediately, as (he Miners' ABBOCiatiqn had made granta Many subscriptions were, it waa said, being held back until it was decided whether a I ernianent fund was to bo started. Even tnallj a motion by Mr Zox, M L A., that in the opinion of the meeting, any surplus which may remain after the Creswick people hnd been adequately provided for, shall go towards a national mining accident relief fund, waa carried with only one dissentient On tbo proposnl of Mr Benson, it waa agreed that a aub committee, which has been ap pointed from tho Central Committee, and ..Inch coneietsof the mayorB of Melbourno, Creswick, Ballarat (city and town), Sand- hurst, Stawell, DajleBford, and Clunes, should be requested to conault the local com nntteo nt Creswick and the president and secretarj of the Amalgamated Mine» Asso cwtlion willi regard to the aaaiatance which maj bo required, and to report to the General Committee It is expected that the sub com nntteo ..ill be ablo to report to the General Committee in a week or tno Some of the bereaved will, it seema, not need much pecu niarj assistance as they benefit from mau ranee policies, but a large proportion of tho amount subscribed will it is thought, be re quired to adequately provide for the rest of the sufferers _ VICTORIAN GOLD RETURNS TOR 1SS2 The gold returns, winch give an approxi mation of tho jicld of Victorian gold for tho jear 1SS2, have been pnbhahed, and they show on increaso for the jear of 180 117o/ Tho total )ield for the jear is approximated nt 1 OGO ri3307 aa against 8S0 11037 for 1881 d be estimate ib made by taking the amount of Victorian gold exported in 18S2, the amount received at the Mint during the year, and the amount held by the Melbourno banks ord their agencies on the 31st December, JS82 Tho total obtained from these returns is reduced by the amount held by the banka and their branchea on tho 31at December, 18S1, as it is neceEBartly included in the return of gold exported or minted during tho jearlS82 '1 ho following are tho returns from the Customs depaitment - 18b2 Amount Valuo \ ¡dorian gold - Gold other than Mctoil.in. oz dtvt 363 788 l8 10 461 5 £ 1,419 010 78 100 Total Gold specie- m. 378,190 8 1 407 110 2,188 421 Total .»Iuo _ £8,083 637 16S1 I Ictorlan gold _ 1 ordtn (.old .

Tho Police Commission, which is now vntnally compoBed of Messrs Longmore, Tincham, Hall, and Dixon, have submitted a further report, which dealB with tho detective department It is very long, and also very severo, Tho blanch ib described as little better than a nursery for crime Inspector Secretan, who has charge of it, is held to be unauited for the poaition, the relations between the general body of the police and delcctivcB are said to be unsatisfactory, and the eepecial weight is given to the results of the investigations into the "fugig" ByBtem-a svBlem under which some oikcers employ cuminals to induce others to commit offences with a view of obtaining tho credit for their capture Briefly stated, their findings are that the detectives should be merged in tho general force, plain clothes constables to tako their placea in tbo detection of crime, that all ¡transac- tions between the police and criminals should bo with the full knowledge and permission of the chief commissioner, that a private inquiry oflico bo maintained at the Russell strcot barracks , that a secret service fund be established, to bo disbursed by the chief com- missioner alone, and that Inspector Secretan be called upon to retire upon any compensa- tion to which he may be entitled TUE EDUCATION COMMISSION Tho Education Commission havo held one sitting since the Christmas adjournment Ono witness who appeared before them, Mr C. P, O Malley, an ex state school teacher, gave important evidence. Ho said that the payment by results system now in vogue was injurious, inasmuch as it led to cramming Further, he said the political appointments havo done a vaBt amount of injury, and he instanced a case showing gross abuse of patronage on the part of tho late Minister (Mnjor bmith). A female assiatant was sent to his school at St Arnaud to do temporary duty from Ballarat, the constituency of the Minister. She waB very lneihcicnt, and when lhere wna no longer cny necessity for her to remain, he Bent to the department and aBkcd that ahe should bo removed. This wob not done, but her Bister, for whom there was no requirement, was also sent to the school from Ballarat "The public money paid to her," he Baid, "was wasted ' Regard- ing the quality of the mBtruotion, he ex the opinion that " tho Becular tuition under the old national Bystem of education was better than it is now ' Mr C. A Topp, one of the inspectors, gave some valuable infor motion regarding (ne details of inspectora' duties, and generally he agreed with the pre- sent system of administration. Regarding tho subject of religious instruction, he said that " there would be no difficulty in the way of teachers reading Bible loBsona in th<s Bchoola ' In consequence of the recent action of the department in censuring Mr. Parnell, o. teacher, for some evidence he gave before the commission, it was considered necessary to apply to the Govemor-in Council for an order protecting the witnesses, and thia has been passed.

In the Legislative Assemblj, on the first dny of meeting, Sir Henry Parkes made a brief statement in which he informed the House that so far as the Government were able to interpret tbe decision of the constitu- encies at the recent general election, it was that substantial reform should be made with- out delay in the land laws of the colony, and that the reform should not be carried out by tbe present Government There was a contest for the Speakerehip, the majority of the House nominating Mr. Edmund Barton in opposition to Sir G. XV. Allen, the former Speaker, and an old politi. cal friend and colleague of Sir H. Parkes Mr, Barton was elected by 51 voteB to it. So far as the land law ia concerned, an actual majority ib pledged to support a re- formed law which will place a limitation on free selection before survey, afford the pastoral leBBees greater security of tenure, exact a higher rental from the squatters, reduce the deposits payable on conditional purchases ana effect either the classification of the lands or the proclaiming of agricultural and paBtoral areaB.
