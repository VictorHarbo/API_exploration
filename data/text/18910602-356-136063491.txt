THERE is now in Adelaide a representative of the Vestved, a daily newspaper of Denmark, in the person of Emil Opquer. His passport is quite an interesting document, showing that he has travelled all over the world. The chief object of his visit is to inquire whether there is an oponing for Danish immigration. Mr. Wright, the Vice. Consul for Denmark, informed him that under present conditions he did not think it desirable to encourage the immigration of foreigners.
