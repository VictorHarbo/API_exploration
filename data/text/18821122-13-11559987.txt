SUMMARY FOR EUROPE POLITICAL SUMMARY. The Legislative Assembly on Thursday last received through the Governor and the Secretary of State for the Colonies the reply of the Quieen to the address congratulating Her Majesty on the suc- cess of the British arms in Egypt. The Queen was much gratified at receiving this loyal and kind congratualtion, and the Secretary of State had been com- manded to convey Her Majesty's thanks to the House.

The following lines have been passed:—Ballarat Cattleyards, Bacchus Marsh to Gordon, Camperdown to Terang, Dandenong to Cranbourne, Dimboola to the South Australian border, Frankston Cemetery to Hastings, Hamilton to Coleraine, Hawthorn to Kew, Kyneton to Redesdale, Lilydale to Healesville, Lubeck towards Banyena, Murchison to Rushworth, Murtoa towards Sheep-hills, Numurkah towards Picola, Numurkah towards To- cumwal, Ondit to Beeac, Richmond to Oakleigh, Cranbourne to Sherwood, St. James to Yarrawonga, Shepparton to- wards Dookie, Tatura towards Taripta, Wodonga towards Tallangatta, Yea to Mansfield, Murray-bridge, Portland Pier, and the Flinders-street Viaduct. Evidence is now being taken in regard ooto lines about which a difference of opinion exists. Mr. Robert Watson, the engineer- in-chief, stated last week that the con- struction of the whole of the lines in the bill would occupy six or seven years, unless some of them were rushed, and if any "rushing" occurred, the cost would be materially increased. tho r 1!0,m.lnatl°ns for tho new seat") in %»tfhl ,, ° °°nncil woro mado on ham if SpWthinst Eighteen mate tai si ° Fed f01 U Provinces In six Wm T thore alQ "O eontosts Mr tarni ii?"0,11 ^aB roolectod for Gipps DoW (?Mt,('ln»"">) Province, and Dr UD«°n for tho South Eastern Piovmce .ho new moiiihcra aie Mi In Campbell fortho V c)hiij.tm (Ililluat) Province Mr N J lir rnlcy f n the Western IV » vinco, nnd Mi I'atncl II inna for tho Ivorlli I iistein I'lovinco It was sup poned that Messrs MielJain and Sargood would havo had a wall ovei fir thoSoutli .lura Province, but at the last miment tho often defeated Mi \V A C A Beckett piesontcd himself lu the samo way Mr J li Hopkins lm foiccd a contest upon Mr F Ormond for tho Southwestern Provinoo or Goolong district Tho candidates ro tinned aro all associated with constit i tional politics Messrs G Coppin G J II mi, and J G Beanoy wero duly liomin ited foi tho Melbourne Province for which one momboi is to bo returned, and the North . arra electorato is t > bo | fairly contested by Messrs G Mearos and S G King, on tho one hand, mel Wm Lang and I I. 1 eaver on the othoi, two having to bo oloctod Tor the Is01 th Western Province (threo seatB), livo candidates aro standing I hero will also bo con'ests for the fil lowing provinces -Nelson (ono seat), Southern (one), and the Northom (one) _ ho number of voters on the new rolls for the Le¡-_3latho Council is 08 7 J >, of whom 07 022 aro ratepayers, and 1 113 non ratepayers Ino ratepayois includo )7 ) licensees nndei the Land Act, whoso liamea were placed on the supplemontaiy lolls framed under tho [rousions of an act of tho current aes3lon, and 8 |omt owners, j jint lcsiees, and joint assignees aro included in tho numbei of non ratepayers When tho Biipplomontary act was boforo tho Assembly, tho radical party allogod that tho joint owners would Bwamp tho licensees, whereas tho event shows that tho two classes stand in tho ratio of about 11 licensees to 1 j ¡mt ownei Beforo tho Reform Act waa passed, tho voters foi tho Council only numbered Jl 0 IO, Including u0,G08 late payers and 1, J88 non ratepayers The lramvvay Cjnipanys Bill is pro pressing Blowly in the Legislativo As sembly SOCIAL AND GEM.IUL II M S & ironclad Nelson Commodoro ErBkinea flagship waa floated out of the Alfred graving dock on the 13th mat While m dock the bottom waa cleaned and painted in two oils and afterwarda had a liberal coatint, of patent anti fouling composition In a letter to the Governor, dated the 17th mat Commodore Lrskino expresses his appreciation of the capabilities of the dock and congratulates the authorities on the very successful manner in which the opera tion of docking had been performed At the mayoral dinner (,iven on the »til mat the commander of the Nelson Captain Hender aon intimated that Bbe would never have been Bent to Australian watcra if thero had been no Alfred ^ravine, dock It may bo ¡vdded that Melbourne ia the only port in Australia where a vessel of the si/« of the Nelson could bo doeked although Sydnoy haa been made the head quarters of the Ana traban atation . ho I rench war steamer Bruit having f niBhed taking in BUJ plies hero has left for New Caledonia v â Brisbane She calla in at the latter port to talco on board several pn soñera who had eacai ed from the island Tho new Mayor of Melbourne Counc llor Dodf,Bhuu gave his inaugural dinner on the Jth met About < 0 (,ueat were present The chief feature of the entertainment waa the hearty reception accorded to the I remier and the Minister of Hallways -he Police Commission haa held but one Bitting-on the 11th mat-but no business was transacted -hey had before them a statement of actions taken in the Supreme and County Couria a.ainst Superintendent Vi inch for the recovery of money which they forwur led to the Chief Secretary for report Ihey then adjourned sine di pendine, a reply from the Chief Secretary as to the action the Government intended tal ing upon the roport of the commission winch recommended the retirement from the force of Superintendent W inch and Sub inspector Lamer Since then Superintendent V> inch Ima accepted the pro posai of the Government 'hat aa he had reached the a^o of 1 e should retire on a superannuation allorance of 1.27 per annum -he!

This enterprising farmer, whose holding comprises -s,300 acres, has, by means of a 10 horse power engine and centrifugal pumps, raised water from a creek fed from the Murray Piver sufficiently high to irrigate 300 acres of wheat crop and an equal area of natural pasture. Nothing but surprise and admiration was expressed by those preaent at the effect of the application of the water A patch of wheat which bad been irr- gated at the right time-before the grain was fully above gronnd-was a heavy, well- headed crop of dark green healthy colour, promising fully 40 bushels per acre and small pieces that had hot been reached by the water were short, blighted, and withered, showing that without irrigation the field would not have been worth harvesting. On other parts of the cultivation irrigation was aprlied after the crops had suffered more or less from the effects of blight. In some the irrigated crop gave promise of yielding 20 to 25 bushels per acre and in others from 15 to l8, while patches which had been missed were completely destroyed by the drought. 'Ihe wheat ia clean, well headed, and free from rust and the general average is likely to be 20 bushels instead of a total failure. Fully 50 per cent of the crops passed between Echuca and Cohuna were total failures, owing to the rain having como toe late to save them, and the unirrigated patches in Mr Garden's fields show that his would have been among the list of total losses had not water been applied. The irrigated natural grass was a close sward, a foot in height, being twice or three times as good as where no water was put. Mr Garden's experiments are chiefly interesting because they show that irrigation can be very successfully under- taken by private enterprise in a portion of the colony known as "the dry districts," where agriculture has for some years been "on isa trial," with some apparent prospects of having a verdict returned finally against it.

A great sensation waB occasioned in Mel- bourne on Saturday, the 11th mat, by the re- ceipt of intelligence that the magnificent Orient liner Austral, 5,088 tons, John Murdoch commander, had foundered in harbour at Sydney The Austral had been busily coaling for some time from lighters moored alongside of her. The coal, however, had been placed in the bunkers on tho starboard side, which gave the vessel a list, and as the weight gradually increased the water rose nearer to her lower portholeB These were unfor tunately left open, and immediately they reached the level of the water, a torrent poured into the vessel which no human Bkill could couateract The vessel gradually filled and settled down into between 40ft and 50ft depth of water. This occurred at 1 o'clock on Saturday morning, whilst the vessel was lying Bnugly at anchor in Neutral Bay. There were on board at the time the officers and crew, numbering between 70 and, 80 men, and of these (ive are known to have perished, the others just succeeding in .uving tbemaelvea by jumping into the lighten alongside of tho ship Most of ti cm were in their bertha, and some asleep at the time when the alarm was raised, and had only time to ruah out half naked, just as they were, and escape, eome into the lighters alongside, and others into boats which were despatched from neigh bounng vessels to their assistance Later in the morning divers were sent down to the vessel, and they have continued at work emce Their first duty waa to aecuro the chronometers, Bhip's papers, and other valuables The bodies of Mr Perkins, the purser, of Mr. James Alexander, the re- frigerating engineer, and of three lascara who were employed on the veaael, were found below, they not having had time to eacapo from the veaael Pumping gear has atnco been obtained from Melbourne and ar rangements aro being made to cover the port holes with iron plates, to hot metically Beal the veaael and pump out the water, and to raise her. Tho Austral ia lyiuR on a bed of soft clay, being at the bow in about six fathoms, and at the stern in about 10 fathoms of water. She is therefore in a sloping position. The promenade deck is about .ft under water, the bridgo being left high and dry. She had 2,000 tons of iron and 1,500 tona of coala on board at the time of the accident She waa to have continued coaling until she bad taken on board from 2,700 to 3,000 tona The Austral waa 17"dt long by 18ft beam, and a depth of 37ft In every reapect ahe waa one of the finest merchant ships afloat, and her cost ia aaid to have been nearly a quarter of a million, On Monday, the 13th mat, Mr. H. Sheill, the coroner, commenced an inquiry into the cause of death of tho five persons whoso bodies had been recovered. In the course of bia evidence, Captain Murdoch atated that ho arnv ed in Sy dnoy Harbour on the 3rd inst On tho 8th met., after having discharged a quantity of cargo at Circular Quay, he hauled off into Neutral Bay, and made faat to the company's mooring No cargo had been taken in for the homeward voyage up to that time On 'J uesday and Wednesday, he discharged the remainder of the cargo The Austral foua dered at her mooringa, while coanng, on Saturday morning at 1 o'clock. It was then daylight On I riday evening tho bottom of the porta waa about 1ft Gin. from the water level lio then had between 1300 and 1,100 tona of coal on beard, and ap- proximately from 150 to 180 tona of dead weight in the bottom of tho ahip, being the remnant of the outward cargo W hen all the tanka were full the abip had 800 tona of water ballast, but on Pnday night ehe had only ISO tona of water ballaBt on board. The Austral waa a very tight ship, and made no water. Having been aehore that evening, he returned to the veaael at 10 minutes to 11 o clock. The men had juat commenced coaling from the W oonona Instructions were given to the watchman that if he Baw any irregularity on board the ship ho waa to call tho chief officer and inform him. Ho waa moat particularly told that if he noticed any hat in the ship caused by the coaling on the star- board aide only, to communicate with the chief oflicer at once. The weather waa perfectly fine and the flea smooth. He (Captain Murdoch) sat in the cabin read- ing until 12 o'clock, and then went to bed, but before doing BO he walked round the promenade deck, and looked over the Bide of the vessel to aeo what progress had been made in the coaling operations There waa then not the Bhghteat list in tho ship He woko at about a quarter to 2 o clock, and walked round the deck again. The ship waa still perfectly upright. He returned to bed, and was awakened ata quarter past 1 o clock by the chief officer telling him that the ship was going over. Ho gave matructiona to the chief oflicer to turn up all hands and save their lives, aa by that time tho ehip had gone BO far over that Baving her was quite out of the question. In bia opinion the placing of 1")0 tons of coal in any particular part of the vessel was not sufficient to givo the vessel a hat, and he could not account for her foun- dering It waa elicited from other witnesses that the coaling of the Bhip bad been left entirely to the discretion of the foreman of the coal trimmera without any peraonal euperviaion from any superior authority, and that the foreman was not preaent in the bunkers directing the men under him at the time of the accident Carl Carlsen, stevedore, who had the contract for trimming coal on board the Austral, stated that he waa called on Monday morning after the Austral carno alongside Circular Quay, in consequence of the vessel a taking a list. It took live hours to place the Bteamer on an even keel. Wit neea deemed it prudent to keep all the port holes closed after the experience he had of tho Austral at Circular Uaay. He did not coneider any ship Bafe lying at its mooringa in Neutral Boy with all the porta open, e . posed aa the Auatral waa to sudden gusta and squalls Godfrey Richards, the chief officer, atated that he did not give instructions to have the collier Woonona taken to the other side of the vessel when he noticed a list on the star- board aide, aa he did not conBider it necea eary, because of the slight nature of the hat He thought it quito aafe to leave her porta open at Neutral Bay. Ho did not think that the vessel bad a sufficient hat at 1 o clock on the morning ahe foundered to warrant him in calling the captain. Robert -"rancis Pockley, the Government marine surveyor, stated, from what he had seen of the Auatral, he considered her a safe and seaworthy sh.p of the modern class. He ahould not coneider coaling at the porta a dangerous operation ; thoy wera specially constructed for that purpoBO He never had objected on behalf of the underwriters, and never Baw anything to juatify auch an objec- tion. The inquiry has not yet concluded. CHURCH OF ENGLAND CONGRESS. The firat Church of England Congress held in Australia took place laat week, under the presidency of the Right Rev. Dr. Moorhouae, Bishop of Melbourne. It lasted four days, waa largely attended by bishops and clergy of other Australian dioceBes, and by laymen, and attracted a great amount of public interest The utterances of those who took an active part in the congress were marked, on the whole, by liberality and toloranco, and, although on many of the subject- con- siderable difference of opinion prevails, the proceedings were of a moBt decorous char- acter, and every Bpeaker waa hatened to with attention and patience. To each subject, three boura were allotted. Three or four papera upon it wero firat read, each reader being limited to 20minutea, and then the time waB filled up by Bpeakera, those whoae names appeared on the programme being allowed 10 minutea and the remainder five minutea each. The papera are to be pubhahed in full Much admiration haa been expreaaed at the preaidenta opening address, in the courao of which he said that this waa a étrange time, for acarcely ever was there either more doubt or a more earnest desire to escape from doubt. It waa an age of criticism, and criticism, with her keen analyeis, rending all robes of ancient form, bad laid bare for us once again thoae awful ahapes of mystery which lied caverned in the abysses of human thought. Towards the Lord Jeans ho found often in the works of the deepest thinkers of our time a great softening of heart and feeling, signa not merely of cold administration, but of yearning, wistful tendencies, that would fain caet away doubt and fear, and be at peace To make a free courae for this returning love waa not only the Church's first duty, but also the one iieceBeary condition of the world's purity and happiness. The cause of the Bpecial doubt and indifference of modern times waa (he difficulty of reconciling Holy Scripture with our advancing knowledge of nature and history. To clear that difficulty ont of the way we must first gain a better knowledge of the true character of the sacred writings. It waB not poaaible for him to ex preBB his disgust at the vulgar and blaa phemoua railings of certain American models. Another very important ques- tion to be considered was, What was meant by revelation and inspiration? To what degree was the human element in tho prophet's character and knowledge Buffered to colour and condition bia measage ? It was at such congresses that differences of opinion on these mattera might be expected to find expression. The congreas waa not a legiala tive body, or even, in the full senBo of the word, a deliberative body, for it waa not allowed to come to any résolution on the subjects discussed. But for that very reason discusBion could be all the more frank and free. Let every man say out the very last word that he deaired to say. Pettifogging bigotries only flouriBhed in the stagnation of little coteneB Again, at Buch congreBaea the church learned the average of opinion amongat her members, and might gather thence what changea would be aafe and necesBary. Theao meetings, by shaking deep rooted prejudices, by Btirring incipient germa of thought and feeling, by breaking down miBunderBtandings and drawing honest minda into a nearer agreement, would raise the general level of thought, and proporo the poBBibihty of Eeacoful and salutary advance. The ohurch era would ever remain an integral portion of the English church, ond the Australian General Synod had as good a right to take the initiative in any movement of general intereet as either of the home provinces In their newer and freer life in Australia they c uld perulpa spoak moro plainly than their breihri-n across the water 'J lit firnt Bubject discussed was ' The Rela- tion of the Church of England to all 1'ioteeiant Churches ' Archdeacon Hales read tho first paper, in which he maintained that there was a clear, distinct, and decided relationship between the church and other Protebtant societies in policy, history, law, mid the essential doctnnea of Christianity. Neither the Liturgy nor the Thirtynine Articles wero essential to the church's exist- ence Ihe law of unity was Christs, and was no moro bound and fettered by eccle- siastical systems than the breezes of tLe open beavens were restrained and divided by Ihe little fences with which man divided th.e Eurface of the earth Canon Chalmors, who followed, eaid that the relation of the Church of England to tho various British Protestant denominations could be nothing short of amicable and friendly The pastors mid teachers of euch denominations ought to he recognised by the Church of England aa a (rue pastorale and teaching body to those who from vanoua circumatances had been led to nccept their ministry, but they did not, of course, hold any Buch position to members of the Church of England, who maintained that the ministry waa derived otherwise than tbey derived it The prin- ciple of religious and social equality should also be recognised Ho did not, however, think it would be well to admit the ministers of other churches to minister to Church of England fiocka while Anglican clergymen miniBtered to them Canon Sel- wyn urged the members of the church, if they desired closer relationship with their Pro- testant brethren to make the advances, and to, in the first place, set their own houses in order and divest themselves of their pré- judices All wisdom did not live and d15 w'tb" those who framed the articles, and he did not eeo why ministers should not hold, BO to apeak, a double or treble commission Sir W E Stawell, Chief Justice, said that, much aa unity must be desired, the Church ot Eug land could not concede any part of that which waa given to it to ensure that unity The prospect of the nonconformists returning to the church seemed to many hopeless As to an interchange of pulpits a question of church law was at the outset m volved At the same time ho could not believe that those who held the truths taught m our common Bible could be allowed to continue separated one from the other Several other speakers took part 111 the elia cufesion, amon"at whom waa the president, who said he could not Bee why, as a question of principle, some of the moro eminent of the ministers of other Protestant churches should not be allowed to do duty in Anglican churches But ho did not want a regular interchange of pulpits Die next subject was " The Duty of the Church of Luglandin Reference to Unbelief 'Hie BiBhop of JNewcaBtle remarked that it was the duty of churchmen to bo ju3t to ali in thought and speech Difficulties in the way of belief ought not to be treated lightly and contemptuously The creation of difficulties ot belief ought to be considered, and aedenda ought not to be needlessly multiplied. Dean Russells paper urged that unbelievers ought not to be regarded as personal adversaries The Rev. R Potter expressed his belief in the doctrine of evolution, but science would never get at the whole truth of the matter, because their were factors in the process beyond its reach. Moral freedom and responsibility wero the practical bases of religion It was the church s duty to make specially prominent the har moniBing action of the great facts on which her faith was built, and to go in search of facta 'Ihe Rev H B Macartney expressed bia surprise at Mr Potter s belief in evolu tion Ihe president endorsed the Bishop of Newcastle s opinion as to the undesirable ness of unnecessarily multiplying creienda On the Becond day, the first Bubject de- bated WOB the responsibility of the church as regardB the aborigines of Australia, the Chinese, and the Polynesians Papers on tina Bubject by the Bishop of Brisbane (read in his absence by theBishop of NorthernQueensland), Canon M'Cullagh, Mr W E Morns, and others In the first paper, the Bishop of Brisbane Btated that Victoria stood at the head of the other colonies as regarded the eflorts which had been made to ameliorate the condition of the natives of this continent Dealing with the colonies generally, he al leged that the church had fearfully neglected her responsibility with regard to the abo rigiues This opinion wa3 corroborated by several speakers The next Bubject was the relation of the church to the Bocial move- ments of the age, especially to the friendly co operative Bocietica and the movoment for shortening the hours of labour Most of the debaters urged that the church ought to evince an interest in upward social move mentB, and try to promote harmony between all clas°es, and elevate the working classes As to co operation, the Bishop of Newcastle questioned the deairableneas of the inter- ference of the clergy, on the ground that by supporting it they might alienate tho small shopkeepers 'ihe third day was devoted to the discussion of the questions of temperance and Sunday observance. As to the former subject, various opinions were expressed as to the desirability of total abstinence, and as to whether it was the duty of churchmen to become total abstainers in order to set an example to the weak The president and others expressed the opinion that total abstainers are apt to injure their cause by violence of language and wholesale denunciations of moderate men On the Sunday observance question, the partisans of Sabbatarianism were certainly not in the majority Canon Bromby was particularly liberal in his views, urging that innocent pastime was no violation of the Sabbath, and that public libraries and museums should bo opened on that day PerbapB the most important and interest- ing debate took place on the fourth and last day, on the question of the duty of the church in the circumBtancea created by our free, secular, and compulsory Education Act Archdeacon Stretch led off with a paper m which he urged that an eft ort should be made to get the Bible, or lessons from the Bible, into the Btate schools aB part of the curriculum of instruction, with, of course, a conscience clause Mr Justice Higinbotham contended that it was the duty of all the churches to uphold the secular principle of the act, and also to remove the obstacles which now prevent religious in- struction being given in auch schools He strongly objected to the proposal that Par- liament should bo desired to authorise the daily reading of the Bible by the state school teacher, with or without explanatory com- ment A knowledge of the fundamen- tal laws which, by universal consent, ought to mould the character and rule the life of every adult man should be con- veyed by education to the mind of every child, in other words, religion, including morality, should form a part, and a leading part, of the regular daily discipline and teaching of n good echool But any proposal to disturb the Becular principle of the act must, to entitle it to the favourable considera- tion of Parliament, satisfy at least two con dillons EirBt, a complete and defiuite Bchemo of religious instruction must be devised and framed by thoae who proposed a change in the law The Becond condition was that the proposed system of religious , instruction should be laid upon lines not leas broad than those of tho Christian rehgton Such a By Btem could be framed by the clergy of all, or a great majority, of the Christian churches, and, if adopted, its advantages would be incalculable But there were enormous difficulties in the way of such a union of the clergy. He concluded by denouncing the "extravagantly unjuät and arrogant ' claims of the Roman Catholic ecclesiastics Canon Goodman read the next paper, in which he pointed out that at present religious instruction could only be given in state schools after the children had been taught their secular lessons, and when they wero anxious for relaxation. 'IherowaB a want of knowledge of the art of teaching children on the part of the clergy, and it would be well to include clase teaching in the training of candidates for orders Perhaps the church might educate and pay laymen to impart religious instruction to children The concluding discussion was on tho helps and hindrances to the spiritual life arising from the religious and Becular activities of the day, including amusements. PRESBYTERIAN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. Tho annual meeting of the general aBaem bly of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria commenced in Melbourne on Monday, the 13th inst. The Rev. Dr. Mercer was ap- pointed aB moderator for the ensuing year, and delivered the customary address. On Tuesday a petition was received from the Rev. Dr Shearer, of Perth, stating that the only Presbyterian Church in Western Aus- tralia waB in Perth, and asking to be con- nected with the presbytery of Melbourne. The prayer of the petition waa granted A remit from the commission on personal cases was recieved and adopted, the recommendation being that all cases of questions affecting character, or partaking of the nature of per- sonal disputes or misunderstandings, should be dealt with by the courts of the church m private session. The Rev Dr. Nish dissented from and appealed againBt the finding of the commission on the overtures relative to the admission of students into the Theological Hall at the University, but after a discussion it waa decided not to interfere with the exist- ing arrangements, as (he students ht\d no far prosecuted their Btudies The Rev A MacVcan brought up a long report from the committee on the state of religion and on Sabbath observance It deplored the alarm mu prevalence of gambling, but waa not I without bono that the crisis had been [ reached, and tbat a reaction waa beginning, giving church bakaara aa instances of im provement Tho committee rogrettod that the tendency to extend the running of trains on the Lord s day still existed, but they were thankful that the friends of the Sabbath ni public life were watchful, and hoped their influence would resist the clamour raised for changing the character of the day The report was adpoted after a discussion The Rev fa Robinson presented the report of the Sustentation 1 und Committee, from which it appears that G1 congrepationa have been m full relation with the fund during the year. Of these 12 have boen aid giving and the surplua thus raised amounted to £37711s 2d BeBldes thia 15 congregations have sent in donutiona to the extent of £.42 Vi. 9. , and there were four private donations amount nig to £20, making a total for distribution of £1,21013s lid. Twenty seven congregations have rendered help to the weaker charges during the year-a larger number than ever did BO before The Rev. Dr Macdonald pre eented the report of the Home Mission and Church Extension Committee, and stated that the committee had very great di Hi culty in obtaining suitable gentlemen for mission work. They had now nine lay preachers out, but they could employ at least 20 Tho committeee would not, bon ever, undertake to employ any person they did not know The miBSion work, he waB glad to aay, waa Bteadily progressing, and ho deeired to mention that the Scots Church, instead of forming new churchea, were en gaged in mission work, especially m visiting the back sluma of the city In the Buburba the same good work waa being carried out The congregations of Toorak and South . arra had united, and were now aupporliiif a preacher who devoted bia time to mission work The brethren of the presbytery of Mortlake were also doing a good work m a district within their bounds which well deeerved the thanks of the Home Mission Committee and of tho church lhe district referred to WOB the Heytesbury forest, one of the roughest pieces of country in Australia The report of the committee on the proposed union of the Presbyterian churchea of Aua tralla waa received and adopted, and it was decided to hold a conference on tho Bamo subject subsequently to May, ISA and m such place aa might be considered most con- venient for all the churches concerned The aBPembly met four days during the week, and on 1 nday the Moderator entertained about ¿>0 ladies and gentlemen at lunch m the Melbourne Town hall BAPTIST ASSOCIATION Or VICTORIA Tho annual sittings of the Baptist Aaso ciation were commenced on the loth mat in the Baptist Church, Collins street, Mel bourne The inaugural address waa given by the Rev Wm Clarke, the chairman, for the current year He congratulated the association upon tho steady progress which waB being made by tho denomination in Aus- tralia lhere waa no longer any neceasity to apeak of themselves as few and unpri/ed Their numbers had been multiplied, and they were now a great force. He proceedod to quoto atatistica to show the progresa which the de- nomination had made in South Australia, New South W ales, Queensland, and other colonies, and alao in Victoria, showing that in tliia colony they bad at the commence meet of the last decade church accommoda- tion for 8 700 persone, and 3,000 Sunday acholara, and at ita close they had accommo- dation for 11072, their members advanced by 3 893, and their Sunday acholara by 5,310 The population increased one sixth in the decade, but their church property had doubled in value They had more than double tho attendance at their Sunday schools, and their numbera had increased by 25 per cent , BO that they had come to occupy the premier place among the denomi nations as regarded proportionate growth On Tuesday the Rev A J Clarke and the Rev. Dr Porter were elected aa chairman and preacher reapectively for the euBUing year, and in the evening the customary association sermon waa preached by the Rev 1 G. Buckingham. On Wednesday a repchrt was presented on the progresa of mission work at Maimanaing, a large district in Eastern Ben- gal, containing a population of one and a half millions, which is in the hands of the BaptiBtB of Victoria In Victoria, balla- rat, Kew, Castlemaine, and Stawell were referred to as placea in which more than ordinarily good work had been ac complished during the year It waa luti mated by the Rev. A J Clarke that a iotal Abstinence Society had juat been formed under the presidency of the Rev Dr Porter, and ita members were desirouB of receiving the encouragement and patronage of the association Several speakers referred in terms of satisfaction to the establishment of Buch a society, and it waa unanimously de cided to accord the sympathy and support of the association to the newly formed society On the motion of Mr T Stone, it waa de- cided to CBtabliah a lay preachers' négocia- tion, to which eligible young men might be admitted and trained for the Ministry Tho Rev Dr Reea brought the question of public education before the association, and aub untied a resolution disapproving of free schools, and affirming that the teachera, aa a body, were disqualified from teach- ing the Bible The resolution lapsed for want of a Beoonder. The Rev Silas Mead, of Adelaide, expressed himself aa strongly in favour of Bible reading in state schools, Some years ago he held the opposite opinion, but experience and observa- tion had convinced him of ita absolute neces- sity Morality could not be taught indepen- dently of God, and the Bible waa really tho only book for the purpose In his own colony, South Australia, a poll of the inhabi- tants had been taken with the result that a majority of 7 to 1 voted in favour of Bible reading. Major Ferguaon, another South Auatralian delegate, stated that the majority on the occasion of the poll referred to was nine to one. The reprrt of the Home Missions Committee Btatcd that tho mission stations in the Murray and Goulburn Valley districts had prospered during the year, and were now established on a permanent baais In the evening the annual meeting of the Baptist Home Missionary Society was held in the Collins-street church. There was a large attendance. Mr. Charles Andrews presided. Addresses were delivered by the chairman, the Rev. S. Mead, the Rev. C. Pickering, Mr. C. Palmer, and other gentlemen. This con- cluded the business of the session. GOLD AND THE GOLDFIELDS. The gold minea generally aro continuing to yield well, judging from the reporta to hand from the various districts The seven pnn cipal deep alluvial mines in the Creswick dis- trict, which have given very large yields for some time past, appear to bo as rich as ever Last week tho returns from them amounted to2,.lloz, and in the previous week to 2,5Gloz. In addition to the satiafactory accounts re ceived during the paBt fortnight from tho principal old eatabliahed goldfields, several interesting items of newa have been received which ahow that new mining country ia being opened up, and new claims discovered on existing fields. Mr P. B W allace, M L A , brought to Mel- bourne, on the 11th met, 5800? retorted gold obtained from 117 tonB of stone taken from a claim on tho Surprise Reef in the Omeo dis- trict, in which he is interested The dis coveiy of this reef was made about 12 months ago, and it is now being developed Recently the Gambetta Company, on the same reef, obtained 391o/ from 00 tons of atone, and the Polar Star Company 27Soz from 70 tons of stone. Some of the richest quartz ever discovered m the ranges waa brought into Walhalla township on the 17th inBt. by Mr, P, W. Gilsenan, the diecoveier The atone waa obtained from the drive of the Long Tuunel and LonRfellow's ConBola Company's lease, at a depth of 20ft from the surface, The reef it waB taken from is 18in. thick, The Langridge Company, Reedy Creek, waBhed up on Friday last for the handsome return of IDOoz. of retorted gold, from 37. loads, being an average of lo/, to the ton The reef maintains ita size, and is improving considerably m quality. The New Discovery Company's claim at Beaufort is now Rivmg excellent yields On Saturday, the 11th inBt, the company exhibited 107oz i" the shop window of MeBsrs Wotherspoon and Co., at Beaufort the result of nine dayB' work, and in five days since then they obtained 130oz. Fifteen tons of stone recently obtained from Lockes Company's claim, Maldon, gave the splendid return of 225oz gold, or 15oz to the ton, and the stone remaining in the mine IB said to be magnificent. A correBpondentof the (Jipps Land Me¡ cm y states that " a company has been formed in Ballarat, to develope one of the deep leads known to exist in Gipps Land. Before taking the matter up, the Ballarat capitalists were invited to Bend over a practical man, in whom they had confidence, to report on the undertaking. The company has secured a prospecting claim of 2 400ft on the course of the lead. Men aro already on the ground getting timber for the shaft Tho name of the company is ' The Tangil Deep Lead G M Co. " In the ropoit alluded to, furnished by Mr Keelan, ho quotes Mr. Reginald Murray, Government geologist who, ia his report on the district dated 1378, points oat that tho fossils found in the deep ground ara precisely of the same character aa those found in similar situations in Ballarat Mr. Keelan adds, ' Personally, I can confidently say that I seo no reason why, with adequate capital and skill, a very large alluvial district should not be opened up in many respects precisely analogous to the Ballarat alluvial " A comparative return of the yield of gold in tho colony for the f rat nine months of 1882 and 1881 has been prepared by tbo Minmi, deportment, and shows an increase of 20 000e/ ni favour of this year.

In both the city of Melbourne and the surrounding suburbs buildings are going up m all directions, whilst numbers of persons are prevented from com- mencing to build on account of the scarcity of labour and bricks.

IXTEBCOLOXIAL. NEW SOUTH WALES, Political interest has centred in the debate on the second reading of the Land Bill. This bill represents Sir John Robertson's policy of free eelection before survey, with Borne addi- tional precautions intended to check abuses that have eprung up. The bill waa very severely criticised m the course of a long de- bate. The motion for its second reading waa negatived by 43 votes to 33 Only 7û members voted out of 107, there bemg at present one vacancy The Opposition claimed that at least 10 members who were absent would have voted with them, besides others trom whom they bad no positive promis», but who had privately expressed opinions adverse to the bill. The Government have advised the Governor to grant a dissolution of the As- sembly. Sir Henry Parkes explained at length hiä reasons for advising tola course His Excellency expressed his entire con- currence with the reasons the Premier ad- duced and assented at once to dissolve Parlia- ment, the dissolution to take place a3 soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. A serions railway accident has occurred near Bathurst. A mail train from Sydney was approaching the Bathurst station at the rate ot ten miles an hour, when it ran into a goode train that was standing on the main line ol rails preparatory to being shunted, and a terrific collision ensued. The driver of the mail tram applied the break, shut on the steam, and jumped off, escaping unhurt. The driver of the good3 tram also escaped unin- jured One of the passenger cars waa wrecked, the tool bein? partially rai-^d, the end com. pletely knocked oat, and the siles split to pieces. At the injured end were seated Mrs. jacob Knight and child, a railway porter and his wife named O Keele, who were travelling to Spring grove, and who had with them an adopted son about 11 years old. Mrs Knight was pitched out with her ch.ld, and severely shaken. The pcrter and his wife were also knocked about, but the Boy was the most eenouely injured, as he had both thighs broken It was a miracle tbat they were not all killed, as the compartment they occupied was smashed to atom', and one of the sides knocked clean away. A Mrs. Daly and several members of the Montague-Turner opera troupe were much injured. An extensive strike has occurred among wharf labourers. Tne str.ke of the labourers is having a very injurious effect upon the shipping trade, as it is causing gr«-it delay to the vessels in port. The ma='»r3 of the wool ships are making use of the'r crews to load and unload. Ihe Australian Eleven of cricketers have returned to "vdney by the as City of New York. The vessel as it sailed up the harbour was decorated in honour of the victorious cricketers on board The members of the New South Wales Cricket Association, with a number of cricketers, went down the harbour to meet the Australians At the Circular Quay between 300 and 100 people as sembled to welcome the colonial team As soon as the steamer drew alongside, and the Australians landed, three cheers were given. The team were then driven in a four in hand drag to the city and formally welcomed by the New Sonth Wales Cricket Association. They were received with great enthusiasm. SOUTH AUSTRALIA The Governor has prorogued Parliament until tith February. His Eicellency specially congratulated Parliament on the p^s'ing of the 'S ictonan Eorder Railway Bill, the resolu- tions in favour of an International Exhibí tion, and the adoption of his defence pro- posals. The session has been fruitful of u=eful legislation. Besides the I »nd Bill, which contains some liberal concessions to those selectore who like to avail them selves of ita provisions, the passage» of the Border Radway Bill and the Ocean Dock Bill represent t-vo important undertakings Ihe latter provides for the construction of a most i/nportant work, namely, a dock in which 17 of the largest steamers afiost can he, each steamer lying alongside its own wharf, with ra.lway lines all along the wharfs, and thc-e lines being connected with the in tercelomat railway and the ra-lway sys-em ot thee kny.

Mr M'llwTaith, the Premier, baa be°n oi a visit to the Northern distnc, and wi 1 visit Thornborough, Herberton, Port Douglas, and Townsville before returning. He is ex pected to reach Brisbane m the first week cf December. Mr. C. Palmerston, the explorer, ha? arrived at Herberton from the Johnstone River. He reports that there is no diTiculty in Eurmounting the range, and believes that a railway ia practicable from Herberton to Mourilyan. He found extremely rich so 1 all the way, and saw the colour of gold all along the north of the Johnstone River. A Eenous disturbance took piare at Bun- daberg, when ~/f) Cingalese labourers by the Devonshire were landed While marching to the plantation» '/> whites endeavoured to impede tbe.r progres». Tne Cingalese drew their knives and made towards their a-sailants, who r3n away. Twelve coolies refused to go to the plantations, and were brought in'o town and lodged at an hotel by the Antt- coolie League A meeting was sub- sequently held at whfh an intelligent Indian, speaking m fluent English, stated that the Cingalese bad been brought to Queensland under false pretences, and that tbe.r agree ment was illegal. AH the Cingalese in Banda berg refused to work on the plantations V bite tvjtatora are encouraging tnem. Grea excitement prevails. the Gympie correspondent of the Brisbane Cotirv, speaking of the late crushing of the South New Zealand mine at Gympie, says - "A splendid yield resulted from the recent crushirg of the South New Zealand a», was anticipated, the average jielJ per ton being lloz., and a dividend of 2s. 6¿ per «bare-equal to £3,000-has been declared from the proceeds. It is reasonable to con elude that there will be a continuance o good yield», as the run of gold still leids on in the south underhand stope», and there re- mains a considerable extent of ground in this direction yet to take out ere the cro3»coursa is reached. Since the crushing was eomple'ed another small patch of epecimenä have been obtained that were estimated to contain about 4ïoz. of the precious metal." KEW ZEALAND. Thongh Mr. Bryce, the Minuter for Native Anairs, has B3 yet been unsuccessful m his definite proposals to Tawhiao, the Maori King, to Bbandon his kingship and submit absolutely to tne Queen's law, there ¡3 hope of advances coming from the natives at no very distant date. Tawhiao and his people are Btated to be in the lowest depths of impe cunioaity, and the native landowners are siid to be beginning to feel severely the necessity of civilisation advancing so as to enable tbem to utilise their land now lying waste. No doubt ia entertained by those beat ac- quainted with native affaira that Mr, Bryce will _ucce«d in carrying out his carefully, matured plana before many months are over. The late rams have done the crop3 a great deal of good, and they are looking eplenonly through the sonth. TVESTERX AUSTRALIA.
