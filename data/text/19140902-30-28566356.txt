POPULATIO4 OF GERfiMANY. Some interesting particulars regarding the population of the German Empire are given in the "German Year Book. 1914," edited by H. A. Walter, and just pub lished by the Anglo-German Publishing Company. The German Empire in Europe covers an area of 208.777 square miles. The population of the Empire is now about sixty-eight millions. Its growth has been continuous during the last century, par ticularly since the foundation of the new empire in 1871. At present it increases at the rate of over 800,000 per year, due mainly to the surplus of births over deaths, and, to a small extent, to immi gration from neighbouring countries. The emigration of Germans into foreign coun tries is much smaller than the emigration from Britain, but there is, nevertheless, a large number in every habitable part of the globe. All Europeans as well as ovdrsea coun tries have a more or less large German population running very often into six figures. IThe aggregate number of Ger mans in the world in the current year, as far as can be estimated, reaches 100 mil I lions. Large numbers of foreigners live in Germany. Austrians, Hungarians, Poles. Russians, Italians, Dutch, French, and Danish to a large extent settle perman Iently in Germany, because opportunities I are greater there than in their native countries. The foreign population proper in Germany amounted at the census of 1910 to 1,259,873. More than 50 per cent. were of Austrian nationa:ity (634,983), Dutchmen came next with 144,175, follow ed by Russians (137,697), and Italians (104,204). Of British nationality there were 18,319 people, as against 16,130 in 1900\. The great number of these foreigners are unskilled labourers. Like all other great nations of to-day, Germany has become a nation of town dwellers. Almost three- fifths of the popu lation live under urban conditions. The number of p'eople engaged in agricultural pursuits has remained stationary since the beginning of the last century, while all in crease of population during the last 50 years has gone to swell the town popula tion. When the empire was founded in 1871 there were only eight (owns with a population of over 100,000 inhabitants. whereas the number of such towns in 1913 was 1,150. Towns with over 500,000 in habitants in 1910 were:-Berlin, 2.071.257; Hamburg, 931,035; Munich, 596,467: Leip zig, 589,850; Dresden, 548,308; Cologne, 516,527; and Breslau, 512,105. There has been, according to the "Bri tannica Year Book," no proper census in the Russian Empire since 1897, but the Central Statistical Committee issues an nual estimates of the population, based on the yearly returns. ,The total population for 1911 was put at 167,003,400 (European Russia, 120,858,000; Poland, 12,467,300; Caucasus, 12,037,200; Siberia, 8,719,200; Central Asia, 10,197,300; Finland, 3,064, 400). The various peoples of Russia have altogether 101 different lanrguages, Russian predominating in 41 of the 78 provinces, 21 territories and 2 circuits, into which the country is divided for administration. The population of St. Petersburg is given as 1,982,400, Moscow 1.533,400, Warsaw 872,478, Odessa 505.600, Riga 331,300, Kharkov 236.042, Lodz 208,330: and 21 other towns have between 100,000 and 200, 000\. Census work has been done in the chief cities since the general numbering of the people in 1897, and it is considered certain that St. Petersburg now contains over two million inhabitants. The urban population of the whole Empire is 23,177, 700, including Finland (459,000), Caucasus (1,577,500). Siberia (1,050,600), and Central Asia (1,385,500). The rural population is 143,825,700, cf which European Russia counts 104,790,100. According to informa tion issued by the Chief Medical Inspector of the Ministry for Internal Affairs, the death rate of European Russia in 1909 was 28.9 and the birth rate 43.8 per 1,000. This. was a less favourable year from a sanitary point of view than the two preceding. and the increase of the population was. lower than for 12 years previously. except m 1905\. For 20 years down to 1910 the birth rate generally fluctuated.between 47.10 in 1903 and 49.5 in 1891.
