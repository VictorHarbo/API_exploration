This included £23,000 each from the Commercial, the National, and tile E.S. and A. Banks, and the Bank of Victoria. The highest tender was 2102, and the gross proceeds amounted to £202, 131. The amount allotted in full was ¿'124,950, and pro rata A 5,050. The debentures are redeemable in 36 years, and the minimum was fixed at AH. Another banking absorption is announced from England, Parr's Bank having taken over the Whitehaven Joint Stock Banking Co. The latter was established, in 1829, but less only A34 000 deposits. Parr's has .£28,723,000. 2 The wine and spirit sectional committee of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce has recommended that the Board of Health of New South Wales be asked, before fixing the- standard with regard to the purity of brandy, to confer with the leading members of the wine and spirit trade through the medium of the chamber. Tee Immigration and Tourist Bureau of New South Wales is arranging itineraries of short trips to be made by members of the Empire Congress of Chambers of Commerce, fixed for next year. The president of the Associated Chambers of Com- force of the Commonwealth and the pre- sidents for the time being in each State capital have been appointed vicr-pret>i dents of the Empire Congress, to be held in Sydney in September next. The Silverton Tramways Co. has declared a dividend of 1s. and a bonus of 1s. per share, payable on December 1. The Australian Land; . Mortgage, and Agency Co. Limited has declared a 5 per cent dividend. McDonald and Co. Limited has been formed with a capital of A1O.0GO in 1 share-, 4,000 of which will be issued as fully paid up, to take over the business of Alexander Joseph McDonald, trading as McDonald and Co., and to carry on the business of manufacturers' agents, indentors, and warehousemen. The first directors of the company, whose registered office will be in Sydney, will be Messrs. Alexander Joseph McDonald and Cecil Aubrey Coghlan. The New South Wales Government is advertising for immigrants in the United States. In the American advertisements the Government points out that New South Wales, with its population of a little more than a million and a quarter, does nearly as large a trade as Japan, with her 18,000,000. According to the "Economist," England has invested A_50,00!),000 in Argentina, including .£138,000,000 in Aigenrino railways, towards which latter the British subscriptions have reached A53,000,0O9 in the past eight years, or an average of over A6,GÖO,000 per annum. Latterly, indeed, those subscriptions have been at a much more rapid pace. It is not British people who flock to Argentina, but Italians and Spaniards. All the same, it is British capital which has sent the country ahead and reckoning on the present rate of capital assistance being maintained, the "Economist" thinks that there may be .£350,000,000 or 100,000,000 embarked by Great Britain in Argentina by 1910. Whereas the trade of the United States is only 35 dollars per head of population, that of New South Wales is equal to 173 dollars per head, or if inter-State trade be included to 223 dollars per head. On the question of the control of the sale of Australasian butter in London through the co-operation of the various co-operative butter factories and distributing agencies at present at work on this side of the world, the London representative of a Sydney mercantile firm wrote, under recent date: "Sydney co-operatives advocate concentration in London of all co-operative factories through one pro- prietary company. Two Victorian com- panies-Gippsland and Western District started their first season's business with this particular company, but discontinued it at the end of the season. One of these companies has since been selling their butter themselves on the London market. New South Wales factories are led to believe that Victorian factories are all going to concentrate,, with them on one floor, which this season, so far, is not correct, nor are they likely to do so. To control the value of colonial butter in the London market is impossible, unless the same co-operative representatives are also allowed to control the price of Danish butter, as the values ruling for. the largest bulk and best quality must always re- gulate the lesser quality and quantity of colonial in proportion to itself." A return issued by the Board of Trade shows that during the eight months ended August the United Kingdom led the world as exporter and importer. Her exports were -30,174,000 more than these of America, her nearest competitor, and over- 28. percent, in excess of French and Belgian exports in combination. For the seven months ended July the exports of the United Kingdom exceeded America's by "22,391,000, so that she further im- proved-her advantage by £7,783,000 in August. British imports for the eight months ended August exceeded those of America, France, and Belgium in combination by A-1,222,0!». ' Mr. Farleigh, one of the delegates from New South Wales State to the Manufacturers' Conference in Melbourne, quoted some rather striking figures, showing the progress of New South Wales. At the end of 1907 New South Wales, he said, had 4,387 manufacturing establishments, an increase of 1,020 over 1901; and 87,104 hands were employed, an increase of 20,96 over 1901. The total wages paid in 1907 was X6,G79,O00, an increase of "1,734, 000 in six years. The output from those-" tories was "25,000.000 in 1901, and Loan disputed that it had reached i'40,000,000 in 1907. In Victoria the number of hands employed in 1907 was 71,090, an increase of 4,000, while New South Wales had in creased 10,000 during the same year. While the consumptive demand for Indian tea is making steady progress in many Continental, countries; the expansion in the Russian trade, is of particular interest and importance. The following figures show how the Continental trade in India and Ceylon teas has grown when compared with 18 years ago, the figures for the past three years being given for purposes of easy comparison: - 1890.'. 14,00 821 '.' . 1903\. 123,8B4,250 1905 .'... 162,461.824, 1907 (estimated)'...,... 171,500,900 The development of the' Indian and Ceylon tea trade with Russia really dates from the discovery that Indian dust gives a greater strength to "tablet" tea than Chinese. Indian tea reaches Russia not only by direct shipments but also across the land frontiers of India and by re-ex- port fWm the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. It has been estimated that Russia in the nine months ended September 30, 1907, absorbed 30,."i-12,081Ib. of Indian and Ceylon teas, as compared with 24,5GS,3291b. for the "me nine months of the previous year. These figures exclude imports of brick tea from China, in which Indian dust has been blended, estimated at 3,000 000lb. in 1907 or, proportionately. 6.000 000lb. for the period January September. Mr. H. C. Cameron, of the New Zealand High Commissioner's Produce D? partment. recently gave evidence before the Departmental Committee appointed by the Board of Trade to inquire into combinations in the meat trade in the United Kingdom. Mr. Cameron subsequently stated that generally the evidence taken before the committee was of a formal character. The business of Hope Brothers, Limited, which is so largely and deservedly patronised by Australians on a visit to London, continues to expand. The chairman informed the shareholders at a recent meeting that the sales during the past twelve months and the number of customers served had been considerably greater than the preceding year. Mr. Jackson looks forward hopefully to the continued steady increase in the business in which the directorial motto is "Good quality at moderate prices." That they are so successful in giving effect to this is due to the fact that most of the articles supplied by the company are made in its own factories, and thus the middleman's profit is saved, and the advantage given to the customers. In October some cases of navel oranges from Victoria were sold on the Co vent Garden market. Prices averaged 15s 6d to 21s. per case. The novels arrived -in good condition, a trifle small in the case at times, but on the whole they turned I out well. Mr Charles Haas, Tunnel, Tas., says: "For many years I was a sufferer from Liver Complaint, from which I could obtain no relief. Three years ago I commenced using Chamberlain's Tablets, and the result was so satisfactory that I am now never without a bottle in the house. Many of my friends used them on my recommendation."
