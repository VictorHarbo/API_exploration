To tlie Electors of Brisbane North. Gentlemen, — After throe years of Parliamentary life, during which a careful and constant attention on my part to the welfare of Brisbane and district has gained the appreciation of my fellow-oitizons, I again, and with confidence, solicit your support for myself at the coming election. QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIES. . As tho industrial condition of the colony is of first and paramount importance, I shall encourage the advancement and expansion of our manufacturing and commorcial life, know ing that, to become independent, we must become self-dependent. THE LAND QUESTION. I shall favour legislation calculated to assist and develop agricultural and pastoral indus tries, making land settlement more attractive und securo than hitherto. LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Years of practical exporicnco convince me that many radical chungca arc required in our system of local government. I shall, therefore, support any well digested mea sure that will cnlurge their powers — cen- Iralise and improve their administration, and make such bodies more than mere scavengers and street repairers. I atu also of opinion that,- as the necessities of municipal govern ment vary from those of divisional boards, it would be advantageous to have .separate legislative Acts -suitable to their respective needs. I shall likewise favour, as soon as the state of the Treasury permits, an in creased Government endowment. PACIFIC CABLE.. I shall support a proportionotc contribution with our sister colonics towards a Pacific cable. IMMIGRATION. Believing wo suffer from a dearth of suit able population, I would favour a judicious schemo'of immigration. RAILWAYS. Experience shows that those countries which have established trunk railway lines have developed their resources quickest and to greatest advantage ; I should, therefore, regard with favour a policy that would do the same for Queeusland. I am in favour of tho connection of tho South-western, Northern, and South Coast railway systems by an extension from Mel bourne street to Roma street or Central station, and also the extension of the South Coast Railway to the Tweed, in order to tap the trade that legitimately belongs to Queensland. The work has been loudly called for by tbc inhabitants of the districts interested on both sides of ths Tweed, and was advocated by me at a deputation which, accompanied by the Mayor of Lisniorc and others, waited on the present Premier when he was Minister for Railways. ELECTORAL REFORM. I shall support a sound measure ot' electoral reform, including redistribution of seats. ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE. I am not ono of those who are frightened at this so-called bogey, believing that it is sure to come in the near future, and shall be prepared to support it. WOMAN SUFFRAGE. I see no reason, why women, who voto at municipal and other louil govommont elec tions, should be debarred fiom tho Parlia mentary franchise. I shall; therefore, support an extension of the suffrage in that direction. ALIEN LABOUR. I object to, und shall voto against, the introduction of all Asiatic aliens. FEDERATION. Federation is an important matter, requir ing much consideration, and should not be lightly entered upon. I am with it gener ally, hut have strong and particular objec tions regarding the fiscul question : New South Wales and Victoria are, industrially, prepared colonies ; we arc unprepared, and there is the danger that Queensland would become the tnere dumping-ground for their products, which would seriously damage, if not destroy, our j'oung industries, aud materially injure the employment and wages of tho workers and cause a serious decrease in I the value of property. I shall only favour federation upon condition that, for the next ten (10) years, our fiscal policy remains in our own hands. By that time we would, probably, ho ill a position to accept inter colonial frcetrade upon equal terms. LOCAL AFFAIRS. Regarding local matters, I may say with out fear of contradiction, that I huvo done as much as tho best. FLOOD PREVENTION. When I was before you three years ago I submitted n scheme and report relative to the diversion of flood waters iu the Brisbane River. The survey upon which that scheme aud report wore founded — aud carried out by Mr. Rogers, tho City Engineer — was under taken at my instigation while Mayor of tho city, and at considerable pursonnl exponso. Although it wouljl be a costly work, still I am satisfied that it is tho best and most feasible scheme yet propounded. The idea is to tap tho Brisbane River in the neighbour hood of Oxley, conducting tho excess of flood waters to tho Bay by Tingalpa Creek. The scheme and report are now in possession of tho Governmeut, aud I shall use my utmost endeavours to see it carried into effect. I shall, however, support any reasonable scheme calculated to protect the city from the disas trous effects of floods. LIBRARY AND ART GALLERY. The city is also indebted to my exertions, along with those of others, for the Public Library und Art Gallery, for which the sum of twenty thousand pounds (£29,000) has been placed on tho Estimates. WORKS POLICY. I have supported the Government Works policy, and seen that Brisbane has received attention commensurate with its metropolitan importance, as tho proposed now Central Railway Station and other important city works attest, and towards whioh the first in stalment of twenty-four thousand pounds (£24,000) has been provided for on the Estimates. HARBOUR IMPROVEMENTS. With regard to hnrbour improvements, I can boldly affirm that, during my Mayoralty and Parliamentary caroer, I have done more thau any other single person towards their accomplishment. During those periods I hare hud a large hand iu ail harbour develop- meuts, and there are somo which are of the greatest importance now being undertaken, altogether at my instigation, and whioh involve tho expenditure of thousands of pounds, and -will take years to complete. It seems to mo that the port of Brisbane and harbour have become a parrot cry with persons who have never done one jot or tittlo towards their im provement. It will, perhaps, bo news to such to learn that the preliminary work (boring, &c.;) in connection therewith is now in progress, Siud upon the arrival of dredges, the work will bo actively prose cuted. It is my intention to still further labour in that direction until Brisbane be comes one of the foremost ports in Australia, and second to nono south of the lino. Electors, you will . recognise that I have done my duty to our city und district. That I do not cpme before you with a bundle of promises, but present you with good, sub stantial results, which I am certain you will nppreoiate at its honest value. I have not been a talker, but a worker and a doer. I solioit your favours at the Poll as an Independent Candidate, and shall address you in publio at an curly dute, to be duly advertised. I am.
