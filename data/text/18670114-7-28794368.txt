COMMERCIAL. WEEKLY EPITOME. Advertiser and Chronicle Offices, Saturday evening, January 12. The week has been very quiet, and merchants have been holding back in expectation of the mail, which arrived veiy punctually on Thursday morning. The arrival of tbe English mail was eagerly anticipated by parties interested in the bread stuffs trade, and as the advices speak of higher rates and continued firmness in the market, we may fairly calculate upon a good trade. We most earnestly advise fanners to send a portion of their wheat to market, as by selling part of their crop at !-., tbey will secure good prices for tbe remainder. If this course is not pursued we shall lose the export trade, and prices will fall rapidly as the season advances. The difficulty is to get money for purchases, and this difficulty has been magnified by false reports about the Banks. It has been rumored that a meeting of all the Bank Managers lias been held, at which it was determined to make no advances whatever upon shipments of wheat for England, but we can give the statement a flat contradiction. Tho only transactions of any consequence in the share market have been in Lyudoch Valley, Paramatta, Euko, aud Adelaide Banks, and Poona. Paramatta, 325. to '365. ; Euko, 355. to 3'Ja. ; Poona, 20s. ; Lyudoch Valley, £i 2s. 6U. to £3 12s. CO. ; Adelaide Bank. £3~ There was an average attendance at the Government Laud Sale ou Thursday.

There is a good demand at our quotations of 4s. We beg to refer our readers to our remarks on the corn trade at tbe commencement of this article. A moderate amount of business has been done in flour, principally for local requirements. Country brands are worth £10 to £10 10s., and Town brands £1010s. to £1110s. There is very little done in minor cereals, and the market for brau and jKillard is dull. The following are the latest quotations:—Cape barley, 2s. 9d. to 3s. 3d.; English do., 3s. 6d. to 4s.

Stock Maki--.t. —The following is Dean, Laughton, Jc Co.'a fortniglitly stock market report, dated Adelaide, January 3, 15G7.-Fat Cattle—Supplies hava been moderate, aud chiefly of fwir md good qualities. Owing to the holidays business has been slack, though still equal to the light supplies brought forward, which met ready sale at fully late Slices.- Stocks in the band, of the trade are ght, both in trjtvtl and in the country, and unle-i some extraordinary supplies come to hand, prices must rule high in this market. We have sold 95 head cattle, middling to good, from Menindie, at £3 3s. Cd.; 93 do. do., good quality, for Mr. C. B.

Fat Sheep—Supplies were not so heavy as of late; we have, how. ever, no improvement to report in the quality of those brongbt forward, which were generally of an inferior description.

Horses.—This market has been completely bare during the lest fortnight and we hear of but few mobs to arrit'c within the nest week or two ; this, together with the lower prircs of fodder, will, we anticipate, have a favorable effect on price-. Farroicg horses, of a. good stamp, un broken, sell best, and are in good demand. Store Sheep—The demand for all kinds of store sheep is stall very limited. We have sold 1,600 mixed lambs at 6s. Gd.; 1,880 aged ewes, lambs at foot Stations—Nothing doing.

In bread stuffs little has transpired -, the news from England is, however, of a character likely to inspire confidence.
