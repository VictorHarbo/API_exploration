The thinking portion of tho public knows that if a man is a success he remains stationary, and 'to be successful means that he must be able to euro those who consult him. Since 1875 POULTON has had one nddress. At the samo time, look back and count the number of Professors, Surgeons, Ac., who have come and gone. You will then understand the saying of tho old philosophers, viz., "That which is good remains, that which is nought comes to nought.." The Inference is simple, and Mr. I'oulton asks no better testimonial to Ills skill and' success than this, that after'20 years' practice lie still lends the van as an expert in Chronic, Nervous nnd Local Diseases. A talk with him costs nothing, while you get on honest opinion. Medicines only charged for.

I tried various remedies, morphia injec tions, blisters Ac., and bad the best medical advice, with oulypoor results. In September, 1896, after an exposure, I had to go to bed, and could not move without crutches, the pains being so intense, having no rest night aud day. In November, 1896, reading of your wonderful cures of rheumatism, I decided to try your remedy. I did so, and iu two days had ease from pain, and before the first supply was finished the CRUTCHES WERE PUT ASIDE. I continued to improve, aud in March, 1897, I could RIDE and WALK anywhere WITHOUT ASSISTANCE, and was in better health than I had been FOR 20 YEARS. Being over, 60 yean of age, I am well ? ilcased that the cure is effectual, as it is now about 2 mouths ago since 1 was under your treatment. i will do all m my power to recommend any sufferer to try your antidote.— Gratefully yours, JAMES M'GlNNEStJ, "IUverriew," Framlingham.
