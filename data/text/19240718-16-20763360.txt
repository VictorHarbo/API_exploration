CARE'OF CREAM. Sir,-In your' Saturday's issue there ¡h an article on "Care of Cream," as com- mented on by the Butter Factory Mana- gers' Conference, from which it w'ould appear that dairymen are careless as to the quality of their cream. I can assure you wc are not, but are very often sur- prised by the grade wo get ,or ouv cream, which leaves our care in a firkt grade condition. Here is a thing which often puzzles dairymen. We read the percentage of cream received for a month is, say: first grade 9S per cent., second li per cent., and third J per cent. Butter grading for month: First frade 80 per cent., rest not mentioned. Tas l8 per cent, of first grade cream been spoilt in the factory? Anothei thing -I'd like to ask the managers is: Who buys our butter in the Old Land are they genuine distributors.or fakers? Does the British food laws permit of adulterated butter (with margarine) be- ing Bold as "butter"? I had a lad immi- grant working for' me who told me his job in london was working in a "butter factors*," where they bought no cream. But they bought Australian butter and ravorlted it. -Two boxes of butter, 401b. margarine and some water, were put on the w-orker at once, and then re- packed in the Australian boxes and sold ns "Australian butter-not quite as good as Danish." Margarine costs from 3d. to öd. per lb., so I guess there is a better profit in faking than milking. Lately, local grocers pay from 4d. to Gd. a lb. more for "farmers' butter" than the dairyman gets from the factory. Iioiv is that? If the factory managers will set themselves' to rçct management ex- penses down to a minimum, and get the best price possible for our butter, and see that it is sold to retail customers "pure," rather than criticise the work of the dairymen, tiley will bo doing some- thing to gain the confidence of suppliers. I -I am, sir, &c;, "08 PER CENT. FIRST GRADE CREAM." July 14. _.
