^nistealla Proud Of CANBERRA: A Danish journalist had grossly slandered the Australian people when he said there was no place for Europeans in Australia, the Minister for Im migration (Mr. Holt) said today. He was speaking at the first Australian Citizenship Conven tion, which resumed- in Can berra today. Australia had no reason to be other than proud of its migra tion record, he said. 'You will find intolerable people in every community. 'I would point out Austra lia's record of receiving mi grants. No country, on a popu lation basis, did more in giving help during the war to victims of the Nazi regime.' 'In view of our population, no country, including America, had a record comparable with the number of people taken into Australia from European displaced person camps. 'With few exceptions, all these people have found hap piness here,' he said. 'Records showed that only 2i per cent, of British people who had miiyated here had return ed home again. In many cases this was because they were homesick and not because of any fault they found in Aus tralia,' Mr. Holt added. Mr. Holt said the need for migration had been universally recognised. 'We need a larger popula tion for our own security. 'We must build un our re sistance against any tnr^it in the future.' 'This can be done quickly by building up, our population.'
