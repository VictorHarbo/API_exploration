Gentlemen,-Ioannot leave thehospltabloshorea Of this sunny Australasia, this "Greater Britain beyond the seas," without congratulating you upon having acquired the sole agency for that a prince of European pianofortes, "The Maps urge To the Auto soloist nothing is of greater importance than the quality of the piano upon which he is accompanied a harsh self-assertive plans, whose metallic jingle refuses either to be drowned in, or blended with, the mellow music of the flute, is in itself sufficient to rattle the most composed temper; and yet at many concerts, pianos, by renowned makers, costly, and beautifully finished to the eye, have fallen so far short of my ideal that I would gladly have used rough and ready measures for hushing their voice for ever. Not so with the Hapsburg-It is, I consider, an unrivalled instrument. i always feel at home, and as though I had met an old and trusty friend, when I find the Hapsburg on my platforms. I am glad to hear that Its sale already exceeds that of any other make, and that your efforts to place a really good piano in the house of the Australian people are receiving due appreciation. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours, etc., JOHN RADCLIFF. m s Trade Brisbane. 1st November, 1881. To Messrs. BEALE & CO. Gentlemen It affords me very great pleasure to and my testimony as to the excellence of the Maps burgPmnos. During our tour through Europe and the Australian Colonies, I have played upon many instruments of English, French, and Gorman makers, and I can confidently state that I have found none to excel, and very few to equal, the Hapsburg. For evenness of touch, purity of tone, and he admirable balance of bass and treble, it is unsurpassed as the vocalists piano. I have been particularly pleased with the beautiful quality of its treble, it blends with and sustains the voice in Its highest efforts. I am, Gentlemen, Yours, &o;" PAULINE RITA. BEALE & CO. have twice as large a stock of Pianos to choose from as that of any other firm La Queensland. BEALE & CO. give the Longest Term of Time Payment, two years (2 years).

The Hapsburg has an imperishable Iron Frame. The Hapsburg Is Double Oblique. The Hapsburg is the Newest Trichord. The Hapsburg is never less than Seven Octaves. The Hapsburg has Plated faced West plank. The Hapsburg has Wire-clinched Hammer felt. The Hapsburg has Played Wrestlers, which cannot rust.
