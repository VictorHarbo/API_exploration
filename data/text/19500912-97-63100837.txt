NEW AUSTRALIANS They Come From Many Lands (From our special representative.) CANBERRA, September 11— Of nor* than 72,400 triTcllen who arrived in Anstnlia from orateu durinf the March quar ter of foil jtu 51,409 were people who intended to remain here pennanenuy, according to figures released by the Common wealth Statistician. Thus it will be seen that the tar get of 200,000 aimed at for the whole year by the Minister for Im migration (Mr. Holt) seems likely to be reached. Allowing for depar tures from Australia the net per manent gain to population through migration was 48,200. To. what extent the migration movement is going to reduce the predominantly British character of Australia's population — It has been our booBt that we are '98 per cent British'— we do not know. It de pends upen how long the move ment continues. But of the 61,409 permanent new arrivals during the quarter ended March 83,122 (64.4 per cent) were non- British, whilst 18,287 (35.6 per cent) were British. The number of males who arrived to settle in this country totalled 29,950 and females 21,459. Persons not 'gainfully occupied' (mainly housewives, students and children) numbered 23,197. The others were classified as follows: Males: Craftsmen, 8383; rural, fish ing, hunting, S982; operatives 2883; labourers 2629; commercial, clerical 1914. Females: operatives 1340; commercial, clerical 1321; pro fessional and semi-proresrional 952; domestic etc. 926. The migration flow began to as sume important dimensions in 1949 when we made a net gain in popu lation of 48,468. Gathering im petus, due in large measure to the energy and enthusiasm of Mr. Cal weU, who was then Minister for Immigration, it brought us ? net gain of 149,270 in 1949—87,856 males and 61,415 females. Of these, 46,800 arrived in the last quarter of that year. MANY POLES AND ITALIANS Arranged according to country of last permanent residence, the largest inflow of migrants was from Germany, but few of them were Germans— they were 'dis- placed persons.' Thev numbered 16,612 In the quarter ended March, as compared with 13.879 from Great Britain. In the last quarter of 1949, however, there were 13,623 new permanent arrivals from Britain as against 5906 from Germany. According to nationality, next to the British by far the largest number of new arrivals are Pol ish (Including 'Stateless Poles'), and then come Italians. Adding the number of British people who came from other countries to those who came from the United Kingdom, the total 'Brit- ish' permanent arrivals In the March quarter numbered 18.831.
