MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL. The unsettled and unseasonable weather that has provailed since tho despatch of our summary of 25th September, has very much tended to prevont that improvement in the import market which at this ad vanced period of tho year is usually looked for ; yet, on tho whole, tho past month's trade will contrast most favorably with many previous ones. Tho country demand has much increased, iind gives promise, when tho weather changes, of opening out on a satisfactory scale. Tho demand from New Zealand, as yet, is very moderate, and falls short of what was anticipated. On Thursday, the 8th instant, tho arrival of tho Madras with tho European mails to the 26th August was telegraphed from Adelaide. The steamer ar rived in tho Bay on tho afternoon of the 10th, and the bulk of the letters were dolirorod the same oven ing. The exports to Victoria for the month amount to £33j,733., an;l show a decreasD of £152,277. Tho deficiency, however, being chiefly in soft goods, all other descriptions being in excess of our wants. The markets havo been uninfluenced thoreby, though during tho short period intervening till tho steamer cast anchor considerable excitement provailed. From Calcutta we were advised of tho departuro of. tho Elizabeth with 10,000 bags rico, and one vessel load ing was expected to bring 7000 bags more. Intelli gence of the loss of tho Alfred tho Great was also received. From China wo were informod of the sailing of three vessels with tea cargoes from Foo - Chow - Foo for this port, The mouth has been free from any commercial dis asters. Money is easy and abundant for legitimate purposes. Mercantile credit is froo from suspicion, and business generally assumes a healthy appearance. Exchange on England rules at } per cent, premium. In consequence of tho wot season, shearing will be later than ordinary. Wool, howover, continues to arrive in town, and tho first sale of the now clip will shortly take place. Messrs Lorimer, Mtirwood and Rome, on behalf of tho Whito Star Line, havo been the successful tenrtprei's for conveying frefl and assisted immigrants to this colony ' from Great Britain during the ensuing year. Tho price at which they have taken tho contract is £18 10s 4dpor statute adult. Tho tender of Messrs Bright Brothers was £13 17s 3d, and the tender for tho present year was taken at £13 19s 5d. Tho imports of this year, us compared with our position last month, show an increasing balance against oxports, tho oxce -b in favor of tho formor down to the weok ending 17th instant being £1,468,800, nud show an increase of £1,003,572 over tho same period of 1862\. Tho oxports also toll in favor of tho present year by £7C2,216, tho respective amounts standing thus : — Imports. Exports. 1862 .. £10,326,862 1862 .. £9,099,41 1863 .. 11,330,434 1863 .. 9,861,634 Tho demand for bulk ale throughout tho month has boon confined to supplying trado wants, the unsettled and unpropitious naturo of tho weather with which we havo boen favored preventing that improvement which otherwise we had good reason to expect. Present rates show no alteration on thoso ruling last month. No sales of Bass's No. 3 have come under our notice over £7, whilo very recently, in order to make better progress in selling, £6 15s has heen ac cepted. No 4, in trade lots, has brought £7 10s. Allsopp'8 has been maintained at £0 15s, £7 being required for No. 4. Joules' has been but sparingly dealt in till lately, when tho demand increased and sales have boou more freely mado at £7 15s Mnrrian's has continued without auy variation on £7 12s 6d to £7 15s, the latter figure being the rute for small quantities— salos at that prico havo been most numerous. The Carlisle Company has I realised £7 12s 6d in trado lots, but a good many | sales of parcels for shipment have been effected at £6 5s in bond (equal to £7 10s). The Coloniul Company ban been uniformly maintained nt £0, but a new light palo India ale, for summer consumption, browod by this company, has brought £6 17s 6d, gives satisfaction, and bids fair during tho hot weather to supersede tho heavier description. Iml, Coopo and Company's brand, at £7, has not rocoived much attention. Scotch ales have ruled at £5 10s to £6, but have only with difficulty been moved off at our quotations. Bulk stout has declined slightly, but the reduction has not led to increased trade. Allsopp's has been quoted £6 10s; Whitbrcnd's, £6 10s; and Taylor, Walker and Co.'s, £6 12s 6d to £6 15s Inquiries have been moderate, and tho quantity disposed of insignificant. Bottled ale has come very sparingly forward, yet sufficiently so to meet the demand. The Scotch brands of light beer, such as Prcstonpon's, Muir's, Berwick's, being in most favor and command 10s to JOs 6d ; Bass's and Allsopp's arc sold at 9s 6d to 9s 9d ; for Joule's, 9s 6d is required ; for Colonial Company's, 8s 6d is accepted ; while ordinary Scotch brands have been quitted at 9s to 9s Gd ; hoary ale, for winter use, has been cleared off at 7s to 7a 0d. Bottled stout has stoadily maintained the improvement noted in our last; business has, how ever, been restricted, no largo sales having been effected. BynBs'a has ruled at from 8s 9d to 9s, and since receipt of intelligence that no further ship ments of this brand can be mado this seuson — 8s lOJd has been refused for a large parcel. Nu merous salos of Duuphy'a have been effected at 93, 9s 3di b asked in many instances, but we have heard of no sales at that figure. Machen's having been reduced to 9s to 9s 3d ha9 gone off very freely. Blood's has been held nt 9s Oil to 10s. Henry White and Co.'s has moved off slowly at 10s to 10s 3d. Edmond's pig brand has not been offered uuder 10s 6d, and for Hibbert's 8s 6d only has been obtained. Colonial Company's single stout has advanced to 8s Gd ; double can be bought at 9s. Early in the month some inquiry for corn sacks led to sales at 13s 9d to 14s ; and, the wholo offering at thoso figures having been cloared off, holders insisted on 14s 9d to 15s ; which buyers refused to concede ; no sales could be made till within a few days ago, when the prices mentioned. were established, a further udvance beitur now asked. Woolpacks in like manner have been in request. Twenty balos of 10 lb packs sold last week, at auction, for 5s, but 5s 3d to 5s Gd has since been paid. In anticipation of Europoan difficulties, can dles improved gradually till chocked by recent Eng lish advices ; an advance of a halfpenny per lb was then established, which since has been lost. Few private sales can be effected, buyers still continuing to supply their wauts from damaged lots at auction, at9Jd to 93d. This week a considerable parcel of sound light mid full weights changed hands at market rates, which we quote as lO.Jd for Ogleby's, &c;, to lid for Bolmout, lOJd for Brandon, and 11 jd for the Neva Stearine Company. Light weights ruled sold at 8Ad to 8!}d. Scotch Government ilax canvas, Nos. 0to 5, realised Is 4d per yard for a recent shipment; another description, Nos. 1 to 5, having boen quitted at auction for 114d to 12Jd. Cement has comi- forwurd so freely, as to provent any ud vanco on Portland, which continues at 16s. American plaster, however, has improved, 15s, equal to a rise of 15d, haviug boen obtainod. Manilla cordage is better, assorted sizes having realised £47. bnlos, however, are on a very mode rate scale. For small, £50 is got. Europe Manilla is offered at £46, asserted sizes, 1 to 8 inch ; Europe bolt rope has been sold at £G0 ; for tarred, £40 is required. Bengal lines move off slowly at £43 to £14. At auction, shop and seaming twiuo have been disposod of at 8d to Is Id and lOJd to 14jjd. Little or no variation has taken placo in coifoes, but, as the season advances, tho consump tion lessens, and the demand doorcases. Salos of plantation have been made at lO.^d ; and of nativos, at y.Jd ; Javas being valued at IUU 10 iltya. A uniform rate of 3Jd has boon maintained for best brands *J chicory, the business done being but small. Chemicals havo had a slow sale, soda crys tals having been placed at £8 15s to £9. Caustiu, for which thero is no inquiry, is worth £18. Car bonate is now saleable at 18s to 19s. Flour of sul phur has not moved off readily at £18. Tartaric acid has realised 2s 2d per lb. Chest opium has been held for £260, but no sales havo been re ported. Tinned has been disposed of at 28s 6d to 29s 6d. Confectionery has had moderate at tention, at lid for best assorted, Is for jujubes, and 13d for candied poel. As ship ments of ling have continued to arrive more freely, prices declined, best sorts still command 5d to 5£d. White herrings have met with trade buyers at 26s 6d to 27s for half barrels, and 9s 6d to 10s for firkins ; sales of red herrings, in tins, having been mado at 30s to 32s per dozen. Dried fruits have been doalt in, but not extensively. Currants havo been placed as low ns 4Jd, but most holders refuse to sell under 4Jd. Loose muscatel raisins have been sold so freely that an advance to 5M has resulted in consequence. Layers have boen quitted at 6Jd for large, and at 7d to 7^d for small pack ages. Capos have declined to 7d and 7£d. .Dried apples havo had a fine sale at 6d, 6Jd being now asked. Considerable transactions in flour havo taken placo; one extensive* bnyer having succeeded in getting hold of tho greater portion of the stock at present hold hero, and it was generally antici pated that ere tho new crops would be ready for use, prices would go very high. Californian advices, via Sydney, received this week, have had, howover, tho effect of checking the upward tendency, and the mar ket has since been quiet, but no change in prices can bo reported. Best South Australian brands are at present worth £15 ; Victorian, country, £13 10s : and town brands, £14 to £14 10s ; Californian having been placedat £13 and up to £14. To-day outside parcels are offered at less money, but there aro no buyers. Adelaide wheat has been in short supply, and held for 6s 6d to 6s 9d, and Victorian has ruled at 5s 9d to 6s 3d. Feeding barley has risen to 4s 9d and 5s, at which sales have been made ; for malting, 6s to 6s 3d being required. Large speculative purchases of maize sent the price up from 4s 4d to 4s 9d and 5s, at which latter nrico it now remains ; aome considerable activity being ex2-erioneed in the article We hear of sellers to-day at 4s 9d to 4s lOd. Oats have maintained a vory much hotter position ; the local demand, as well as that for New Zealand, having been satisfac tory: during the month little has boon sold at auc tion, most sales effected having been privately. Colonial are valued nt 5s 9d to (U 3d, and milling at 6b 3d to 6s tid ; very considerable sales of Danish have been made at 4s lOd for 9000 bushels, 5s net for 5000, and 5s 3d is at present asked. Scotch have benefited in a liko degree, 4s 3d to 4s 6d being obtained ; tho market to-day shows signs of weak ness. One shipment of gram, per Mary Dove, was sold at £10 10s to save storing, since which small trado lots havo been quittod at £12 5s. Brim hus boen much wanted, and supplies having been behind hand, tho pneo went up to Is 8d, but has again ro coeded to Is 6Jd and Is 7d, its present valuo. Colo nial oatmeal and pearl barley have not varied, £30 to £31 boiug our quotation still. Scotch is worth £23 to £24. Blasting powder has not beon at all active, buyers declining to give over 7d and 7.j (I for best brands, which holders havo been unwilling to accept. Wo noto a sale this week at auotion of Karao's at Csjd for sound, damaged having bronght 4d. Hops have been quiet. Kents, 1862, have been disposed of at Is 3d to Is 6d. For Americans Is 3d is required. Tasinaniau, 1863, sold at Is 4M to Is 5d. Sales of malt have been moderate. English ndvicos improved tho tone of the market ; dealings, howuver, liuvo been confined to trado pur chases at 8s 6d to 8s 9(3. On Thursday last some heavy speculative purchases wove reported at about 8s. It is surprising, on the whole, that tho prico of this article lias beon so well sustained, considering tho extent of shipments, and how far into tho year they have been continued, while on this side tho usual cqnsnmptivo domand has beon kept back by tho backwardness of tho season. Metals gene rally hnve been dull. Pig iron being quito nominal at £3 15s ; of corrugated sales of eagle brand have boen mado at £34. Gospel oak is valued at £35 10s, but thoro is none offering. Hamilton's brings £33 10s to £33, and Scotch, 24 to 28 guage, is worth. £28 to £30. Zinc sells for £30 to £31. Sheet lead at £27. Black wire, 6 to 7, is saleable at £16 to £17, and No. 4 to 5 at £14 to £15. Huir brooms sold last week at 12s to 203. Shoe-brushes at 10s t6 15s. Carpet whisks, 40s to 45s. Scrub bing- brushes, 9s 6d to 14s per dozen; and door mats at 2s to 3s each. In oils, American advices havo led to a riso in kerosene, sales of Downer's and Couzzous' having boon made at 3s 2d to its 3d ; and of Oriental at 3s 3d. The news of the loss of the Alfred tho Crreat, from Calcutta, induced a speculative movement in castor, 1500 gallons having beon bought at about 4s 9d. Linseed is reduced to 5s 3d in bulk, and 5s 9din drums. Chinese is very scarce, and worth 5b. Colza is saleable at 5s 9d to 6s. Oilmen's stores in most cases havo beon sold at less rates. Bottled fruits being tho only exception, 'a great scarcity having been ex perienced, so much that this week at auotion, 15s Gd was roalised for thorn. 1 lb jams havo ruled at 10s 9d to lls. Whybrow's pickles havo sold at Gs 6d ; Joyce's at 7s ; for.Batty's and C.B.'s, 9s to 93 3d has boen quoted. Colerann's mustard brings 7Ad to 7;Jd ; blno, 9d to 9j-d; half-pints castor oil, '6s 'to 6s 3d ; half-pints salad oil, Oo Oil to 7s ; and pints, lls to lls 6d. 1 lb oysters havo been pluced at 12s to 12s 6d ; 1 lb lobsters, 7s -3d ; 1 lb salmon, 16s 9d. At auction Thin'a sold thin woek nt 15s 9d. Halves sardines aro moderately inquired for at 9s to 9s 3d, and quarters at 6s to 6s 3d. Whybrow's vinegar brings 8s to 8s 3d ; bulk is scarce and valued at 1b 9d to Is lid, according to brand. Irfixod spieo has been quitted at 17Jd. Chutney at 24s, and curry powder at 18s per dozen. In provisions, bui.tor has presented a falling market, old lots have L'?cn quitted at 5}d to 7d, whilo early in tho month 50(J firkins, new, ex White Star, averaged 8Jd ; 250 fir kins, ex Champion of the Seas, sold on the 9th, brought 8Jd to 9d ; and this week, 200 sold for 7j|d to 8Jd. First brands of hams and bacon have np to the arrival of tho mail shown no variation, Sinclair's commanding 12Jd, and Coey's and Compton's, Is all round. Since then the larger holders have mani fested a desire for better pricss, requiring 13}d to 14d for hams, and 12Jd to 13d for bacon, and those rates aro likely to booome established, York hasis and secondary brand aro lesB saleable at lOid to lid. North Wilts cheeso has beon dis posed of at Is and 13d. Tho usual insignificant domand has provailed for quicksilver, at Is 9d for California, to Is lOd for Spanish. In our last wo announced a combination amongst rico holders, for tho purpose of obtaining paying prices from tho buyers, against which the latter contended until receipt of intelligence of tho loss of the Alfred tho Great with 650 tons, when about 300 tons chang ing hands in one line, purchasers have since como forward more freely, paying £22 10s, tho prico fixed for fifty ton lots, and a higher figure for smaller quantities. Coarse salt is gradually improving ; stored parcols are not offering, being hold abovo market rates ; and, as shipments havo of late como in very slowly, dealers havo boon forced to pay £3, prices tending upwards ; for, should no consign ments, to avaid storing charges be pressed on tho market, we have no doubt it will very shortly attain a more satisfactory position. Speculative pur chases in fino, havo resulted in an advance of 30s per ton ; £4 17s 6d, £5, and £5 5s having beon obtained for the article. A large and extensive trade has been done in sugars, most sales, contrary to usual custom, having beon effected privately. On this occasion tho Sugar Company were the chief purchasers, in consequence of tho failure of their supplies from Manilla, and many hundred tons changed hands. An advauco of about £5 per ton has been obtained on rates current on the doj-arturo of last mail, the lowest point reached. At auction sovoral cargoes have also beon disposed of : on 26th ult. 15,664 bags, tho entire cargo of tho Los Piot and Hannah Nicholson were offered, and realised £14 for very low black rations to £18 10s for medium, and £22 10s for good ; £23 10s for medium counters ; £24 to £24 10s for good; £26 5s to £26 10s~forfino; £27 15s to £28 10s for grainj- brewing sorts ; and £31 for yello iv crystals. On tho 7th instant tho Tanreau's curgo of 4211 bags sold at a slight ad vance. On tho 12th the St. Ives' cargo of 5784 bugs was offered, but only one lot of low rations, at £18 15s, could be sold, though immediately afterwards several parcols were placed privately. Tho market has since vory judiciously not been pressed, but on Thursday last the Madras's cargo of 6165 bags was offered, when, the attendance being large, every bag was disposed of at the following prices, fully establishing the advauco already mentioned. Low rations sold for £22 2s 6d ; brown rations, £24 10s to £25 10s ; fine counters, £31 ; good counters, £32 to £32 5s ; yellow crystals, £33 10s to £31 15s; white, £37 to £37 12s Gd. Business in tea has beon confined to a mere trado demand ; aavices irom Ulnua being of such a naturo as to pro vent any speculation at tho prices current, but a fair amount has thus boon done — to this the sale of tho Kahlamba's cargo, consisting of 1419 chests and 2050 halves, was an exception, though tho ouly one. The whole of tlmsn n-nrn r1ienrv.-ml nf of. lo Oil in Is lOJd for the former, and Is lid to Is lljd for the lattor, showing a decline of Id to 2d per lb.
