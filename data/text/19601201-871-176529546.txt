They'll mass produce Danish-style furniture for AMBimlian. . pmiiiiiiiiiiiii ...AND USE NOTHING BUT INE QUEENSLAND TIMBERS Two Danes who own a furniture factory in Brisbane are preparing to mass- produce Danish furniture for the Australian market. ' They are Eric Petersen, from Slangerup, and Borge Bkihby, a tall fair-haired |rchiiect, from Aarhus. i Mr. Petersen had a furniture factory in Slangerup, making Revision cabinets, until he mi- ;rated years ago on medical dvice for the health of his wife, nga. He did not come to Australia just with ideas or hopes. He brought with him much of his factory plant, including a circular saw and spindle, planer and borer, and a belt sander. For the first year he worked as a joiner while he settled down and prepared to start his own factoty. He bought a band saw and a dovetailer and began making high-quality special order furni- ture, usually designed individually by architects for homes they were building. In that way he met Mr. Skibby, who had migrated in December, 1956. Originally a cabinetmaker, after the war Mr. Skibby took a Degree in Architecture at Aarhus Technical College. They decided to form a partnership. Mr. Skibby resigned his Public Service job and they moved into a larger factory. Until now they have continued to make furniture mainly on special order, but they are preparing to mass-produce highquality Danish-style furniture to sell at a comparatively low price. Big future They use nothing but Queensland timber â€” Queensland maple, silky oak, blade bean and walnut. Mr. Skibby, who is single, said: "There is a big future for our business. There are very eood opportunities for immigrants in Australia, particularly in Queensland." Mr. Petersen, who has built his own home in Brisbane, said that his furniture business already was twice the size of the business he had in Denmark.
