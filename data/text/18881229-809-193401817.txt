THE NATIONAL TYPE OF AMERICA. CHICAGO TIUnU.VK,10TIt NOVEMBEH. One of the most peculiar and interesting re sults of the methods by which tho . social exten sion of this icountry has' been fed lies in the fact that wo haveho well defined national tviui "of woman". Novelists, occasionally' . introduce their heroines as representatives of the " truo type of American womanhood," and there nvo newspnper correspondents abroad who write of the sensation caused by " that typical Ameri can beauty, hlrs. Hiflicr," .but if the expres sions of nil. these novelists And correspondents are compared it will be found that tlieir idenls are widely divergent. That there is a typical' American woman, so fnr as manners go, may very possibly bo tlie case, but that is a question of mind rather than uf matter. Of course it is hut natural that this country, witli its 65,000,000 of people drawn from every parfcof tile globe, shonid present ahttndred widely varying physical models, and.the wonder rather is that out of such hoterogeneous material there shpuhl be already evolved anything so nearly approaching homogeneity ns tiint political integer hnoivn as the United States of America. An examination of the census of 1880 shows somo very remarkable 'figures.' It is seen that out of a total population of - a little over 50,000,000 more tlmn 6,500,000 were foreign born, . over 6,000,000 colored, more tlinn 100,000 were Chinese and nearly 70,000 were Indians. Looking next at tlio nativities of the foreign population it is, found tiint 4906 were born in Australia, 38,633 in Austria, 15,535 in Belgium, 85,361 in Bolie- mja, 610,090 in Canada, 41,788 in New Bruns wick, 4789 in Newfoundland, 51,160 in Nova Scotia, 7537 in Trinco J5d ward's Island and 1793' in- other unspecified parts of Britisli America that 707 wore Central Americans, 6917 were Cuban's, 64,196 Banes, 106,971 Frenchmen and that 1,996, 742 wore Germans, coming from Baden, Bavaria, Bruiiswieki.Hanibiirg, Hanover, Hcssen, Lubcck, Mecklenburg. : Nassau, Oldenburg, Saxony, "Weimar and Wurtemburg. Of British bom .-there were 2,772,162, of which - number 662,676 were .English, 1,854,571 Irish; 170,136 Scotch and 83,302 "Welsh. Greece,' it was found, hail sent us 776, Grcenlnml 129, Holland 58,090, Hungary 11,523, India 1707, Italy 44,230, Japan 401, Luxemburg 12,836, arid Malta and Gilraltnr 372\. Of .Mexicans we had 68,399, from Norway 181,729, from tlie Pacific islands 806, of Poles 48,557, of Portuguese 8138, of Russians 35,722, from tlie Sandwich Islands 1147, from South Amorica 4566, from Spain 5121, from Sweden 194,337, from Switzerland 88,621, from Turkey 1205, from the West Indies 9484, from dilforent parts of Asia, exclusive of China and Japan, 1054, and from different regions of Africa 2204. 4 But this miscellaneous contribution of our 6,500,000 foreigners, of whom a fair half (3,249,377) are females, is not tlie only factor that lias to ho considered as taking a part in tlie perpetuation of' our multiplicity of feminine types. There is next to be considered tlio great contribution' to our population of tlioso foreign in tho . second - degreo— tiint is, of those born on American soil of foreign pnrents. This branch of tho subject, in fact, is tho most interesting of all. It shows, for instance, that if the same rulo of three generations , be applied to tlie making, of a'true American as it does to" tlio making of a truo gentleman, it shows, then that tlie leaven ' of the truo American has a mighty, if not unending task in leavening the whole lump. Iudccd, it might almost seem that tho further we go tlio further. we get from tho production of a race type. . . In 1870 the. results of tho census showed that while there were in that year'5,567,229 persons- resident in tho United States who were born in other countries, thoro were 10,521,233 residents who had a foreign father, 10,105,627 who had a. foreign mother, 9,834,845 who had both parents foreign, 10,892,015 who had one or both parents foreign. It will, of course, he understood tiint ttip last four sums are- not to bo ndded" togothor for .any statistical purpose. For ex ample, tho third sum, 9,734,845, is repeated four times, constituting n.part of encli of tho other three 8uii1s given. ,!(ho outsido iimit of foreign parentage is tho lost. sum 10,892,015, which comprises all persons either of whose' parents was of foreign birth, and this number, it will lie observed, includes the 5,567,229 persons direct foreigners, that is who were themselves horii in other countries, ( Tlio years elapse 'and the foreign eontriBntioh' both-in the first and second degrees is seen to bo' 011 tho increase. Tlio main facts qro -that of the 50,155,783 inhabitants of tlio United .States, at that time there wore 6,679,943 who were foreign liorn, , the outsido limit of '"foreign parentage being 14,922,734, which comprises all persons' either . of whoso parents was." of foreign hiitlu, and includes the 6,679,943, who were themselves born in foreign countries; Compare these figures of 6,679,943' first de gree foreigners and 14,922,744 second- degree foreigners in 1830 witli 5,567,229 first", degree foreigners and 10,892,015 second degree foreigners in 1870, and it will he seen that .the type was then a long woy off. Nor will- the next census bring us any lioaror'to the national type, for already the statistical abstract of the United States shows an arrival of moro than' four and -a quarter million immigrants, witli three more years yet to hear from. This, faking an average of 600,000 a year, will mean another 6,000,000 of first degree foreigners to ho ndded to tlie population. The extraordinary increase of foreigners of tlie.second degree will, perhaps, appear, dispro-' portionato ut first glance, but a .little considern. tion will show how nnturnl it is. ' I.ct, UB look for n momcnt at what is now g'iling.oif around us.

"We. havo .the large,- : fnll- brbasted Englishwoman and tho stout limbed Austrian, the lustrous eyed Italian 'and the aquilino nosed Jewess from Poland, tho short, plump . Sclav arid the strango eyed Russian— to say nothing of tho growing classes of Mongolian maidens and ncgresscs. Almost every nationality' is represented, but of all lliese which shall oho say is the typical Amorican ? Yet it is believed the national typo is comin". Education, climate, food and surroundings must in time have their natural effect. Already, indeed, this typo is beginning to bo seen'. " It is not in tho solid western woman, tlio sinuous southerner, or tlio more spirituoUe product of tlie eaSt, but in tho something better, braver, broader and more beautiful that clings to the American woman more than it does to hor sisters of else where. Again, there is a local example of this. Little hy little tho general disappearance of tho strong individualities of the ditrercnt races is to be seen in San Francisco, and especially in the schools. Traits nro being lost, slowly, it is true, but none the less surely ; tlio new race is coming to tlie surface, tho great pro- cesses of amalgamation are going on, and of tho result 110 one can entertain n douht, The very fact that tlie writers referred to aro moro and more given to use the term- " typical American woman " shows that such a creature iB lining evolved, and nlready there are tho unmistak able signs that tho . evolution will bring about something that will add another to our many causes for national pride.
