' Messrs. Dalgetty and Co. report At our wool sales to-day we offered 3400 bales, comprising an excellent selection of good to superior merinos and crossbreds!, chiefly from \y.e5tcr1i Victoria, Gippsland, and Tasmania, Competition for all greasy wools was as brisk as ever, and we sold 5500 bales at equal to last week's prices. The demand is still strongest for crossbreds, and for pieces, bellies, and locks of all descriptions, and super lambs' bring very satisfactory prices. "Washed wools, unless vary dry and clean, meet a dragging sale, but Scoureds, which are in comparatively small supply, sell well. During the week cables have arrived giving averages realised for leading clips in the London November sales, and the comparison is decidedly. in favour of the colonial markets. '
