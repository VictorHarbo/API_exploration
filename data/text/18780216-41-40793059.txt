' *Ehe Alta was towed down the river on Thursday morning, having a load of cereals for Brisbane. She -arrived here on October 20, and ha3 therefore had a \good stay in harbour. The Iocs Ukr proceeds to Port Pine to load cereals, and on Thursday morning made a start from the roads with a light northerly wind blowing. The Brier Holme is another handsome iron ship, which forms an addition to the wheat fleet. She has brought a full cargo of Puget Sound timber, and has not only an ordinary deck- load flushed up to the height of the mainrail, but the poop has a lot of timber stowed on it. She is a very fine ship, almost new, having been launched at Sunderland in 1876. She is fitted out with the latest appliances, and her cabin is extremely handsome. The joinery is in mahogany and maple, some of the panelling being painted glass. In mirrors, settees, and upholstery the apartment is as near perfect as possible, and an inspection will gratify those interested in naval matters. On leaving Puget Sound some very heavy gales veering from S.W. to N.W. were encountered, but no damage was sustained beyond the loss of a mainsail, which was blown away. On January 1 crossed the Equator in 140° E., and then followed a succession of fair winds all the distance across the Pacific Ocean. After making the Australian land the weather became thick and foggy, with calms, which prevailed to so great an extent that for a dozen days before reaching Cape Willoughby she was within two days' sail. The arrivals of Friday were of a very miscellaneous character. At about 2 o'clock a.m. the Brier Holme was boarded. Soon after 11 o'clock another vessel hove in sight, and a fresh start was made, and at 5 the officers landed, having in the meantime boarded four vessels. The Deveron passed Cape Borda the previous afternoon, but not knowing taere was any telegraphic communication from that quarter the master hoisted no Sags. It is, however, a very good proof of the lookout being well kept when the signalman there read the name on her bows, she having passed close enough to Cape Borda to see the people on shore. The Severon is a most complete vessel, for in every respect she shows the wonderful improvement in the build and construction of the recent class of ships. Being in ballast trim from the Cape an opportunity ?was afforded of admiring the Iine3 of the hull, and on . crossing the gangway the appointments on deck were seen to be of the very best description- Of course iron is the principal feature, but where wood i3 intro duced, 33 in the decks and the rails, it is not only ol superior cast, but is also well kept, and from end to end the vessel looked like a new pin. The Deveron is classed Al 100 at Lloyd's, and nautical men will understand by this that nothing is spared in her equipment. The poop is, according to recent fashion, constructed to meet the requirements of the master and officers only. The master has a beauti fully-fitted state cabin,' with bathroom attached ; and abaft all, on the transoms, are two apartments also devoted to the use of the mister. The officers have well-appointed staterooms before all ; and on passing from the cuddy to the deck it is seen tint every im provement is at hand. There is an engine in the fore deckhouse capable of driving tlic windlass or the pumps, lifting the anchor or the topsails, or when in harbour working out cargo. Belonging to this depart ment is a condenser for the supply of fresh water. The Deveron took to the Cape a cargo of iron and sleepers from London, and made a very good passage of 43 days. She hauled into the new docks there. and on discharge of her lading was ordered to this port to load. She sailed on January 7, and shaped a course as far south as 41% having fair winds all the way. On one occasion she ma.ie considerably over 300 miles as a ran, and kept close to it on another occasion. At'tor reaching the Ioneitude of the Leuwin the easterly wind delayed her progress. She made Cape Borda an Thursday night and anchored in the roads on Fridiy noon, when the master landed to seek further orders. as it was considered probable she might be intended for the Port Pirie fleet. The Athene is a vessel of quite 'another descrip tion, being one of the old school built at Sunder land in 1S57, and consequently famished with full poop and topgallant forecastle bf the ancient order. - The master reports an extreme dulness in shipping it Calcutta, as many as a hnndred iron ships and fifty, steamers being there waiting employment. The Athene crossed the Line when 14 days out, and than had a singular ran of calm3 until reaching the longi tude of Cape Leuwin, whence she has been a fortnisut detained by east winds. On arrival in the roads she' anchored to await a tag to tow into harbour. ? - The.. Eedbseast is -a barque which -has arrived Tim under somewhat singular circumstances. Sne ?was- chartered ? to proceed to Maldon Island, 'and .left Melbourne on November 3, and five days after was s away to the southward of New Zealand. On November »55 she -was off Chatham Islaad. She then made for the - tDcri&K;&rd;, passed Tahiti, and was 21 day3 thence to ^HaJdon Island, arriving there on the same day as a ft.vqoe named the Hel^a, which had left this port on a ymHar mission. The aiaster was disappointed with' l&e; prospect of loading, and finding there were some vessels there with priority of turn he resolved to shape * retem course. On January 3 he set sail to retrace' 'ca track, and on the 12th reached Palinerston Island /?n the £Sth he touched at Norfolk Island for suDDlies w 'fere he learned that Bishop Selwyn's wife lad died bu *? a fe* d*?3 before. He then prosecuted the vova~e * .itade the land at Hogan's firouD on Saturday and c-n Friday following eame to aschor ia the roads to V^k further orders. When leann.tr Maldon Island the $jPe«dy- Eoo Diego, PJctator, 38* ?Belga were there. ' ; . The Crro was the first reached, and she turned out to be a Danish-bnilt barque, subsequently sold to colonial owners, and trading on the coast. On her present voyage she has coal from Newcastle, and made a very fair voyage except when off the Dromedary, when she fell in with a severe gale, which lasted with extreme violence for several hours. Since then she has had very fine weather to the con clusion of the voyage. CAPE BOEDA. February 15, 3 p m.— Gkace Daklixg, schooner, passed inward.
