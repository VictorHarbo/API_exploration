PROSPECTUS. THIS DAY (SATURDAY), tho 3rd of EBB RUARY, 1806, is PUBLISHED tho UïrBt Number of THE QUEENSLANDER, a now Weekly Journal, to be issued in Brisbane every Saturday Morning. THE QUEENSLANDER is intended to supply tho acknowledged necessity which exists for a Weekly Newspaper of a size and oharuotor which will render it suitable to the wants of readers of all classes throughout tho Colony. The number of Nowspopers published iu Queensland is sufficient ovidonco of tho general tx demand oxisting throughout the colony for this class of reading. But thoso who wish to bo suppliod with information of what . is passing beyond the boundaries of the district in which they resido aro at present without the means of obtaining it in any one Newspaper. It will bo the object of tho proprietor of THE QUEENSLANDER to endeavor to supply this want fully; «id'tho means at his command being so much moro extensive than arc to be found elsewhere, ho -will bo enabled to «rive caeli week such a mass of information collected front nil parts of the colony ns can- not fail to secure a largo circulation. As the paper will bo published in Brisbane, the largest centre of population, a considerable portion of its eontonts will necessarily bo devoted to events ocourring in that neighbor- hood ; but great caro will be taken that a sufficient portion of space be devoted to oach of tho other districts, so that a fair history .'moy bo given of tho week's proceedings of the whole colony, principally obtained through special and trustworthy correspondents. The greatest care will be takon to admit nothing of a doubtful character j and in ordor to render the paper welcome as a family newspaper, interesting reading of a literary character will bo suppliod from woek to week. With tho advantago of being published in the capital of the colony, THE QUEENS- LANDER will contain the earliest and most reliable information of all Legislative and Governmental action, afTecting tho welfaro of tho general b3ay of tho people or that of any of tho various interests which flourish among us. A full epitome of the Parliamentary Debates will bo given during the Session ; and all important bills or public documents which aro of sufficient interest will be produced nfc the . earliest possible date. Full reports will bo givon of the proceedings in the Supremo Court Brisbauo, in the various Circuit Courts, and also in the District Courts-in all cases fur- nished by persons competent lo undcrtako this description of reporting. In politics, THE QUEENSLANDER will be free from anything approaching to party spirit. Its cltiof object in discussing political questions will bo the material advance- ment of the country, and the enforcomont of a wiso economy on the part of the Govern- ment. At the samo timo the activo promo- tion of public works of a reproductive character will bo advocntod. Whilo tho proprietor will avail himself of all the resources at his disposal for tho purpose of giving tho News of tho Wcok a^ fully as possible, the leading columns of TRE QUEENSLANDER, as well as the comments on passing events, will bo written specially for its pages j and tho principles of progress and economy in government will be constantly maintained. Tho main object of the paper being to promote social and material progress, the principal industrial interests of the colony will be carefully watched, with a viow to record everything which may tend to dovelop its resources. ThuB tho improvements will be noted which are effected from tuno to timo in tho older portions of this or any other Aus- tralian colony, whereby the country is im- proved and its productive power is increased ; and full accounts of tho progress niado in pro- moting an improvement in tho brood of stock vill bo regularly published. Special attcntionwilt bo dovoted to Agriculturc) which, although now in its infancy, will doubt 'less beforo long bo ono of tho most valuable sources of wealth to the colony. Nothing can tend more to produce this doirablo result ' than a full interchange of information among all thoso engaged in farming pursuits in tho different districts. To assist in attaining this object, no pains will be spared to obtain the most reliable statements as to what is actually taking place wound us ; and as tho largo circulation which TRE QUEENSLANDER will command among residents in tho country, will render it tho beat medium for this purpose, it is hoped ' that the farmers will freely use its open column for giving to, or eliciting from, one another, much valuable information of a character which nothing but experience can supply. The Markets will bo carefully reported, and the ruling prices will he given for all produce ns well ns the principe articles of consumption. For the former the quotations in the neighboring colonies will be extracted from tho best sources, .in all cases whero thay materially affect the prices here. Pull catalogues of Wool Sales, both m Sydney and in London will be published, and great care will be taken to render the market '-eports as full and reliable as possible. THE QUEENSLANDER will contain '-wehe pages, tho same size as tho monthly «ummary of the Rrislmie Courier, and will be Published every Saturday morning, in time for tue country mails. Smisenipiios, Gs. 6d. per quarter, or 21s.
