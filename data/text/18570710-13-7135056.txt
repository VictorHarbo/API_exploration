I Reared in a country In which hay and oats aro I always accessible at moderato rates, ho becomes nccu i tomed to think that thoy constttuto tho only propor food for horses. And ho adhores to thom under variations for cost as compared with other nu- tritious substances, that rondar that kind of food ridiculously extravagant. Thus within I tho lost year or two, wo havo seon oaten Iny, containing llttlo nutriment, soiling at forty pomvH per ton, whllo flour vory nutritious hi comparison has sold at fivo and twenty. Oats havo sold at llttion shillings por bushol of forty pounds, while wheat of sixty pounds to tho buBhol was selling at about seven and sixpence Tho substitution of raw wheat for oats is objection- able, becauso thoro Is somothlng about tho uncookocl flour of whoat that has a tondonoy to clog the intes- tines of tho horso ; and honco daugor arises, and ovon fatal resulta fioquently onsuo. Tho sound economy of supplying food to auimals in a cooked stato is rocig nisod by tho best writers upon such subjects ; and in many cotintrioi of Europo tho horso is fed apoa bread as at onco tho choapost, tho most wholesome, mid tho most nourishing food that can bo gi von to him. Ample research and oxporimont havo domnn stiatcd that a proporly-proparod HORSE-BREAD, of -which wheat Is tho staplo Ingredlont, is in all respects a highly auvantagoousjood for horsos, being at onco safo and nutritious, being in most status of tho imirko vcry economical, and during the prosont stato so eco- nomical as to reduco tho prico of horso-focd byuoirly one-half. Tho HORSE-BREAD COMPANY supplies HORSE BREAD, lu flvo-pound loaves, ono loaf to a feed, at tho prico (till furthor notice) of ono shilling por loaf. Fed w ¡th throo or four loavos (according to work) per diy, and a Bufllcloncy of choppod straw, or othor cheap and filling Bubstanco howovor lunutrltlous, that a horso ?will cat, ho w 111 ho found to maintain a Bpirlt and condition such ni cannot bo given to him at much less than doubla tho cost spent on othor kinds of feed. Almost all horses tnko roadily to horso -broad, and In a short timo quickly prefer it to any other food. Tho Instinct ol n horso soon tolls hiin what ho roally wants, and ono that at first refuses chopped straw or such food, when fed upon Horso Ercad for n short timo, prosontly understands his own case, and.boing providoel with ample nutrlmont In tho bread, readily devours, to till up with, what ho would reject undor tho uneconomical systom of feodlng bltharto prcvalont. In giving Dorao-Broad to a horso to which It is a rovolty, it should bo broken up rathor small at Ant, and perhaps etrowed over a llttlo bran.
