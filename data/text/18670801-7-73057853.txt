' We have considered the question submitted to us, arising under Section 5 of the Constitution Act, as to the alleged disqualification of Mr. John Crozier for a seat in the Legifdatiye Coon cU of this Province by reason of non-residence in the colony, and we are of opinion that Mr. Oroner is not disqualified by that clause from nutrntjng or retaining a seat in the Legislature. -^?e-™* 'Stow b Bkuce. '* Boucaut b Whttby. 'Adelaide, July 23. Ve^.' die rpo THE ELECTORS OF THE _L LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Gentlemen— Having been requested to corns forward as a Candidate for one of the vacancies of the Legislative Council at the forthcoming Elections, it is necessary, as I am not known to many of the Bloctora, to place before you my opinions, and the measures I would support in the event of their coming before the Legisla tive Council. I have been in due colonies for twenty^ight years. Although residing in Sew South Jf. ales and Victoria as a squatter, I have for the last seventeen years done business here, and have now come to reside permanently in this colony for the purpose of educating my family, and am in no way connected with trade or business to influence me from giving an impartial support to any measure that would be for the benefit of all classes and the advancement of the country. Land Systems. — Desirmis of encouraging bona fide settlement, I would carefully consider any plan that could be devised to render agriculture mow remunerative, and to enable this colony to compete wit];, the liberal land systems of New South Wales and Victoria. Mining. — I consider that to. gncourage the development of our mineral rejourpes more liberal regulations are necessary. Thai measures should be devised to protect the actual dis coverer In the enjoyment of his rights, and that a small royalty might be preferable to rait. Squatting. — I am in favor of a classification of runs, and liberal terms in the dry country. In favor of the principle of an assessment at per head actually depastured, the rate varying according to the value of the run. Railways.— The great want of the country is improved means of intercommunication, and oheaper carriage for its produce. Whilst sup porting liberal outlay in ordinary roads I would support railway extension on a cheap scale; also a system of tramways for horse traction. Am in favor of guaranteeing private capitalists in lie execution of reproductive works. The Tariff. — I believe the taxes should inter fere as little as possible with tjcade j J am op posed to the imposition of protective duties, qs hese i increase the cost of living, and enhaqce the charges upon raising produce, thereby dis abling bur miners, and farmers, and others from flompeting in the markets of the world ; but I should not object to admit free of 4uty, such raw material as can be worked up into manu faotured articles in the colony, and would favor a bonus to any positively new industry bene ficial to the colony. Insolvent and other Laws. — I consider they need amendment so as more effectually to pro tect the public against reckless extravagance and fraud, and at the same time better to secure the honest but really unfortunate debtor. I also consider that a revision and simplification of many of the laws would be beneficial, as from tb^jr intricate and complex forms they as often crate a grime 48 prevent it. Education.— I am in favor of Government ajd to Education, if wholly unsectarian; would sop. port the extension of Education to the outlying districts, and generally assist the establishing o) schools in thinly .populated localities. Constitution Act. — I am in favor of amnnfling it in several particulars, such as making the office of Attorney-General not necessarily poli tical ; preventing Government contractors get ting into Parliament ; and giving the Govern ment power, as in Victoria, to remove a Jodge on the address of both Houses. Immigration. — At present none is needed, but I should favor introducing suitable labor eS.SVbHM^-1 ¥5 «wj¥4 J» tip ?mdtin.Ucatiqn. o£ ofl|sas, and 9qoJ4 »4.TOcm|e strut economy in the Government departments; supporting the appropriation of a larger share of die public revenue to opening up the country districts, and for the convenience of gauntry settlers generally. Intercolonial Affairs. — I am in favor of fede ration, or mutual agreement for certain defi nite objects, such as the free interchange of colonial produce, co-operation in schemes of coast defences, postal and telegraph arrange ments. On all the various questions that may from time to time arise, and which I have not touched upon, my best endeavors will be pat forth to advance the interests of my fellow colonists, without respect to olass gr party, should I be returned. ?' *' ' Your most obedient gewant, JOHN OROZIEB. Oaklands, Sturt, July 18, 1867. dxo MR. OROZIER ia much surprised that the Light Farmers' Club objects to his letter to Mr. John Barrow (of AshweU) on the Land Question. The abuses of the new regula tions in New South Wales and Victoria have had the effect, in many instances, of putting the land in possession of speculators in a shor time, in consequence of the occupiers being unable to fulfil their preliminary undertakmgs. tyr. Qjojier'g plan wqald, onihe jgontrary, f«g vent any bnt REAL WOR^IlfG BARMER^ from qibtapiing possession of the freehold, either at once if tbey had the necessary cash, or in a few years, if properly devised and secure mea sures could be enacted for giving them credit. Mr. Crorier is equally surprised that the Club should have extracted a meaning out of his letter which it was never intended to convey, and which neither he nor his Committee can see in it He maintains the consistency of his letter with the address, his great desire being to put the working farmer on the land on the best possible terms.

We, the undersigned electors of the province, beg to request that you will allow yourself to be nominated as a candidate for tie Legislative Council, feeling assured that from your long experience and knowledge of what tends to our best interests, you would ably represent the colony in that important branch of the Legisla ture ; and we pledge ourselves to use our best exertions to secure your return : — [Here follow the signatures.] Adelaide, July 18, 1967. Gentlemen — I have much pleasure in acced ing to y/qur request that I should allow myself tooe nominated for one of the vacant seats in the Legislative Council. In accepting this invi tation I desire to express my sense of the re sponsibility that devolves on members of the Upper House to conserve its constitutional privileges. As members of the Legislative Council are elected for a lengthened period, more depends on their general character than on an expression of opinion on the 1 an/ling topics of the day. especially considering the rapid changes in colonial life. I shall therefore only very briefly refer to a few of the prominent questions now before the public. I am in favor of lwyrnwiwg T?.ngl jon napifaj to a reasqnahle amount, $p. be expended in reproduc tive wfirks and works calculated to open up the resources of the colony. I deeply regret the temporary distress which prevails amongst the working olasses at the present time, but X trust that the dark cloud which for- some ingm^nc lias bung over the colony wQl speedily pass away and better times will dawn for all classes in the community. The trade with the Biverina districts requires the careful consideration of the Legislature, and any measure tending to develop that trade and remove obstructions from this important branch of its progress will have my earnest support I shall oppose any impost or restriction calcu lated to fetter or embarrass the development of the resources of our pastqral, miners, or agricultural interest^. ' % tpQ, Geatl«in,efi, touts faithfully, ' W.MORGAN. To the Hon. Thos. English, the Hon. A. Blyth, the Hon. J. T. Bagot, and the other gentlemen signing the requisition. dxc 'FO THE ELECTORS OF THE J. PROVINCE. Gentlemen— As I have been very much mis represented at some of the public meetings in the country, and as I am, prohibited, from ap pearing in person at any meeting to explain my views, \ take this opportunity of more fully stating mj opinion on a few of the questions now before the electors. The time has now arrived when, in my opinum, qome alteration must he mads in our system of di^posuig ctf the waste faw^» of the Orown. Any plan that can be devised to enable as to compete with the system in operation in the neighboring colonies would have my hearty support I should vote for the formation of light rail ways between any parts of the colony where it can be shown that there is a reasonable prospect of their proving reproductive, such railways to be constructed by tile Government with borrowed capital, or by companies with a Government guarantee, thui at the saice time opening up the country and. ennhfing the farmer, the miner, and tie squatter to convey prqdu.ee to. inatket, and giving employment to working yfjpn, I am in favor of the repeal of Sutherland's Act atones, as I believe the Legislature should only vote money for immigration when abso lutely required. As an instalment of free trade I should a&ro-; cote &e; admission of all raw material duty free. I would, under careful and proper restric tions, grant bonuses to the promoters of really new 'and important industries. Pastoral lessees within the nefcUed dutfaicts can well afford to paj, and. should be made to pay, a, good, rente) J mile it is, I am convinced, fox the interest of the country that holders of runs subject to drought should be dealt with liberally. Mmy remarks having been made at meet ings as to my being a squatter, for the informa tion of the electors, I may say I have on'y a very ?mall interest in pastoral pursuits, which I most unwillingly had to take for a bad debt, and which I should be glad to sell at a considerable loss. As a person engage^ in trade, I have more interest in the success of agricultnre than I have in any other interest in the colony. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, dxc, W.

L The first and most important question, in my opinion, relates to theeilreme distress at pre sent existing an^ngst the working dassesof the coIoej. I was' until very recently a working man myself, and csn fully appreciate the con dition into which so many hundreds of our popu lation have been thrown by thenrjeaeatBcarc^ty. of employment I have pver^ tb,e matter niybest consideration, and won}.! ^avecati anintmediate repeal of Sutherland^ Act, and the disbursement of the present accumulated proceeds (amounting to £291,0001) in pfiblic works likely to give em ployn)0nt t9 the working classes, and to fnf^ili- . tate the thorough opening and development of the colony. I am inclined to think that a judicious expenditure of money in tramways, and in otherwise improving our internal means of communication, would be of most permanent benefit to the colony. 2\. I would advocate the borrower crone and a half millions, to be ej-eut'in 'reproductive works. 3\. Tb.,6 cext important question is that of Pro tection vtraux Free Trade. I am in favor of ad mitting raw material duty free. I consider that bonuses to assist in advancincr colonial manu factures from colonial produce would be, b^anc^ cial to the country at large, tvnd. I cejta^n\y think that bo long as I«?e vnppae e, ^ty on im ports, such «fc\tjj alkpajd, be in. ifa nature pro tectiye. 4\.

Should immigrants hfirnafter be required, as I trust may be the ease, X am in favor of ftngigtr^d immigration to suit ^'»* wants of the time. ' 6\.

I has* been equally struck with 'the limited imml^^ ' of this assembly and the immense self-confideooa with which these rural politicians iiu^insiaii upon difficult problems in political economy; ' and assume to direct the policy of the ouuuUy. ' Their creed is aB simple as its professors. Tfaey . ?elieve in agricultural representatives, be« selection, deferred payments, and a free press, that.'Irrespective of the supply of type In thai. colony, and regardless of the laws of space. ' will publish everything that is said bvevoy body on every subject at every country ? ling. j While these reformers of ^n?t]P« in muesz advocate radical changes with consHer-. able boldness, they do sot ignore precedent aaA Former experiments altogether, for they -£ng with stem tenacity to the land systems of Vic toria and New South Wales, though probably not one of those who speak eo fluently on the subject, could state the leading provuwms «T rattier Act, or show wherein th* two Acts differed. Those candidates, horn- ' ever, are utterly condemned who, jkiuiwinaj both systems, would prefer a method off settling farmers on the land, free from tbs defects and evils of either. Accordingly **??- intelligent fragment of a constituency adoptea three candidates, two of whom are profao tionists, who, would fax imported mannfactarc^ »r make the agriculturist pay through tteitDse)' for«verything he wears, and for every imple ment he uses, to put money into the pockets of a few hundred tradesmen in Adelaide. Those provincial demonstrations are mmji— -l to indicate and have a great effect upon psjbfie opinion. lavish the public could see Ifroe&ec; ' political debates as they are. The main pro moter of these gatherings, the landlord «f the public-house where -'these demonstrations sou usually held, Mr. Kenny, is a genuine -eon of' Erin, whose native wttisoonsiderabryshaipesedl by colonial, experience. Nothing troubles 1dm more than political stagnation; he believes av constituency ought always to be meetxag or preparing for a public discussion.' fl inert Jngly one of these great musterings of the free and independent is announced to come off at the Liberal Hotel, at say 7 p.m. About that time half a dozen neighbor* loiter about the. bar, and during the next two hours a fear : bucolic agitators from a distance put in an ap pearance. .
