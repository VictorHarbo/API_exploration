TO THE ELECTOBS OP WEST ADELAIDE. Gentlemen—In compliance with the request of a large and influential deputation, I offer myself as a Candidate-for the representation of the district of West Adelaide. As 1 shall have opportunities of addressing you befort the nomination day. I shall but briefly lay before you my views on those sub jects, which are of vital importance to the well-being of the colony. I shall give my support to the Bill regarding taxation, passed by che House of Assembly last session, and rejected by the Legislative Council. I shall not support indiscriminate immigration, but shall support and encourage an assisted immi gration (the nominating parties to be residents in the colony), such as will prevent the labor market being flooded, and will bring to the colony a healthy and industrious population Cur local industries require to be encouraged, and I shall advocate protection in such a degree as will encouiagethem, and at the same time stimulate competition. I am in favor of payment of members With regard to education I think that all those ECbools, in which private instruction is given,shou'd ret eive adequste remuneration for all those pupils who would pais the standard required by the present Act I shell support a Laud Act that will deal liberally with those who settle on the land, and thus en courage the occupation of it. I shell er courage the undertaking of remuserative publ c works, such as useful railways. &c; With regard to l.ocal Option and the Brewers, I think f ood laws for the regulation of Public-houses f hould be made so as to preclude thu interference of persons of extreme views. I shall advocate the openirg of public-houses on Sundays, but for a limited time after 12 o'clock noon, and for one hour in the evening. Finally, with regard fo the health of the city, I shall advocate the moat stringent measures to abate any nuisance Should any factory be closed, or any private individual suffer any loss, I should hive compensation made Should you, Gentleman, place me in the respon sible position o' representing you in the next Par liament I shall do all in my power for the welfare of West Adelaide and the colony at large.
