INTRODUCTION. As tho session draws towards its to: minatior, hon members address then sehes to businoss with groator dihgenoi Tho Opposition, by numerous defeat has been foiccd to rceogmso the fact, tilt as long as it continues in ita present du organised condition, all its attacks upo tho Treasury benches aro sure to bo i vam Tho attention of tho Assombl during tho past month has boon pro: cipally devoted to the Local Governmeri Bill This important measuro is now i tho hinds of tho Upper House, but thoa who are in favoui of its provisions ox press some anxiety regaiding its fato I contains cortam clauses, tho effect o winch would bo to press heavily, am fomo think unfairly, on property, am these, no doubt, will bo strenuous!, opposed by tho gontlomen who re gard themselves as specially chargei with the protection of property. Ii laying out tho country the survoyor have left roads at frequent intervale many of which at presont, however, ar not required by the public Consequent!; the squatters who havo bought th' various blocks which thoy divido hav< not thought it necessary to fence thom but havo contented thomsolvos for tin most part with placing gates in their run fences wherovor th"? occur We ahoulc add that holders of purchasod land als< havo adopted a Bimilar course, and tin consequence is that thousands of acre! aro now being used as grazing grount for winch the occupiers pay notlung Of course tho natural and propel plan would bo to open all thorough faros necessary for the public con vomenco, and to rnako tho occupiers of tho remainder pay a fair rental to ti« state, but this common sonso arrange- ment does not commend itself to many oi our politicians Thoy aro desirous ol .« hat they ouphoniously term " bursting np " tho largo estates in the country, and they think that any annoyance or expense they can inflict upon exten- sivo landholders is justifiable on tins ground Forco them to subdivido their estates, thoy say, and they will soon find that it would pay thom better to part with large portions, or else let thom to farmers The only result of compelling people to ioiico every square milo of country, as fax as wo can seo, would bo a lamentable waste of money-an unprofitable invest- ment of capital, and consequent loss to tho community generally It was pointed out, of course, during the dobato, that if it was desired to discourago the accumu- lation of thornlands of acres of temtoiy ni the hands of a fow, tho object might bo easily accomplished by moans of a land tax, but tv hilo admitting tina, cor- tam members could not forego the luxury of harassing a class whose principal enmo is thoir prosperity Thoy have carried thoir way in the Lower Houso, but it remains to bo Been whether their success will not bo reversed in tho othor Chamber Appeals ha\e beon made to tho Go vcrnment from various quarters to go on with tho Amending Land Bill, which was read a first time somo months ago It is perfectly patent to all that tho present artificial system of alienating tho public catato ia not only a gross fraud on tho people, whose property it squanders, but also a most potont means of demoralis mg tho community. In fact, under ita auspices the state is yearly defraudod of at least a million of monoy, whilo every form of perjury and pettiness is fostered and encouraged The Ministry, however, is so anxious to ond tho Bession, that nothing will induce it to bring forward debatable measures No doubt, too, thero is an indisposition on tho part of tho present Minister of Lands to part with tho largo powora ho wields undoi the present act Virtually, ho is enabled to proceed as ho pleases, and to do things daily which had thoy taken placo at the timo our ancestors wero engaged in winning their libortios,

At Mornington, near Schnapper Point, will be placed a 4¼in. equatorial, with double-image micrometers for cusp measure- ments.

'I be Government have intimated that it is not their intention to introduce the Amend- ing Land Bill at so late a ponod of tho ses- sion. The necessity of dealing with au amendment of the existing land Bystom has been so forced upon public attention that the decision of the Government in post pomng this measure has excited much boa tile criticism, and a motion on tho subject has been tabled m the Legislativo Assembly Ihe LstimateB have been finally passed, and the Supplementary Estimates will bo sub- mitted this week. I LOCAL GOVEnVMrM BILL This measure, which has constituted the main work of the session, has at length passed tho Legislative Assembly, and boen transmitted to tho Council Tho bill has been under consideration over four months in the Lovvei Chamber, and for the last two months baa occupied almost constant atten- tion At the departure of the last mail the endowment and toll clauses remained to be dealt with With regard to tolls, a provision waa inserted in the bill to the elfect that tolls Bhould be cloaed after the 31st December, 1875, except on private bridges constructed under octa of Parliament The endowment clauses evoked a most animated discussion New clauses were submitted by the Govern- ment, which proposed to divido the shires into threo claeseB, each CIOSB forming a schedule, and to grant endowment on the following baaia - Sbires in the first achedula 30s in the £, on the Bhilling rating, Becond schedule, 10s in the £, third schedule, 003 in the £, the endowment to be in full for five years, and afterwards to bo reduced annually by one fifth, the endowment thus expiring altogether in 1S.3 A proviso was made thut the maximum endowment should not exceed £2'J0 000 m any one j ear 'these propositions, however, were not liberal enough to meet the wishes of the members representing country districts An amend mont, moved bj Major Smith extending tho endowment to cities, towns, and BoroughB, rucluding Melbourne, waa passed, although vigorously opposed by the Government, and tbo endowment waa fixed at £2 for £1 for shires, and £1 for £1 for cities towns, and boroutbB In the latter no endowment was to exceed £2 000, and the endowment waB to last live j eora, commencing from let January next A long discussion arose over tho pío posai to strike out the proviso with the view of allowing the Government to in- troduce a freBh proviso increasing tho matt mum, it waa suggested, to £3JOO0O lina amendment, however, was negiuved, but Mr Gillies agreed to raiso tho maumum to £310 000 as ho believed that amount would be suihcientto carry out the alter itions mado 1 hero was also a lengthened discussion aa to whether tho liabilities which somo local bodies had illegally contracted should or Bhould not bo recognised Mr Higinbotham Biiggested that if recognised at all, only tho principal should bo îepaid, and not the mtprest, but tho Houae w13 averae to repu diation of any sort and paaacd a clauao legalising the repayment of all such liabilities OB those referred to Thero ia however, to bo no moro illegal action of this kind A now clauao waB passed, making the individual councillors illegally contracting a loan per sonally responsible, and another providing that each councillor acting m such a manner may, on the motion of any rato paver, bo mulcted in the aum of £200 with On tho recommittal of tho bill several amendments were proposed by private mem- bers. A proposai, submitted by Mr Higin- botham, providing that owners should bo hablo for all ratea, was negatived On clauao 203, relating to tho valuation of property, soveral amendments wore brought forward which evoked considerable diacuasion, but they wero all, with one exception, uogativod. An addition waa made to the clauBO, on the motion of Mr Gilhea, providing that pastoral tenants should bo rated in respoct of tho annual valuo of the land Tho proposition, which was strongly opposed by soveral mem- bers, was carried by a majority of 31 to 10 A new clause was added, on the motion of Mr Higinbotham, providing that tho freohold of all rools should bo vested in the Crown A now clauBO was propoacd by Mr A T Clark, tho object of which waa to tako away from local bodies tho povvor of permitting public roads to be closed, and to render it impera- tivo that all such roads should bo maintained opon and free from obstruction of any kind, lho clause was specially levelled against largo landed proprietors, who had enclosed without authority aurveyed roada Through a technical difliculty tho clause could not be proposed by a privato member, but Mr Ker- ferd, on behalf of the Government, agreed to introduce a clauao of a similar nature A clauso was accordingly added to tho bill, which provided that all proclaimed or re- served roads throughout the colony should, after 12 months from tho commencement of the act bo oponed and maintained open for the public uso, but power was given to tho Board of Land and Works, 111 caseB whoro the roads wore not required, to ordor thoir temporary closing Tho bill waa paaaod m the Assembly on tho 24th ult, and sont to tho Council, whoro its first roading was paaaod on the following day Tho second reading waB agreed to last night.

various mattera of fiucinco sta- tistics voluntary day agoncy Sabbath ob- servance (and m connexion with this rail way traffic on Sunda) s ) and many othor sub- jects belonging to the routmo of bumnosB wero discussed and resolutions wore arrivod at in duo courao A protracted debate took placo oi or tho case of tho Eov H K. Fwing who had hoon ordained by the pres- bytery of Beechworth and whoso namo waa objected to by tho Homo Mission Committoo when tho roll was callod on the first day of session According to lho Rev Dr Caima, Mr 1 wing aftur having boon rofiisod au. mittanco aa a clergyman into tho church try that committee, did not appoal against it to tho assembly but ignoring ita decision, ho proceeded to Beechworth and was inducted, by that body in an irregular manner. In tliia irregular induction tlio namoi* of the Rev. A. Robertson and the Eev. D. rroser, both of them belonging to Melbourne congregations, were concerne-. The earlier Btages of this discussion were conducted with closed doora When the public and the press were again admitted, and after much discusaion, the following de- liverance was agreed to by 58 to 10, and tli3 greater part of the minority dissented from the decision -"The assembly suatain the action of the Homo Mission Committee in rejecting Mr Ewing s application. Tind that he is not a minister of this church, that the Beechworth presbytery acted contrary to the laws of the church in proceeding to his mduo tion, and are hereby admonished for their irregularity " The matter in dispute was Stoted as follows by the Home Mission Com raittee -"Mr Ewing, who was for many years xt minister of *_o Presbyterian Church in l'as mania, retired from the ministry of that church invalided, and has since then re sided in Victoria following tho profession of teaching and other pursuits In the month of April laBt Mr Ewing wrote to the com- mittee from Bright, where he resided for a time as manager of a mining claim, asking to be put on tue committeo s preachers' list, and the committee, on its responsibility, de clined the application Soon thereafter the committee learned with profound astonish ment, that a call in favour of Mr Ewing had been sustained by the presby tery of Beech worth, and this waa followed by a demand on this committeo from the presbytery to publish its reasons for declining Mr Ewing s application Tins committee of course re fused to comply with any such demand, whereupon the presbytery, after long delay and within a few weekB back, went through the form of a settlement at Beechworth and Mr Ewing is now in possession of the Près byterian church and manse in that town ' In connexion with this Bubject the Rev James Nish, for himself and others read the following statement of opinion as to their dissent from Dr Macdonalds lesolution, namely - "1 Because the reception of a protest against hating the name oí Mr Lwing placed on the roll would hate sulhciently conserved the rights of the nomo Mission Committee, and have obviated the prejudging of the action taken by them in refusing to entertain its application "2 Because the removal of Mr Ewings name from the duly certified roll of the Près by tery of Beechworth was a virtual censure of that presbytery for their procedure "3 Because the pronouncing of a judg ment, m any form before the individual or court to whom the judgment refers have been cited to plead or has had a suitable opportunity of speaking in their own de fence, is a violation of the first principles of justice, and is specially to be deprecated in dealing with cases which affect character and civil rights ' 4 Because, as has been again and again admitted by former assemblies irregularities on the part of inferior courtB even when Íiroved, do not necessarily invalidate or call or reversal of that procedure, and hence a forliort aro not to be assumed without proof as injuriously affecting the status which would have been secured to ministers and members of the church if tho action which is deemed irregular had been either unchal lenged or unexceptionable Many reasons were stated at length in writing, signed by the dissentients, and were banded m to the clerk of the assembly, pointing out tho unfairness of taking action against a clergyma" without making a formal chai.e against him so that ho might be heard m his own defence These wero answered by other reasons stated at length on behalf of the Home Mission Committee the general tenor of which may be gathered from an extract - " ö The assembly is not responsible for its memberB concealing information regarding the office bearers of the church And if there lias been concealment concerning any person this should not influence them to receive au unsuitable man And while it may not boa duty to take action regarding an office bearer of the church it may yet be a duty to decline his application to bo received as a minister "0 Mr Ewing not hating been received by the Home Mission Committee, and not being on the list of unattached pieachort* he could not be a candidate for the ministry of the congregation at Beechworth, and the committee aro not required to give to a con gregation reasons for not receiving a minister into the church As to the members of as Bembly not being informed of tho reason, in cases of a delicate nature a certain amount of discretion must be allowed to the Home Mission Committee and where no appeal has been made by the party interested it is un wise to satisfy the questions which may be put by individual members of the assembly ' A resolution was proposed that for their action in connexion with the caso the Rev A Robertson, of West Melbourne and the Rev D Fraser of Heidelberg 'be now solemnly aamomshed from the chair On this occasion (the evening sederunt of the seventh day of the sesBion), the Rov D Eraser was admonuhed from the chair, but the Ret A Robertson left the hall saying that he declined the jurisdiction of the meet mg A citation waa sent after much dis cuBSion on the following day, but was answered only in writing to tho effect that " tho finding of last evening was not only hasty ai d not duly considered, but utterly incompetent and illegal, as being a finding to which the court could not como in accord ance with the law and practice of tho Presbyterian church of Victoria and those of the Presbyterian church at largo who hold PardotanBinstituteB as binding on Presby terian courts as acknowledged by tho Mode rator himself Mr Robertson respectfully declines at so Bhort a notice, and without having the advice which be is entitled to get before replying to the deputation Bent to him to notify tho course which he ia prepared to take but meanwhile resort ea all his legal and constitutional rights, civil and ecclesi astical declines to commit lnmBelf further than to eay that the assembly must tako its course on its own responsibility, and leave it to him to take his when ho is in a condition duly advised to decide on the matter On tho ninth day of session this résolu tion waB agreed to after a further cita tion of the Rev A Robertson, to which no perBona, appearance was made - ' Whereas the Rot Andrew Robertson was guilty of contempt of assembly at the oten mg sederunt of tho general assembly on \V ednesday the 18th mst , whereas this offence has been aggratated by subsequent repeated manifestations of a spirit of insub ordination , and whereas moreover, such a course of procedure would fully justify tho infliction of a much moio sovere sontonce yet seeing tbnt the assembly ure desirous to treat lina with all possible gentleness and so lead lum to a frame of mind in fitting ac cordanco tv ith his ordinotion vow, by winch he stands pledged to submit himself willingly, humbly, and in the spirit of meekness to the admonitions of his brethren, it is hereby resolved to suspend lum from tho exercise of his judicial lune tion and by the adoption of this resolution, he is authoritatively doclared to be sus pended accordingly, it* from having a seat in the presbytery m the commission, or in the general assembly as also from presiding or avmg a seat in the session omi the board of management of the congregation, or from pre siding at congregational meetings at West Melbourne, until bo shall unrcervodly ao knowledge and express regret for the fore cited offenccB to the assembly m commis sion and submit to the admonition of the moderator with certification that unless he so acknowledges and expresses regret at the meeting of the commission in May noxt, the commission is hereby instructed to take further action in the matter ' lo this the Rev D Tiaser dissented on the following grounds nomely-1 Because the offence for which it wad moved on Wed nesday last, at the evening sederunt that Mr Robertson should be admonished, was not, m Mr Robertson a opinion, or that of other mombera of the assembly,

month in connexion with mining, which havo to a cortam oxtont relieved that mdtiBtry from tho Btato of rather monotonous dulness in winch it had continued for some months previously The Golden Stream Tubutoand tho Pandora companies, on the Garden Gully line of roof, at Sandhurst, bato Btruck golden stone of .atable qualities and of such a naturo as is ikely to give profitable work to thoso com Îlames for some time to come A triai crush ng of quartz from the first named company returned 108o/ lOdwt from 110 tons of stone, or about 2Cdnt. per ton-a result which was considered extromely favoiirablo, and after the crushing the mine continued to improve in appearance m both tho northern and southern drives of tho claim The Pandora Company cut good stone in tho enstom leg of tho roof of winch thoy wero in search, at a depth of 090ft from the surface, the stone being 20in thick The striking of quartz of that description at auch a depth from the surface was of vast im portance to the district as it proved there was payable stone on the Garden Gully line at a lower level than any which had hitherto been discovered The same company a few days ago also struck rich stone in their winze at the GOOft level and that together with the other promising appearances in the minc, as well aa in the Golden Stream Tribute, and other claims on the Garden Gully line had the effect of raiBing the price of shares in all the different companies on the hue At Stawell an important incident occurred on the 23rd inst when the Albion Company there struck the reef at a depth of 645ft from the Burface The reef showed gold, and the stone was very promising The Albion mine is some distance away from any of the other Stawell claims which have payable lodes and the discovery was therefore considered of im mense importance to the district Another rich reef was also struck during the month in the Crown Cross mine at Stawell. and the Newington and Magdala claims winch have been sunk to a depth of about 1 100ft and 1 r00ft respectively each had an nillux of water-a sign that was v ery encouraging to the hope that the ainkers were near the reef they bad so peraevenngly and at such great cost been mining for The inflow of water into a claim under similar circumstances is enerally reckoned an almost certain sign of eing near a reef In the Magdala claim the water was said to be coming in from the side where the rich North Crosa reef is and aa the Magdala shaft is just about the depth at which they expected to cut what is known as the lower Hat reef tnu general impression Bcems to bo that they may any day find that reef If they do BO and it is equal to that in the adjoining claim theie will be an im menso increase in the value of the mine lhe Creswick alluvial claims continue not onlytojield well but also to increase their yields weel ly and if a few more of the pro gressive minea theie Bhould also get into gold the returns will be much larger The news from the Blackwood

On the water, there has been little of spa cial interest to note during the month, but both the yachting and rowing clubs have made several turn outs, which showed that aquatics aro by no means neglected by ths Victorians. THEATRES, i.e. The popularity of Mr. and Mrs William son at the Theatre Royal has continued uu abated during the month Mr Williamson took its benefit on the 16th ult., when "Our American Cousin" waa produced very successfully. The attendance on the occa- sion was one of the largest ever seen at the theatre, and the cordial reception of the bénéficiaire Bhowed that he has established hiniBelf as a firm favourite The performances at the Prince of Wales Opera houae during the month have been fairly successful and well patroniaed At the time of our last aummary, "LaFillede Madame AngOt" was being played with immense eclat, and on ita withdrawal "Rob Roy" was placed on the atage with special regard to the musical parti culara. The pieco, however, could hardly bo considered a success, and was withdrawn after a week The play at present being produced at the Opera house is a melodrama, by Miss Benbow, a Victorian authoress en titled 'Tor £00,000," which waa first played at Sandhurst some weeks ago with great success. Its reception, however, in Mel bourne waa hardly favourable, and in fact, it must be said that the play, divested of its local colouring, is but of the common place order of melodrama, in which virtue and villany have the usual struggle, with the usual satisfactory result Preparations aro being made at both the Royal and tho Opera houso for the protluc tion of the Christmas pieces which it is expected will be produced this year with more than the usual brilliancy M Blondin, the world renowned tight-rope performer, gate his fiist performance on the 4th Hist, in a large enclosure erected on the Artillery Football ground lue weather was very unfavourable the performance, in fact, being git en amid thunder lightning and rain, butnotwitliBtanding M Blondin'sfoats, then as well as on the many occasions on which he has since appeared, fully justified the highest expectations of his skill and daring The weather, unfortunately.has been much agamBt him on most occasions, but it is evident that his popularity is steadily increasing his latest appearance-on Satur- day last-being the most successful perform, ance in point of attendance ho has yet git en _ MUSIC \Aith one exception there has been but little doing in the way of music to deservo spécial notice since we wrote last.

At the close, however, an improve*! feeling has been evinced. Commercial confidence has boon well sustained, for though tho banka have not yet Been their way to relax the stringency which has been kept up for montba paat, nothing either aerious or alarm- ing haa occurred in the tv ay of f ailurca, and in commercial circlea generally the feeling ia beginning to bo entertained that the worst is now over ; and though it may bo somo time before confidence is completely estab- lished, and business haB entirely recovero, its wonted tone, yet all fears in regard to further mercantile difficulties of any consequonco may now bo said to be over. The past month haa been particularly unsatisfactory to im porters, in consequence of the losses to which they have been subjected on their im- portations ; and as an instance we may point moro especially to brandy. Shipments of Hen nessy's arriving at the present moment from London, which cost 10s. 6d. to 10a. Odi laid down, if offered on the market would not realise over 7s. 9d. Heavy losses aro like- wise occurring in other staple articles, and though not to such an extent aa that referred to, yet sufficiently ao to create au unpleasant fooling. As the last mail was leaving, we reported the sus- pension of Mr. Henry Mills, timber mer- chant, with net liabilities amounting to £14,117, and assets estimated at £11,534. An adjourned meeting was subsequently hold, and after receiving the report of tho investi- gating committee, an offer of compromise was accepted on the following terms :-12s. 6d. per £ guaranteed, payable half cash an- bali at three and six months ; 2s. 6d. addi- tional his own bill, at 24 months, and this offer baa since been ratified. On the 5th ult., very considerable uneasiness was created by the rumoured suspension of Messrs. Wilson, Crosbie, and Co., for many years engaged in tho country trade as wholesale grocers. At the meeting of creditors, held on the 10th of the month, a statement was submitted which showed the direct liabilities as amounting to £23,700 Is. Od., the contingent liabilities being £26,096 8s.; the assets, including £1,018 2s. 2d. of doubtful debts, were valued at £22,220 Is. 2d., leaving a nominal deficiency of £1,486 0s. 4d. ; but, when allowance was made for losses on doubtful debts and con- tingent liabilities, it was'-estimated that the deficiency could not be leBS than £5,000. An investigating committee was appointed to report to an adjourned meeting, which was held on the 12th, and the report prov- ing satisfactory, an offer of 14s. per £, gua- ranteed, payable half coBh, half three months, waa made on behalf of Messrs, Wilson, Crosbie, and Co., and ita acceptance being strongly recommended, a resolution to that effect was carried. A meeting of the cre- ditors of Messrs. William Mitchell and Co., brewers, Richmond, waa held. _ The state- ment submitted showed liabilities amount- ing to £4,500; the assets are estimated at £3,100. A committee of the creditors present was appointed to investigate the position of the estate, and report to an adjourned meeting. At the subsequent meeting, it was agreed to assign the estate to two of the creditors present. The publication by Colonel Ward of a report on the condition and prospects of the branch of the Mint established in Melbourne, which that gentleman superintends, was made the subject of investigation by a sub- committee of the Chamber of Commerce, who also published a report showing the conclusions they had arrived at in regard to its utility. According to the statement of the deputy-master, the annual expenditure has exceeded the revenue by £10,000, but the report of the sub-committee shows that to that is bo added an amount of £10,000 for interest on the land, buildings, and machinery, and the in- creased cost of remitting to England tho inlerest on our debentures. But that is not all. The action of the Mint has had the effect, it is stated, of raising exchange, by increasing the cost of gold to the extent of 9d. to Is. per ounce-equal to at least 1 per cent., putting thereby into the pockets of mining investors a Bum equal to £50,000 or £60,000, and into those of the pastoral in- terests-in consequence of tho advance in exchange-an amount equal to £15,000 to £20,000; and the conclusion arrived at is that, unless the loss which at present is shown to bo made by the operations of the Mint can be turned to a profi t, it would bo far better to abolish the institution, and turn the buildings into a "Deeds Registry office." From this some correspondence has arisen, criticising the statements made in the report of the sub-committee, and more especially taking exception to the assertion that the Mint has been the means of raising the exchange. Unfortunately, however, Colonel Ward gives as one of the indirect reasons for establishing the Mint the neces- sity for keeping the exchange from fluctuat- ing, so that he is left by his defending critics on the horns of a dilemma. If the exchango is kept at the same uniform rate as before, the Mint has done nothing more than was formerly attained. If the exchange has been raised, as already referred to, all the objec- tions brought against it stand good ; in either case a direct loss of £20,000 per annum ap- pears to have been incurred without any corresponding benefit having been con- ferred. Operations in the market have not been extensive. In our review of the month we observe that bulk and bottled beers have been in very slow demand. Dundee goods have been neglected. Calcutta cornsacka have of late, nowever, risen into notice. Trade in candles has not been activo. Fish has been selling very freely, and considerable parcels, moro especially of Californian salmon, have changed hands. In fruit the only feature is the arrival of new. Bread stuffs, though an unsatisfactory market, have not varied much during the month. Feeding grains are still realising very ex- treme figures. In the arrivals we note tho Emma with barley, and tho Italy with oats, from San Francisco. New hops have made their first appearance. Metals aro lower. In oils, we note one sale of kerosene to the ex tent of 10,300 cases ; otherwise the market is very sluggish. We note the arrival of the Agate with 12,000 cases. In salt, the clearance of 300 tons fine London stoved ¡B the only special transaction reported. Operations in sugar aggregate 07.2G0 bags and mats. Teas have been quiet. Timber is moving, though not to any great extent. Tobaccoes aro firm. Brandies are much lower, and very depressed ; about 1,300 pack- ages, hlids., and quarters have been forced off of late. On Sunday evening, the 15th ¡nat., the mail steamer from Galle reached the bay. By that opportunity our dates from London reach to 3rd October. The shipments to the colonies for the four weeks ending September 9 amount to £1,239,100, against £1,325,000 the previous four weeks. Those to Melbourne figure at £413,400, being a de- crease on the previous period of £97,000. On Sydney, Adelaide, and Swan River there is a decrease for tho same period, while Queens- land, Tasmania, and New Zealand show an increase. Tho wool saleB have gone off very satis- factorily ; about 20,000 bales altogether have been sold in Melbourne. Greasy has been quitted at 8d. to Is. -lj-d,*, Ileeco atlGd. to 2s. 3ld.; and acoured at Is. 3d. to 2s. 2d. In this class of property, not much has been done this month. Mr. John Geo. Dougharty announced having sold by auction, by order of the executor, tho Eon. William Wilson, Goorimpa and Butha Butha, 650 square miles, with 40 milos frontage to both sides of the Paroo River, N.S.W., together with 42,500 sheep at 15s. a head, cattle and horses at £G a "ead, stores and plant at a valuation, to Messrs. C. and S. Officer. Also, by order of tho executors in tho estate of tho late Mr. Robert M'Laurin, Curnalla and Derrulaman stations, near Moama, with 2,000 cattle at £8 a head, horses at £5, free- hold land at 30s. an acre, stores, &c;, at a valuation, to Mr. Henry Ricketson, of Glen Eira.
