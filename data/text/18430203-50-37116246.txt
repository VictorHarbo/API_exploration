PEK.CI5IV7NG that no Candidate lias JL .f'uniu forward to represent you in the forth coming Legislative Council, i bog leave to so licit jour sufl'ragus for that honour. 1-Nir this favour, I ground my pretensions on tho long oxpnrionce at upwards of twenty-two years, whlcli I have had in the pastoral and agilculturalpui suits of these counties, the large stake which I hold In them and the adjoining County of Argyle, as well as my public services In these districts, which I trust are still fresh in the memory of most of you. My public principles are, I flatter myself, well known. I shall continue strenuously to uphold both the legitimate rights of the Crown and of the people, ns guaranteed by the British Const i- tiitionj nnd will equally oppose -any encroach, merit on thn prerogatives of tho one or the rights of tlie oilier. In the siime spirit, I am prepared to advocate the full liberty ot conscience, and of . private judgment, in mutters both of religion and po Utlcs. I am decidedly of opinion, that an assured increase of population from thu piircnt State, is of the utmost importance to the prosperity oT the Colony, as well its of the British Empire. And t am therefore prepared to make every ex ertion to encourage at|d maintain Immigration.' To those principles I can so far pledge myself. But in regard to other matters which may he brought forward, 1 will expuct that I may he allowed, after the bust consideration, to exercise my own judgment, in forming which, I shall ever weigh must attentively nnj suggestions which may be made to me by. my cunstituenis. \- I shall only further nssurc you, that should I obtain the high distinction of being elected yuui ruprtisentativt*, I shall exert myself to the ut most, of my abilities to support not only your interests, but those of the whole community; and that In my efforts for this purpose, nelthei the frowns of power, nut any personal interest, slrill. ever Induce me to swerve from tho duties to which I now pledge myself. Ii. M'ALISTER. tO TUB INDEPENDENT ELECTORS OP THE COUNTY OP DURHAM. Dunmore, Hunter's River, 9th January; 1843. r~1 ENTLEMllN,— As it apponrs from Of tho. lVill' nbout to be introduced into the legislative Council, that the County of Durham s to bo constituted ono of tho Electoral Dls ricts ul tlio colony, to return a Member to ho Colonial Legislature,. I beg most respect ully to offer myself as a Candidate for your suffrages, for the. representation of that county. Having' l'Rsldud for nineteen years in this Co ony, seventeen of which I have spent as a scttlei n the County of Oiirhnm, it will scarcely he no :essary for me to say anything of myself person illy, cither as to my character and standing in so duty, or as to my stake in the colony. And, as I conceive I Imvcalrcady, and in various ways, given sufficient evidence of my anxious desire to pro mute tlie general welfare' and ndvancemiint of this district in time past, I trust you will not require any additional pledges of | tny: readiness to support every measure that may have a similar )l)jcct in future, in the event of my being liouuured to 'represent your interests in the Colonial Legislature. In regard to my political principles, they are limply Tlic greatest happiness of tiik greatest NDMiiF.it. I do not think, with certain parties in the Colony, that the franchise is at all too low. On the contrary, I consider it one of tlie best means of elevating tlie great' mass ol society in education, in morals; and in religion, to frive the humbler classes a direct interest in their Government by ghing them a direct con trol over the appointment of their Legislators. I have 'long considered the expenditure of this Colony dlsproportioned to tlio amount and wants of its population. . I consider it susceptible of important reductions, and I conceive that the public service generally might bo even 'butter' conducted than it is, with fewer hands and .at considerably less , expense. It would bo my ob ject to recommend and support such reductions, wherever they could be effected withoutx'bmpro mising the public interest. I'am fur entire religious liberty and no political, distinctions on account of religion ; considering the interests of morality and good, government us likely to be best piomotcd by affording alt le llgious denominations a fair fluid without favour to any. . In regard to the immigration of virtuous and industrious persons into thin .territory from the mother country, I am decidedly of opinion that It ought to' be promoted by every possible me.ins ; :uid at a time when so m.iny of our fellowcountry men, who arc willing to cmigiate to this colony from the United Kingdom, are suffering 'un exampled distress at home, I hold it to beiucum bont upon the colony to make every exertion, as well from motives of self- interest as of humanity, to afford them tho requisite means. And believ ing that it is fctill practicable, greatly diminished as tho resources of the colony now are, to secure, a large supply of valuable labour fiom the mother- country in this way, I cunceive th.it till such exertions shall have been made and Jon ml ineffectual, it would neither be politic nor patri otic to encourage the extensive importation of nn inferior race from India or elsewhere. Such gentlemen, arc my principles. If you are satisfied with them and with, me, I shall be happy to represent your intciests In th« ncn Council and to do my best to promote them. At tho same time, I shall neither he sorry nor dis appointed if you should find some other person who possesses your confidence more fully than I do, tind Who would', mote zealously piomote the welfare und advancement of our common country. ; ? I ltavo tho honor to be; Gentlemen, . Your most obedient humble servant, ANDItEW LANG. TO THIS INDEPENDENT ELECTORS OF THE CITY OF SYDNEY. GENTLEMEN, — I beg to announce , to you that it is my intention to offer my self as it candidate' for the honour of reprusent ingiyour City-.in. the fiist Session of the new Legislative' Council. -After ? having laboured ainong-you for.tlie, lust eighteen years, In concert with other friends. of Ireudom, to obtain those constitutional privileges, which are tlio rightful inheritance of IMtuns and their descendants, In whatever quarter of the Empire- they may- re- side, I trust now that the parent Legislature has .it length conceded to us a portion of our birth right, that I maybe permlted to found my claim to your support, or. the. p?rt j havo taken in procuring this important concession, tardy, as it has been, and imperfect and unsatisfactory, hs it still is. My, public principles have been so often before the public, in tho course of tlio long and arduous struggle,1 which lms led to this iippronchlnf; change in our form of government, that I du not consider it necessary to trouble you with n 'recapitulation of them now: feeling confident, that my veneration for civil and religious liberty, anil for all the free and expansive olemer.vso) uur happy constitution, will not be doubted by any one, who is acquainted with my public career. Should it he. your pleasure to ele.ct me to' tin distinguislied honour of being otie of your first representatives, I pledge myself to deal with all measures that may hi- propounded to the Coun. cil, according only to iny diillberato views ol their probable tendency, come from what ijuar. ter they may; giving to whatever I may decn: beneficial to the general weal, my c inlial sup port ; and to whatever I mayjudge detrimental my strenuous opposition. A son of the soil myself, it must be almost needless to add,' that my whole interests, fuej. ings, and prejudices, are identified with tin prosperity of iny country — a prosperity which 1 know, e;m only be insured by free institution! and equal laws. To revive nnd re-establish thin prosperity on lasting foundations is evidently tho first want of the Colony, and will be tin first duty of its new Legislature. After having devoted tlie best energies or mj life, to promote the interests nt my country, ; trust it will not he deemsd presumptuous in mi to anticipate, that few will be found in it Councils more competent to assist in extricatliif it from its difficulties; still fewer— with mori experience, purer intentions, or greater zeal. 1 have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedlent-Scrvant, AV.
