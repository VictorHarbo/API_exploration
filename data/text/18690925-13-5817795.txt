Sir,-In your paper of last Tuesday, there is a letter under the title of "Port Phillip Pilot Arrangements," which, I think, to any honest minded man, would have reflected more credit upon its author (Capt. Bartlett), had he postponed its publication until the Investigation at the Pilot Board (between the Palm Tree and the Rip) had terminated ; as it was evidently published to prejudice the pilot's case at that board then sitting. I will only deal with that -v ory small portion of it which really relates to "pilots' arrangements," the other part being entirely foreign to that subject. Cant. Bartlett there states that vessels running for this port before S.W. enies in the daytime cannot procure a pilot till within three miles of the Hoad) and that at night. It would be perfect madness." My answer to the first part of that assertion is, that within such a distance, and under such circumstances, It is almost impossible at all to board ships there on account of the fearful sea which exists, causing us,' for our own safety, to cruise from the to 10 miles out I am certain the captains of our coasting steamers who have had a long experience in those waters will endorse. this as a fact. As to the second part of the assertion, I can prove that I have taken pilotage charge of ships by night nearly as often as by day. Our mail steamers, which are eight times out of 10 arriving by night, have never lodged any complaint against us and there are many respectable ship masters regularly trading to this port who can give a very different account of us during the night. In fact, I can produce documents signed by masters ..thçnwçlvca which would go far to convince even Captain Bartlett that his statements were not altogether correct. Indeed, it must be patent! to every sensible person that our merchants and the press would never tolerate men to re- main in the pilot service had they displayed such reckless indifference to their own duty and the public welfare as that which Captain Bartlett alleges to exist here. Furthermore, let me add,, two handle some of the largest ships in the world la narrow waters under canvas, a rare thing. now; In Europe, where steam tugs are so plenty and cheap, and, judging from Mitchell's" Maritime Register," the damage done to shipping in this port will bear a very favourable comparison to other ports, which, In my opinion, speaks well for the Victorian pilot service. In conclusion, I may mention that I have been 27 years at sea, 15 of which I have served here In this pilot service, and I certainly feel proud of working with such an honourable and competent body of men, and did I choose to leave them, 1 ould, In three months afterwards, take charge of as fine a ship as ever left London. I feel sorry that Captain Bartlett and a few others should combine to crush us under their feet." Hoping for justice sake you will give this a place in your impartial and valuable journal. I remain your obedient servant, W A WAUCHOPE, junior of the sea pilots. Pilot offices, Williamstown, Sept. 24. i
