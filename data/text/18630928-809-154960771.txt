Our issuo of Friday, in which tho monthly com mercial review was published, contained most of tho market details generally supplied in our weekly summary ; and, as it is unnecessary to recapitulate tho same, a casual glanco at tho week's transactions will sulfico 011 the present occasion. Tho slight im provement noted towards the closo of last week, in consequence of the weather agaiu becoming unsettled, has been lost duriug tho present, tho general trado demand having been languid throughout ; but, though tho early part was characterised by great dulness, in tho latter portion, notwithstanding the doparturo of tho mail, and the attention of merchants being wholly occupied by duties pertaining thereto, very largo quantities of goods, chiefly sugars, havo been disposed of at auction, while in teas andtobaccoes somo extensivo operations have been entered into. On ale and stout in bulk wo have no alteration to roport. Sales of colonial Binglo stout in bottle havo been made at 8s 3d, and a parcel of Byass's was placed at 8s Od. In corn sacks and wool packs there lias been nothing doing. Caudles have again been largely sold at auction, and lower prices submitted to ; full weights realised 8gd to 9gd, and 7Jd to 8Jd per packet was obtained for light weights. Cement, confectionery, cordage, chemi cals, chicory, coffco, fish and oilmen's stores con tinue without any change. Brcadstuffs havo been quiet, and transactions limited to trade purchases, at £14 10s to £15 for silk-dressed country brands, £15 10s for Hart's and Magarcy's, an I £13 5s for Victorian. Colonial oats have improved, Gs 9d to 6s being obtained for feeding and Gs 3d to 0s Od for milling ; 10,000 bushels Dutch aud Danish, sold all faults, brought 3s Id to 3s 4d. The Capo fruits recently to hand were offered at a limit of 8d for raisins, which had to bo reduced to 7Jd, but even then only a few hundred boxes could be sold ; sweated brought 7Jd. Currants aro now- offering at 4Jd. Hops have been in increased inquiry at auc tion ; Kent's, various growths, brought 3£d to 4gd ; faulty, 1857's, 4d to 5d; and G2's, Is OJd iu bond. Several parcels of 02's liavo also been placed privately at Is 4Ad to Is 5d. Business in malt has been confined to executing trade orders at 83 3 Jd to 8s Od. A sale of sheet lead at £27 denotes the only change wo havo to report in metals. As shipments of now butter continue to arrive to a languid market, importers show moro anxiety to quit, and prices havo gradually fallen from lOd to 9Jd and 9d, last sales having been effected at 8gd to 9Jd for parcels ox Lightning. Hams and bacon aro quiet, but prices havo not varied. Cheese, in good condition, is valued at 13d. Tho offer of the cargo of rice, ex Notre Dames des Victoiros, resulted in nothing being dis posed of ; it was, however, announced from the box that the price would henceforth be fixed ot £22. Coarso salt lias not improved. Fine has been sold at £3 10s, and rock at £2 15s. Nearly 25,000 bags of sngar offered this week wero all placed.

The attend ance was very large, aud the bidding most spirited ; and 011 Friday, the entire cargoes of the Les Piots and Hannah Nicholson, from Mauritius, und suc ceeded in selling evory bag, as also tho residue 01 the cargo of the Maurice, together aggregating 15, 001 bags of Mauritius sugar, at tho following prices £11 per ton for vory low black rations, to £18 10s for medium, and £22 10s for good ; medium collators, £23 10a ; good do, £24 to £21 10a ; fine do, £20 5s to £20 10s ; grainy brewing sorts, £27 15s to £28 10s; yellow crystals, £31.

Tho Energic's cargo of common teas, unsuccessfully offered at auction, was placed pri vately; the quantity consisted of 0588 packages, and comprised more than one sort. A speculative movement in tobacco led to the purchase of 400 cases Northern and Southern halves ; aud as the wholo of this description is now centred with one firm, an advance of Od per lb lias been established, prices now ranging from 2s Od to 3s Od, and oven 4s for superior, aromatic having been sold at 4s 3d to 4s Od. No sales of timber luno come under our notico. Wines and spirits evince 110 sigus of im provement ; 1100 eases Martell's changed hands under ordinary quotations, tho exact figure did not transpire.
