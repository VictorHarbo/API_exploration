Having by cxpenmcnt satisfied herself that Dauns- - brog. a very delicate and highly scnaitivo remedy, would withstand tho Australian chmate, Madame Frokjar began, as very many mople know, to prnc- tiso with it quietly. It proved a godsend to many in afflicted woman, and in a few years Madame rraolvcd, and thus proved herself a benefactor of womankind, to giro up masssge and dcrotc herstlf to Dannebrog.
