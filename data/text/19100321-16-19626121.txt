8ACRIFICE AND SECURITY. The acceptance of the financial agreement, men when embodied in the Constitution, will repiesent on tin» pait 01 the Stutes a su/.rifiee lur gieatei ihun v\us anticipated by thoso vvlio most stienuouslj utlto eatod the acceptance ol the Fedeial svstem Mr Kidston, in his speech at Warwick on l'ndaj nlg-ht, pointed out thut, taking; 'the teur 1909 as an example, the Couimon trealtji leceived i.2,030,000 as its share m the Customs, and Excise revenues, and thut if the proposed agreement-as already aecepted by the ijoternments of all the States and submitted to the electors-had been in oppjatlon the Common- wealth's ¡,hi\re would hat« been £5,222,000 And jet it is auda eiouslt contended by the Labour Sociafist unlftcationibts that the Commonwealth has been generous to the States instead of the States being generous to the Common- wealth The sacrifice made fojy the States may be explained in another way The new agreement proposes that after the 1st lulv, 1910, the States shall rcteivc unimullv from Customs and Excise a sum calcu- lated at the late of 25/ peu head of tho population nccoiding to the statisl.es of Hhe ( ommon'vcalbb Ijndei the expinng agi cement IQuumsland in tin tem 1U09 actu itllj received 37/1 por head of the population undei the new agree mont she will, of course onlv le echo her shaie m the general 25/ per capita distribution The con traot means that if the proposed agreement had been in operation last j ear Queensland would onh hate receitcd £600,000 instead of ¿1,024,87b-a difference of £334,87« The State paid old age pensions in that j ear to the amount of C148.000, but as the Commonwealth is now paying them Queensland was íelieved of that sum Even then, however, the Stale loss would have been £186,000 had the proposed agreement been in force Yet the Premiers anti Treasurers of all the States, as well as the Premier of the Commonwealth, have unanimously accepted the new agreement which will take the place of tho Braddon Clause, and levommended its en doi sèment bv the electors oi Aus- tralia at the referendum to bo taken nett month Why should the repre- sentatives hate expressed willing- ness to make the sacrifices to which we hat e t ailed attention "> The jeph is thut there was the compen- sating advantage of permanence and seeuritj bt having the new financial agi cement made- a component part of the Constitution Tf bv nnj chame the electois should not give eflect to the finan i ial agreement trien at the end of the tear the solvent v or insolvency of the States will be entirely at the mercy of the Federal Treasurer and Government for the time being The sovereign rights oi the States undei a democratn form of government will have been abandoned, and their living revenues sacrificed With the agreement in the Constitution theie ) s both secuiitv and permanence- as far as permanence can be secuietl bt tho expressed will of the people who consented to the Constitution and who alone have povvei to amend it in the way provided In the Con- stitution itself It is that povvei which is so feaied by the sham democrats of the Laboui Party, who wish to bo given the position of Tederal dictators should the Social- ist and unification goal ever be jeached Let the ogi cement be ic pudiated and the States' Govern- ments would be plated in a helpless and hopeless position, though com- pelled to di aw upon olhei levenues bv ever increasing land and direct taxation to continue a precarious ex- istence This was the desperate plight so dreaded bt the framers of the Constitution, who refused to ask its acceptance by the electors unless there was some constitutional guar- antee that then living revenue irom the Customs would bp continued Sir John Tonest said "It is like beating the au to tell us that we are to give up oui great revenue producer-the Customs-and that we are to have no guaiantee whatever that anv pail of that money will bo leturned to us " Without such a constitutional piotision, said Mi Kingston, ' we should be told 'Suiely it was possible to devise some scheme by which we could meet the leasonable demands of tho Federa- tion without depriving us of our ihief source oi revenue, and giving us no guarantee that the money will be returned to us " Mr Isaacs de- da) ed 'To ask the States to enter the Tedeiation without any secunty is too much Wo know 'v«ry well that faith will move mountains, but it seems to nie we aie making a mountain of dimensions that it will take a very strong faith to move I would earnestly press on the Com- mittee not the dosirabilitt, but the absolute necessitv if the consent of the States is to be obtained, of pro vidmg some means b\ which the States and the State Treasurers shall receive a guarantee that thev will not be deprived of then revenues, and left in a most temblé state of uncertainty with íegard fo meeting tM.ii liabilities " It is such u guarantee that the Tedeial Labom Party refuse to give The desperate plight in which the States would bo placed bv having their great Custom revenue placed absolutely at the meicv of the Tederal Treasurei is best shown bv the íesponsibilities of their Govern- ments in the Toderal sv stem Bv fait tho largest propoition of Aus- tralian expenditure is lepresented by the States as distinct from the Com- monwealth Tho only Tederal De- partment which involves any consid- erable expenditure without any avail- able revenue theieiiom is that of de- fence whereas tho States have to prov ide for the entire w ork of educa tion, railwaj construction, loads, bridges, harbours, immigration, and closer settlement, the opening up of Crown lands, hospitals, charities, police and tho administration of the law and exclusive of these details there is "other oxpendituio" amount- ing to 19/2 peí head of the popula- tion, The last item alone means moie than the total expenditure of tho Commonwealth in the j ear 1905-6 , what then would be the re- sult of placing the eíllciene¿ oi this enormous administration at the mercy of a Fedeial Tieasurei untc stneted bt any constitutional guai anloo that the States would teceite their piopei shaic fiom the Cus- toms rev enue » In realitt, their work is such that thev should have the first claim on such revenue, and sacrifice has been pushed to an extiemo in making saeuiices, under the pioposed agreement never con- templated by the fi amers of tho Tedei allon Labour-Socialists talk largely and looselt about tho in- creasing responsibilities of the Com- monwealth Ts that ant reason for surrendering all conti ol of the com- mon purse *> Hav e not also the Stutes increasing lesponsibilities of a far moro împoi tant character in pioviding foi the educational re- tirements of a glowing population, i uilwaj s, and ev ei v thing upon which development depends ' Exclude de- fence and the Post Office, it will bo found that the State Governments must make piovision for all the great spending departments , tet it is pi oposed bv Mr Tisher and his Tederal colleagues to depriv e them of anv right to their chief and surest sources of îevenue What these gentlemen want is not exactly sacrifiée, but rather absolute sui rendei The action taken hy the State Labour Paity contrasts badlj with that of the Parhamentarv Labour Party of New South Wales in the latter's manful declaration that the peirmenency and secur- ity so dwelt upon bv speakers at the Brisbane Labour Conference can only be obtained b> making the financial agreement part of the Con- stitution. A SLANDER ON AUSTRALIA. Hie habit of libelling Australia as a promising field for emigration from European countries has recen ed a htrong rebuke from the Premiei of New bouth Wales Mr Wade has re leived from the Agent-General the text of the waining which was issued bj the Danish Government against emigration to Australia The Danish Minister for Toreign Affairs, it ap- peals stated regarding the condition of affairs in Australia and New üea lund that, as the difficulties for nri niigmnts subsisting in those loun tiios had latterlj largely increased, Danes in search of employment weie earnestly dissuaded from going there Mr Wade in repl> to this íidiculous libel has sent an authoritative» met sage-and the example should be fol- lowed m the case of Queensland-for publication by the British Press, de daring that no country in the world to-dav offers better inducements than Australia for genuine settlers and industrious workers Mr Wade, how- ever, makes the mistake of dwelling too much on the policy and poten- tialities of his own State, as though there was an implication-conscious or otherwise-that it inaght be re- garded as an exception to the ac- cusation made by the Danish Min- ister against New Zealand and Aus- tralia in general This is a case in which joint action would have been far more effective In every one of the State« thsr« has been ma awakening to the need for a vigor ous immigration poiicv moto par tit ulm 1\ in piovidlng 101 the le quirements of new settlers while it is also difficult to supply the local demand fot ngricultui al v\ oi kei s fi oin ovoinen 1 he oppoitunitv for vuik cnterpiising lminiginnls in Auhtiiihu is ns gient today tis e\ci it was while there is a realisation of tin fait that Austialia s best dofencc will bp found in peopling her waste jpareb and developing her boundless resources It is not howevet too much to say that considerable harm may have benn done by thoughtless Laboui speeches about immigration and unemployment in Australia though fortunately Labour utter mees on these questions count foi less and less in Australian politics and this should io eive new demon stiation at next months I ederal elections Queensland alone could provide for all the Danish immi grants and give them a better posi tion with grander prospects than they could evei hope to attain in their own country or expect to win in anv other part of the world It is bad enough to have a small munoriiy w aging a campaign of men duertj within Queensland^ without having such mendacitv ofhciullv ac tepted In Eui opean Ministen, as though 4t weie tho truth of the gospel The Premier of \T«w South \\\ ales has taken the proper step in giving the lie to the slanderers of \ustralia but as we have said combined action will prove to be more effective in giving a simple plain statement oí facts relating to the whole of Australia MENDING THE L0RD8. The ¡British Premier, who hub hitherto been as putty in the hands of parties with votes to giv e to a yielding Government, has made a vu tue of necessity by declaring that the Budget must be pressed forward with promptitude and despatch in ordei to set right the unexampled financial confusion produced by the Louis The accusation does not coincide with tho facts and confu- sion could easily have been avoided but foi the (leslie to pick a quarrel with the House ot Lords and confuse the election issues 'lhere was no objc-tion to the Budget m itself, but the second Chambci veiy properly refused to pass the tacked on revolu- tionär pioposals until they have been sanctioned by the count! \ The Budget mav again be preshed foi ward though there is, reason to doubt whether it will be the same Budget, and in that respect the bicameral svstem repiesented bv the House of Lords mav ngain be justi- fied The decision, however, has goni» forth that the House of Lords shall bo amended, and that Chamber has accepted the decision, though there is the widest difference of opin- ion as to method Lord Lansdowne appears to have accepted the leading principles of the scheme adopted by the Hoseberv committee of 1908, which proposed to abolish the i ight ol peers to sit in Pal lianient because they are peers, though not entnely dispensing with the heiedilary prill ciple It was suggested that the whole bodv of peers should consti- tute a kind of eleetoial college to elect from theil number-now roughly 005-200 Lords of Parliament The spiritual Lords of Parliament would be limited to two archbishops and eight bishops , there might ulso be i epi esentatlv eb of the leading Non confotmist churches , and the high ofhcials repiesenting the oversoa Dominions could be included Others entitled to leceive a writ of sum- mons would be Cabinet Mimsteis or ex-Cabmet Mimsteis, Vicerovs or ex-Viceroys, Governors-General or ex-Go\ernors-Gencral, those who had served the Empnc for a penod of years, attained a ceitain lank m the Navy or Anny, anv who had earned high judicial office, oi îendered cei- tain service in the House of Com- mons Life peers might be created and summoned at the rate of lour peers per annum, their numbei never to exceed fortv while the total mem- bership of the House would bo about four hundred The usefulness of a bi7arre Chambei so constituted is doubtful, though it looks ceitain that thete must be a tiansition between the present TTousoi of Lords and the lealisation of the bald proposal that (,reat Bl itain and ,Ireland should be divided into 75 enoimous constitu- encies, each i etui nmg two members to the second Chamber The plaint of Mi Asquith is that the debate last w eck proved the House of Lords to be desirous of disguising itself with a coat of democratic white- wash Tho "Times" is nearer the mark in the accusation that Mr Asquith and his friends mean to pie serve a second Chambei merely us a shaniv and screen
