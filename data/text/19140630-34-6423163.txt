The evil spirits exist still. We call them Disease Germs," and they also must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with its aches and pains, is the result. is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs. Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines, rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates the whole digestive tract. It may be safely taken at any time by young or old. It is very effective in the early stage of Diarrhoea by removing the irritating" cause. Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a bottle in the house. Prepared only by J. O. "_NO, t. J., "Fruit Salt Works, London, England. SOLD BY CHEMISTS AND STORES EVERYWHERE.
