Y.W.C.A. IN INDIA. American Betrenchment. One of the far-reaching effects of the financial depression in the United States, has been retrenchment m the work of the loung Womens Christi in association m foreign lands. Miss Margaret Allan, who for the last six years has been in charge of the travellers' aid section of the YWC A in Colombo and is returning to Svdney bv the Mooltan explained yesterday that the American association has for a great many years been accustomed to allot so much money for what is known as foreign work. Now under existing financial conditions the association finds that its own work at home is seriously handicapped and foreign grants have had to be cut very severely, and in some cases stopped altogether. This will mean probably that the work of the YWCA in what might be described is the foreign field will be cut down bv more than half. From India and Ceylon for example practically all American money and American secretaries have been withdrawn. Miss Allan's own work was the first to come under the axe in Colombo.
