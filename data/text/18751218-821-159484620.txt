An Admiralty minute on the court-martial on the loss of the Vanguard excites great dissatis faction. Their Lordships decide that no further investigation is necessarythat the high rate of speed during the fog did not contribute to the disaster, which was occasioned by the reduction of the Vanguard's speed and the improper shearing out of line of the Iron Duke, under the orders of her sailing officer, Lieut. Evans, who is dismissed his ship. No blame is attached to Captain Hickley, of the Iron Duke, and Vice Admiral Tarleton is censured only by implica tion.
