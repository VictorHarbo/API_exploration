SOUTH AFRICA AT THE MACCABIAH To the Editor of The Jerusalem Post Sir, - I was shocked to read in your newspaper how South African sportsmen were participating in the 12th Maccabiah, disguised as new immigrants. From friends on the Danish team, I understand that the decision to arrange South African participation in this way was taken a year ago at a meeting of Maccabi leaders. Did these leaders forget their obligations to international sports’ unanimous decision not to participate in events with sportsmen from apartheid South Africa? Did they forget their obligations to the International Olympics Committee? By this thoughtless arrangement, those responsible for the Maccabiah are endangering Israel’s position in the world of international sports. HANNA FOIGHEL RamotTzahala. Sir, - It is despicable for Jews (The Jerusalem Post, July 17) to publish an article which may well have the effect of jeopardizing fu ture get-togethers of Jewish sports men from all over the world simply because some South African-born sportsmen are participating in the present Maccabiah. It is a great shame that politics prevented a South African Maccabi team from taking part in the Games. South-African born sportsmen have made a phenomenal contribution to wards sports here in Israel. The contributions that have been made by them in tennis, bowls, judo, ka rate, rugby and squash, to mention just a few of the sports, are unequal led by any other country. JOHNS. COHEN Ra’anana. For the record, the story was broken all over the world by The Associated Press. - Sports Editor, J. P.
