The Adieu is a very fine brig, which was under Swedish colours when last at Port Adelaide but during her absence has chanced her flagto a British ens'gn in consequence of becoming by purchase the property of Captain Anderson. She has been kept in first rate order, and therefore is a valuable acquisition to the colonial fleet of merchant vessels. The Triumph, from Warrnambool, potato laden, has made a long passage in consequence of a con tinuation of westerly weather. She came to anchor about midnight, but was not boarded by a pilot till past 9 the following morning, in consequence of her passing the pilot cutter cruising in the Gulf unobserved.
