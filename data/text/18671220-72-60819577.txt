THE ILLUMINATIONS. Out from the glare of a million lights, with eyes, dazzled by the brilliancy of colors as diverse as those of the rainbow, with ears deafened with the tnurmmvof many voices, feet a weary, and body generally dilapidated we come to describe a scene which certainly has no parallel in the history of Australasia, which probably has no more than a parallel in the history of the world. We may be drunk with loyalty, but our drunkenness takes to it self a very pleasant form sometimes. It could clothe itself in no brighter colors than it did on Tuesday night. ? If it triod over so hard it could not show itself more vividly, or speak so strongly to the senses. It was written on every wall, pictured from every window, reflected in the smiling jocund faces of many thousands. To those who are familiar with Melbourne in its work- a-day attire, the sight was a marvellous one ; to those who know not Melbourne at all, and are not acquainted with the deep devotion and loyalty of her citizens, it must have, indeed, been more than marvellous— it must have been miraculous. It was a fairy city, astir with active, prosperous life, radiant in smiles, and wreathed in beauty too intoxicating to last. Night was not, as far as the city was concerned, for everywhere was radiant with light, beneath which trooped countless thou sands of men and women. Where the people came from must for ever remain a mystery. Was there any house in the suburbs with a human soul in it, or did the dogs alone sit in watch and ward over the goods and chattels of the burgesses? Collingwood emptied itself into Bourke-street in all sorts of ways; from the more aristocratic suburb of St. Kilda came elegant and airy vehicles, which however, had to suffer the indignity of following in the wake of lumbering waggons and mud bespattered drays, which had not been cleaned apparently, for numberless months. Yet in all this vast crowd there was no disorder, and nothing but the best of humor prevailed. All looked happy as they felt; all were well clad, all seemed to revel in health, and if not in wealth, at least in content. Such a picture of a thriving, well to-do people must have been a novelty to the Duke of Edinburgh. Driving through the streets he could not have failed to observe the youth and vigor of the people he has come to visit. Here no decrepitude, no pauperism, no cause to turn away with a sickening shudder from the feast offered to the eye, because there was, nothing to offend the eye in the slightest degree. Indeed; the mass of.-^he^pebple, i happy; ? joyous and ;,cpn tontedu'was ay'sight JLn ?itself;-'1 To be/pleased y^UYiad'-nia'-pccasion to sb:muobyas--lo6k at the gorgeousness of the pictures on the walls ; there was;enough ifor;yqu;to..find sati^fgc.tlonln the facB^^JhVpo^ttla&e.; ? tfherp'' was' to be seen reflected all the better., attributes of pur nature under; the influence of :a great and atiperyad ing exoiteme'nt. Of course, it is impossible by description ; to convey , any. idea of the scene. as it presented itself to the eye. of-' . the;, multitude. . The' only man who could'' photograph it properly with . his pen is George Augustus Sala, and it requires all his descriptive powers to convey anything like, an idea of what was seen and what was done. As to what was seen, coming to dry fact, it'iis hard to say how to commence. There were so many dazzling sights, that not one of them fastened itself on the mind for any length of '.time. Were you enchanted with the Troa suryibewildered. by the blaze of light at the Town Hall, gratified, by the tasteful blending of colors at Denis Brothers, startled by the gorgeous appearance of the Oriental Bank, 'you always in your travels found ; something else to take ' your fanoy^and '.efface the impressions of the last -picture you had gazed on. Perhaps it was ; a little ? bijoyj of a transparency, passed . bocanse::,of;its insignificance by the' crowd ;? pej-h^si^ a combination of effects theatrical in; i their, nature, 'and highly effective. And writing of theatres reminds one that theatrical managers 'have-, every reason lo complain of: the dullness of their trade. Lately, the streets' have been converted, into theatres, and in them /eights have been seen more real and moire vivid than those presented on any stage. Again to ooihe to mere matter of fact, it may be; said that the streets of Melbourne were densely^ thronged from eight o'olock till midnight on Tuesday.' 'From every house shone -fbi'th some words of welcome, and from' the tops of many there were burst great pots of ^blazing fire,, which illumined the night even more brightly than the gas. The weather was most propitious. A gontle breeze only stirred the gas jets of the illuminations, but did not in any way rob any of them of their duo effect. Through tho centre of the streets in solemn rniivch wont a string of oavriagoB of 'ovary floBoyipllou, from tho elegant barouobo f,o tlio litliogomQ buggy, tba lumborlng Any ami to tlio hmity 1r-Io» lony, These last wore in themselves features of the sight. They were for the most part crowded with the wives ef men who arb-.the bone and sinew of our colony, and a 'very comely, pleasant sort .ofc people' ii'ey/;s'6e'med* to; be. -. Side by side jmarohed^derisely.' packed: .together, those who preferredifreedcm.of climii : to comfort of body. .Thbir -name wosrlegioni and amongst them there' was inoi comfort for those who were -? troubled tjy:- their- poor feet. : They were reckless ? in .their loyalty,:- these.: people, and whatever .'their; respect for: the , Crown, they had none -for -the corns ' of; their neighbors. As to centre's.iof attraction, they were to be found evjerywhere.'.- 3 Thojglory, .was, not confined to our four principal streets,; but scat-; tered about everywhere. ;.-: So splendid was it,; that by its' splendbrdt'o satiated 'the eyeslongl before you'hdd arrived- atvthe end of . it.; There was a plethora of gasj Jand infinity of paint-, ings. There was beside, here and there, an electric light shown and this lit up the sur roundings with astonishing effect. Bourke street and Collins-street, seen from their best poirits of observation arid regard, seemed as if they were endowed, with a strange life. The 'heads of i -the people,' with the re flection of the gas upon .them never showed to better advantage.- : In Little Bourke-street there was an : independent display..

COLCINS-S^IIEET. The Treasury b;eirig one.' of. the few principal Government buildings that are completed, there was a fair opportunity for the exercise of good taste in planning -:its^ illuminations, and they were certainly very successful. As none of its architectural:', features i are very promi nent, no great difficulty could have been expe rienced in : throwing dyer , all of them an equal flood of light, in i; which:. even the minutest points of beauty and adornment were seen yvith noonday distinctness., .And as .the building, though large and imposing. in its general ap pearance, is quiet in its. stylo of architecture, it. is most to bo,, admired for. the ^highly ornamental character of,;. its:- various details; and hence- the- chiefs t,objept , to be attained was .to avoid throwing- iany, part of it into shade, and to effect a: f clearly defined display of the finely wrought., work of its small but beautifully proportioned projections. By the illuminations as /.ttiey^.^vere carried out these ends were accomplished, very siiccoss fully ; by a judicious distribution of lights over all parts of it, the large ^ and massive figure of the building was brought put j^vith great effect, before a highly favorable dark ; back-ground afforded by the public gardens at. the rear, arid not ?: the smallest ornamental , feature - of the front .or side elevations was obsoiired. , The illuminated designs were in t the central and more highly ornamental part of the vfront eleva tion. Here, in the upper story, are five'arclied recesses,- with a projecting window oil the right and- left. In the centre recess there was a transparency of the .Q'aeen in ., her royal robes ;it was .27 x 13, and was painted by-M. Chevalier ; the figure was really colossal, but at the distanco from which it waq viewed it did not, appear, unnaturally large. 'The. state robes of., hey Majesty are peculiarly well adapted for effective, display, in an illuminated design, and their bright .-and rioh cblorsi and also the heavy, fall of the drapery, were reinarkably good features in the painting. Around eaoh of the nearer recesses,, on the one hand and on the other, there was an illnininated border described by those responsible for the' idea, as beincf of ^Greek design, but which may be. plainly repre sented as being formed,. of squares alternately plaoed/ right and left within two .parallel. lines of perforated gas-piping. In the centre of eaoh of these recesses was a brown in the same style of .illumination as' the border. In each outer recess to the ..right and left there was a more simple but yet, a very handsome border formed by equi-distarit diagonal bars of light between illuminated parallel lines, and in the centre of each of these spaces there was are presentation of a star, the dosigris thus cor responding in the two more distant as in the two nearer recesses., As the illuminated designs were kept well babk in the recesses at eaoh side of tlio transparency in the centre and showed in front of the windows, of which tliey are the openings, the effect was as if they were the ends of long vaulted arcades, rioh through out then- length with the same handsome columns and other architectural adornments that are bathed in light at the seeming entrances. Next, in. the doorway or window to the right, and also on the one to the left, d lighter device follows the lino of arohiteoturo, arid within it: there is a representation of the rising ,,sun; .The several windews on tho ground: .flbbr| beneath the .central part of the bnildirig we have desoribed, were ornamented with festobris arid stars formed of variegated lamp's ? and in each of the other windows, above and below, and to the right and to the loft of the front elevation, and likewise in those on the returns, there wore pyramids of wax lights, the objoot being to avoid as. far as possible the risk of an insufficient supply of gas. Extending far down Collins-street, and to tho right and left in Spring-street, there* was an immense and closoly-paokod crowd, upon whoso npturnad and gazing countenances a bright light was shod from tho illuminations on tho noblq ntruoturo bofore thorn, It mlghl ho said, without exaggeration, that a pin dropped among this vast) multitude of pooplo ooula nod have fallen to the ground, so closely did they stand together. Extending over a wide space in front of the Melbourne Club an ordinary design was ~ worked'! put ?dn- gas-piping,-1, but yjwjth- sb-r- muph I iiechanical ability,-. by Mr Dempster-i-,ilie ^ coil-; : tractor, that.it looked' uriooriiinorilyj-weli.

The Telegraph Office was illuminated with the voltaic electric light which we may ex- plain for the benefit of some of our readers, is generated by the combustion of carbon between two points through which the electric current flows. The flow is regulated by electromag netism, and chiefly upon skilful and watchful management in this matter depends the steadi ness and brilliancy of the light obtained.The light was exhibited from the top of the building, and upon a revolving stand by means of which the rays were directed at pleasure to any particular point of the horizon. The whole of the appa ratus for this and the other electric lights dis played in the city, by the Reception Commis sion, were manufactured in the colony. The electro- plating and burnishing of the reflectors was done by Mr. Watts, of Stephen- street, and Messrs Dykes and.Ed wards, executed the copper work. Mr: S. Kilton, the instrument fitter to the Astronomical Observatory, prepared all the brass work, and effected some improvement in the practical details connected with the apparatus: At.the Sydney Hotel therewas a transparency o f ?, the Galatea in .full, sail, .under, tho British arms, at one. side and the Australian, arms at the. other ; above, Ihe inscription!

If the people of Melbourne cannot point to anything in tho shape of old association in connection with their olty, they have at all events shown that they are able to cope with cities tho nainos of which are old in history, in giving a prinooly wolooino to thoiv Sovereign's eon, ??

But neither king nor kaiser could giye such a triumphal reception to those whom, they delight to honor as the welcome which flows spontaneously from the uncontrolled enthusiasm of a free people; The grandeur of . the public reception on Monday, great as it undoubtedly was, would, have been without a fitting sequel if the illuminations of Tuesday , evening had been dispensed with.

These novel results in an illuminated device were prodnced by' the skilful application- of a large olock movement. . ' , IiATROBErSTBEET. !' * ' ' \ ' ?'-. The illuminations in Latrobe -street were but 'few, and,, with the exception '?' of the public offices, were for the mo|st part of a very small character. The' building belonging to the Eoyal Society was the first to iittract^the atten tion from the eastern quarter oj^'the city, each of its' windows being, covered by trans parencies of; varied celor and design, the effect of which .'.was.- on the whole good, though, perhaps, a little more light might, have been an. .improvement. Eqtially worthy of notice^was the building occupied as police, bai racks, every windowr.f. which. wus' fully lightpd up. .;'/. The stained -glnas coat of nrms on the front of the; Supreme Court looked very pretty. the' colors; of. the glass being nicely bleuded. and ? 'the whole effect was improved with the glare of light reflected upon it from a dozen flaring 'grease pots' blazing on each side. At the Exhibition Building there was not any il luminatipn, and from this peint to the Crown Lands Office there was nothing calling foi special notice ; the latter was . illuminated with candles, 27 in each window, which caused a bright reflection on the white walls of the Old Exhibition Building, between whioh corner and Spencer- street, the Immigrants' Depot was the only other building at all brilliantly il luminated. Of course, in addition to ' those mentioned above,, there were many smaller at tempts, at illuminating, the success of whioh. was varied, though most of the places being private houses, the superior attractions in the heart of the city induced the residents to wend their way thither, and so negleot their own neighborhood. Altogether Latrobe-street was deoidedly dull and deserted. ? V BPMNG-STBBET. At the Model Schools was exhibited an illumi nation in gas. The device was a Prince ef Wales feather, having on the one side the letter A, and on the other. E. ' The present unfinished condition of the Parliament Houses necessitated the adoption of some extraordinary appliance to hide the nn sightliness. So far as this could be done it was effectually accomplished. Facing Bourke street was a complete metamorphosis, so. skil fully, exeouted as to present the appearance of a vast palatial pile, where nothing but unbaked bricks had been before exhibited. The front of the building had been covered by a design of what it is ultimately intended shall be its form. This was skilfully illuminated. The apparent windows were filled with portraits, and the4 exterior had a skilfully exeouted design in gas. . Mr Pitt, the contractor, deserves credit for the good effect so . skilfully produced from, bad material.' ' , .'.'. ..'.' ?; / \ TOT PJWaSXAPF OAEDBNS. V The Flagstaff Gardens were illuminated at dusk, according to announcement, and though all the lamps vteto not pat up at that time, the effect was really good. ^'om every tree, and every thick bosh, peeping out of the dark green foliage appeared parti-colored lamps. The walk to which the greatest attention was paid [was] that between William and Dudley streets. 'Leading across the gardens zigzag festoons of lamps were hung across the path aa far as the rising ground 'where they ended in a thick festoon erected on the highest spot. The beautiful naarblo f onntain opposite Dudley street was lit up with glaas globes and vases, and the effect of the soft light falling on the marble was beautiful. The principal fountain on the hill was only lighted up with, white paper, lamps, but a sham fountain in the enclosed plot below it looked verywell. JJttBJps of diver sified bolors were distributed all over the grounds in', abundance. Befbre the illuxninatians in. the city began to distract public attention fro«a the quiet and rpta.an.tio scene, the attendance was . good, but . soon dwindled away,- and ?while the fierce excitement of illumination sooing lasted, the Flagstaff Gardens were com paratively deserted. ? Th° scene from the Flag staff-hill was inexpressively grand. North, south; and east appeared one blaze of light, paling the stars, that looked dim and siokly m the strong light ' of gOs and mftst^sium. . ' To the west stretobed.Batman's Swanip, dark and gloomy, the light of the illuminations being but slightly reflected in the mnddy waters oo vering it. 'A revolving 1{ght was ' exhibited from the top of the old observatory on the Flagstaff-hill, but it 'had to pale into ineffectual fires before the brilliant hght exhibited '» Lonsdale- street, towards, which the peoplq from the suburbs flooked in great nuinberS-..'. :
