' Headed by MISS ANN IS MONTAGUE, the Unrivalled Prima Donna, and \- MB. CHABLES TDBNBB, the Great English Tenor, .... supported by a Company of the finest Artists in English Opera that have ever visited Adelaide. TO THE MUSIC-LOVING PUBLIC OF ADELAIDE. ^ . The Management regret their being unable to ob tain the Theatre Boyal, which they have tried for the past two years, but as arrangements have been made for the appearances of Miss Montague and Mr. Turner in England, and their time being so limited, they have been prevailed upon to give a Season in the above Hall, as the heat suited place after the Theatre, where every possible attention will be given to the convenience-nnd comfort of the Public. Miss Montague desires it to be strictly understood that all that is advertised will be carried our, and that she will be supported by Artists that possess voices that she is confident have never been excelled . in Adelaide in English Opera. Knowing the Ade laide Public are fond of good music and singing, and also are good jndges, she will be proud to meet them. _ OPENING OPEBA, MONDAY, OCTOBEB 16, Balfe's Pretty, Romantic, and Ever-Favorite Opera, in 3 Acts, THE BOHEMIAN GIRL, THE BOHEMIAN GIBL, THE BOHEMIAN GIBL, As played by this Company for 21 Consecutive Nights in Melbourne. 21 Consecutive Nights in Melbourne. Speaking of one song alone, "Marble Halls, by Miss Annis Montague, the Sydney Mommy Herald, September ID, says—It Is customary with many musical connoisseurs to ridicule Balfe and despise English Opera. We have, however, amongst us a lady whose performance in many Operas have attested her ability, and who in a Ballad from the ■•Bohemian Girl" carries her hearers far and away beyond the routine of this every day life. True, in comes fresh from the land of melody, and puts us mentally bo completely in the realm of fancy that we come back with a shock as the applause demands a repetition. Utterly free from ornament. Miss Montague* wisely sings the ait _as it. herself still under the influence of the charming vision. The poetry of life is pictured in the words, the poetry of sound is reached in their utterances, the , voice is managed with consummate skill, and yet with such an absence of effort that the melodious tones come forth like tha clear rippling waters from a crystal fountain, brightening and gladdening all around. Musically it is a triumph, hut it is much more in an ideal sense, and if Miss Montague were judged by this ballad alone she proves herself an exceptional artist, and she makes all who hear her debtors for a season of leal delight."
