MINING INTELLIGENCE. ■ADELAIDE SHARE MARKET. -General Agency Office, King William-street, Tuesday .Evening,.August"29, 1818. The share -market has <beeo affected, hut not so sensibly as was apprehended on Monday morning4>y theintelligence/ per Constance, ot the depressed state oftbe British ore and wool markets Surra Siirrs'ciures opened this week sunder a cloud, and were done in conseqnence at £5 reduction yesterday ; to-day, they bare changed hands at £21?, but' this evening there ate-inquiries for them at £220. In noticing last week the dividend-upon "this'stock, (which becomes: payable on Friday,) we stumbled upon an error, which not being detected till a considerable number of copies were printed, it may be proper to correct.—The dividend being a quarterly one of exactly £13 per share the total sum divided on the.oacasionds at once found by adding a nought to the figures in tbe'"shares" column; many o( our readers familiar with the subject, would at once perceive that we had inadvertently taken tbe figures ■of our "paid up" column, thereby making '-a mere cypher " into a much more important personage than we ■■ bad any idea of doing. As the exhibition of so noble eqnsr- - terly dividend as <£24,040 upon a paid up capital of only £12,320 is almost without precedent in mining, we quoted it prominently for the notice more especially of our English readers.-on which account the prt sent correction is rendered necessary. Adelaides are a shade better in price,say £2 J2< 6d, and continue in favour. Port Lincolns are beginning to labour under the disad vantages of £! per share call payable this day mouth. Toe Company we notice offers constant employment in to-day's advertising column for a team and dray at tbe mine. The share market to-day has been less active than we have observed it since we have been invited to comment and report upon it. "Friday Evening, Sept. 1,1848. The enquiry is still continued, at intervals, for Ade laides, but without materially altering the price. Surra Surras continue in request; and iiave been done at £211 exclusive of the ^dividend (£10, payable to-day), hiot withstanding the increased scarcity of money, and considerable dulness in many important branches of trade and commerce, the stock maintains its elevated position, and it will not surprise ns if we have to quote it at £220, or more, before the end of the present month. \- Belvideres liave changed hands to some extent at £3 5s. Port Lincoln* have been rather quiet this week, par ties wishing to purchase, holding back in expectation of: the call of £1, due on the 29th instant, sending them j down a little; holders of this stock seem, however, to I have quite as good an opinion of their worth as those i who want to buy them cheap—and as there appeals i little disposition on the part of holders to give way, j business in it is somewhat- suspended,-l>oth parties wait- i ing the effects of Michaelmas day. \- WakefieUs.—Of this stock a quantity, reported to he ; the property of a gentleman leaving the colony* has 1 been adventured for sale at I2s 6d, and a good many Lave been bought at from 10s to l*2sCd. The mode of payment probably causing the difference in price. In the absence of business in shares, which is seldom,'a feature of dividend day, we avail ourselves of the present space to mention the circumstance of the formation, at Hamburgh, of an enterprising smelting company, h .v ing an establishment, on the banks of the Elbe, and em ploying a capital of upwards of £100,000, and posses sing six frigate-built vessels employed in the importa tion of foreign ores. Of these, two were recently des tined for this colony, one of which, the Alfred, is duly announced as "expected ;" but which we suspect, with her partner, may have been detained by the Danish blockade of the Elbe The importance of this feature, as respects the mining interests of this colony, will be readily appreciated by our readers, most of whom will join ns in considering as a consummation devoutly to be wished, the suspension-or abrogation of the naviga tion laws which at present so seriously fetter the com merce of Britain and her colonies. At the present time, vessels pasinginto the Pacific for ore, the produce of! Chili and the Western parts of South Ameriea, have to double the Horn in quest of cargo " to fill up," along ; the coast of Brazil With our commerce unshackled,•< and as free to the world as its -wide spread waters them selves, it cannot be doubted that numbers of vessels trading to other regions would find their way hither, swelling the tide of our immigration, supporting the market for our ores, and in a diversity of ways, easily to be conceived by our readers, giving a renewed impetus to the prosperity of our adopted country.
