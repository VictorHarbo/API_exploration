THEATRE ROYAL. Of the 'Seven Deadly Sins,' perhaps 'Pride,' the one now being screened at Spencer's, is the best to date. Hol brook Blinn is in the lead, and is sup ported by Shirley Mason and ' George Le Guerre. The story is full of thrills and sensational situations, and is beautifully mounted. In addition there is Betty Nansen, the famous Danish tragedienne, in- the pictured version of 'La Tosca,' and Charlie Chaplin as 'The Immigrant,' quite the funniest of this artist's creations. The scenes on board an Atlantic liner are full of comedy of the liveliest order. The full programme is screened at the matinees.
