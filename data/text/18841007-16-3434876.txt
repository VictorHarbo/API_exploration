BRITISH AND FOREIGN BIBLE SOCIETY. THE annual meeting of the Queensland auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society was held in the Wesleyan schoolroom, Adelaide street, last night under the presidency of his worship the Mayor The attendance, owing probably to the threatening state of the weather, was small After devotions, the Rev E GltlFuru read the twenty-eighth annual report, of which the following is an abstract - In no previous year has this auxiliary been able to send so large an amount as free contribution to the parent society From Brisbane we have sent £120 This is 120 more than last year, and from branches we have forwarded -as will be seen in treasurer's statement-the sum of £115 ICs id , which is £6 Ils Od more than last year. It is hoped that the sum from Brisbane will annually increase; but as some branches intend to sever their connexion with us, and to communicate direct with the home society, we hardly venture to hope for any increase in the amount of free contribu tions from branches Three Sunday schools have responded to the committees re quest, and made a collection amongst the scholars for the funds of the society There have been sold and issued from our depot during the past year 1965 Bibles 841 Testa ments, 41 Testament and Psalms, making a total of 2810 copies as against 2b-)0 The depository is still held at the Wesleyan Book Depot, and is now well supplied with copies of sacred Scripture in English, Welsh, Dutch, Danish, Swedish German, French, Italian, and Hebrew Since our last report the Governor, Sir A Musgrave, has accepted the position of patron of the auxiliary, which was vacated by the removal of Sir A Kennedy The following extract from the eightieth report of the parent society was appended The in come of the society's eightieth year has been the largest it has ever received the total receipts having reached the sum of £231 'OISs 7d and having exceeded those of the previous year. by £22,708 15s 6d An advance of about 1,2000 in annual subscriptions collections and free contributions is more than counterbalanced by a decrease of about £5000. in donations The substantial increase of income is therefore due to about £5000 more received from the sale of Scriptures, and about £14 000 more received in legacies The last named source of income is necessarily of such a fluctuating character, that an unusually large sum accruing from it in one year may be followed by unusually small receipts from it soon after Legacies have yielded £5S,18110a 5d , or 2lb 000 above their average in the year just closed and half the whole sum came to hand in its last three mouths Under the unusual circumstances described, your committee deem it only right as a precaution against any correspond- ing fall below the average in legacies during another year to hold for a time in reserve a portion of the exceptionally large receipts from that source announced on the present occasion The free income of the society from all sources has been tl2G 182 18s 7d Adding to this £107 02ll2a 3d received from the sale of Scriptures, and £104 17s 9d from the Roxburgh fund for Indian colportage, the total income of £233 309 3s 7d already mentioned is obtained, as against the £210 000 1 Is Id announced at the last anniversary Meaning by copies not Bibles alone but any integral part or portion of Holy Writ, the issues from the Bible House in London to meet home and foreign demands have been 1,317,024 copies Those from depots abroad have been 1 601.2 copies, making a total of 398 364 copies, or lo3,l>GS more than in the previous year The ladies of the society for the eighty years since its commencement now reach a total of 100 035 933 copies The total for the year of above 3,000,000 copies has only twice been surpassed before, and that was when the Franco German war, in the one case, and when the Russo Turkish war in the other, caused an exceptionally large distribution among combatants in the hold No extraordinary call on anything like the same scale has occurred during the past year. It has been one of quiet but growing work Mr Dvvmsov treasurer, presented the financial statement, which showed that the income of the society amounted to upwards of 1826 and after the working expenses of the year had been defrayed and the contributions forwarded to the parent society, there was a balance of £20 2s 3d in favour of the Queensland branch The Rev K GltiFHTHread the report of the , ladies' auxiliary, from which it appeared that the work of the bible women during the last twelve months had been most thoroughly and faithfully performed Mrs Cherry continued to labour in her old district in her most steady and vigilant manner The whole of tho Red Hill and Kelvin Grove neighbourhoods, with Paddington and the streets off Petrie Terrace, were included in her district and offered a wide held for her zeal and activity lins mission was upheld by no particular party or denomination of the Christian church, but was in the highest sense of the word catholic and un sect organ The w women had been appointed from vniioussections of the Church, the same was the case with the committee, who, with many different shades of opinion among them, united cordially in forwarding by this means the knowledge and spread of Gods word They then appealed with confidence for assistance from all fellow christians in the city in the North Brisbane district, including Spring Hill and I Fortitude V Liley, New Farm, ac, Miss Chapman, who was appointed last year, continued her work with unabated diligence and increasing usefulness She visited each part in rotation, and was at the call of sick and distressed persons in emergency The committee had particular pleasure in announcing the appointment of a third bible woman It had long been their expressed wish to have an agent in South Brisbane, where no bible woman had resided since the death of Mrs Ada seven years since A few months ago they met with a person who had been for years a bible woman in England, who had gained long and varied experience, and who was anxious to resume the work in her new home She was now in full work in the scattered and outlying parts of South Brisbane about the Logan and Ipswich Roads, and the Thomp- son estates The name of this bible woman was Mrs Mell 4th, who was already favour ably known in her neighbourhood The state of the mission funds had not increased as they might have been expected to do. The subscriptions for the last year or two had not come up to 290 per annum whilst this expenditure had been £108, and now it would be £160 The committee believed that in view, of the rapidly increasing resources and population of Brisbane the needful amount would be gladly contributed by those who approved of the work for which it was asked The list of officers for the year in connection with the British and Foreign Bible Society, was read as follows -Patron Sir Anthony Musgrave, KCMG, president, Right Rev Dr Hale, Bishop of Brisbane, vice pi residents, Rev Chas Ogg and Mr J S Turner, treasurer Mr Robert Davidson, secretaries, Rev E Griffith, and Rev J Stewart, committee, Messrs J G Cribb Jas M'Leod, G Grimes, J Grimes, J R Palmer, N Lade, J H McIntyre, G Lang P Savage W. M Smith, J Warner, and J J Kingsbury The Rev W Poole proposed that the report be adopted, printed, and circulated, with a list of subscribers and the names of the officers and committee for the ensuing car Perhaps, like himself, those assembled there were struck with the great difference between the work done by the Queensland Auxiliary and that done by the British and Foreign Bible Society as a whole But although the work of the Queensland branch seemed small, they must not despair There was one thing hopeful about the report, it was a progress report Progress had been made in the recipes, in the amount forwarded to the parent society, and progress had been made in the work done But on the other hand, Queensland was full of rapidly growing towns wealth had been multiplied, and business places had been extended and, considering the circumstances, the extension of the work of the society might have been greater The success of the past ought to stimulate them for the future and he hoped the year upon which they had entered would be one of greater growth than the past had been The Rev C HOUXBROOK, in seconding the motion, expressed his sympathy with the gin nous object of the society Some people, he said, withheld their subscriptions from the society because they did not see its advantages, but he thought it was doing an incalculable amount of good in their midst The efforts of the British and Foreign Bible Society had been blessed abundantly in the past and it only remained for them to give it thou labour, then time, their money, and their prayers, and they would find that it would be blessed still Those on the platform felt that, although they representcd various denominations, they stood on one common basis there that night for the good of their fellow men, and he for one said " God speed the work ' The proposition was carried. On the motion of the Rev. J STITVY van, secondcdbyMr R D».\inso>, it was resolved "That this meeting expresses its satisfaction at the great work accomplished by the British and Foreign Bible Society and pledges itself to help on the work and to disseminate the word of God among the nations of the earth On the motion of the Rev E Gill PITH, a hearty vote of thanks was accorded to the mayor for presiding, and the proceedings were shortly as derives ds brought to a close Till gentlemen who were so smart in apply motor the land at Urangan recently, in view of the increased value which the projected railway will give to it, are likely (says the W B News) to have their hopes dashed, as we learn that the Minister for Lands has declined to grant the applications, and has moreover stated that the land in the Vicinity of the line will be cut up for the benefit of small selectors, and for township purposes A HVTltER singular discovery was made a day or two ago (says the Bulletin of the 2nd instant by an old man who was fossicking about amongst the rubbish that is being deposited in the gully near the Belle Vue Hotel, Quay-street VVIulo engaged in his search for unconsidered trifles he happened to drop across an old bag, which, by its appearance, hadevi dontly belonged to a bushman On opening it there was found a miscellaneous assortment of articles, and amongst them was a deposit receipt, which, with interest due was worth about 2000 The finder mentioned the matter to the police and it was afterwards referred to Mr Stanley G Hill, the agent for the Curator of Intestate Estates, who will make all necessary inquiries The money is still lying in the bank bearing interest, and we understand that the owner died about twelve months ago in the Rockhampton Hospital It is not known whether he has any relations in the colonies. THE Umbiron correspondent of the Toowoomba Chronicle, writing under date 2nd instant, says -The beginning of this week I went round the farms of this district and in spected them all, with one or two exceptions I am sorry to say that on examining the wheat crops I found them all infected with the rust In some cases no good even for hay in others only specs to be seen, but in my opinion the sooner all the wheat crops in this district are cut for hay the better The farmers are now busy cutting it down for that purpose, and all will do the same Potatoes are rather scarce, but crops of lucerne have this year already been cut and collected into stacks All kinds of stock are looking well, sheep are doing splendidly, and every prospect of the best lambing this season we have he had for years Land is being prepared for maize and potatoes, Se, and generally speaking the farmers are not serum being Many are talking of taking advantage of the new Land Bill »ellenpassed, with the view of going in for grazing areas, as some say there is nothing like wool IT IS our unpleasant duty (says the Rockhampton Bulletin of 3rd instant) to have to record a case of garroting and robbery by violence, which occurred shortly before mid- night on Wednesday It seems that a meeting of one of the masonic lodges was held on Wednesday evening, and it was attended by Mr R Sharples, who is treasurer After the meeting he started homeward, but on the load met Do tective Clark and had a conversation with him Instead of going along Archer street into Bolsover street he called at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and went along East lane On the way thither he met one of the new arrivals and on tered into a con- el sation with him, sitting on the veranda of the office just inside the gate About ten minutes to 12 he left the depot and continued walking along the lane in the direction of Lion Creek, with the intention of going through the vacant allotment facing Bolsover street in a direct line for home Before, however, he was able to do so he was pounced on suddenly by a man who had come up unobserved His assailant placed his left arm against Mr Sharpless throat almost choking him, and his knee against the small of his back and brought him to the ground With one hand he held his victim down, and relieved him of his money and watch and chain with the other The amount taken was about 8lb and it was mostly in cheques, there being only a £1 note and a sovereign As the moon was shining brightly at this time Mr Sharples was able to obtain a good view of his aggressor Seeing that his victim was scanning his features Joseph Morton, who was the principal in the robbery, picked up a stone and struck him on the eye with it by letting it fall on him It was then that Mr Sharples noticed that there were two men can coined but as the second kept in the back ground his features were not so well observed After taking every thing they could Morton's assistant jumped on the prostrate man, and fled, going in the direction of the depot As soon as he had recovered from his astonishment and shock at the sudden ill treatment Mr Shin pics gave in formation to Detective Oink, and between 4 and 5 o'clock in, in company with senior sergeant Graham and constable Walsh and Sweeney, arrested Morton at the depot, and he was brought up at the Police Court yesterday morning and demanded Soon after the at rest Morton was identified by Mr Sharples as the man who had attacked and robbed him Morton and his confederate, whose name is unknown at present, are new arrivals in the colony, and were only landed line from the Mount Lebanon, ss, a short time ago 'they have been in the habit of seeing in the immigration depot at night, and it is thought probable they were among a number of men who were creating a distur- banco in East lane a few minutes before Mr. Sharples passed along None of the money, nor the watch and chain, have yet been recovered.
