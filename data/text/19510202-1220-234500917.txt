A. Gibb). On the introduction of the im migration yscheme in 1948 the Com monwealth Service Office could not get employers interested in giving positions to the newcomers. Neither was the reaction favourable in the , second year, but last year it he- came very favourable. By that time there had been learned how to place the new arrivals in their pro per positions and other matters. Very few of the people come and. go, as the saying is. Generally speaking, they stay here. It may be mentioned that only Displayed Persons are under con tract to the Government. People from the United Kingdom, and the Dutch, Italian,' Greek, Maltese, Spanish, Danish and Swedish settlers are free to select their own employment. Not many Italians come to Kemp sey, they mostly going to Bowra- ville where they were favourably known as prisoners of war. Some are working for the -same employers, who nominated them. The Displaced Persons came from the Baltic States, Poland. Ukraine, I Hungary, Yugoslavia;, Czechosto- | ; vakia, Rommania, White Russia | and other countries. __ | The Kempsey district as, far as | s the Commonwealth Employment 1 : Office is concerned covers the Nam- | bucca, Macieay and Hastings Shires j and the Kempsey and Port Mac- I quarie Municipalities. .
