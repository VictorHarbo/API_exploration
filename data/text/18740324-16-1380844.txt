Townsville [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT. February 25. Quite a stir has been created in out latterly quiet town by the arrival of the Lammershagen, from Hamburg, with over 300 German, Danish, and Polish immigrants. They are generally acknowledged to be as fine a lot of immigrants as has ever been landed here. It is fortunate that they were also a happy, contented lot, otherwise the miserable accommodation which awaited them here would have caused serious trouble. A lot of thin wretched things called, by courtesy, tents (but in reality only partly tents, the rest old flies, with no ropes to them), were supplied to the new comers, and hurriedly erected in a pouring rain. The single men, to the number of over eighty, were put in possession of these man- sions, and told to make themselves at home. Too much credit cannot be given to the Police Magistrate and the Immigration Commission for tho labor they went through in seeing to the wants of some 300 people, who all had to be pro- vided for at a moment s notice. In proof of the energetic action of these gentlemen, the general expression next morning was one of satisfac- tion. In fact the immigrants stated that they had never slept so well since leaving home, their only want had been a little more salt. Salt being invariably the condiment which is fated to be forgotten at picnics, sustained its reputation at this gigantic picnic. A few stret- chers would have been an improvement in the internal economy of the old it printing office, which did duty is a depot for the single girls. It seems hard to compel girls to roll up in a single blanket on the floor, but none complained, and next day all who wished for situations quickly hired at remunerative rates for new arrivals. A few single girls are to be forwarded tomorrow to Mackay and Bowen, together with about forty single men and a number of married couples with large families. There were no cases of sickness on the ship's arrival, and the surgeon- superintendent, Dr. Mohs, may congratulate himself on his success in landding his charge in such good condition. An Italian who became light headed whilst on board, ran off into the neighbouring bush on the arrival of the steamer at the wharf but the police and black trackers were at once set in moiton, and he is probably ere this in custody. As we are to have a regular shipmont of immi- grants for the future, it seems strange that no provision should be made for a depot. We have a fine and expensive bonded store for the convenience of our thirsty population, and surely when we landed a cargo far more remunerative (ultimately) to the revenue than brandy and beer, some more convenient recepta- cle should be provided than a few rotten tents and a wet ground to sleep on. The pots and pans which were served out to these people were of such a description that few were in service- able condition-holes and cracks were the pre- dominant feature in their construction. This could well have been avoided, as the articles could have been purchased here at such a price as would have fallen below the total cost of those sent from Brisbane when breakage and freight are taken into consideration. However, all has gone of merrilv, and every one is satisfied.
