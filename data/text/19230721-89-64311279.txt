SHIPPING NEWS, ?r 'SEMAPHORE TIDES.— SATURDAY? 'July 21— High nrat8rt 6.30 a.m.; low water, 12.30. p.m.-SUNDAY, July 22-High water, 1.50. tun.; \ ,lo«r water, 12.50 p.m. , . ,-. ... amer'ican war risk losses. ?i American companies' hare filed claims ?moontiiw to about £3,000,000 against the ?GdsTian Government for losses paid on war risks owing to the German suDmarine ? . campaign. ? When this matter was first mooted? there was some discussion as to ?whether such claims could be made, but apparently the American Government ? is prepared to accept them and to include them in the national claim Upon Germasy for reparations. Frankly, for an under writer tb ask a third party to refund a \- . loss, caused by tfhe very.- peril tfiat 'he accepted a premium to insure against ap ~ pears to be doubtful ? morality (says* a ?wbter »n Fairplny), even though 'that ?; third, parly be responsible for' the -action 'that eaused the loss. The case is'by-jno means on a par with the recovery -by unda-writers of collision claims from the vessel at fault in a collision, but is more like' making a claim upon Father Neptune for a. refund of a. total', loss caused by ?violence; oC the seag.^Without haying any parh*cnlarrmf6rniaticn.t':.as to 'how the clsini is ijcin$j made-, or :on what. — ounds, it seeps~tliat it -is really .in the: nature of a 'trj;;--ft;'ytuxd that the American under writers Jiatt'. very, little hope of Eeeing ' their Mbuer back from Germany. Pre sumingr, however, that tBey do obtain a ? ? rccovejj ofjome sort, it will be. interest ing to- see in what manner they set about the refunding of the premiums which they nave received for war risks, for obviously they cannot retain these, sfnee the risk -? ?? for which they received them was not run by them at all. ??-?-?' ' DOUBTFUL PROFITEERING. ? ???.'? . The other day British shipowners were j ? ? . «ccused_-o£- profiteering- in connection with the purchase of 'ex-enemy steamers. Some ??'_ . of these ate not by any. means the splen-. ? ' did bargains that some people' seem to -. imagine, ag.is evidenced. in ths case of the ex-German: Uners Agamemnon - and '*$Immt Vernon. TTie former is If ^81 tons grrss and wns bnilt iq 1902. while thej latter is 1S.372 tons gross, and was buiit I in 1908. _ These vessels have been laid up in America ever since tliey were with drawk, frpm.4he ^tr%nsport; service,' and* it . was estimated that, the cost.- of converting them -in oil 'burners and refitting them \- with accommodation for three, classes of passengers would be about £900,000 each, but it has been ascertained since that the cost would^probably exceed . £l,fi00,000, . and it is now decided !Vjt to proceed with the reconditioning/; It is proposed instead to - recommend Congress' to- . expend £2,500,000 each ott two new ships of about '. . 30,000 fons gross each. '-Jais wpuld_make the .-vessels somewhat similar- in size to the Manretania and Lusitahia', '.which cost ; trader £2,000.000 each, but it is hardly ».'? likely, in view of existing costSi that they ?will have anything like the epeed of the British boats. The President Buchanan w being reconditioned and turned into i one cabin steamer at a cost -of £800,000. NOTABLE SHIPPING AUCTION.. ' ? ? , The most important shipping auction held in recent times took* place at tne Baltic Exchange, London, early ui June, ? when Messrs. Kellock & Messrs. Thomas 'Pinkey & Sons offered for sale by aucbron, 'by order of the Government, four /B type standard boats' and two 'C type Standard boats. In one respect the auc tion was a record, and that was nvths 1 ' depreciation shown on the prices; origin- ally paid for the vessels. Of the loui 'B' standard boats; carrying between 8,000 and 8,200 tons deadweight- each, * §ome were built-in Hongkong and some in Shanghai in 1019 and 1920, and were sold br the Government to Mr. N. E. Amba . ? tielos for about £289,166 each— £1,000,000 was' at one time offered foe three of the 1 fcoBta an- behalf of. Swedish, owners— while -the two 'C' type steamer?, bnilt at 1 Shanghai, one in 1920 and the .other in ' 1913, at about £205,000 each, and carrying 1 about 5,100 tons each, were sold, also to . Vt. Ambatielos, for £150.000 each. The . prices realized for the four 'B' boats ? aggregated £158,750, or an average of £4 ' ~W per ton dead weight, and for the two 1 \ 'C' -boats £52,000, or £5 2/ per ton, 'it against* cost ot' £38 per. ton for all the ; boats. The 'B' boats showed' a fall in Take since 1910-1920 of 8627 per cent., ?fidthe'%' boats of 85.55 per cent., and a low to the late owner of £1^05^14, which would be increased to £1^52^80 assuming that the Nicolis, which, was not offered, realized -£^,500. Never before in the history of shipping has such. a loss been,-made^X-'an owner on seven cargo boats. . ?: .- ' . . - ?-. ; - ? -'?'? COALING RECORD. ' It having been stated that the world 8 coaling record was 1,390 tons in. two hours. The Panama Canal Record gives several instances where this rate has been ex ceeded. It points out 'that on November 25, 1920, the steamer Wiltshire took 1,101 tons of ?' coal at Cristobal in one hour 35 minutes, and on December 24, 1920, the steamer Pakeha took 1,002 tons in one hour 10 minutes. Bunker coal is deli vered to ships at the Cristobal plant by four electrically operated rcloaders with a total capacity of 2,000 ton8 per hour, in addition to which there is at the end of tbe pier an elevated storage bin electrically operated with a capacity of 1,500 tons. INTERNATIONAL MARINE COMPANY. _ According to advices from New York, the financial results of the working of the International , Mercantile Marine Com pany of New Jersey for the 12 months ended Degember 31 last had not been very fortunate, apart from the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company's boats. .The profit is- estimated af £943,000, which com pares with about £3.050,000 in 1920, and about £3,600,000 in 1919, and £2,400,000 in 1921. After providing for deprecia; tion, there was. last year a deficit or £254,000.. Naturaliy, no dividend is paid on the preference stock. Mr. P. A. S, Franklin, the President of the company, in the course of an interview, attributtd the decrease in the earnings to the falling 'off' in the number of third class passen gers, owing to the immigration laws and the unsettled conditions of Europe, in addition to which' the freight busmesa was, he stated, exceedingly bad and com petition wore active, including that of Government-owned steamers. He added that the business for the first four months of 1923 showed even less satisfactory re sults.^. When it is borne. ]n mind that £1,104,000 waB received by. the company from the Oceanic Steam Navigation Com pany, one must assume that the rest ot the company's steamers lost, £160,00-' before providing for depreciation, which indicates the unfortunate position of the shipping trade at the present time, even under the management of such experi enced men as those at the head of the International . Company. SHIPBUILDING IN DENMARK. At the beginning' of May there were 25 ships, totalling 45,169. tons, under construc tion in Danish yards. These comprised 16- steamships and nine motor ships, and in 'the latter connection it is significant to observe the prominent position which Denmark' holds among the countries in terested in the building of motor ships. At the end of the January quarter only England, Germany, and Sweden had more tonnage of this character on the Btocks than Denmark had. The Odense Steel Shipyard, Limited, is at present workinc at full capacity, the three stocks being all occupied and; the labour strength fully engaged. At the beginning of April the yard delivered to the Dampskibsselskabet of 1912 the new motor ship Sally MoersK- and in the midde of the month it launched for the same company the motor ship Chastine Moersk. The two stocks thus realized were immediately again brought into requisition for two other constructions for the same company, and in addition to these the yard also has on band several large, orders, including one for a 6,350-tons motor ship for a Norwegian owner, to he provided with Burraeistcr & Wain sis cylinders motors, of 1,100 h.p. The motor ship Sallv Moersk was built to British Lloyd's ciass 100 A I as a closed shelter decker, and has a carrying capacity of 5,200 tons. Its deck machinery is elec tric,' and was supplied by Thoma6 B. Thrigef Odense. while, its engine is a' Bur jheister & Wain eight-cylinder, fout stroke, single-acting Diesel 'motor of the fongRtroke type, developing about 1,600 LHJP., and giving thexship, with full cargo, a speed of 10-11 ipiOfs.
