The | yield of our gold-fields, as exhibited through the escort returns, again com pares Unfavorably with the return of corres ponding periods of preceding years. The falling o£f is tf-'iy marked, the total amount being al most a| low as for the last week in June. The retun^ffor the corresponding weeks in 185S and and iSp9 were also below a good standard, being not mtjre than'44,094 oz. 10 dwt-. and 40,108 oz. rdWiectively ;' but that for the week now ending is only 33,802 oz. 10 dwt. — a result which .Considered in connection with the fall ing o!t ilrnt we have had to notice on several ooxisioas lately, augurs by no means favorably for the^n-esent condition of the gold-fields. The only places fv-om which we observe an' increase arc' Sa'fdliurst, Avoca, Pleasant Creek, and SmvthjAdale j and with the exception, of the Beii.iigd district, which shows unusually higb., the inciiease in all is but very small. Sandhivrst s:-nds 12.7GG ounces, as compared with only B588 last year, thus tending mainly to save the returns, as if by an exceptional ease, from presenting a 11111 uh more meagre appearance tnar, they do. At Avoca the yield is 3383 oz. agaiv.st. 2136 oz. last year ; at Pleasant Creek, 193/2 oz. against G39 oz. ; and at Smythesdale, 4086~oz. against 3S78 oz. At Castlemaine, Blackwood, Mary borough, Ballaarat, Fiery Creek, and Ararat, the falliilg-off is very marked. At Ararat, especially3} it is to he noticed, where we have only 1291 oz. against 4850 oz. in 1859, and 6022 oz. in 1858. It is not easj- to account for this; and! perhaps, therefore, it is as well not to make the attempt ; suffice it that the fact exists, and^that too in a degree by no means to j be neglected ; more especially when in addition to the comparatively small returns from out I gold fields, lis recollected the large amount of capital that lias been sunk in mining enterprise . To meet this the returns should be better 1? j stead of worse; and it therefore alnj/jst inclines us to a Deuei mat tne lnemci' ;r icy of our mining operations as very palpa bly indicated at the meeting of the Mount li.ope Mining Company yesterday, is in grea 1 1 aea sure the difEculty that needs to be overcojaj e. There is no change in the money »a- arket. Some applications from farmers have 'b.een re ceived for loans to a moderate extent, 1 j* at gene rally the securities offered are not su /. h as to satisfy lenders. Bank rates of discou are un altered. For bills under 95 days' c .arrency, 8 per cent.; for 95 days' to 125 days,' 9 1 per cent.'; over 125 days, 10 per cent.; and for werdrawn accounts and cash credits, 10 per e/fmt. The selling rates of Exchange on Englan d.' are at par for GO days' sight, and 1 per cent, p n ;mium for 30 days. The freight on gold is fr Q-,n 2;d. to 3d. per oz. by sailing vessels, deliverable in London. By the P. and O. Co.'s v essels, ship per.-i taking all risks upon the;tr jselves, the charges are one per cent., deliv e- rable at the Bank of England, and the sa /r,e to ports in India and China, at which the - jc .mpany's ship3 touch. ? In the Stock and Share martlet much inac tivity still continues, hut for tall transactions have* been perhaps more ni id jerous than last week. The Beehive Min 'in g Company have declared a dividend of 5.4,, and favorable re ports have been received of t .he future prospects of the company, 'ojh also of some ground. idjoimng them. ? There has been some inquiry tor this stock, but shares , are held tolerably firmly, and ca'/mot be got under from £G 15s. to £7. Mary'ooroughs ha.y e undergone tydepres-: noil, and have been placed at £1, but Llie marl*,et is dull. Loiag Gullj's are in no. way im .proved. They ha.ve been sold at 4s. 6d., nubjc jt to the last call ; and a number have also bee' j disposed of at 5s.r on the same conditions. M.uch dissatisfaction is srtill felt by the company At their prospects and the condition of their affairs, and a further investigation into the states of the ground and of the workings is about to be undertaken. In the mean time, it is not likely that much alteration can be anticipated. In kelson's Reef stock there is a good improvement. Several sales have been . ? i ,. , 1 n,. ri.l i - — ,«.* wmt iiiraru 58SP.teAie^ in ay lie quoted at from £1 to £l Is. The Atlas Mining Company have reduced then shares from £10 to £1, and sales have been effected at 22s. Gd. Insurance stock lias been dull. Australasians have been placed at 24s, but beyond that we have heard of no clianges. Bank of Victoria have changed hands at £33; and National Bank stock has been parted with at £2 5s. Suburban Railway stock is improv-, ing. Some inquiry has 'Been made during the' last two days, and we quote the shares at from' £9 10s. to £9 12a. Gd. j In the import market business continues dull.' The slightly increased- movement in flour which! took place last week subsided after the receipt 1 of the English mail and has not been revived.; From the country orders have arrived a little! less sparingly, but this may be expected at the: present period of the 3' oar, and scarcely indi-i cates any change upon which we need' congratulate ourselves. . The unfavorable' accounts that have come in from the Snowy River, added to theauthonticated discovery of counter attractions within our own territory may producc a favorable effect in stimulating, the couutry trade, and until this improves, with tho unsatisfactory continuance of the English mania for exportations, it is not likely that much improvement can he felt in the city. Advices brought by the Salsette effected no change for the better, an the contrary they rather seemed to paralyse any little specula tion that there might have been for the time. The market is stdl auffi-ciently stocked with most things to servo all the requirements of this colony for some months to come, i so that any intelligence of a return: to that reckless system of deluging' the place with goods in the Avay that '-British exporters have , been too long so prone, must inevitably produce : this effect, especially in the depression that prevails among all circles. — Teas and Sugaks are about stationary. Congou lias been placed at auction at £11, and 111 10-catty boxes at 28s. each, but only in limited quantity. A large lot of sugar was offered in tlie middle of the week but withdrawn, there beiii'- no purchaser. Cossipore has been sold at 52s. — In Butter there has been a little speculation, and to-day and yesterday the inquiry has been somewhat increased, but prices cannot be maintained. Messrs. Greig and Murray placed Luuham Cork butter at 9i(L to 9jd., but this was exceptional, and the best kintLs arc quoted at 12d. to 12jd., but a further downward tendsncy. — Rice is easier. The stocks are good, and quotations not exceeding A20. Ilie cargo ot the Mary Pleasants was offered to-day, by Messrs. Fraser and Cohen, but without buyers. Tho lot was a good deal damaged from sweating. — Candles continue firm. Price's Belmont are scarce. Some, slightly damaged, have been sold by auction at from 15 jd. to 15|d. — Hams and Bacon- are a little easier, to the extent of about £d. in the most approved kinds. — Coffee is scarce. The market is ill supplied and prices range some 3d. per pound higher than a few weeks ago. It is no*v quoted at Is. net. cash in bond. The sup ply that arrived at Sydney last week seems to have been chiefly absorbed in that market. — Flour is ensier nn-nin sin no tho movement last week, but transactions have been few and very limited. Our quotations for ?the best Adelaide brands are from £20 10s. to £21, with few purchasers at the higher figure. Mri.\i:.s and Brandies arc declining, al though the stock of fine brandies are low, there , being not more than 2000 gallons in bond. Our ! quotations are about 3d. below last week's. ! Wheat and Oats remain without much ' \- ... ? ? . ... ... , . change. The former lias been rather more heavy on hand, millers being vf.rv cautious in their purchases. The cargo by the Penguin, from San Francisco, sold at Q*. G(L ? Several lots of oats have been placed ii'c auction : Dutch at 4s., Danish at 4s., and Calcutta, slightly damaged, at 3s. lid. Seveisil importations of maize having taken places, the price has given way, and ranges from 4s. to 4s. 3d. Of the flour and grain market, Mr. W. Lo:wrance ? reports that the arrival of 'the Pengvin, from San Francisco, with a corga of wheat, and flour, and reporting low rates a 3 ruling h 1 California for breadstutis, has not as yet affected the mar ket here to any extent, shocks of flour being moderate, a good steady, Bonsum.ptive demand taking off imports lis th^y come to hand at fol lowing quotations Adelaide sorts, £21 to £22; Tasmania^, and Victorian, £20 10s.; to £21 per ton ; United States, 52s. per barrel ; Wheat is 1'^-as saleable, and millers are rather shy this Veek. Prices arc nominally 8s. 3d. to 8s. 9d., Oats are without change, and remain nominally as follows: — Irish and Scotch, 3s. Gd. to 4s. Calcutta and Russia, 3s. Gd.' to 4s. ; Uf'cch, 4s. to 4s. 3d. ; Califovr.ian, 4s'. Gd. ; Co lonial, 4s. 9d. to 5s. per bushel. Barley is scarce and wanted: Cape and California find buyers at 4s. 6d. to 5s. Gd. ; malting, 7s. to 8s. per bushel. ~ Maize — Impoi-ts have been heavy this past nweek, and a slight reaction has oc curred. Pxices range from 4s. 3d. to 4s. 6d. per bushel. Bran is heavy of sale at Is. 6d. to is 7d. per busliel. ' Our dates from Sydney by,' the Rangatira are to the 10th of July. FrOm the Empire we take the following : — .* ' i The Salsette's mail w^s delivered this morning, conseouentlv there h'.dinrrlK-'hppn time to dieeat the news. The br-^dy market will doubtless re ciire an increa^d firmness in consequence of the high prices r'aiing jn London, which will preclude the possibility 0f Marteli's brandy being laill down ir. Sydney at lis. (3d., which is the present quotation. Rums have been shipped in large quantities, which will have the effect of de crc jasing the price here, more especially as they p .ave not been quite as firm for the last few day3. Liverpool coarse salt has been quitted to-day at [ £5. A parcel of Bass's ale has also changed 1 hands at £7 53. ' A comparative statement of the Consolidated Revenue of the colony of New South 'Wales, and of the special funds paid into the Treasury at Sydney during the quarters ended 30th June, 1859, and 30th Juife, 1860, respectively, showing the increase or decrease under each head thereof, is published in the Gazette. From this statement we find the total revenue received during the quarter ended the 30th of June, 1860, was £339,654 19s. 8d. For the corresponding quarter of 1859, the revenue amounted to £370,188 3s. 2d. There is therefore a decrease of £30,533 3s. 6d., or 9 per cent on the receipts of the quarter. During the first half-year of the year 1859 the revenue amounted to £721,365 19s. lid., and during the half-year ended the 30th June, 1860, to £595,912 18s. 8d. The decrease in the half-year is, therefore! £125,453 Is. 3d., or over 21 per cent. The falling off. in the revenue . this quarter is again in the Customs and land revenue ; but it is satisfactory to find that during the last two months the Cus toms revenue has imoroved, and is fully equal to that period of last year. It must also be borne in mind that the separation of Moreton Bay makes a difference in our Customs revenue of about £3000 a month, but still the decline on the half year_ is so considerable that there is very little probability of the year's revenue being equal to that of 1859,' and, consequently, it will fall far short of the es timated revenue, so that the Treasurer, unless gome wonderful change takes place during the present half year, will have to meet Parliament next session with a deficit, instead of the surplus he anticipated. The Customs revenue collected during the quarter ended the -30th of June, 18-59, was £158,778 9s. 3d.; during 1860, £144,461 153. lOd. Decrease, £14,316 13s. 5d.

We have Queensland papers to the 5th in stant. Tho following is from tlie Cjnn'er: — Flour. — This article remains as last quoted Imported flour is selling below mill prices, and. salesj are only effected for actual consumption . But in opposition to this tendency to a deeliu.e, ui u very 'gui, nuu w:ieac is aavancr.ag in price. Bran continues steady at about £9 per ton. Sharps, £10 per 2000 lbs. Corn is more inquired for, and sells freely at 3s. 9d. to 4s. per' bushel, wholesale. Potatoes. — Stock of potatoes are working off, and new ones are saleable at £10; to £11 per ton. Seed oats and seed barle y are supplied in excess of the demand, and pric as no minal. Tlie demand, will, probably, improve if the rain continues.

Tlie rumors of arrivals of Ctdii'otniun wh?at m Sydney appear to have originated in the fact of J the arrival at Melbourne of the Penguin, with a cargo of wheat from California, which, is stated to be the first of a series of vessels coifliftg to^AfiSs^ ^ tralian poTts ; and that two others were loading when the Penguin sailed. In -reference to the statement that other vessels were to fol&rw; the Penguin with large quantities of wheat, it is by. many persons on 'Change doubted; but the foundation of the belief is the following extract from a letter lately received by a well-known firm in this city : — ' As soon as the deficiency of the South Australian harvest was known in England, large orders were sent' to California for wheat,' to be delivered in these colonies, provided the contracts ' could be taken at 6s. per bushel, delivered. The magni ficent appearance of the crops has compelled holders in California to give way, and the Pen guin is the first of severaL vessels no won their 'way with wheat from San Francisco, having been chartered at 40s. per ton, and the wheat being at 4s. 6d'. per bushel.' With regard to the fore going, the argument of some parties here is that, even admitting the fact that wheat was as low as 4s. 6d. in California, it could not be laid down in Melbourne to give any profit undei about 6s. 10d., and that therefore it was not probable that any large quantity would be sent to the markets of these colonies. The wheat market is in the mean time .rather flat, and the millers are at present cautious buyers at 8s. * By the City of Hobart Tasmanian papers to the llth of July haTe reached us. The Mer cury of that date reports ; — Verv little was doine in the wheat market to day, the demand being quite inactive. _ Prices have not experienced any change, 9s. being the figure for good samples. Oats and barley are very dull, little or no disposition being erinced to put-, chase. Hay remains as previously quoted, loose and country pressed going off slowly at £6 to £7 per ton according to quality. Potatoes meet with no inquiry, and are still quoted at £6 to £6 10s. per ton. 'There is about the usual local demand for .flour, and prices are steady at £22 per ton for first qualities. Bran, Is. 6d. to Is. 9d. per bushel. We have Auckland papers to the 23th of June. The Southern Cross of -that date reports as follows : — ? ' ' No greater liveliness exists in commercial affairs than during the previous month. The Taranaki war still remains as an incubus, and safety is the order of the day. The flour market is in an unsettled state, and. an increase upon the already high price of £27 per ton is anticipated, and we shall probably, before next harvest, have to record a higher quotation in breadstuffs than has been known hi New Zealand for many years. Greatjlestitution may be looked for amongst our old customers, the natives, and the disregard for the future, which characterises the Maori, when he goes to war and consumes in his preliminary feast stores which might have lasted him through a long campaign, 'will re-act upon all engaged in commerce in the Province. English imports will be accumulating in our warehouses, as the native ceases to be a producer, and so becomes unable to continue a trader. We may also remark that the importance of the native trade to Auck land is beginning to be appreciated by all simul taneously with the anticipation of the probability of its ceasing. The Government have found it necessary to interdict all trade with one district — Kawhia— a measure which, whilst having the re quired. effect of causing natives to realise their entire dependence on traders for articles, wliich have become to them actual necessaries of life, has likewise been seriously detrimental to many of our out-settlers, who, in obedience to the orders of Government, have been obliged to abandon a trade on which they depended for a livelihood. Auction sales still continue, but it is occasionally difficult to realise inYoice prices. Paper is not at a premium with our auctioneers, ana cash pay-, ments are looked for. The result of this change ?cannot fail ultimately to be of benefit, and a, more bona jWfl.character will be given to transactions ] under this system than they have hitherto worn. | The stock market is very uncertain, and it has been generally difficult to anticipate previous to sales what prices would be realised. Annexed is the report of the Net 0 Zealander ?f the 25th : — Business continues flat ; and until affairs in the' Taranaki Province assume a more encouraging; aspect, we are puzzled to discover any immediate prospect of improvement ; unless, indeed, means be devised at the Meeting of the Tribes, which is fixed for the 2nd proximo, to place the relations between the races upon a Bound, decisive, and equitable understanding. The arrivals have been the Aquila, cutter, with a cargo of fruits, cocoa nnt oil. vams. and curiosities from the Fejee Is lands ; the ship Nugget from London, via Sydney, [ with troops, and a general cargo of merchandise ; I aniL-lhe beifiantiefn. G.W'USeri^unusually 'tem- pestuous, and, as will be seen in our shipping re ports, there has been considerable loss among our coasting craft; From the coast the arrivals. have : been few, and the produce to hand exceedingly limited: — 1570 bushels wheat, 16 tons potatoes, 70 cwt. salt' 'pork, 20 cwt. flax, 7 tons kauri gum, 196 tons firewood, 300 palings, 2000 ' shingles, 16,600 feet sawn timber. The Customs revenue received during the week ended the 16th inst. amounted to £657 18s. 4d. Mr. Alfred Buckland's sale at the Greyhound Yard, on Sa turday last, was numerously attended ; but the severe weather prevented stock . from being brought forward, and but little business was transacted. Seven of the horses, ex Hirondelle, sold at an average of £10 5s. ; two riding foals, £5 5s. each, and a riding horse £14 10s. The sale held at the residence of J. Fairburn,.Esq., was well attended; and satisfactory prices were ob tained. Half-bred ewe3 realised 23s. ; lambs, 10s. 6d. ; aged merino ewes, 12s. 9d. each. The dairy cows were good, and realised respectively £20 2s. 6d., £16, £13, and £10 17s. Gd. Horses .were dull of sale. The hay at the stack sold at about £3 10s. per ton. The severe weather 011 Wednesday, occasioned but a slight attendance at Otara ; but for the cattle and sheep there was a good competition, ahd fair ! prices were obtained. The horse stock was again dull of sale. At Newmarket, yesterday, the l emainder of the horses, ex Hirondelle, were dis posed of at an average of £9 17s) 6d. each. The fat cattle, ex Margaretlia Roessner, were brought forward in excellent condition. There wag keen competition for them, and the prices obtained were good, the whole being disposed of. The dairy cows, on the contrary, suffered a good deal on their voyage, and sold consequently at low rates ; as a class they were not equal to the re quirements of our market. There was a small market of sheep, with a dull inquiry, and seve ral pens were withdrawn. Fat pigs were scarce ; nine only were brought forward, and those were of small size ; extreme prices ruled;
