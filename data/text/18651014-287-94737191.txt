TOPICS OF THE WEEK, We understand on good authority that Mr. B. B. Torrens is about to return to this colony. The Moonta case has been set down for argument in the Privy Council in Deoember next. We need scarcely direct attention to the letter of our London correspondent, but we may aav that it is this month more than usually interesting, and deals with a variety of topics in a most graphic and attractive manner. On Tuesday evening, the President entertained the members of the Legislative Council to dinner at Par liament House. The arrangements were unexception able, and a very pleasant evening was spent. Oae non-parliamentary guest was invited, namely, Mr. Phillips, who bo gallantly rode into the breakers at Marino, and saved two human lives from destruction. This invitation was in exceedingly good taste, and was generally appreciated by the guests of the Hon. President. The Estimates of Public Expenditure for the year 1866 have just been laid before Parliament, but we have no apace to enable us to deal with them to-day. We may, however, state that the classification of officers has been adopted, viz. : — Professional heads of departments, £800 and £703. Other heads of departments, includiag the Under Treasurer — First class, £700 ; second class, £600 ; third class, £500. Deputies and Secretaries — First class, £500 ; second class, £400. Clerks of the first class, £300 ; second class, £260 ; third clasa, £220 ; fourth class, £180 ; fifth class, £140. Cadets not to exceed £100, and to be ranked as ' Provisional and Temporary.' Wherever the salary of an official, provided for on the 'Fixed Establishment,' does not accord with one of the above amounts, it is to be understood that the office has purposely not been classified. The prizes which were recently drawn in the Grand Lottery in aid of the Catholic Fund were exhibited on Wednesday in White's Booms, and Were distributed to the fortunate winners as they pre sented their prize tickets. There was a large number of persons present other than those who were directly interested in the results of the lottery, and advan tage was taken of the opportunity to arrange for rafiles for articles which were still left on hand. The room was kept open during the afternoon and evening, and there were a great many persons present all , the time. The remains of the late Mr. P. T. Schumacher, an old and much respected colonist, were conveyed to the Adelaide Cemetery on Monday morning. He had for many years past carried on business as a land agent, in Pirie-street. We have seen at Messrs. Amsberg & Gesner's shop, an excellent specimen of tobacco, grown at Penola. It is unmanufactured, being simply fine cut from the dried leaf, but its quality is excellent, and, mixed with, other tobacco of heavier kinds, it would be found very palatable for smoking. It is well worth a trial. We have received a communication containing a charge of improper conduct, alleged to have occurred on board the immigrant ship Electric. It is stated that the minutes of an investigation on the subject have been placed before Government, but that it is not yet' decided whether Ihe matter shall be adjudicated on here, or referred home. Our correspondent hopes that steps will be taken to prevent the recurrence on board immigrant ships of such conduct as that re ferred to. The twenty men selected to compete in the rifle match with the Sydney Volunteers, fired at the Butts on the South Park Lands, on Tuesday morning, October 10. The day was fine, though the wind was rather cold. The distances fired were 200, 300, 500, and 600 yards ; seven rounds at each range. Some very fair shooting was made, as will be seen from the subjoined scores : — 200 300 S00 600 Yds. Yds. Yds. Yds. Ttl. Jas. Waddell 5tB . . 2213203 2222233 2212434 2443030 69 M.

It will be seen that the highest score was obtained by Private J. Stark, Strathalbyn Bifles, with a total of 72 points, tbe next highest being Private Jas. Waddell, Mount Barker Bifles, with 69 points. The firing commenced about eight o'clock, and did not terminate till about half-past twelve o'clock. We hare received the subjoined communication : — ' Having just returned from a visit to' the South and South-Eastern Districts, allow me while my recollec tion is still fresh, to furnish you with various facts and data (relative more particularly to the coming harveBt) collected during my travels. As applying generally to the whole of the country over which I hare traversed, the remark may be made that the crops are exceedingly backward — that they are not, in fact, sufficiently forward to resist the hot winds which are now daily expected. This circumstance, therefore, makes it impossible to prognosticate with any degree of certainty the result of the forthcoming reaping operations. It is doubtful whether the yield at Echunga will exceed that of former years, or whether it will form another link in the adage ' small by degrees, &c;,' which it has been carrying out with re markable fidelity during several seasons past. At Mac clesfield, Strathalbyn. and the Finniss, the young crops, with a few exceptions, look healthy and vigor ous ; and it is to be hoped the returns will realize the cherished expectations of the farmers residing iu those districts. The country surrounding Goolwa, Port Elliot, and Encountry Bay, presents just now a very charming appearance ; and so far as human foresight can go, average crops may be expected. From Willunga to the Adelaide Plains, the prospects are not so promising as they were a few weeks ago. A yellow rust or blight is making disastrous inroads upon flourishing fields ; and the farmers are pnzzled out of their wits in their endeavors to explain the causes which operate for and against the appearance of this foe. It is less noticeable about O'Halloran Hill ; but in most other parts the sections are dotted over with a number of yellow patches, blighting the corn and the prospects of the farmers atone and the same time. The warm weather of the last few days has also been regarded with apprehensive feelings, as if preluding the approach of hot winds — another unwelcome visitor to the cultivator of tiie soil. So far, however, as can be now seen and ascertained, an average yield may be looked for from the southern parts of the colony, but much will depend upon the kind of weather we shall be visited with during the next two months. * * * It is stated on good authority that the country from Strathalbyn to Middleton (a town ship between the Goolwa and Port Elliot), has been surveyed for the purposes of the contemplated tramway ; and that the belief is that junction lines will be laid down from Middleton to the townshipB on cither side ; or possibly the present tramway may be used for that purpose. The people of the district interested are highly elated ; and if the mem bers of the Legislature refuse to pass the measure, anathemas loud and strong will fall on their devoted heads. Muoh good, it is predicted, will result from the construction of the tramway ; but if Victor Harbor is to be tbe place of shipment for most of the produce, serious alterations must be effected there. The jetty must be extended to Granite Island, and a breakwater built, es as to enable ships of large draught to come in and go out. At present all goods have to be lowered iuto a boat from the vessels and then carried to the jetty ; but this might be done without any more trouble if the jetty were a tenth part of its present length. To utilize the structure it ought, therefore, to be ex tended across to the island ; and sufficient provision made to protect shipping from harm. Victor Harbor has improved wonderfully within the last eighteen months. The Goolwa tramway has been extended to it ; and now nearly all the imports and exports of the extreme south paBs through its port. Some fine buildings have been erected — those of Messrs. Acraman, Main, Lindsay, & Co., the Government, and the South Australian Banking Company are the most noticeable. It is perhaps worthy of record that the late Rev. Mr. Ifewland predicted some years ago, that although he might not live to see the day, yet it would assuredly arrive when Port Victor would be the Port of the South. Port Elliot and Encounter Bay present little signs of material improvement, so far as the township is concerned, and it is feared the proposed tramway will militate against its future progress. For beauty and grandeur of scenery, however, and for salubrity of climate, it will always maintain a pleasant place in the recollection of those who visit it. Goolwa cannot fail to go ahead, particularly now more energetic efforts are being put iu operation to retain and extend the River Murray traffic. At the present time tvro steamers are in course of erection at the works of Messrs. Hooker and Curson ; and it is reported that Captains King and Johnson are both in EngWnd selecting boats that will be able to enter the dreaded mouth at any time. It now seems an opportune time for the Government to step in and aid in nursing the River trade. If they were to lay on a steamer, or subsidize one to run between Adelaide and the Goolwa or Port Victor, for the purpose of carrying mails and stores, this would accomplish much towards the desired end. Just now the cost of cartage from Adelaide to the Quolwa is greater than the cost of conveyance from Melbourne there ; and if this state of things is not altered, depend upon it many of the tradespeople of the South will purchase their goods in bond in. Melbourne and get them brought to them by one of the small vessels constantly trading between Victoria and Victor Harbor. This will so seriously affect the Adelaide trade that our patriots ought to look out.' According tu the statement of a friend from the Goolwa, a rather serious robbery occurred ia that townBhip on Thursday night October 5. The stable of Mr. Bay, landlord of the Corio Hotel, was broken into, and a very valuable mare stolen there from. Deeming this favor sufficient for Mr. Bay, the thief or thieves appear to have proceeded thence to Mr. Field's house, the Goolwa Hotel, from which a nice saddle and bridle were abstracted. The stores of Messrs. Goode & Cohen seem to have been respectively called upon, for on the following- morning various articles of clothing, silk handkerchiefs, &c.; were missed. Having now satisfied all necessary outer requirements, the wants of the ' inner man'* were next attended to ; stud with this object in. view Mr. Cohen's supplies were again patronised, various empty tins, recently occupied by preserved salmon, &c;, and numerous eggshells, betokening a hungry appetite. Up to between 9 and 10 o'clock on Friday morning these were all the depredations which had been discovered. Information was at once given to the police-trooper in the township, and telegrams were dispatched to various stations, although it was very problematical whether this course would be of any use, as the robbery wa? committed in tbe night, and the stations not opening till 9 o'clock, sufficient time had elapsed to enable the possessor of the horse to get beyond telegraphic reach. Suspicion had fallen upon no one in particular; but the general opinion was that the work was done by one individual, and that he was well acquainted with the township. Mr. Bay's loss is a serious one, he having been frequently offered as much as £30 for his animal; and the scamp appears to have known its superiority over most of the other horses in the township ; for he could have procured one or two from Mr. Field's stable, and a saddle at Mr. Bay's ; but, knowing the difference in horseflesh, and anxious to distribute hia favors, he acted as above narrated. On Tuesday, October 3, the children of the Port Augusta Sunday School met by appointment at 2 p.m. in the Custom House, and after singing and prayer — led by Mrs. Mildred and the Bar. If. Twopenny — formed into procession and proceeded through the township, accompanied by tbe teachers and friends, to TasBie's Jetty, where they embarked in boats and were rowed to the Coonatto. After being showed over various parts of this fine ship, they adjourned to the saloon and partook of an elegant tiffin, kindly provided by her generous commander. The children then left the vessel, with three cheers, and after landing, formed into procession and marched to the 7udanamutana Company's fine store, which had been kindly lent by Mr. Crane for the occasion ; and here a fine tea had been prepared. The building was tastefully decorated with flags, green boughs, &c.; About 115 were present, and after tea the children adjourned to tbe grounds (whilst the cloth, was being cleared) and young and ?- old heartily joined in ' kiss in the ring,' and other games. They were then called in, and sang to the harmonium the hymn — '1 think when I read.' The Chairman, the Bev. Mr. Twopenny, then called upon Mr. Mildred for his report, which may be summed up in the few following words : — The School opened on the 1st May, 1864, with seven scholars ; the average attendance for the first month was eight ; the average attendance for this last month was 35 — 53 names still stood good on the books, besides 13 who had removed. The library consisted of 60 volumes of entertaining matter, the issues of which during the period bad amounted to 384. Mr. Mildred also added that tbe system was perfectly tree from sectarianism. The Chairman then distributed the prizes awarded to over 20 scholars for good con duct, making appropriate remarks upon each. After which, the hymn ' There is a happy land,' and a very impressive and entertaining address from the Chairman to the children. This was followed by a humorous and lively one from Mr. Burgoyne, which was loudly cheered. The hymn ' Around the Throne,' having been sung, the Bev. Mr. Twopenny proposed a vote of thanks to Mr. Mildred and the teachers, for their exertions in getting up the arrange ments. The Bev. Mr. Hovritt, in a pleasant manner, proposed a vote of thanks to the ladies assisting, which was responded to by Mr. Wicksteed in his happy style. Mr. Mildred proposed the Chan-man, the Bev. Mr. Twopenny who acknowledged, the vote, and proposed a vote of thanks to Mr, Crane for his store and: assistance. Then followed thanks to the visitors, which was responded to Mr. Pearson, of Melrose. : After which, Mr. Mildred gave the com pany one hour of the magic lantern, to the evident great delight of the children. ' God Save the Queen,' by Mr. Mildred on the harmonium and whole com pany, concluded, a little after 8 p.m., one of the hap piest reunions that has ever taken place at Port Augusta. Oa Wednesday evening, Mr. Pearson gave an interesting lecture upon ' Wit ;and Humor,' which was well attended, and heartily received by the com pany present. We have received a letter fromPort Lincoln stating that shearing has commenced and that the clip will compare favorably with hist season'e notwithstand ing the drought, but that the runs there are over stocked. Among our obituary notices will be found an announcement of the death of George Windsor Earl, Esq., Assistant BeBident Councillor and Police Magistrate of Province Wellesley. Mr. Earl first visited this colony in 1837 with Sir Gordon Bremer, in H.M.3. Alligator — the vessel by which our first Governor, Sir John Hindmarsh, left the colony, and which took the marines from H.M.S. Buffalo to Port Essington.. After a short stay here Mr. Earl left in the Alligator, and after an absence of nearly 27 years revisited the colony in February, 1864, for the benefit of his health. He left again ia the year following to resume his duties, but we regret to eay that since bis return to Penang bis health gradually failed. His medical adviser recommended an imme diate voyage to England, but unhappily before the vessel sailed Mr. Earl breathed his last. In him, Australia loses one who took a deep interest in her welfare and prosperity. North Australia and the Islands of the Eastern Seas especially were objects of his attention, and his published remarks upon theu are in the hands of every one possessing any knowledge of the subject. In private life Mr. Earl was a man of great general information, a kind and warm friend, and one of whom we may truly say that all who knew him loved him. His death will be a matter of great and general regret, and amongst his own immediate friends s deep aud heartfelt loss. The Mark Lane Express, ot the 21st August, has the following remarks on the corn trade: — 'The weather of tbe paBt week bas been again of a treacherous character : now and then fnll sunshine, and anon smart showers, anything but propitious to the harvesting of the grain. As might be expected, there are already complaints of sprouting and mildew, and tbe new samples that have hitherto appeared do not favor the impression that we have either a good yield or quality. With such a catching time on prices so low, and the country iu a perfect state of alarm about tbe cattle disease, it is not to be sur prised that we are able to note a further advance of fully 2s. per quarter on the average, and some places noted doubly as much. But the rates hitherto reached have only a moderate range, and as the British farmer during tbe cotton famine was feeding the half-starved Lancashire men partly at his own expense, now that the American war is over, Bonie remuneration for sunk capital and fruitless labor seems his due. Should the cattle disease reach to the height of a national visitation, there is no question but a much higher range of prices would set in ; but, as extremes of all kinds are deceptive and injurious, we hope the threatened scourge will find a remedy, and that the grazier, as well as the farmer, will be righted in the end. Foreign accounts too much, agree with our own, S3 to defective and injured crops, to give much expectation of a return to very low prices. France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, some parts of Bussia, and South ern Europe, all tell the same tele, and prices generally have risen. With more samples of new exhibited at ? Paris, some dulness has appeared ; but iu the country prices have gained ground, and all along the Baltic there is a different range— Dantzic holdiug, as we expected, for fully 4s. per quarter more money; and, although a decline in gold at New Tork has been followed by a slight reduction in breadstulTs, the facts of Western failure and Southern discontent show that the United, or rather Federal, States will be a very uncertain dependence in case of extremity.' The following were the current prices of British grain and flour in Mark Lane : — Wheat, Essex and Eenfc, white 44 to 52s per quarter ; red 44s to 47s ; Uorfolk, Lincoln, and Yorkshire red, 44s to 47s. Flour, per sack of 280 lbs., town households, 38s to 43s ; ditto country, on shore 30s to 36s ; ditto, country Norfolk and Suffolk, on shore, 30s to 32s. Foreign Grain. — Wheat, Dantzic, mixed, 46s to 503 per quarter ; old, extra, 50s to 56s ; ditto, Konig3berg, 44s to 48s ; extra 483 to 50s ; ditto, Bostock, 44s to 48s ; ditto, fine, 49s to 50 ; ditto, Silesian, red, 423 to 44s ; ditto, white, 45s to 47s ; ditto, Pomera., Mec&berg.;, aud Uckermk., red old 42s to 4Ssj Russian, hard, 38s to 393 ; St. Petersburg and Rigs, 41s to 43s ; Danish and Holstein red 40i to 42s ; French, none ; Rhino and Belgium 43s to 47s ; American, red winter 43s to 46s, spring 42a to 459, white 46s to 49s. Flour, per sack, French, 32s to 35s ; ditto, Spanish, per sack, 32s to 353 ; ditto, American, per brl., 22a to 24s ; ditto, extra aud double, 25s to 27s. In the Supreme Court, on Wednesday, the ruTe for a new trial in Galbraith v Elder was argued, but tho Court deferred judgment. The rule for a new trial in Green and Another v. Bagless was dis charged ; but tbe rule for a new trial in Copeland v. Wentzel wm made absolute. t
