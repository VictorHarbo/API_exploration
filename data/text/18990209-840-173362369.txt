(Secretary, Brisbane- Fish and Agency Company, Limited), South Brisbane. Tho objects of the Company are:— To Purchase the "Assets and Goodwill of the Brisbane Fish and Agcucy Compauy. Limited, .us a going concern. To purchase, prepare, and deal in all kinds of Fiahj Ice, and other articles of Fresh Food ; and carry on' the "busiuess of General Merchants, Importers. Exporters, Warehouse men, Bondkeepers, Storekeepers, Produce Merchants,- and other food preservers. To manufacture, buy, sell, aud trade in goods, storos, chattels, and effects of all kinds. To amalgamate (if 'desirable) with any Company having like objects in view To carry into effect an agreement entered into by the Brisbane Fish and Agency Com pany, Limited, and Mr. David James Davies, as Agent for the New Company, for the sale of the busiueHK on most' reasonable terms, which agreement can ho iuspeotcd at the office of tho Company's Solicitors. The Brisbaue Fish and Agency Company, Limited, has been most successful since its inception, and although only a short time in existence, a dividend nt the rato of 25 per cent per annum has lately been declared, and an increase of capital is . required to extend operations by opening up trade with the whole of the principal towns iu Queeus- land and the other colonies. . There is already a -good trade being done with Rockhumpton, Townsville, and Charters Towers, by packing fish on ice in instituted caseB, a thing con sidered beyond all possibility a few years back, und, with increased facilities, a very much larger trade is certain. " It is the intention of the Directors to ondcuvour to run the new Company on the same lines as the New South Wales Fresh Food and Ico Company, Limited, of Sydney. ... In New South Wales a largely increasing trade has been opened up by the old Company with both fish und oysters, several consignments having been sent to tho New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company, Limited, Messrs. Chenery & Co., aud other large fish merohnnts in Sydney. Fish has also been' forwarded in insulated coses to all towns in Queensland having railway communication. ; An extensive trade is also conducted by the old Company in smoked flsb, oysters, and turtles, negotiations having been outered into by Mr. Finucauc, the Queensland Commercial Agent, with Messrs. Bellis k Co., of London, on behalf of the Company for the export of the latter. The fish industry is in its infancy with regard to smoking, curing, and tinning, and a large business is possiblb in this direction, preliminary arrangements having been made with a large firm in town for disposal of all tinned goods. Mr. Cer- vetto, tho Managing . Direotor of tho present Company, has been iu the hsh trade for the past 25 years, und his experience in the handling and preservation of fish is unequalled in the colonies, and this experience enables him to state that Brisbane is naturally the most suitable centre from which to carry on a business of this kind, us Moreton Bay gives the most regular supply of any fishing ground in tho colonies. The services of Mr. Cervetto, ns well as those of the other active members of the old Company, will, of course, be retained, an agreement having been entered into with the former gentleman to that effeot. Satisfactory arrangements have been made with Messrs. Geddcs, Birt, & Co. for a lease of the Cold Stores, South Brisbane, giving over 12,000 feet storage capacity. Contracts are held by the Brisbane Fish and Ageuoy Company, Limited, for the supply of Fish, Oysters, kc., to tho A.U.S.N. Compauy, B.I.S.N. Company, the Duke Line, Messrs. Howard Smith k Sons, the Generate Italauio Steamship Compuuy, Queensland Club, the principal hotels and cafes, all of whioh will be considered as part of the goodwill. The Directors of the old Compuuy are so confident of the ultimutc success of tho New Company, that thev have completed, a deed, guaranteeing to the Shareholders an amount equal to not less than 10 per ceut per annum for two years on the eapitul paid upon Contributing Shares. Tho total amount of this guarantee will be lodged to the credit of two trustees iu tho Government Savings Bank for this specific purpose.

EXTRACTS FROM DIRECTORS' REPORT, BRISBANE FISH AND AGENCY COMPANY, Limited. We are pleased to report the business of the Company has been most successful. We have opened up a good trade with Rockhumpton, Townsville, and Charters Towors, sending fresh fish there twice a week, and a very lurge trado is possible with the North by means of insulated cases, the stock of which will have to be increased soon. With New South 'Wales wo have a lurgely increasing trade with both fish aud oysters. In Sydney alone we have opened several good accounts. Arrangements have been made with Messrs. Geddcs, Birt. and Co. to increase our storage capacity. The alteratious are now complete, giviug us over 12.000 feet storage. The present half-year shows a profit, and considering the size of the company aud the heavy expenses incurred opening up the business, the result is highly gratifyiug, and we are sure that with increased cupital wo could not only keep the present up-grade movement, but better it still Wo would also recommend that & dividend at the rate of 25 per cent por anuum be declared. , v Crovernmcnt Advertisements. .
