The annual average may be little less but judging by the experience of centuries in other parts of the world, when rain does fall it is more violent and the effect on the unprotected soil is more severe Thus channels and gullies are washed out and Hoods are more frequent Since there is little cheek to the water in its result to the low lying country Every landowner can and should initiate a policy of tree planting in the coastal district there is little to do but sow the seed or put in the trees and protect them from here from stock and from vermin with a view to shelter purposes and future timber wealth nil reahorcstatmn scheme should he intelligently carried out and under export advice Thus in any dis trict efforts should first be directed to wards growing. belts of trees in positions which will afford the greatest shelter to the greatest number Often a thick belt along a ridge will protect a dozen firms 1 In varieties to plant to secure earliest results, the distances apart the after Imitmenl/-all those points should be con- ordered and advice on them will be readily i Headed by the ''orchard department What that is required is a forestry league in every district so that all efforts may be properly) organised Failing thin in div kIukIs should make up their minds to fill in a few trees every year The Scotch laird s advice to his son was sound al pass be planting a tree It will grow while you are sleeping ' A Sound Investment In this connection may be pointed out what a sound investment there is for any one able to suit in growing timber Re cently a case came under notice where a city resident with a small block in the Tallis has made up his mind to grow trees Instead of putting money in a Savings Bank his idea is that every year he will put in as many trees as he can afford and can look after He is working under expert advice and feels sure that in 25 years it will have timber of considerable value should the timber not be worth the money she expects from a nursing point of view he feels that the satisfaction of knowing that he has served his generation will be re- comprise enough In a country of assured rainfall shelter belts are most economically established by sowing the seed broadcast Mention has been made of 1 he settlement of lightly timbered Mallee country in the north-west of the State Pins is going on at the present time, but unfortunately little or no provision is being made for Shelter by leaving large belts untouched The consequence that will follow can he t seen in the country that has been cleared within the last 10 years The practice has been to clear out everything in a race meeting that by rolling down and burning; a man can easily clear from 200 to 250 acres in 12 months, it can be understood that only a few years are needed to convert a dense scrub into an open, rolling countryside quite clear of any settler Usually reserve- are left every few rules which are termed water reserves or timber reserves These are mvambly (fattened by settlers who are in such measures only shelter for rabbits and noxious weeds The settlers clamour for these to be throw open for selection and aided by short sighted politician- mast of of man have been so utilises The few remaining along the Ouyen Murray ville line, during the boom for repatriation of Jinldicrsr were then sac rise Since fallowing is demanded to ensure a crop in this country of limited maintain, the absence of shelter timber relates that wind- sweep across the open paddocks, and one of the most serious problems is to prevent the surface soil from blowing away in the older districts a viRoroirs I can v of tree-planting should be pushed forward in this northern climate such trees will need!
