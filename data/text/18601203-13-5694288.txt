Gontlcmon,- "> , At tho request of an influential mooting hold thU n orning, I hive consented to offar my surucos toro prctcnt your district in tho Legislative Aisemhly. 31)0 request nos bo unexpected that I must nooda apologise if in this annount cmeut I am unable to glva j ou any lengthened exposition of wy political priu eples; thoy are, however, not unknown to many of li y fellow-colonists, and I shall gladly avail of tho o illest pOBsiblo opportunity of explaining thom to yiu in person. Meantime I may state that I am an advocato for tho g eatcst pof aiblo freedom of ti ado, and I rogan! t ixi tlon for any other than strictly fiscal purposes its V -eatious and unwho. 1 consider that the State has an indefeasible iitlo t > ti c gold so lavishly distributed under the sur/aoo of those lands, and am opp"od to any surrender of tua rivenue it yields Tho timo has aul-cd when it «i.l ho necessary to lcpiElato on tho subject of tbo pastoral lands of t-o colony. 1 think it »ii! be deairablo to auhdivido tho biter runs bo that thtlr occupation may bo brough*, within the roach of mon of moderato capital. Suuh * reduced runs, let to tho highest bidder, and secured c > h'm for a defiutto term, would, I think, be a settle n ent of this vexed question nllko advantageous to tho Slate, and to the f-nuders themselves. On tho subject of-tate-lid to religion, I still think that it would bo wise to conttuue it, but I topeat whit 11 old the electors of South Bourke whon I contested th» t district at tho lost general election, that I am pre pned to Burrondor my opinion on this point to tim v libes of the colonists generally, as cxprcsbod hv their representatives in tho Assembly on moro than one occasion. I am, and 1 trust I shall ovor bo found to bo, a stronff supporter of Constitutional Qovernmpnt, and it is with u ucb regrot I lmvo noticed what I fear is a disposition to ignore tho Upper Chimber, as au ossontlal pait of cur Constitution.

Tho lato Government attompted to govorn the colony without a party or n policy, and failed.

The result is a Coalition Ministry, who now demand public i orifideneo until tho measures proposed by thom have beta examined aud tested. Tho new Government will vigorously administer tlio Land Sales Act, and will, if neo«s£ory, amend the oot when experionoo justifies it, in order to removo any impediments and restrictions in the woy of the cottier. A scheme of assisted immigration will bo intro- duced, based upon the principio of reducing tho com paiotlvo cost of passago between America and Aus- tralia to an equil ra e. It is well known that the British people would sooner come hero than go to America, If the passago money was not so expensive ; therefore, the cost of passage-money Is an obstacle to overcome. This plan will confer upon resident colo- nists the advantago of nominating their relation» aud friends as immlijrauts, by the prepayment of monoy according to a given scalo. Tho Btato of tho public exchequer will render it no cceeaiy to reviso tho tariff, and lo impose new duties upon importations. Bills to license distillation and to amend the Post office Act, »ill be iutroduood. Tho foimation of water reservoirs upon tho gold-fields will be carried on with vigour, and a largo amount of money will bo duvotcd to this purposo.
