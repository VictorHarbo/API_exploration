PROSPECTUS. ON SATURDAY, the 3rd of FEBRUARY, 1866, will be PUBLISHED the First Number of THE QUEENSLANDER, a new Weekly Journal, to be issued in Brisbane every Saturday Morning. THE QUEEN'SLANDER is intended to supply the acknowledged necessity which exists for a Weekly Newspaper of a size and character which will render it suitable to the wants of readers of all classes throughout the Colony. The number of Newspapers published in Queensland is sufficient evidence of the general demand existing throughout the colony for this class of reading. But those who wish to be suppliod with information of what is passing beyond the boundaries of the district in which they reside are at present without the means of obtaining it in any one Newspaper. It will be the object of the proprietor of THE QUEENSLANDER to endeavor to supply this want fully ; and the means at his command being so much more extensive than are to be found elsewhere, he will be enabled to give each week such a mass of information collected from all parts of the colony as can- not fail to secure a large circulation. As the paper will be published in Brisbane, the largest centre of population, a considerable portion of its contents will necessarily be devoted to events occurring in that neighbor- hood ; but great care will be taken that a sufficient portion of space be devoted to each of the other districts, so that a fair history may be given of the week's proceedings of the whole colony, principally obtained through special and trustworthy correspondents. The greatest care will be taken to admit nothing of a doubtful character ; and in order to render the paper welcome as a family newspaper, interesting reading of a literary character will be supplied from week to week. With the advantage of being published in the capital of the colony, THE QUEENS- LANDER will contain the earliest and most reliable information of all Legislative and Governmental action, affecting the welfare of the general body of the people or that of any of the various interests which flourish among us. A full epitome of the Parliamentary Debates will be given during the Session ; and all important bills or public documents which are of sufficient interest will be produced at the earliest possible date. Full reports will be given of the proceedings in the Supreme Court, Brisbane, in the various Circuit Courts, and also in the District Courts-in all cases fur- nished by persons competent to undertake this description of reporting. In politics, THE QUEENSLANDER will be free from anything approaching to party spirit. Its chief object in discussing political questions will be the material advance- ment of the country, and the enforcement of a wise economy on the part of the Govern- ment. At the same time the active promo- tion of public works of a reproductive character will be advocated. While the proprietor will avail himself of all the resources at his disposal for the purpose of giving the News of the Week as fully as possible, the leading columns of THE QUEENSLANDER, as well as the comments on passing events, will be written specially for its pages ; and the principles of progress and economy in government will be constantly maintained. The main object of the paper being to promote social and material progress, the principal industrial interests of the colony will be carefully watched, with a view to record everything which may tend to develop its resources. Thus the improvements will be noted which are effected from time to time in the older portions of this or any other Aus- tralian colony, whereby the country is im- proved and its productive power is increased ; and full accounts of the progress made in pro- moting an improvement in the breed of stock will be regularly published. Special attention will be devoted to Agriculture, which, although now in its infancy, will doubt less before long be one of the most valuable sources of wealth to the colony. Nothing can tend more to produce this desirable result than a full interchange of information among all those engaged in farming pursuits in the different districts. To assist in attaining this object, no pains will be spared to obtain the most reliable statements as to what is actually taking place around us ; and as the large circulation which THE QUEENSLANDER will command among residents in the country, will render it the best medium for this purpose, it is hoped that the farmers will freely use its open column for giving to, or eliciting from, one another much valuable information of a character which nothing but experience can supply. The Markets will be carefully reported, and the ruling prices will be given for all produce as well as the principil articles of consumption. For the former the quotations in the neighboring colonies will be extracted from the best sources, in all cases where they materially affect the prices here. Full catalogues of Wool Sales, both in Sydney and in London will be published, and great care will be taken to render the market reports as full and reliable as possible. THE QUEENSLANDER will contain twelve pages, the same size as the monthly summary of the Brisbane Courier, and will be published every Saturday morning, in time for the country mails. SUBSCRIPTION, 6s. 6d. per quarter, or 21s. per annum; payable in advance in all cases. No books will be kept for subscribers, and no deviation made from the rule of all subscriptions being paid in advance, the benefit of this arrangement will be given to the subscribers, as the amount saved in reduction of expenses and avoidance of losses will be devoted to the improvement of the paper. SINGLE COPIES, 6d. each, may be obtained of all the Agents of the Courier, both in town and country. SUBSCRIPTIONS will be received at the Office, George-street, Brisbane, or by the authorized Agents. ADVERTISEMENTS : 3s. for the first 8 lines, and 1s. for each additional 8 lines.
