In pius* tim.», tho highest point of apparent prosperity was reached in 1853. At tho end of that year tho circulation (notes and bills), in round numbera, amounted to two millions, tho deposits to 0,| titillions, and tho coin and bullion to nearly 3!¡ millions. In 1854, tlio circulation roso about £200,000, but -*tho deposits decreased by £1,200,000, and tlio coin by £500,000. Then carno tho Crisis of 1855. Tho circulation at that time decreased to £2,000,000, and tlio deposits reached thoir lowest point at tho end of 1855 £4,870,000. Singularly enough, the specie pos- sessed by tho banks vvas increased, anil this, doubtless, is to bo attributed to preparation for a po.ssiblo run for gold. In tho- fii-»t quartar of 1850, the banks hold coin and bullion to tho amount of 3^ millions sterling. During 1830 there was a gradual and steady improvement. lu tho first quarter of 1837 tlio circulation had risen to upwards of £2,500,000, the deposits to £0,288,000, while tho coin and bullion vvero re- duced to £3,200,000. .3 c3 C'S 2*~ Notes in circulation Deposits not bearing interest .

Stneo thou tho imports havo amounted to C71.000, and tho exports to £174,477, showing a considera- ble drain of specie heneo to Great Britain. Two important changes have taken place in the money market within tho last fortnight. The banks have reduced their rato of discount on throo months' bills to 7 per cont.-arate which appears high when compared with that ruling in England. In Sydnoy tho rate is only 0 por cent., but there tho banks gonerally do not givo interest on current accounts, as is done here. Tho rates now quoted aro-for bills under 95 days' currency, 7 per cent, ¡from 95 to 125 days', 9 per cent. ; over 125 days', 10 per cent. ; and on overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent. Tho other altera- tion has boen in tho ratos of exchange The banks, either taking the first ad- vantage of the adverse balance of tho com- merce of the colony or finding themselves com- pelled to ship specie to meet the drafts, havo raised tho selling rate of 00-day bills in England to 1J por cent, premium. Tito necessity for this proceeding is not apparent, and the judgment of the bank managers is. questioned in tho matter. Certainly tho colony is just now importing values greatly in excess of tho exports, but at tho same time pioceeds of the sals m England of the first batch of lailvv ay debentures hay o to bo ti
