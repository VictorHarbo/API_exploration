TO RETURNED SOLDIERS. Board and Residence for four Returned Soldiier's. Terms Moderate. Piano and every other convenience. Ap- ply "Bendigo," Alfred Street, Valley. There is to be no more dumping of cheap German immigrants in Australia. So much has been decided. Those who are already here will be a bit lonely of course, but the fullest facilities should be given to them to go back to the Father- land they love so well. No more dump- ing of German goods, alive or dead. Has the ex-Kaiser any friends in Ger- many? Just picture William Hohenzol- lern's genius for lying being devoted to inventing rewards and promises for ser- vice and the question is answered. That is what makes it so foolish to allow the arch-murderer to carry off a cool million with him. Think of it! If the Huns had won "peace would have been dictated from Buckingham Palace," so says the late Herr Ballin, Boss of the Hamburg Steam- ship line, and who committed hari-kari, because the conspiracy did not work out as he wished. It is a toss up whether the extremists or the moderate revolutionaries win the day in Germany. The sanity of the Bosches is by no means proved yet. * * * * The Schleswig quiestion has been settled after nearly sixty years of Hun bullying and lying. Danish colours have been hoisted, and one more little country has come into its own. Divided Germany is harmless. A united German Empire is a menace and danger to mankind. Does Australia realise this?
