? A MONTH TO FIND HUSBANDS. Much amusement has been caused at the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, by the urgent petition of two pretty blue-eyed Danish girls, Al lild Anderson and Ingoborg Jauscn, of Copenhagen, for permission to depart immediately for Winona (Minnesota). Thoy, tho 'Mail' says, are tho cheer ful victims of an eccentric will mado by their grandfather, who bequeathed them each a half-share of COO acres of fine farm lands on the condition that they marry within thirty days of their nfrivnl in 'Mow 'Vnrlf. T-v flin tnrms nf tho will, which tho two cousins ox plained to an interpreter, title to tho' lands will not be finally vested with either of them until they become mo thers. If at the end of fivo years ono of the couains haa a child aud the other has not, tho motherless one will loso half her land to tho other. If noithor has children at the end of fivo years the entire property is to revert to a male cousin in Denmark. Both girls departed for Minnesota, confidently declaring in broken English that thoy would find good husbands within tho stipulated term.
