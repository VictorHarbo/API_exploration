Stock and Shabe Maeket.— Tlio tono of this market is still exceedingly languid, and for tho present it would appear as if speculation had entirely died out.

Eraser and Cohen. The English. news rceoived by tho Northam is not likely to affect our markets to any important extent. Tiie shipment of brandy is very littlo over tho average : monthly consumption, and it j a unlikely that prioos hero will decline muoh helow tho present quotation in the face of an additional demand for New Zealand. Tho exports of ale and beer to thiB colony arc very light, and Bass's No. 3 has shown a decided tendency to advance from 18 7s 6d to 18 10s being now asked.

Lawranco re ports as follows with reference to tho local liour and grain markot. Tho corn market has been in a statn of eon- Bidornblo activity during tho past week, parti cularly as regards breadstuffs,- extensive trans actions having resulted of a slightly speculativo nature, wnuo mo iraao Duy moro rreeiy, uuu larger orders are now being oxecutod in tho fulfilment of export demands for How Zealand. In liorso feed a fair amount of business is being transaottd. Erom Sydney telegraphic messages announoo tho arrival of a small parcel of wheat from California, supposod to bo in execution of a particular order to be fulfilled ; tho advices roach down In 29th July, at which time ono other vessol was loading, and two moro were eaid to bo on tlio berth, but for wliero destined no mention is made ; however, as tho bulk of tho orders Bent from lienco in Maroh and April were subsequently cancolled in May, when our markets experienced tho reaction, the probability is that tho vessels laid on will be withdrawn ; undor any circumstances, witli tlio present moderate Btocks of breadstuffs held by millers and morcbants hero, as well as in Sydney, and in the absence of specula tion, with the. low prices ruling, tho markets cannot thereby bo much influenced, or prices affected. Elour: Imports aro slightly over an ave rage. Adelaido sorts havo boon extensively deult in, prices have rather advanced in gene- rnl, closing rates being os follows t — Tasmania!!, town nnd country (Victorian), 114 10s to H5 ; Adelaide, L15 to L16 ; Hal t's and Mngaroy's superfine, LlG 10s ; Californian, L14 to L14 10s per ton ; United States, 40s per barrel. Wheat : Imports aro moderate, prices are firm, and millers aro moro anxious buyers, Victorian nnd Tasmnninn fetching 5s Gd to fis; South Australian, Gs Gd to Gs 9d per bushel. Oats : Imports aro to a fair extent, prices aro unaltered, colonial aro mora ready of salo than other descriptions, tho bulk of consump tion resting in them, quotations ure unchanged, and rule as follow; — Russian, Scotch and Irish, 3s fid to 3s 7d ; Californian, Dutch and Dunisb, 3s Gd to 3s 9d ; Colonial, -Is Id to 'is 3d per bushoh Barloy : Business vory limited, nt following quotations : — Capo, fis ; English malting, fis Gd (o Gs por bushel. Maizo is in fair request at fis 3d por bushel. Gram is out of first hands. Bran : Supplies come moro freely forward, but not in cxccbs of requirements, nnd prices close firmly, nt Is Gd to Is Gd per bushel. Oatmeal is iu fair request, Scotch finding buyers at' LlG to L20 ; Colonial, L2S por ton. Malt is in fair request, at 9s Gd to 10s nor bushel. Hay -finds buyors at L4 103 to L7 10s per ton ; good descriptions of hydraulic-pressed nro scarce, nnd wanted for export. Potatoes. — Tlio turn is in favour of tho buyer, transactions having taken plaeo at LS to LG net' ton. Or, ions mny bo quoted at L7 to L9 por ton. Estimated imports of flour nnd grain at the port of .Melbourne, from 12tli to 18th Septem ber, inclut'ivo Elour : South Australian, 405 tons ; Tasmnninn, 13 tonB ; Victorian (coast wise), 14 tens.

' Wool. — By tlio arrival of tho mail ship Northern ws aro in possession' of advices of tlio opening of tlio -London July- August series of 9ales, and we regret to. say they report a still futlier decline in prieo 011 the ruling rates of the last sales of nbout 1 J-rl por lh., and fow conditioned wools suffered a still greater decline ; tho quantity which had arrived was ubout 90,000 bales, of which, howover, nbout 9000 bales was from tlio Capo. The attendance of buyers at the sales was smaller than had been noticed for a long trino past, nnd, from tho cotinucd disturbances in America, combined with tlio unfavourable weather for tho- har- vest, ana dullness of trado generally, prices were not expected to rally, only about 12,000 bales had passed the hammer, thus leaving o largo quantity still to bo offered. Wo cannot therefore, again help expressing our oft repeated ndvieo to tho wool growers of Vic toria and its adjoining colonies to sell in this market, wliero tho full markot value is always obtainable, and the risks and losses, etc., of shipping, thereby avoided ; and wo trust our friends will also seo the desirability of getting their wool up in as good condition as possible, as heavy and low conditioned wools will not realise, cither in this or the English market, so good a price in proportion as light and woll got up clips. The new clip lias now com- inonccd to arrivo, and thero aro several moro lots on tlio road, and shearing has now com menced in several districts. The usual weekly sales here will be hold at our warehouses, ; commoncing after the arrival of the October mail, which will bring advices of tho conclusion (or nearly so) of tho London July-August sales. Nearly tho whole of tlio fel- mongcrs' wool now coming into tho market, is shipped o.n their account, it being at a nominal value in this market. In another column will bo found tlio reports of tlio homo markets. Tallow : Wo liavo had a fuir amount of inquiry during the week, and havo dis posed of a few tons of mutton tallow for local use at L45 per ton, and 50 casks mixed tallow for shipment to tlio Mauritius, at L42 por ton.

Should the Victorinn Government ostnblish their excise, nnd Iegaliso tho distillation of spirits (giving ns is reported tlio colonial dis tiller a protective duty of four shillings per gallon), tho demand for imported Bpirits is likely to bo Bcriously affected. Although tbo bonded stock of brandy in Melbourne on tlio 18th Mny hist, was 6292 lilids and 54,765 cases against 9301 hhds nnd 102,675 cases at tlio snmo poriod in 1860, prices do not improvo ; tho consumption was only 453 lilids and 6421 cases for tho month of April. Tho reduction of tho wina duty in Groat Britain hns hitherto proved n great success, tlui consumption averaging nbout 1,000,000 gallons per month, against 600,000 gallons at the old duly. It was anticipated, and vory reasonably, that the introduction of olarot and othor light wines nt a duty of ono shilling per gallon, while sherry, port, raarsnln, oto., paid two shillings and five-pence, would create an enormous de mand for tlicso wines, but tho publio appear pertinaciously to adhere to thoir formor tastes, nnd of a total of 5,400,000 gallons, cleared in the five months ending 31st Mny, only 57(000 represents those wines cleared ot tho shilling duty ; it is therefore elenr tlmtlritherto common French and German wines liavo not made much impression. iyines. — anerry : tho causes inducing tin advance in medium nnd good wines are easily explained ; tlio oidium vintages 1853, 1854) 1855, and 1856, gave but scanty crops, inherit ing a bad reputation — thoso shippers who rigidly exnmiuo quality, have generally" avoided thorn, using vintngrs anterior to 1853 or sub sequent to 1856, ns bases for medium raid fine old marks ; thoso who1 mny hare beeu I«33 fas tidious, while taking a- risk, of course neap a commensurate profit. Since 1S55 and I85G, when tho report of tIre oidium< induced tho trado to purchase considerably in excess of ('heir then requirements, doubtless in consequence of tlio assurance that great scarcity existed, and- Hint fabulous mriees woitiU be demanded!. tlio English wine merchant lias acted w;fh: extrcmo caution, importing only for his present use ; this plan, undoubtedly as advantageous! to tho legitimate shipper as- tho importor, secures to both a minimum price fairly fixed by supply and demand. Tlio advices respect ing prospects of tho vintage are conflicting, some reporting tho. discaso to have- znndb con siderable progress, others say that as yet no material damage has onsued. Pbi-t a From Oporto the last advices note very unfavourable weather for tlio vines, but the gmeral use- of sulphur would, it is hoped, savo a portion of tho crop. Prices wero firmly maintained, especially ior flno old wines. lit other wines nothing material calls for remark. Spirits.— Brandy': Tlio latest letters- from Cognac, advise the market thore n.v inanimate but prices firmly maintained ; tlio- general estimate gives tho crop at about ona-third- of an average. Rum remains at unaltered values. 1 California. — Wo liavo commercial! intelli gence from this State to tho 23rd July.

Tlio Alia California of 23rd July has tho following commercial news : — More confidence lias bcon manifested to-day in a number of leading articles, bat ventures havo beeu made in a few only. Sugars havo gained more attontion, and are decidedly firmer, and coffees have further advanced. Wo learn that the balance of Rio, ex Mnrbs, has been withdrawn from tho market. As is usual on Monday, the jobbing trade was quite light. Nothing of momeut was done at. auction. Tho produoo markot showed some inquiry for wlioat, at tho rates of last week, but barley is lesB wanted, and has declined. From Australia wo have dates to 29tli April, by tho Danish barque Otto, a fow. days later than previously received. The complexion of tho breadstuff markctjg had nndargono no change. The Cimbor is also in from Hong Kong, and tho Comet and Kathleen from Honolulu. China.— Tho accompanying report of tbo Chinese market news ib from the Overland China Mail of 27tli July. Thero is littlo change to- report in business generally. In the cxtremo north, in coiiso- quenso of tho continued attempts to impose inland dulieB mado by tho mandarins, and an equal determination on tho part of the native traders not to pay tho same, business has como to a stand, and according to latest aooounts bona fido sales wero impracticable. The tide of war Booms for tlio present to flow against the inBurgont party, in more districts than ono, if official documents are to bo boliovod. Too much faith must, however, not bo placed on theso reports. In tho valloy of tho Yang-tszo there iB littlo cliango. The river seems pretty well Bupplied with steam communication, but thero is not muoh actual business doing. All tbo newly-opened markets, Hankow, Kowkiang. aud Ohinkiaig, avo well suppliod with foreigr i goods, »b far ns circ.tinstniiccs will admit. A trado seems to bo springing up at Nanking, 0 ; (t rebel port," so wo slia'l soon see how tills \- party is ndaptcd to trado. Chinkiang . is ' described aB n wretched descried city. So wn9 1 Nanking a short timo since, buMt scorns sud denly imbued with commercial lite. At Shanghai business oontinuoi.1 dull nnd depressed. Sales of shirtings had boon effected at n reduction on prorious quotations for medium weiglits, lig" nnu noavygoouo >.« unchanged. Tea. Black : Tlio arrivals from Hankow comprised about 15,000 chests of principally now Oopncks, which wore being transhipped to London. The bulk of theso teas nro from good to fine, worth, according to 26th May prices, from Is 8d to 2s per lb, but it is ex tremely probablo tlio.v will cost considerably in ndvnnoo of theso figures. Actual sales in Shanghai do not cotnpriso inoro than 600 packages of common congous nt tls, lGi to 2G, leaving about 4000 chests of low and common congous and common flowory pekocs on tho market. Green Tens : About 2800 hnlf-clicsts of China and 550 linif-chcsts Japan, teas liud been sottled since last advices. Tho most noteworthy feature, howover, was tho arrival of about 4500 half-ohesls, now pingsuoys, reported to bo fair averngo quality. Extra vagant rates — from tis 85 lo 37 — wero de manded by tlio teamen, which consequently put a stop to business. Tlio stock in Shanghai amounted to 5000 packages, whilst 7000 packages were reported held in Ningpo. Amoy. — Ton: Tho arrivals during tho interrnls of tho mails havo been on a largo scale, comprising 20,000 chests congou, 5000 chests souchong, 32,000 half ohests oolong, 5000 boxes Bconted teas, nnd 1800 chests flowery pokoe. Tlicso compriso tho remainder of the bulk of the Becond crop, nnd are not of a favourable quality. Tho sotflements for tho fortnight compriso 29,000 chests of congou, at rather ensier rates than wore current a fortnight since, that is, for common to flnvonry kinds. Anything abovo that maintained quotations last given. Tlio followingisn resume of transactions : — Congou, 29,000 chests, vory low ordinary dust to coin- ' inon, 8.7 to 15.7 laols ; good common to fia- ' voury, 18.2 to 2.37 do; good il-ivoury to kuisow, 25.2 to 27.2 do ; fine, 28.2 to 3D. 2 do ; souchong, 3250 eliests, 21.7 to 36.7 do ; flbwery pekoe, 1170 do; 32.7 to 40.7 do ; oolong 1180 halPcIicsts, 17.2 to 23 7 doy scented teas, 300 boxes, 24.2 to 34':2 do.

Hatatia. — Iniclligenco-ftom this-settlement has reached us to the 31sWuly : — The heavy and continued rains wero pro ducing much damage on tfto:sugar catatc-Lind wot less- to tho second orops-of rice, .rendering the-eiKirts which- were being mado in' tlio pre viously inundated districts So- avert tHo threat ened1 scarcity, fcy replanting tho fields,, of no avail. Tho distress thereby likely ta. be pro duced1 will probably bo aggravated by nn- in creasing want of the means off transport), partly caused By a decrease of draught cattle; and partly by tlio ir.creaso of tho prodaoo te-bo carried awny. Tlie numerous- planters- in tho interior- cannot send down, their sugar and cofiue to tho coast, from tho- oomplbto-absence of the mesne of transport. Tho-rico wliioh tho Government wishes to send! to theso places where a total want of mod' prevails oan scarcely be taken, there from: tho some cause. And even when this difficulty, is ovsacorac, in acme cases the cost of transport D-oqpal to tlie- value of tho article conveyed.
