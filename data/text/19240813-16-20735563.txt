ITAULAN SETTLERS. The one thing about the confer- ence of the New Settlers' League that is unworthy of public endorsement was the preamble of a resolution in which the Italian settlements in the North wore described as " a grave menace." Why such a reference was introduced is difficult to understand, and still moro difficult to understand why it aroused no pointed objection. How do these Italian settlers become a menace ? Surely it is better that they should have possession of their farms, adding to the wealth of the nation, than that the land should be left to the jungle. The Italians carne here, strangers lo the country and its climate, ignorant of the language and of its laws, and they have co-operated, and aro still co- operating, in their efforts to make homes. It is true they are not nearly so valuable as British immigrants, and not so assimilablo as people of French, German, or Danish nationalities. But any white com- munity that is opening up tho country, endeavouring to develop its industries, and adding to the wealth of the nation, cannot be described as " a grave menace." Our White Aus- tralia policy is based on the principle that racial unity is essential to national unity and to national pro- gress; but there are no strongly marked divergent national or physical characteristics to prevent the Italian from becoming a useful citizen. In the eyes of some people his crime ap- pears to be his unusual energy, and his willingness to face pioneering hardships. But that does not make him "a grave menace."
