Ou hearing this he thinks he wilt not have an operation without making further inquiries. However, his friends hear of his illness nnd visit him ; and one advises him not to consent to an operation, and says, "I think lean find a person who can cure you wiLhout operation." ThU friend called nr. our establish ment, and asked, "Is it really a fact that you can euro hydatids without operation ?" Hois assured that it is a fact that anyone, young or old, suffering from hydatids can bo cured without oiK?raf.ion. lie goes to his siek friend with the glad tidings, nnd induces him to try our treatment, which he docs, with the result that in two or three weeks he finds himself rapidly improving : I hen it Is that he or she (whichever tho enso may be) realises that It is pocsiblu in euro hydatids without operation, & fact which every doctor we have heard of fa reluctant to ndmR, and it is then that thu light of confidence shines within them, and beams forth upon other sufferers. Ilaw many hundreds have I cured of hydatids during my fourteen yean' experiuueo in treating that disease in Victoria, ami have uot had one failure to my knowledge). Then the question arises, why do not tho publio who suffer from that complaint get themselves cured without tho risk of an operation ? The answer is, simply because they have not sufficieat confidence, nnd would sooner believe what their doctors say, "There is no cure except by operation." But if I, who found out the siraplu means ot curing it without operation and by herbs alono, had been a doctor, the public would then have rushed after me to get my treatment at a very high price. I have removed hydatids from all parts of the body, both In childrcu and adults, and in every coso I have been successful. I may hero mention that the older the patient the longer it takes to euro them. Mr. George Earl, of Inverleigh, was treated and cured by me in August, 1892, and I am informed that he has not had the slightest signs of tho trouble return ing. Mr. Kregiier, of Bendigo, was first operated upon before going under my treatment, and for a great many months had a tube in his side, which was agrcatincon- venlonce to him. He, liko many others, had very littio hope that I could cure him: but, to his agreeable sur prise, in about two months he was perfectly cured, nnd has since recommended many others, who are also cured, to their own and others' satisfaction. I may add that in many cases of other diseases when an operation is pro posed, which may be necessary— but I would advise that every tnraos should be used to restore the patient before an operation is resorted to. For instance:— I cured a lady who had been operated upon for Ulceration of the Liver. Aftor the first operation the doctors said that another one would be necessary before she could re cover, but we must defer it for a time until you get stronger; but finding she was getting weaker and fast approaching her grave, sho was advised and decided to try Mentiplay'8 Liver and Kidney I'ills, and after taking them for one week she began rapidly to recover, and eight weeks saw her in perfect health aod strength. How many other diseases can bo cured by simple means, such as Eczema, Barber's Itch, Liver and Kidney Complaints, Erysipelas, Blood Poisoning, Indigestion, Scurvy, Bad Legs, Marasmus in children, &c.; In fact- 1 can cure nil curable diseases when all other treatments have failed. I may also mention that Mentiplay's Worm . Syrup is not only reliable for rcmovingworms of all kinds, but for curing innny other diseases of children and 1 adults.
