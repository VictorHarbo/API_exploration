Whether our object be attained by nnuuxution, or by the establishment of a protectorate, is not material. The end and aim must be to prevent such an occupation as would become a standing mennce to our peacclul shores, and also to avert an lnllltiation of emin nais into our colony, the olleets of which have already been experienced by UB " His lixcellency's observations on the Bubjeet will be re echoed throughout the length and breadth of Victoria. Writing from Port Vila, New Hebrides, under date August 28, the special corre spondentof The Argua ("The Vagabond") sends another of Ins highly interesting letters. Ula contribution deals principally with the products of that portion of the group Referring to the labour question, The Vagabond says -"The natives work comparatively well now, looking forward to the end of their three years, when they will go home rejoicing m muskets, and beads, and tobacco If the labour trade is ever true slavery, it ia theoretically BO here in the New Hebrides, where the hands are re- cruited without Government agent or formal contract, and where their trcntment, and the fulfilment of promises made to them, depend on tho goodwill of their employ era-where, inflict, 'they have no rights which a white man is bound to respect,'-where there is neither government, nor law, nor acts ot Parliament or Congress Yet, to the credit of the managers ol the New Hebrides Com- pany and other planters 1 have visited, 1 lind everywhere the ' hands ' well fed and con- tented, not too hard worked, and that for only Bix days m the week. What moro could lixeter-hall ask for'" "The Vagabond " also speakB of the dislike which the natives every, wheic have for those hailing from France. Taking pasBage by a labour vessel, "The Vagabond" arrived at Townsville, Queens laud, on the 2nd mst In our last summary the return was an- nounced of The Argus special expedition to New Guinea. Captain Armit, its leader, and Mr. Loftus Irving, his second in command, have since been received at a special meet- ing of the Johnsonian Club, Brisbane, when congratulatory speeches were de- livered. Captain Armit is continuing his series of contributions to our pages, his latest being written at Manadoubi on the 10th of last August. His letter is brimful of very readable information concerning the customs of the natives, the products of the country he passed through, the birds that came under his observation, &c.; Speaking of the deeply lamented Professor Denton, Captain Armit writes:-"Professor Denton seems to have won the good opinion of Binori. The old chief threw his arms round him, and actually hugged him in an ecstacy of friendly ardour. The professor was rather taken aback at first by this unwonted form of salutation, but he laughed heartily, which so encouraged the old chief that he repeated the performance, and there were the learned professor and the barbarian indulging in a reciprocal embrace, to the infinite amusement of the assembled women and children. Binori's comical old phiz, surmounted by a very much battered felt hat, peering gleefully over Mr Denton's shoulder, a broad grin extending his mouth from ear to ear, and exposing an immense red cavern-the result of betel chewing-set us all laughing until our sides ached."
