On arriving at Fremantle, the .captain notified the Cus toms authorities o£ the German's, presence, and entered into the required bond of £100, as Germans are prohibited immi grants. 'The aid of the police was sought to place. the man in safe keeping during the vessel's stay in port.. He j had been allowed his freedom up to that point, and it was found. he: had made good use .;of it, for a diligent search falied to reveal him. The vessel came on to Port Adelaide, and it was; thought there' might be a chance that he was hiding on the ship. Customs officials boarded the steamer at Port Ade laide, bat the master stated that since they left Fremantle, some of his crew had stated that they saw, the man ashore at that port. As there was no photograph of him obtainable, it appears as though the captain has lost his £100 bond, for there seems to be little chance of the man's arrest.
