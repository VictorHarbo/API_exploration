SATURDAY, AUGUST 28, 18S0. -??. In any immediate revision of our elec- toral system the question of boundaries will Lave to be discussed, if only on accountof the great Bhiftingof population which is taking place. Formerly the goldfields were the disturbing element, but now the rush to agricultural areas is a now source of change. Though the presont Electoral Act was only passed m 1876, already some of the districts established under it have been seriously depleted, and others, such as Moira and the Wimmera, have witnessed au astonishing growth Experience has proved also that the act of 187G is in itself eminently dofectiv e Many of its districts are ill constituted They aro composed of liicoiigiuous elements, and complaints aie constant that one division is disfranchised by the action 01 anothei 1 veij session since 1^76 has seen a Boundanes Bill before the House, and it is of some nnpoitauce that a pim ciple should be laid down on which P ir liament, in cases of disputo moy ict Of course pioportionil repiesentation would cure the ovil of divisional dis franchiscment once and for all ^\ o see no reason why such a scheme as the cumulative vote of Illinois should not be ititioduced at once into our sjstem as it stands The arrangement that m a double con stituency the electoi shall have two votes to use as he likes, and m a treble constituency shall have thieo votes to use as he likes, dividing the two or three v otes if he so pleases among two or three men, or giving them to one man, is simplicity itself, and in a rude but effectual way it provides foi the io piescntation of minorities In lit/roj, for instance, the electois vote in round numbers 1,800 on the radical side and 1,600 on the constitutional Under the cumulative sjstem the íadicals would have a total of 3,600 votes, and the con stitutionalists of 3,200, and the majority, it is clear, could not seat two men If they tried, the poll would be as foi lows - A Constitutional 3 200 B Radical 1800 C Kadical 1800 The return of A would be ceitam, and the radicals would go to the poll simply to decide whether B or C should repie sent them In West Melbourne, on the othei hand, the constitutional majority is as 2,000 to 1,700, and the constitu tionalists could not win both seats If they ran two candidates, the result must be A Radical 3 400 B Constitutional 2 000 C Constituttoual 2 000 Each side would secure a man The Constitutional party, we feel ceitam, will never consent to any change of pimciple ni oui electoi al system-such as sunendeiiiig the pluial vote-unless propoitional îepresentation is conceded ihatwill be the ultimatum of the party But taking the system as it is, boundary changes aie inevitable, and in dealing w ith the existing grievances of ill assorted union", it will be important to decide whether in the interests of fair play double and ti ebie electorates should be maintained oi whether single electorates should be invariably established We aie aware that at one time the opinion was generally entertained that the minority was better piotected m large constituencies than in small, but e\ penence would seem to establish that the contrary is the case What we have learned is that mon of a particular class and of a particular sentiment generally live together, and that the smaller the subdivision the better the chance of local feeling being îepie sented At piesent we have 29 single electo rates, 21 double, and 5 treble, and the seats are claimed as follows - Ministry i Opposition bingle electorates Double Treble Total Hie single electorates in then repre sentation reflect public opinion most faithfully, the double next, and the treble aie the most out of accord of all In such of the double electorates as were contested, the gross voting iu July last was as follows - Ministerial Opposition Majority Votes 3jS13 3317J 2134 Slombera 12 The unfairness is obvious, and we may run rapidly over the list of the constituencies to show where it exists In Ballarat East sometimes the seats aie divided and sometimes not, but weie the constituency cut into two a seat to each paity would be a certainty In W est Bouike the case is still stionger Sometimes, as now, the radicals sweep the two seats by vntue of then majo rity at Blackwood, and sometimes, as in February last, the constitutionalists secuiebothby virtue of their strength in the eastern poition of the district If the constituency weie divided, Heming ton and Essendon would be nb'e to nominate a constitutional member alwajs, and on the othei hand Bacchus Muish and Blackwood would have a fair show of letuiiung the othei In Castlemaine the town itselt inclines to the constitutional side, but the minéis of Chewton not only seat then own man, but they systemati cally unpo°e a second membei on the citj Emerald hill is anothei case in point The Albeit paik distnct is undoubtedly constitutional, but the "laira bank voters flock to the poll in the opposite inteiest, return then own membei, and force a hostile repiesenta tivL upon the othei division lit/ioyis in the same position Hie man whom South 1 lt/ioj has foin tunes olected is Mr C li Blickhi, yet Noith Fit^ioy first seals Mi i u ku , and then nu poses Mi V\ir on the dissentients In \\\ cot Melbourne theie is a continued strife between the St 1'itiicks division and the R ulway div lsion, and sometimes the one is disfranchised and sometimes the othei, while it is ceitam that the Constitutional paity could win in the one single electoi ate and th it the 1 adical I nty could tnumpli in the othei A division of East Melbourne into two electoi ites would also pi ice the îadital pirtj in a bettei position than thoj n^w occupj Alona now le tunis two Ministeual membeio, but a division cf the constituency would Oivo the W anyratta side to the constitu tionalists In Richmond, the position is most un^atisfactoij A hue diawn thiouLji the distnct would Oivo aiadical electoiateto the east, and a shorn, con stitutional electorate to the w eat '1 he two electoi ates have nothing in common, and now an unseemly struggle neces sanly occurs, with the result that sometimes Richmond East is disfran clnsed, and sometimes Richmond West A division would insure peace and proper íepiesentation lu Rodney, two constitutionalists have sat for yeais, and yet there has not been a liundrod votes between the two parties, and division o£ tho electorate would certainly give tita minority a lepiesentative In the treble constituencies theie ara still more glaring anomalies The cou stituencies aro Geelong, Creswick, Mia durang, Sandhurst, Ballarat West, and the tablo of results is Ministerial Opposition Majorit) In Geelong the constitutionalists would alwajs take a seat, for Geelong North one half the electorate-returns Mr C Anduws by a majority of neailj two to one Divide Mandurang, as m alL fairness it should be, into one mining con stituencj, with 1 aglehawk as its contre, and into two agricultural electorates and the constitutionalists would talca tw o scats, and the radicab one, whereas now they aie excluded altogether On the othei hand, while it is clear tint the îadicah aie entitled to a seat m Sandhurst, jet in 1 ebruary they were shut out fiom any lakmg the voting of Tilj Ug3a basis, it appears that if the electo lates had been divided the coostitu timahsts would have obtained five seat* in the double constituencies and three in the treble, and the radicals would havo gained two m the double districts Parties would theu stand m the Houso os 41 to 45, and that result is tolerably near to the voting m the country, whick was about 03,000 to GG.000 To insuie justness, a scientific system of pio portional îepiesentation is requited, but pending that complete refoim, prac tical politicians may find it well worth then while to inquire whethei fairer results aie not obtained when each locality is left to elect its own indi vidual member than when there is in terference on the part of adjoining districts As our readers are aware, a new board has been appointed to inquire into the cucumstances attending the dealings of the Railway department with Messrs Bain and Son. The gentlemen who replace Messrs. Munro, Rogers, and Blyth, are Messrs. Sinclair, Johnson, and Fulton. The scope of the intended inquiry is of the most limited extent. Most of the matters disclosed in Mr. Higinbotham's well remembered memorandum are with drawn from consideration. An investigation of the system pursued by Mr. Woods and his satellites is not contemplated, the simple question submitted being - are the charges made in the account now in suspense fair equivlents for the work done and goods supplied, after making allowance for any circumstances which can fairly be held to justify an advance on current market rates? In fact, the procceding will virtually take the form of an arbitration between the Government and the firm whose account is challenged. Notwithstanding what has taken place in Parliament, Mr. Patterson has come to the conclusion that the matter has no political significance, that it is only a tradesman's dispute with his office, and therefore the press will not be represented at the inquiry. It will be remembered that when Mr. Higinbotham's memorandum, disclosing gross irregularities, and inferentially suggesting the possibility of something worse, was read in the Assembly, a wish was generally expiessed for a thorough and searching inquiry, not only into the merits of the particular account the non settlement of which led to Mr. Nimmo's very fruitful question, but also into all matters which would lay bare the system of expenditure which obtained under Mr. Woods's .management Mr Ricii vedsoy, a member of the present Ministry, " hoped " that the Government would consent to ' have the commission appointed, so " thal the i hole of the infot malton. " lo be obtained might be laid befoie the "House/ and when Mr GiLLirs stated that he " had no objection to an inquiry " that would elicit the uhole oí tlu " fads, ' the announcement was received with seeming satisfaction There caa be no nustal o as to what is at stake in the settlement of this qucotiou Mr Higiniiohmm s memo does not make any duect chaige a^unst Mr Toitu, but sufhcient was disclosed m the memoiandum to show that a state ot aflairs had existed in ono of the principal depaitments of the state which if it had not led to abuses, was at all events as suggestive of ¡,nvo lnegulaiities as anjthing well could be C ndei these cucumstances wo cannot see how Mr Iaittrson has been led to imagino that a meie aibi tration over the items ot a bill foi ¿oods furnished or work and laboui done, will satisfy the House and the lui lie We cannot quit the matter without pointing out that even if Mr. Patterson was right in regarding this grave public scandal as an ordinary trade dispute, he has not taken care of the interests of the state in selecting a board No doubt the gentlemen he has chosen are of the highest respectability, and we may rest assured that they will endeavour to discharge the duty devolving upon them with the utmost impartiality and fairness. But with the very best intentions, how will it be possible for them to avoid leaning in some measure towards their fellow tradesmen? They are all engaged, or have been engaged, in the same business as Messrs. Bain and Son, and we ask, without at all wishing to say anything offensive, whether it is fair to the public to commit what is virtually an arbitration entirely to such hands.? One of the gentlemen named, and a tiustwoithy expert in Government em llojmcnt, presided ovei b) an nide lendent business man of well known pubity and independence, would have formed a satisfactoiy board fti the small« pin ate inqiiny winch Mi T \11 r i sois has unw îsely deteimined to hold, but one consisting of thiee con ti actors m csbc or m po not command guieial confidence Wa cannot help thinking that Mi l'ArrfT son has made a mistake m tho way ha has treated this mattet, and we logiot that a gentleman who is «edited with consideiable administrative ability should have failed to form a ti nar estimate of what was required to satisfy the public mind The defence that is set up foi Sab batauamsm ought to convince eveiy ona that the cjueaUu ia ripe, for reconsidera votes 11781 10 »19 Member« 11 ' tion When we are assured that our iccent sketch of the Puritan Sabbath ia a caricature and misrepresentation of the Viotonan Sunday, we can only reply that that is the very essence of oui argument 'Sha Victorian Sunday is an anomaly In spite of the lurking presence of the Sabbatarian idea, wo have opened cei tam public institutions By what leason can we open the gardens and closo the Library? 'Ihe Sabbath, btrictly speaking, has becomo an impossi flinty We cannot retrace oin steps, and leturn to a strict Sabbatarianism , und therefore wo must rest the obsor canco of Sunday on a new basis We tnust determino by some rational pim Eiplo which of our public mstitu tions aie to bo oponed and which Bre to be closed If wo cannot teturn to that conception of Sunday ivhich pronounces eveiy pie îsure a flcadl) sin, and threatens cvciy smihn¿ Taco with eternal perdition, we must Ecuouslj ask, what is tho toil giound foi the obseivanee of Sunday, and how can the daj bo best observed ? Hie Soulh'') n Cioss, indeed, is of oiinion that the library and museums belong to the Sabbath keeping majority, and not to the minority-as it is kiiciously pleased to say-of " anti « Sabbatarian fanatics " That journal is filled with deop indignation at our presumption in questioning the estab fished oidor Does it really believe that the community is nothing more than the baie majority of votes ? Has it liev ei heard of the rights of labour or the rights of property ? Lven should the Sabbatarians bo m the majouty, ivhich we strongly doubt, we should ttill advocate the opening of the fubhc Libiarj, because it is our duty to insist that men have every fair oppor tumty foi developing then intellectual faculties M o claim that those members of the community who are interested m intellectual and aesthetic matters should tiave fair scope To force them into idleness, to depriv e them of those highest recreations which are powerful organs of iustiuction on the one day which they possess, is a grievous wrong But what shall we say of the cynical gospel that is preached with a cool tfiionteiy The rich man may do as he lileases,becausehislibrary,andgarden,and piano are his own The anti Sabbatarian is not allowed the same privilege Is there any difference between private and pub lie morality % If we allow men without lebuke to enjoy certain recreations, be cause they can afford them- recreations which are universally believed to be the most beneficial of all- would religion Joe at all endangered by offering similar opportunities to those who are not for túnate enough to command them? *. Anti Sabbatarian fanatics ' though »ve be, we urge the opening of the library and the provision of becoming jrablic recieations, on the ground that it is oui duty to offer every man an oppor tumty for the best use of his faculties V e do not care to commit ourselves to a laisse fane view of life Weie it not loi the pious professions of the Southe) >i doss, we should doubt if that were a lehgious view If the Jewish Sabbath were íecognised as an essential part of Christianity, we could understand the attitude of the Sabbatanans But when we are told that ¡Sunday is a witness for something highei than the ordinary business and laboui of the woild, "of a highei life than is 1 ' know ii to time or sense, ' then we must ask, does the present Sunday, with its slow, languid hours and nairow ex ilusiv eness, fulfil that idea 1 Once tho !Puiitans were almost forbidden to Jbreathe Go» s free air on Sunday Will the da) be less pleasant or less profit- able if vv e now throw open to them the «i eatest monuments of human genius? We tiave no desire that any man should be made unnecessarily to work on Sunday , we have as little de»ne to see the peace ful domestic character of the day changed But we must remember that theie is a large population m this city S\ho have no home life What has been piovided f a them on Sundays 1 What icfining and elevating employment do »ve oflei to our joung men foi the long Ü10U13 ?

commissioners, military and naval officers, Executiv e Councillors, &.c , should make a point of appearing in them on each OLcasion Attention to this point of etiquette will not only add greatly to

ed from Afghanistan is very serious Ever since the British Government declared m favour of Abdur Rahman's claims the friends of the ex Ameer, \akoob Khan, have been steadily increasing in number, and it has been freely stated that even if the British nominee could establish himself in the capital, he would find it difficult to hold his own against the national patty, which supports his cousin Only a few weeks ago thousands of Afghans favour ableto Yakoobassembled at Haitian, under the command of influential Ghilzai chiefs, but the energetic action of Sir Donald Stewart caused their temporary dispersion The withdrawal of the British forces from the vicinity of Cabul lias encouraged the discontented portion o the population to rise again and it is reported that large numbers of the Ameer's troops have openly avowed their intention of sup porting Yaltoob and Ins brother Ayoub If this be true it may bo necessary for the English to re occupy Cabul again The situation is rendered still more
