Robertson, plumber, gastittcr and bellhanger, 434 Law Courts-place. Melbourne, in a letter, 22nd Sep tember. 1896, says Previous to 1893 I suffered severely from indigestion, and was never free from headaches and Kalns across my chest. I dreaded when meal dine came, nowing the pain 1 would have to endure. I tried several remedies front doctors and chemist, and tho relief was only of a temporary nature, so finally was induced to try Warner's Safe Cure and Pills, and when I had consumed throe bottles I felt a new man, and ran now enjoy my meals without fear. I ran thoroughly recommend It to anyone sufferlngas I did, and may add that I have never bad any return of the symptoms since." Send postAl card to Warner's Safe Oure Co..
