The 'Estey' Is the STANDARD by which salesmen seek to sell their (inferior) organs. 'Just as good as the Estey' is heard on every hand, but unconsciously every use of that argument is a compliment to and a recognition of the proud position occupied alone by the Estey Organ. The great reputation enjoyed by the Estey Organ is very largely due to their 'TONE.' This has always been their distinguishing feature, bnt wonderful strides have been made during _, the last ten years. PERFECTION IN DETAILS Is a prominent feature of the Ettey Organ. Constant and un* Itting eare is exercised by skilled inspectors all experts in their different branches. _ The STANDARD OF THE ESTEY has never been lowered, bnt is to-day, as it always hag been, the very highest in the market, whether refe rence is had to their organs of smallest propor tions and compass or to their largest two ynfrTi^fti Ohureh Organs.
