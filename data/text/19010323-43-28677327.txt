"It is impossibleto throw ofl_ that terrible depression; and theTe is no amhltion It work. But there is a -way whereby you may again be strong and -rigorous.

A statement was r_e.-i_-.r pnl.^lie.l th it it waa prjbib'.o the Imperial Oaverumcnt wnald consult tlu authorities in Aust?t'L about a batch of Boer war prisoners being sent ti these shore*.

ITS A HANLT ACT. A CAMPERDOWX CITIZEN ' SPEAKS FOX THE BENE FIT OF OTHERS. ! A plain straightforward statement. . A grriteful acknowledgement of help. \ Telling a personal experience. Making it i üblic for the public good. It's a miniy act. i Its manly because it helps others. 1 So miny people hive been misled. So tnanv claims made that were not ' true. " - j A Camperdown man speaks here. : Speak., in the interests of humanity. ; Removes the stumbling block of doubt.' Ko b_r:er proof can be had. Mr. J. \V. Bart-,coachbuilder,Meikle- : John- street, Caniperdown, states: — ; *' Daring the past three or four winters my back has given me terrible trouble. When I say winters I mean this was; whan it w.l-5 worst, but it ached all the \ year round. A pain sis always in the small of my back, and sometimes it was so severe I hai t. knock off work. Having a lut of hiring "tvhsn working, t j do, it ssemed to come ajiinst me a great deal, and it was the same when bending my hick and turning or t listing about, < all these movements being detrimental ; to my back. All eli.rts tv get rid of my j trouole proved unavailing,' until at j length I read an advertisement about ] Down's Backache Kidney Pills; these"l j procured at Peterson's pharmacy. Ihad | only taken half a box of them when I was cored. It was simply astonishing tbe way this remedy took hold of my ailment and cleared it right out of my system. I regirded my recovery as something wonderful." Djan's B^kache Kidney pills always ' have the picture of a leaf on the wrapper. ' In askirg for this remedy see that you j get the fame which Jlr. Burtt naed, and i see that the leaf is on the wrapper. D.iati's Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all chemists and storekeepers at 2/9. p it boi (six boxes 153), or will be post _d on receipt of price by the proprietars, Fost;r-ll'Clel!aa Co., c/u Rocke, Tomp sitt ci- Co., £92 Flinders-street, Mel bourne.

WOIK IN A COACH FACTORY \- ,^ ■ ♦ To the ordinary "mind, cuachbuilding would *eem -a trade possessing no special disabilities, but that this is a mistake is interestingly shown by Mr. Geor?e Fieldii.g, coachhuilder, of St. Arnaud. \- \ x Ir^ ■■ " A coachbuilder's. life," said he, when ; interviewed, "is attended .by ni'jre danger than one would fancy, ouing t-i the sudden changes of temper ature, occasioned by his drawirg the red hi.t iron work from the fire in the heated furnace room and immediately selling lo wcrfe on it in the draunbty open jard, where it is fitted 10. the frame work. In my case these" sudden changes caused prostration and debility. My appetite deserted me. I became very thin, and I could not sleep at night- My work was radly interfered with, for when I nse in the morning I was totally unfit for it; on some days I Was too ill to even lift a tool. Despite ! medicines, and the attention of a skilful doctor, I did net recover, a One day I , read of a person who was in a similar j plii_bt, who had been cured by'Br. [Williams* pink pills for pale people. I { tried them and after taking two boxes I felt stronger, and my nerves seemed j braced up. Sis boxes cured me. Since j then my former vigour has returned, I 1 h?ve put on flesh, and the trying condi tions of my trade have caused no re lapse." When the nerves "want bracinsr, and the constitution is weak, Dr. Williams' pink ypills awT. invaluable, as in ~ Mr. Fielding's Cisc. By re toning the .nerves and purifying and enriching the blood 'they care .-.uremia, debility, dyspepsia, insomnia, neuralgia, skin diseases, St. Vitus' dance, consumption, bronchitis, . dysentery, etc Sold by chemists and itirekeepers, and by the Dr. yWilliams*" Medicine Co., c/o Rocke, Tompsitt & Co., Flinders-street, Mel bourne, two and nine per box, six boxes fifteen and three, post free.
