AN AUSTRALIAN IN LONDON. (From Our Correspondent.) INSCRIPTION OF AUSTRALIAN LOAN, STOCK. I LONDON, Sep 8-The joint repre- sentations made by Mr Coghlan and Sir Horace Tozer to the Bank of England with a view to securing a reduction in the average cost of manag- ing the New South Wales and Queensland loans has been met by the bank authori- ties in an uncompromising spint They are, in fact, "quite unable to accede to the request which has been made" They have indicated, also, that they would be unwilling to entertain alternative pro- posals for the transference of the inscnp tion work to the State agencies if that were desired They maintain, it appears, that the published conditions under which the loans were raised constitute a standing guarantee to investors that the manage- ment shall remain in the hands of the bank during the currency of the stock. Thus, it is argued, the reputation of the bank might be damaged by a departure from the existing arrangement The mat- ter ihas not yet, however, been finally disposed of Air Coghlan has asked for another interview with the bank authon ties and Sit Horace Tozer states that there are some further points which may be urged on his side AUSlRALI VM VND CANADIAN DEILNCE SYSTEMS When returning to Australia next month Captain Collins will spend two or three weeks in studying the administrative methods of the Canadian Defence Depart- ment He has been specially directed by the Commonwealth Government to make himself acquainted, as far as possible, with the defence s)stem of the Dominion, Winch is now undergoing various improvements, and he thinks that the time allowed lum for the purpose will be well spent Ha has been in dose touch with the War Ofhce authorities since he arrived in Lng land on leave about three months ago, and he thinks it will be of some particular interest to see how far their views on colonial military questions have prevailed with those wlio aie engaged in the man ugement and development of militar) work in Canudi While there he will discuss Lieutenant Colonel M Cay s proposal for an interchange of ofheers, and he will also get some idea of the work done at the Kingston Military College The late Lieutenant-Gencial Sir \ndtew Clarke used to say that this college was one of the finest institutions of its kind in the Bntish Fmpire, and should be taken as the model of a similar school which Australia would require for the training of its olficeis In justification of his cn thusiasm for the Kingston College he pointed to the fact that its engineenng «induites wete in great request in tha United States and could ilwa)s obtain lucrative posts on completing their course RDSLRVDD Li YD FOR ENGLlbH SEI FLERS The- decision of the Lands Department of New So jill \\\ ales to reserve temporarily about fifty farms foi Lnglish emigrants with

possess barely sufficient money to pay their passages and provide them with the means of making a start on the land , naturally they wish the interval between their arnval and the beginning of productive work to be made as short as possible The) all know some- thing about red tape, and have an idea that the Australian Government depart- ments are, if not indifferent and unsym pathetic-as discontented settlers have sometimes said m letters sent home to their friends-at any 4\ife not energetically helpful The suggestion made to the "Vio torian Government b) its London repre sentative

POLITICS -The Trade Union Congress has again made it clear that it will not permit any Parhamentaiy alliance with the Liberal peu ty If the Labour members in the next Parliament favoui any combination for fighting purposes it will probabl) be a combination with the Nationalists who are equally distrustful of the two- princi pal parties, )et equally read) to vote with either when a practical advantage can be gained by doing so Mr Sexton, the pre sident of the Trade Congress, says that both Tories and Liberals have used the working classes as tools and ' by mutual arrangement shaies both the political and industrial plundei He shares with other trade i epi esentatives a settled resentment at the failure of the Liberals to do any thing for Labour inteiests when the failure of the trade

capacity of the English market for butter which can be sold at moderate rates Some of the great energ) they are now exhibiting as expor ters mi) no doubt be attnbuted to the «?teadv supply of information and prac tical advice which they have been receiv ing of late from the commercial agents of the Dominion it Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, and other country centres where the consumers are
