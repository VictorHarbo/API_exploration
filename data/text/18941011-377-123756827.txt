PaNY's. -(Anv.) 23.6 AN advertisement in our last issue, calling for tenders for the erection of a two-storeyed brick building in Brisbane street, attracted more than ordinary notice, because it is quite refreshing, in these dull times, to find business people with sufficient enterprise and sufficient confidence to invest their money in the erec- tion of new premises of so substantial a character as those indicated in the announce- ment alluded to. The new building is, we understand, intended for Mr. F. Goleby, saddler, and will be erected on the site on which the office of Mr. G. B. Gill now stands, this property having been purchased by the former gentleman at the recent sale of the late Mr. S. Shenton's properties. Mr. G. B. Gill is the architect, and he has succeeded in designing a building which, when completed, will be a creditable addition to the architecture of the town. The premises, which, as we have said, are to be of brick, will have a frontage to Brisbane-street of 21ft., and will extend some 45ft. down the property. A cellar, 6ft. 6in. deep, is provided for, and the shop itself will be 13ft. high from floor to ceiling, with a double frontage, containing five large plate-glass windows, 9ft. high, in which there will be ample apace for the proprietor to display the wares of his trade. There is also to be a side entrance passage up to the first floor, while the upper storey will be available for the holding of lodge meetings or small public gatherings, it being intended to have this portion of the building so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for such assem- blages. The balcony will be 8ft. wide, a stair- case giving access to and from it, whilst pro- vision is also made for the usual shop balcony and sun-shade. The front of the premises are to be surmounted by a parapet wall, with cornice, and the whole of the front will be cemented. The building will be a handsome addition to the business premises of the town, and we have little doubt that, when he occupies it, Mr. Goleby will reap the reward which his enterprise deserves. Tenders for the work close on Thursday next, the 18th instant. The Lockyer Star states that it is understood that Mr. M. Hohenhaus bhas been appointed to the charge of the Bimrslide State School. This gentlemen is well-konwn in and around this town. He is, webelieve, a native of West Ipewibch, and was for a number o ynears teach ing under Mr. ?John Soott at the East Ipswich school.
