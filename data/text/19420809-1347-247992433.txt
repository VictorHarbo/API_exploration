PRODUCTION Dressed fir in his Right Job m Again & again, for - six months, the scene has been repeated in war plants all over the countrv. A fall, lumbermg, grey-thatched man with a quizzical look and three silver stars of a lieut-general quietly strolls in. Quietly he walks up & down the production lines, looking hard, say ing little. Sometimes he stops, shows a workman how to handle a tool- more smooth! vj. Sometimes he re-routes a whole Tine. He leaves without fuss, flies on to the next plant, the thanks of produc tion bosses ringing after him. Lieut.-Gen. William S Knudsen is a happy man again. The Danish immigrant who rose to be General Motors production boss— but who. as half-boss of ill-fated- Office of Pro duction Management seemed to be a squarehead in a round hole — is work- in? hard at a job he likes. Lieut.-Gen. Knudsen started his tireless jaunt Feb. 1. three days after the President put him in uniform as Army. Production Director. He has been to 350 plants in nearly 100 cities and towns; has flown 55,000 miles over the US. has talked to thou- sands of ' Americans about their work. In six swift months. Knudsen has had an experience that would make any land-conscious American poet desperately envious. No poet of words, he is the kind of American who fingers shiny, greasy machines with a conscious, tactile pleasure — and because he loves machines they seem to work well far him.
