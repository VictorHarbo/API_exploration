FEDERAL BUDGET. MAIN ROADS DEVELOPMENT. £1,500,000 CUSTOMS LEVY ON MOTORISTS. £20.000,000 HOUSING PLAN PROMISED. YEAR'S TRIAL OF PER CAPITA PROPOSALS. Dr. Page (Treasurer) delivered his fourth I consecutive Budget statement in the House of Representatives yesterday. Only one other Federal Treasurer can claim the record. The speech was longer than usual. Dr. Page began at five minutes past 3 o'clock, and ended at 25 minutes, past 4 o'clock. He was listened, to by a full attendance of members, and the public galleries were crowded. There was a remarkable absence of interjections. The Budget included a heavy increase in Customs duties, so Dr. Page had so to deliver his speech that he did not disclose the new duties until 4 o'clock, when they became immediately in force. The increases were kept a close secret so that there would be no withdrawals from bond to escape the duty. After questions were dealt with the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) moved that motions on notice should be deferred to allow the delivery of the Budget staff Tiierjt, and that an amount of time equal to that taken for the Budget should be allowed for motions on notice in the evening. Early Presentation of Budget. Dr. Page began by saying that he was pleased to be able to present the Ministry's financial proposals within the first eight days of the financial year. The early presentation of the Budget gave Parliament full opportunity to exercise its control of the finances and enabled the commercial, trading, and industrial community to make early provision for taxation. Hitherto it had been considered impossible to deliver the Budget until about the end of July, but he had decided to dispense with less important details, and he hoped that his practice which was supported by the practice of the Chancellor of the Kx chequer-would become the established practice of the Commonwealth. The early presentation would be of great value to members in discussing proposed legisla- tion dealing with the adjustment of financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. A further revision had been made of the form of presentation of accounts. Surplus of £2,786,944. Dr. Page continued his speech as follows: The chief increases in the actual expenditure in 1925-26 over the estimates are as follow:- ? , ' ''. , interest and sinking fund on war loans, war' pensions, and other war services . £311,40,') .

This amount, with surplus of £659,529 brought forward, gave an accumulated surplus of £2,786,944. Of this amount £2,500,000 was expended in anticipation of surplus, leaving a surplus remaining of £286,944. The main increases in the expenditure on war services are in connection with in clent on war loans and was pensions the estimated interest was based on the assumption that on the conversion of the £67 000 000 war loan in December last, only one half year's interest at the in milked late would fall due for payment within the year The convulsion loan however, was floated with the right of contributors of new money to reten c interest from the date of their subscriptions T\ ar pensions exceeded the estimate by £143,604 The estimate for invalid and old age pensions expenditure Mas calculated on the basis that the increased pension of 2/6 a week would come into operation in January Increased payments operated from last September The effect of the wine export bounty, together with preference Ki anted by Great Britain enabled Australian in manufacturers to compete with continental wines even more successful than was anticipated 'the bounty actually paid due to the increased export was therefore £172,109 in excess of the estimate An unanticipated amount of £28 982 was paid to the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited in accordance with the Oil Agreement Act 1926 the balance of the increase under bounties and other special appropriations is made up of iron and steel products bounty, £31,005 and sundry other increases and decreases Of the increase in Treasury expenditure, £38,183 is for minting: silver coin to be place British com- withdrawn from cn cn ation the actual coinage receipts due to the profit on this replacement were £207,030 in excess of the estimates For science and industry investigations £25 460 was crowded whereas when the Budget was framed it was contemplated that this amount would be paid from a trust account The increased interest on loans raised for the States results from the city wanted loan raisings being exceeded This money, is recovered from the States Disposal of the Surplus In addition to the expenditure set out above the following moneys not provided for in the Budget of 1025 26 were paid to trust fund in anticipation of a surplus in the accounts of the year - Naval construction £1,000,000 Special provision for air services 250,000 Science and Industry latest gations and endowment for scientific research 250,000 Special pan ment for debt re- demption 1,000,000 £2,500,000 There remained at the close of the year a surplus of £286,944, which it is proposed to set aside for - , Pi respecting for oil and precious metals £100,000 Im affair and old age pensions and national insurance 180,044 Increases in Revenue.

The increase in direct taxation mises almost wholly from income at the normal rate of growth of the taxable in comes 0 per cent was considerably exceeded, and the position in regard to ar team has improved Business Undertakings The receipts and expenditure of business undertakings do not show any considerable variation from the estimate The actual expenditure of the post- office was £10,654,880, lacing £38,445 in excess of the estimate, while the Rev ernie was £105 251 in excess of the estimate, the actual receipts being £10,815,261 The cost of working the Commonwealth railways was £807,122, or £3,985 below the estimate and the actual revenue was £20,345 less than the amount estimated Territories of the Commonwealth The actual expenditure on the Territories of the Commonwealth was £40,537 less than the estimate An amount of £50,000 was provided for the transfer of staffs and office equipment to the Federal Capital, the general transfer was not begun as was expected Estimated Expenditure The Budget for 1926 27 is framed in accordance with the Ministry h proposals for the readjustment of the finances as between Commonwealth and States More particular reference to these proposals will be made at a later stage When considering the expenditure to be provided for it is necessary to divide the amount into capital expenditure, which is chargeable against loan, and annually recurring expenditure, which is correctly payable out of revenue The estimated expenditure for works out of loan in 1925-26 was £10 279,014, the amount spent was £7,682,089 The items of expenditure in 1926-27 are - Land and buildings for the Postmaster General's department and construction and extension of telegraphs and telephones . £5,000,000 Commonwealth railways 1,474,500 Grafton South Brisbane railway 1,000,000 Naval bases, floating dock aviation buildings, mum tions supply buildings, and other Defence works £587,100 Advances for purchase of wire and wire-netting «. 500,000 Immigration Advances of passage money 348 380 River Murray Waters Act 252,500 Subscription to capital of Amalgamated Wireless Ltd 250,001 Sundry works of various departments 117,331 Subscription to capital of Commonwealth Oil Re- fineneB 50,000 Loan to New Guinea for works 42,085 Total £0,622,297 The expenditure on war and repatriation services, mainly war service homes is estimated at £038.202, making a total loan provision for Commonwealth expenditure of 110,500,490 It is expected that not more than £10,000,000 of this total will be required Provision is also made for " !

Increase of Gross Debt Of the greg debt at June 30 1926 £287148 652 is redeemable in Australia, £86 865 882 is due to the British Government £69 017 016 is redeemable in London and £15411487 in New York The gross debt at the beginning of the financial year 1925-26 was £430 94.8 061 the increase in the year bein-, £27, 495 075 Of this amount, i 14 543 56 was raised by the Com- monwealth for the States The gross debt also includes the recent London loan of £0 000 000 practically- all of which will be available for works to be carried out in the financial year now commencing Debt Redemption Substantial contributions were again made last year for the redemption of the public debt of the Commonwealth. The contributions from revenue were -for payment to the sinking fund, including special contribution of £1,000,000, £2 700 722, for payment to the British Government £1231723 total £4 028,445 Repay months of moneys lent by the Commonwealth amounted to £777 700 half of Commonwealth Bank profits £226 176 reparation moneys received under the treaty of peace with Germany £302 921 interest on investments £83 950 contributions by States in respect of loans raised on their behalf by Commonwealth £76 711 The amount made available in 1925 26 for the redemption of debt was £5 495 909 Since the establishment of the national debt sinking fund less than three years ago a total of £20 067 040 has been applied to the redemption of debt, Under the arrangements we have now made the area silver is compelled to find i avenue for payment into the sinking fund at such a rate as will repay all the debt existing at the formation of the fund in not more than 50 years from that time, also he must Provide revenue moneys to repay his new borrowings within not more than 50 years after the year in which the new borrowing occurs the use of sinking fund moneys m repurchasing our securities on the main ket has a beneficial effect in maintaining their price In this way our credit is improved and future loans will be floated at a rate of interest lower than that which would in other circumstances be obtain- able Debts of the States. The latest particulars available of the public debt of the States are those for June 30, 1925 when the debts were -Ven South Wales, £215131,110 "v Victoria £ 128 445 505 Queensland £90 389 007 South Australia £74 780 835. VA eastern Australia, £64 493 261 Tasmania £23 894 416 total £003 334 254 these amounts represent the cross debts without any de lue tion for the substantial revenue producing assets constructed by the States with the loan moneys raised in Australia most public utilities are provided by the State Governments whereas mother countries these scr v es are in a much larger measure provided by private enterprise or this reason the public debts of the Australian States are of a nature different from those of most other countries In 1924-25 the State undertakings in Australia mo duced a net revenue of £19 400 080 which represents the earnings available for the payment of interest on the debt The State sinking funds amount to £18 630 051 On all loans now raised by the Commonwealth for the States an annual sinking fund payment of 10/ per cent is made by the States to the national debt sinking fund of the Commonwealth Commonwealth and State Debts Omitting debts which are included both in the Commonwealth and in the State debts the gross debt of the Commonwealth at June 30 1929 and the States at June 30 1925 was £990 642 419 From this there may be deducted sums held in cash by the Commonwealth sinking funds and moneys to be repaid in cash in respect of certain assets which amount to £90 740 881 the Commonwealth and State debts with out allowance for assets created by the expenditure of loan moneys on public works amount to £899 892 535 so that the gross debt of Australia a head of popuH tion is £160 The Australian Loan Council has well established the interest rate of 5 per cent and sales of Commonwealth stocks are now taking place freely in the open market on a basis yielding about 54 percent In the last few weeks the Commonwealth has by private negotiation raised a local loan of £1600 000 on behalf of the States at this rate Last month the Commonwealth floated a loan in London of £0 000 000 the interest being 5 per cent, and the price of issue £20/10 This price was £1 better than that which was secured by New Zea land and Victoria on loans issued within the previous few weeks, and £1/10 better than that at which New South Wales raised a London loan of £4 000 000 In March of this year Commonwealth Bank's Progress The profits of the Commonwealth Bank in the last three years 1923, £328 000 1924, £201000 1925 £452 000 show that the bank is making progress under normal conditions and under the new management The Savings Bank branch shows remarkable expansion In 1915 the deposits amounted to £7 400 000 On December 31 last the deposits amounted to nearly £44 000 000 These details are a cheering indication of successful management The real value of the bank to the community however is to be tested by the way in which it handles its central banking lune tions Australia is enjoying a period of good finance, to which the management of the Commonwealth Bank has largely contributed The rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank is passing safely through its initial stages Already it is handling wheat frozen eggs, dried fruits wines, and osmiridium Allegations that the rural credits department has been unable to function in particular cases on investigation have been found to be based on instances in which no proper security for advances could be given No good purpose would be served in taking income mercial risks It is in the interests of the primary producers themselves that the tural credits business shall be conducted on a sound basis Return to Gold Standard After more than a year's experience it can be said that the return to the gold standard was effected in Australia without financial distilleries and the free export of cold has been maintained without any difficulty exactly the same facilities as 1 advantages as those which were in existence before the war are now bond, en joyed Our engine being thus a line lined on a gold basis exporters are finding, the proceeds of their sales back to Australia practically at par there 1 chu, a charge for exchange of only a few shillings in each £100 Importers have no difficulty in meeting the requirements The consul ing public benefits by the lad that prices are not disturbed 1 In vagaries of exchange An important result of the l elm li to gold standard is Out moneys borrowed abroad may be bit light to Austin in without c* cssive (o t for exchange Ministry's Housing Plans in accordance with the police in milmed before the last election the Ministry in consultation with the board of the Commonwealth Bank is preparing the details of a plan to be submitted to Pin li uncut to enable the Commonwealth Savings Bank to assist in the provision of homes for the people both by new construction and by purchase for this impose funds up to £20 000 000 in all will be provided Mr Rodgers (V -The Commonwealth Bank is not going to undertake new con str action Dr Page - The intention is that an fences shall be made by the Commonwealth Savings Bank up to amounts which consistent with safety shall be a high per centage of the total cost It is desired also to keep interest rates to a minimum The Commonwealth has already provided 28 813 war service homes, and this has assisted to meet the acute shortage of houses and since the War Service e Homes department was reorganised in 1922 no losses have occurred There is immense work yet to be done to meet the demand for good housing and the desire for and v i dual ownership The Ministry's intention lb to assist and supplement the exist log activities both State and private Since the Ministry's is arising plan was announced notable changes have occurred in the liberality with which the existing institutions are viewing the demands of home seekers Annual Recurring Expenditure The total annual recurring expenditure out of revenue for 1920 27 is £49 237 413 the expenditure of the previously tar was £5">3S4 247 There is a reduction there fore of £3 0<)6S04 The chief items of decrease are Naval construction £2 500 000 special payment for debt re IcmpUon £1,000,000 science and industry investigations £300 000 defence equipment for air services £250 000 prospecting for oil and precious maintains £100 000 ordinary votes of departments £80322 wine export bounty, £07,109 miscellaneous services £49 027 ad litions new works and buildings £36 000 Total £4 432 167 trains these decreases it will be necessary to deduct the following creases invalid and old age pensions (partly due to the fact that the increase of 2/6 a week granted last year did not operate for the full financial year) £747 618 Defence department including special provision to cover the develop- mental programme 1912 interest and sinking fund on works loans £100 360 bounty on cotton uni e itton yam £150,000 war and repatriation services £51300 sundry increases and decreases under special appropriations net increase £30 264 The net decrease therefore amounts to £3 006 801 Departmental Expenditure Reduced Decreases have been effect d in directions where the admitted at i n is in a position to control the expenditure The increases of Commonwealth expenditure are almost wholly the result of a policy which meets the legitimate demands of the peoples in the case of old age pensions and defence The contention that the Ministry can substantially reduce the cost of administer its n of the departments may be consider c 1 in the light of the details now appearing in the Budget The expenditure under the ordinary votes of the departments in the last six years is as follows-192122 £2 952 475 1922-23 £2 712 920 1923-24 £2 608,710 1924-25 £2 758 448, 1925-26, £2,874 403 1926-27 (estimate) £2,701141 In this period the main of expenditure has been reduced by £158 334 notwithstanding that in the meantime the population has increased by approximately 600 000, and despite the fact that arbitration awards have consistently increased salaries and other coats in all the depart meats In 1021 22 the cost of the Commonwealth depar t ments a head of population was 19/9 in 1920 27 it will be 9/2 If the expenditure in 1926-27 were made at the per capita rate of 192122 the expenditure would be £3 290 951, or an increase of £400 810 over that contemplated lins comparison indi Oates clearly that the strictest supervision is being maintained over expenditure, while of the same time the Ministry is seeking policies such as the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Income Tax departments which will reduce duplication and permit substantial savings the proposed adjustment of Commonwealth and State finance will probably result in administrative savings to the people of Australia of nearly £100,000 a year unnecessarily spent under the present duplication The cost of war pensions is still overcast ing owing to the birth of children to pensioners and to liberalisation of the conditions under which pensions are granted No immediate reduction in the numbers applying for medical attention is expected lectors such as increased age profit ess of disease and complications of war ills abilities with the ordinary diseases of civil life are likely to cause the numbers to be maintained in the ensuing financial year Defence Programme The live j cat programme to improve the army the navy and the air services and to enlarge the organisation of a munitions supply is being actively pursued The building of two 10 9000 ton cruisers two submarines and a seaplane camel is pro- receding The Ministry has agreed to pay New South Wales £135 000 as a subsidy towards the cost of a floating dock at Newcastle, on the understanding that the dock will be capable of accommodating the new cruisers Additional personnel will been listed in 1926-27 to provide for the manning of the submarines the cruisers and the seaplane carrier, and for the establishment of a new aircraft squadron The naming of an additional quota of Royal Australian Naval Reserves and Citizen Air Force training will continue Provision is being made for the building and filling of 1111 oil tank National Insurance The hope that the researches of the Royal Commission on National Insurance would be sufficiently advanced to enable the Ministry to introduce last financial year a national insurance system in connection with old age and sickness has not been realised The 1 urge number of new claims for old age pensions which have been received shows that the increase of pensions to £1 a week has been greatly ap- predicted by the old and infirm in the nine months from October, 1925 when the increase to £1 a week began to operate, more than 2000 new pensions have been (granted lins slightly exceeds the total number of grants for the whole of the preceding 12 months. The number of pensions at pi sent in force is approximately 176 000, an increase of more than 13 000 in the year after allowing for deaths The amount paid in pensions in 1925 26 was £8 252 382 It is estimated that an amount of £9,000 000 will be required for pension purposes in 1926-27 The Ministry is still of opinion that the present method of providing relief does not fulfil ill i empire months It is looking forward to the time when as a result of the inquiries of the National Insurance Commission it will be in a position to present to Parliament a national scheme for old age sickness and unemployment It will not be practicable immediately to bring into operation the extensive programme, included in the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Health but the Ministry has made provision to give effect to these recommendations so far as is possible A conference between the Commonwealth and State Ministers for Health is being held in the present month to agree on the best methods Scientific and Industrial Research A sum of £250 000 has been paid to the credit of the council of Scientific and In dustrial Research in a trust account to enable it to work effectively As a first step investigations will be begun into the following main groups of problems -Am mail posts and diseases plant posts and disease food problems especially cold storage fuel problems especially liquid fuels and forest products A sum of £100 000 has been set aside as an endowment, the income from which is to he used to provide assistance (a) to persons engaged in scientific research and (b) in the training of students in scientific re- seen on the work of the council will be carried on in close cooperation with the scientific and technical departments of the State Governments the universities and other scientific bodies throughout the Commonwealth Existing institutions will be used to the extent practicable the court oil will co operate with the Bl table Department of Scientific and Industrial Re- search Primary Products There does not appear to be any reason why eventually the whole of the Australian cotton crop should not be manufactured into cotton goods in Australia The Minis In proposes to ask Parliament to grant as a first step towards this objective a bounty on seed cotton and on the spin iron (f cotton yarns The bounties are estimated to amount to £150 000 The whole of the 1921-22 clip has now been disposed of and the carry over from the previous season of about 590 000 bales has been paid The market seems to have steadied at prices that may be considered fa rly 1 renumerative to glow el s and, as far as they can be estimated the prospects for the new season which will open 111 August next, are encouraging the recent general strike 111 Legunia!

The bounty paid on the export of sweet wine together with the preference given in Great Britain has enabled Australian wines to compete with the products of Continental countries, 077 000 gallons of Australian sweet wine having been exported to Great Britain The annual value of the production of eggs is now approximately) £10 000 000 -An encore rising export trade has been developed and regulations will shortly be issued prescribing the grades and stand aids for export The expansion of this in dustry should provide opportunities for the settlement of large numbers of people. The Department of Markets is assisting various organisations to improve the system of oversea marketing Value of Empire Preference In the year the concessions of duty resulting from the preference granted by Great Britain to Australian products have amounted to Sugar £846 000 wine £196 000, currants £14 000, sultanas £96 000 lexias £22 000, canned fruits, £4,000, total, £1 178 000 the reciprocal tariff treaty with Canada has already been of advantage to producers of Australian butter and canned fruits There are also prospects of a good market for Australian Red fruits Cost of Bounties In 1925-26 bounties amounting to £498 582 were paid on primary and secondary products On galvanised sheets fencing wire a wire netting, and tractors, £242 005 was paid in bounties on wine amounted to £217,109 Ko bounty was paid to an ex porter unless a guarantee was furnished to the effect that he bought or would buy, best Doradillo grapes at not less than £5 a ton and his spirit at 5/ a proof gallon, the latter price being fixed to enable the distiller to pay £5 a ton for his Doradillo grapes, Under the Sulphur Bounty Act 1924 £38 549 was paid, and £10,002 was paid under the Canned Fruit Bounty Act 1924 the payments under the Export Guarantee Act, which was passed to assist the oversea marketing of primar-, pro Huco, amounted to £53,000 lins assistance Included £24,540 to the hop industry of Tasmania, £17,417 to Doradillo grape growers, £8,027 to exporters of canned flints, and £1842 to growers of chance grapes broom millet, and oranges from January 1, 1927, under the Papua and New Guinea Bounties Act, encouragement will be given to Territory growers of cocoa beans fibres, sago vanilla beans, bamboos and rations spices and kapok imported into the Commonwealth Expenditure on Business Undertakings Illa estimated revenue and expenditure of business undertakings for 1920 27 are as follow - POSTMASTER GENERAL.

The estimated expenditure of the Postmaster General s department for the current year is £11,294,480 The actual expenditure in 1925 26 was £10,654 880, re suiting man increase in 1926 27 of £039,000 Owing to the liberal programme of capital construction the charges for interest and sinking fund have grown by £188,312, leaving an increase of £451 688 in the ordinary working and administrative costs of the department Arbitration awards have greatly increased the expenditure and with an extension of postal telephone, and Tele graph facilities, further increases must be roofed for These, however are offset by an increase in the earnings of the department In the estimates for 1926 27 it has been necessary to provide £177 000 to cover increased salaries of postal employees payable under the public service regula tions and the public service orbit! item s awards When the additional assets, now being provided by loan expenditure, reach their full earning capacity, it is expected that the increase in working costs will be more than provided from the additional revenue earned Telegraph and Telephones In 1925-26 approximately £1,000 additional telephones were connected, of which 18,210 were in the metropolitan areas It is expected that in 1926 27 46,000 additional telephones will be metalled, of which 25,000 will be in the country. The number of telephones in use in the Commonwealth now exceeds 400,000, nearly seven for each 100 of population Australia now stands seventh on the list of countries in telephone development. The policy of the Ministry is to provide, in the interests of national efficiency, the funds necessary for the expansion of the telephone system The Ministry's progressive policy has resulted in the last two and a half cats in the addition of 100 000 telephones The expenditure for 1925 20 amounted to £5 050 000, for 1926-27 £4 500 000 is provided In recent years no increases have been made in the telegraph and telephone tariffs, but on the contrary a number of concessions have been granted the present tariffs are among the lowest in the world, and, as a result of increased costs of labour and material, many services are now being operated at a loss The antics rated revenue for 1926 27 would be m or eased by a i 580,000 if Oio American rates operated in Australia Beam Wireless in January Owing to difficulties beyond the control of the Ministry the beam wireless services to 1 ngl ind ima Canada have not yet begun but are expected to begin in January the broadcasting services have now

to determine who ther any changes are necessary in the in terests of the multitude of listeners, who now number more than 118,000 Wireless stations at Wave Hill and Camooweal were in ned in the car and have already proved their utility Losses on Commonwealth Railways the extension of the uniform gauge into Adelaide has been recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and will considerably increase the traffic on the Trans Australian railway, us the breaks of gauge at Kalgoorlie Port -Augusta and Terowie have greatly hampered and restricted business on the railway The working expenses of the Northern lemons Railway including interest and sinking fund, is estimated at £192 800 souls, an increase of £30 500 over the actual expenditure of the previous year The estimated receipts are £76 000 for the sum lent year, being an increase of £17 121 oki the actual receipts of the previous year leaving a deficit of £0 015 Jobs than in 1922 for the first half-year to December 31 1925 the Oodnndiitt a miner was operated on behalf of the Commonwealth by the South Australian Railways commissioners and for the second half of the year by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner The total loss for the 12 months, not in cluding interest and sinking fund is made up is follows Half year operated by South Austi ulm loss £57,910 half v tar operated by Commonwealth, loss, £35 000 (approximately) flood damages £11000 (approximately) total £105 000 It is expected that for the year 1920 27 the loss on the working of this railway will be very much reduced the cost of working the Queanbeyan Canberra railway is estimated lit £14 210 and the revenue is estimated at £22 500 thus showing a star plus of £8 264 The surplus in the previous year. was only £2,4 The improvement in the position can be attributed to the greater activity in connection with the establishment of the Federal Capital The working of the Commonwealth railways shows a loss of £404 308 Cost of Territories The estimated expenditure of the torn tones of the Commonwealth for 1926 27 is £435,53'), the revenue, derived exclusively from Northern Territory is estimated at £35 000 leaving a deficit of £400 031 The actual expenditure for 1925 20 yards £385 224 The estimated expenditure for 1926-27 is £435 539 being an mc reuse of £50 315 The chief item of increase is in the 1 elder of Capital Territory, where it is expected that expenditure will be £31,818 in excess of the amount expended in the last finan- cm] year The increase is almost wholly due to the cost of transferring, in the current financial year, portion of the central office staffs to Canberra together with of h and records an increase of £32.729 is found in the expenditure for additions. new works and buildings This additional expenditure is provided in connection with the administration of the Northern Australian Act which was recently passed by Parliament 1 are estimated expenditure on Papua is £22 187 news than that of the previous year and the estimated expenditure on New Guinea shows an increase of £4 293 Owing to the slump in the copra market and the undeveloped state of the plants tions an immediate realisation of the expropriated properties in New Guinea could not be made at satisfactory prices so the development of the plantations was continued under the management of the Expro prntion Board I the wisdom of the policy is shown by the results recently achieved when the first group of former enemy properties oflic lily valued at £422,143 was sold fd 2'(s 408 many to former soldiers It is hoped that practically the whole of the expropriated interests in the mandated territory will be liquidated at satisfactory prices Raising Money for Main Roads A systematic development of Australian roads of a standard suitable for motor traffic is demanded Those benefiting should specially contribute in some measure for these facilities the State Governments lacking the power to impose Customs duties are unable effectively to reach all road users The Commonwealth, therefore is co-operating with the State in a national roads policy, and will impose special Customs duties which will be hypo treated for road construction The imposition, of these duties at the source will ultimately result in the road users paying this special tax proportionately to their use of the roads in 1923 the Commonwealth granted £500 000 to the States on a pound for pound basis for the construction of main developmental roads, and in the subsequent years sums of £500 000 and £750 000 were provided on a similar basis The results of these expenditures have been so satisfactory that the Ministry, in conference with the States, recently evolved a plan of national road development contemplating an expenditure of £35 000 000 in 10 years Of this sum £20,000,000 will be con- tributed by the Commonwealth £5,000,000 being from existing sources of Its revenue, and £15 000 000 will be obtained from additional collections of revenue from road tion through the Customs The taxes for this purpose will be levied on petrol!, tyres, and motor chassis These Customs duties are expected to yield £1,500 000 The Commonwealth will distribute its contribu- tion on a basis of area and population, three fifths according to population and two fifths on men the States' contribution of £15 000 000 may be derived either from revenue or from loan Where the State contribution is from loan a 3 per cent sinking fund is being arranged to ensure that at the end of 20 years after completion of a road it will be free from debt Provision is made for the permanent maintenance and upkeep of roads constructed or reconstructed under the scheme The roads included in the plan are -(1) Main roads which open up and develop new country, (2) trunk roads between main towns, (3) arterial roads to carry concentrated traffic from developmental main trunk and other roads This will in effect be the first instal- ment and form the basis of a national roads scheme When completed it will be capable of extension in such a manner that the whole of our future roads construction will dovetail into the works now proposed In taking this step Australia is putting herself into line with what has been done in America and Britain where road users for many years have contributed a very substantial part of the cost of road construction and upkeep Commonwealth and State Finances On June 4 I explained to the House the Ministry's proposals for a more satisfactory adjustment of the financial relation ships of the Commonwealth and the States based upon the true 1 federal principle that the rates should be financially independent of the Commonwealth so far as this is possible The Ministry is proposing legisla- tion for the withdrawal of the present capitation payments which are paid from your to year At the same line it proposes to discontinue the imposition of certain Commonwealth taxes This will enable the States to recoup themselves for the loss of the capitation payments by raising pays lent funds by their own taxation methods in the Bar rendered fields Out of the remain mg revenues of the Commonwealth, special grants, amounting, to £600 000 are to be paid to the States in the first year It is proposed further that Western Austro tea and tasmania should receive assistance to the extent of £400 000 and £378 000. respectively on account of special difficulties and disadv autogee The principle under Ijmg the proposals is that as far as pob Bible the authority which extends money shall have the responsibility for raising it Departure from that principle has led to the costly duplication of existing agencies which collect similar taxes from the same people under different laws Under the new plan this waste of administration will be eliminated, with the saving of approxi- mately £100 000 to the taxpayers of Australia Practically every argument advanced by the State Governments in regard to these proposals disregards the vital effect of the war on federal finances If the war had occurred before federation the Commonwealth would clearly have required an amount greater than the Customs and excise revenue to meet its vice and other obligations In such circumstances it would have been idle to argue that the Commonwealth should pay a share of the Customs revenue to the State Governments and at the same time raise direct taxes similar to those raised by the State Governments simply for the purpose of paying moneys over for expenditure by those Governments. The present system of uniform capit ration payments to each State is palpably on a wrong basis because two States already have been forced to apply for special grants which practically means the adoption of a graduated scale of cap! tation payments At the present time if Commonwealth policy should stimulate the development of one State and retard development in another, that State which has benefited has its industries enlarged its population increased and receives an additional payment by reason of that fact in the State which is not stimulated in the same way population may remain station ory or decline and its payments may be come both relatively and absolutely less If any payments are to be made and if there is to be balanced development in the Commonwealth it is evident that just as for special industries there need to be special tariffs be to meet the conditions of each State there must be differential and not uniform payments In all the payments made by the Commonwealth to the States except the capitation payments some basis other than that of population has been adopted No other Federation has adopted a system of uniform capitation payments to its constituent States in the field of direct taxation being Vacated the Commonwealth has been collecting sums of money in excess of the caps tation payments actually made Including the special payments to the States and on the hypothesis that the State Governments will raise in the vacated field only as much revenue as the Commonwealth now pays them the State taxpayers will be better off to the extent of £1 527 852 This amount of relief to the taxpayers is at the disposal of the Parliaments of the States and the proposed adjustment of the finances does not require that it should be with held Withdrawal of Per Capita Payments The Ministry has given very careful and earnest attention to the various objections made by the State Governments to the Commonwealth proposals It however, is firmly convinced that these proposals are sound in principle and should be translated into statute form To meet the objection, however, that the States have not sufficient time to put the required machinery in motion for 1926 27, the Ministry has decided to ask Parliament to pass such legislation as will enable the Commonwealth to operate the plan during the first year, instead of leaving the arrangements to be made by the State Govern- months. This will give to the State Governments and Parliaments an additional period of 12 months in which to formulate their plans for raising the necessary revenue. In the States' Grants Bill a clause will be in served to enable the Commonwealth to pay over to the State Governments land tax entertainment, tax, and estate duty for the year 1920 27, collected at the rates which existed in 1925 26, also 40 per cent of the income tax at last year's Federal rates Bills will be submitted to Parliament for the repeal, as from the end of the year 1920 27 of the Land Tax Act, the Entertainments Tax Act, and the Estate Duty Act For the year 1927-28 the Commonwealth will abandon 49 per cent. of its in come tax The arrears of taxes imposed by the Commonwealth in respect of years before 1906 27 will belong to the Commonwealth, but all the taxes imposed by the Commonwealth for the States, whether collected in 1920 27 or in subsequent years will belong to the State Governments of the taxes actually collected by the Commonwealth for the State Governments in 1020 27 do not reach the total which would have been payable to the State Governments in 1920 27 on a e capitation basis under the Surplus Revenue Act the Commonwealth will make good the difference during 1926-27 by advancing the shortage to the State Governments this year in anticipation of the collection of the arrears In the case of Western Australia a special addition to capitation payments are provided for in section 5 of the Surplus revenue Act of 1916 That special addition to the capitation payment is included in the special relief of £450 000, now to be given to Western Australia, and comes quently the payment to Western Australia in 1928-27 out of the special taxes will not include this amount The result will be that in 1926 27, the State Governments will receive at least as much as would have been payable to them this year as capitation payments under a continuation of the Hair plus Revenue Act No change of State taxation laws will be necessary until 1927 28 The States will thus have a full year to consider how they will adjust their taxation, and during that year they will be guaranteed against any loss under the new proposals, It has been suggested that when the State Governments have read justed their taxation laws, they may experience some little difficulty in collect ing before the close of the year, a full years revenue in respect of the taxes they impose to replace the discontinued retical taxes Any shortage of their own collections m 1927-28 will, however be fully compensated for by the arrears which they will receive in that year in respect of the Federal taxes imposed on their behalf The States of Queensland South Australia Western Australia, and i remains will also receive in 1927 28 the adjusting grants totalling £000 000, originally proposed in the States' Grant Bill in respect of 1926-27 Thus the Commonwealth by operating the new plan for one year in the manner purposed will overcome the most pressing difficulty under which the State Governments felt they would suffer The State Governments will have time for readjustment a guarantee against loss in the mean time and arrears to make good any short age of tax collections when they commence to collect the taxes Doubts have been expressed by the State Governments as to the accuracy of the Commonwealth estimate of the yield of the direct taxes to be Surrendered The actual collections of these taxes for the year just closed show that the Commonwealth somewhat under- estimated the amount and should entirely dispel the fears of the State Governments Revenue for the New Year. Apart from the special taxes to be raised for payment to the States, the revenue (for 1926-27 is estimated at £51,382 000, The actual revenue for the previous year was £58 996,261 There will be a decrease therefore of £7,6M,2GI The chief items of decrease are - L mai tax (additional land tax is being raised for payment to the States of £2 111000) £2,321,928 Income tax (additional income tax is being raised for payment to the States of £4 050 000) £4,408 M5 r state duties (additional estate duties are being raised for payment to the States of the 300 600) £1,361337 (Continued on next page) THE BUDGET.

It is unfortunate that, although the Postmaster General b department is able to pay its way, and, in fact yields a small surplus, yet the various raihvaiB, with the exception of the Queen bcjanCanbcira railway, impose on the taxpayers a dead weight burden which must be provided for general taxation The public has, however, demanded these railways, and the accounts as presented bIiovv clearly the loss on the work which the taxpayer has to shoulder the fact that more than the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue is confirmed by war expenditure, adequate development of the national defences and invalid and old age pensions, obligations which were imposed on the Commonwealth long after the Constitution was framed, is of itself sufficient to show the wisdom of the Government's action in placing the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States on a more satisfactory basis and is an effective reply to the claim of the State Governments that they have a moral right to a share of the Customs and Excise revenue The necessity for such action and the unsoundness of such claim however become all the more clear when it is recognized that the Commonwealth is not only forced into the field of direct taxation to provide for grants to the States but also to provide for the ordinary, services of government, for losses on railways and territories, and for special payments to Suites requiring financial us sistunic to raise their development to the general standard The Ministry must raise revenue to meet the three last-mentioned oblige unions the State Governments, them kill should also 1 use the Rev armies neces easy to meet their obligations and thus become financially independent of the Commonwealth to facilitate this action on the tint of the States, the Common va faille proposes to vacate fields of taxi lion more than sufficient to yield the present capitation payments due Ministry's policy is ultimately to vacate the whole field of direct taxation It will still maintains its programme of strict soon on and tax reduction thus giving the state a continually widening scope to deal with their problems in the last three years the Ministry has made reductions in taxation and postal charges of an annually incurring amount of £5 090 COO It has also substantially reduced war debt, has instituted a pro erosive Defence policy, pard £1,250,000 in bounties to stimulate ministries, and improved at an increased annual cost of £1600 000 the lot of the old and the in firm Under the Commonwealth s finan eral proposals the State Gover unions when itnpOKina. taxation in the field vacated by the Commonwealth, will have the opportunity of giving further relief to tax payers totalling £l,527,8o2 Aims of the Ministry The policy of the Ministry since its accession to office has been to secure the balanced development of Australia Its actions have been directed to strengthen the financial position both of the Commonwealth and the States The redemption of war debt in Australia, Commonwealth ibrtcBtion from raising new loans for its own purposes in the Australian market, Commonwealth cooperation with regard to migration Commonwealth concessions regarding soldier land settlement bounties w stimulate industries in various parts of Australia, Commonwealth assistance for the unification of railway gauges and until nial main road construction, national of forts to improve marketing conditions, as stance to trade, commerce and production by the provision of better facilities for postal and telephonic communication, and reduction of direct taxation-all have tended to make the States' financial posi- bon stronger than it otherwise would have been The policy of the Ministry has an doubtedly strengthened the Commonwealth b financial position and enabled it to deal effectively with the problems con "ment on the war The principal stoRes if economic reconstruction after the war have been recognised to be Stable government provision for today most of war debt balancing of the Budget, stabilisation of currency reorganisation of industry.
