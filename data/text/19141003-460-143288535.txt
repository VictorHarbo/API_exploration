RURAL TOPICS. As usual the clerk of the weather reserved his worst sample for Royal Show week, and no moving of dates will, affect this. Un fortunately, it did not include a thorough downpour to cover the wheat areas. For the majority of Malice residents, particu larly those in their first season, the situa-. tion is pratty hopeless/but a few careful cul tivators still have hopes. In -many parts of the North the; stock have been turned into the wheat, but where .the best methods of farming have been employed,' and the soil lends itself to cultivation, the ,crops are. holding' out'well. It is cheering to hear that farmers have two years' supply of r'foddte bajfiancl, an'd3tlibse,so well provided wilTmake-a loVof money. Grt*at activity is being shown in gfetting ready for 'summer i fodder- drops, arid farriers are by do means ^sitting down under .misfortunes. - A time like this brings out the best there is in a man; and our country dwellers are facing the situation with courage. ; A Federal Proclamation was. issued on - Sept. 23, prohibiting the export of mares from Australia.

TheMarquis of Lincolnshire has given in structions that ho rents are to be collected during the war from the tenants of cottages on his estates, where any adult member of the family has joined the colours or volun teered for' public service. Messrs. Sutton, the seed merchants, have announced that the wives and families of those called on to serve their country would be cared for during their absence by tbefifm, and the places of all would be kept open. Thus nobieman and tradesman ;vie in showing patriotism. • It is evident that the military authorities in Great Britain have.spared neither time nor pains during the last two years to place the remount branch of the military service on a war footing. The. moment that the possibility of mobilisation arrived the heads of departments commenced to put in train the work which had beeB mapped out. The exportation of all hprses suitable for war was forbidden at once,and hundreds of horses on their way to. the Continent were stopped. The: last"census of horses showed that the authorities need not, even for general mobilisation, take one-quarter of the horses recorded as suitable for military purposes. At the annual conference/ of the Vic torian. Closer .Settlement United Associa tion last week it was decided not to ap proach -the Premier \vith reference to the repeal -of Jclanse 69, owing to, file grave . condition1 of affairs through the War!

The Railways Commissioners have de termined to renew a privilege granted m 1902 to owners of starving stock removing them to relief country. A pass is to be issued for one truck of starving stock dur ing the period that the reduced rates re main in operation. It was found advisable in 1902 to encourage small owners to send a man along with their stock .to assist them on the journey, and to help depart menjal officials in transport arrangements. The steamer Themistocles, which is ex pected to arriye in Melbourne about the beginning of October, is bringing to ic toria a party of 70 men and 170 lads, whom it is intended to place in employment m the country districts as soon as possible after their arrival; The Immigration Bureau, of 555 Flinders street, Melbourne, is desirous of receiving information trom any farmers or country employers who may be in need of labour. English farmers' are complaining • that their working stock of hflrses have been requisitioned for military purposes, and that they are impeded in harvesting tiei crops iri coilsequence. The Board of Agn culture are urging neighbouring farme , land-owners, and land; agentsf to uteres themselves in remedying this trouble by some measure of co-operation, and that those in-a position to do so should a. those whose stock have been required for the needs of the nation. A lar«e meeting of shareholders in the Western and Murray District Co- operative Bacon Co. was held at the Danish Club on Rent 25, to receive the balance-sheet and report "Shareholders expressed themselves as satisfied with the'work done, considering the initial difficulties to overcome, and attributed the satisfactory prices of pigs to the operations of the company's buyers. The amount of business recently under taken indicated great prospects for the future. They unanimously voted £20 worth of bacon and small goods as a first donation for the use of the Expeditionary Forces. An important shipment of pedigree stock has recently been made from Eng land to Russia. It included several prize winners at. the Shrewsbury Royal and other leading shows. Four Lincoln red bulls,''six dairy Shorthorn bulls, and a number of Shorthorns made up the cattle section; white the sheep included Roraney Marsh, Hampshires, and .Lincolns. -There were also large white, ^urly- coated. and Berkshire pigs, from the herds of.leadmg breeders. A large white boar consigned to the Russian Government measured lUtt. 'flln. from snout to tip of tail, arid weighed over half a ton. A special truck had to be ^obtained for him on the railway. ^ Mr. Sanders Spencer, the well-known authority on pig-breeding, writes to the "Live Stock Journal" giving results ot ex periments at Holmes Farm-in feeding pigs.
