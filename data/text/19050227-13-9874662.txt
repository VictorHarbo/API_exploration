Iliuucnot and the Continental migrants bringing with them some wealth but, more important still a profound knowledge of arts and manufactures, immensely aided England in its ascent to the pre- mier position in the world of finance, commerce, and industry. Australia is sorely in need of an influx of suitable Immigrants, and it is matter for keen disappointment that people afar off appear to have no desire to venture their lot here. The volume of legislation is largely responsible for this state of affairs, although it may be admitted that distance from the teeming popula- tions of the old world is also a factor. The population of tbeCominouiveallh on 31st December, 1904. is estimated by Mr. McLean, Avlis 3,95 063, and by the end of March it should, at the present rate of increase, be -1,000,000. Of the increase of 57,520 recorded for the year 1904, New South Wales stands for [20,904, and Western Australia for 15,46!, the other four states together standing for. only 12,150. The most unfavourable experience is that of Victoria, which shows the almost nominal increase of 1,430, the natural increase being 15,37, and the loss by emigration 13,920. The process of substituting infants for adults is evidently continu- ing. But It is hardly less than a disaster that a state cannot manage to retain all its able-bodied men, not to speak of attracting people from other parts of the world. The want of an increasing population is greatly felt by traders and manufacturers, who can- not expect their business to expand within the state. The relative importance of Victoria as a member of the federation is also affected. Thus from 31st December, 1861, When the population was 1,5S 400, to 31st December, 1904, a period of thirteen years, the net increase was only 51,904, while in the same time the population of New South Wales rose from 1.1G2.100 to 1,457,240, an increase of 205,050. The experience has been in striking contrast to the expectations formed in the early eighties, when the commencement of extrA a games in loan expenditure brought for a time a large influx of working men and traders into Melbourne. About that time even the cautious Mr. Service was highly optimistic regarding the growth of the Victorian population, and at his suggestion Mr. Hayter, by the application of a geometrical ratio obtained from the movement of a short period, demonstrated how great the number would be by a given date. But unfortunately the prognostication, which could he only of an artificial character, has failed of accomplish- ment. Owing to the slow rate of increase in the population of Victoria and South Australia, a movement has been in progress for many years which has not escaped the observation of the thoughtful section of the public. It is the gravitation of people to the eastern and north-eastern coasts of the continent. At the end of 1881 the number of the inhabitants of Australia was 2,323,000, of Whom 1,314,000 were living in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, leaving 1.009,000 for New South Wales and Queensland. The proportions were ilG!_ and 43 respectively. But New South Wales and Queensland now account for very nearly 1,979,000 out of a total of 3,95 000, or say for about one-half.- With the shifting of the numerical majority eastward, electoral and political power is bound to follow. Every year the movement silently goes on, and only for the gold discoveries in Western Australia, which have been instrumental in adding 150,000 to 200,000 to the population of that state, it would have assumed even more significance than it does to-day. Some of the reasons for the drift are quite natural. North of the Murray and east of the Darling, in New South Wales and throughout Queensland, there are Iranians, areas of fertile land and varied resources, and it was only to be expected that in a country in what, after all, is the formative stage, the population would find its way to the parts yielding the best rewards. But the supremacy of New South Wales and Queensland, as allied states, appears to be assured. The most potent cause of the distribution of population throughout Australia is the discovery of gold-bearing areas. Xa unquenchable desire to possess the precious metal has led to its quest in every direction. The rich rewards obtained in Victoria fifty years ago raised tills state to the dignity of a highly organised state. aVs the yields fell off, fresh fields for discovery were sought in New Zealand and Queensland. After those fields were opened up, and when the gold production for several years appeared to be falling off, the Western Australian explorations were crowned with a magnificent success, and again a drift of population took place, to re- vivify an old colony- that had been almost given up as a possible factor in the establishment of an Australian nation. The thirst for gold has brought in its wake the desire for settlement, and that has meant the gradual development of agricultural resources. But, to return to the statistical view of the subject, the paltry rate at which the population of Australia is growing in numbers is a matter for profound regret. The natural increase is only moderate, but the want of immigration and the departure of stalwart wage earners are of serious moment. The vast populations of the Eastern world are rapidly growing, and this is a consideration that ought to be recognised by the advocates of a limited Australia. With, for instance, Japan increasing by 000 000 per annum, and Australia by only 00.000, what may be the relative positions twenty years hence? The Peninsular and Oriental Company's Royal mail steamer Marmora arrived at Largs: Bay from London yesterday afternoon. Her mails were sent on by special train, nail the Melbourne portion of them should be available for delivery about mid- day to-day. Some splendid racing was witnessed at Caulfield on Saturday, when the autumn meeting of the Victoria Amateur 'Turf" Club was brought to a conclusion. The Alma Stakes fell to Bon Grafton, who was followed home by Roycroft and Main States; and Bright Beauty, 1 stable companion of Gladsome (who subsequently romped home in the Futurity Stakes), were The Woodruff Hauliers, after a line finish. Only three out of the six students in the Stanley steeplechase- stood up, but the finish was exciting, Diamond just winning; norn P.M.G., with Foster third.
