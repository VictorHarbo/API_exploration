Mr. Calwell is agreeable to taking displaced persons to Australia, pro vided that the Commonwealth has the complete right of selection. This the International Refugee Or ganisation will readily concede. He is also keen to use vessels similar to the one which he in spected to carry passengers from the United Kingdom.

The ship which Mr. Calwell in spected was one of three being used by the International Refugee Or ganisation. They are United States converted cargo vessels known as C4's, of 12,500 tons and with a speed of 18 to 19 knots. As troopships they carried 3,500 men each and now take about 860 per sons, most of whom sleep in dor mitories. There are special cabins for el derly folk, expectant mothers and women with young children. The men's dormitories hold 200 and the women's 50. There are rows of slung mattresses in tiers of four, but only the second and third are used for sleeping, the others being for luggage. Passengers, except youngsters and the sick and elderly, eat standing in cafeteria style.
