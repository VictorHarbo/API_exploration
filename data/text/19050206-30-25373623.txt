FINANCE AND COMMERCE. Messrs. Angier Brothers' steam ship. ping report for 1904 contains the follow ing:-The net result of the past twelve months' trading with steamers under the British flag must be written up as a fourth year of unprofitable work, though Sa few trades have relieved the general monotony, and cause it to compare, in a small degree, favourably with 1903. ' The volume of trade has been large, consi dering the general restrictive tendency of all markets, but rates of carriage have ruled below profitable figures, in many cases involving serious loss. The saving features have been .the revival of trade in India and Australia, -and continued good crops in Argentina, coupled with a small share in the profits of contraband trade with each of the belligerents in the Far East. Australian legislation con tinuing severely to hamper shipping, the mail services will, in consequence, either I be transferred to subsidised foreign ships or be totally disorganised. Trading ships are harassed by vexatious regula tions. Immigration of coloured labour, the vital necessity for developing the boundless resources of the tropical and dining, and indeed, the major portion of this rich continent, absolutely is pro-' hibited and even white labour more or less barred in effect; at. the same tidie Australia pronounces boldly and gener ously in favour of closer commerial ties and preferential tariff treaty with kin dred Britons. The same practical com mon sense which so eminently character .ises all our young sister nations, and dic tates this latter policy, doubtless soon will awaken Australians to the necessity of altering their immigration laws. "Let them all come," is her proper motto for the next half century. The Australian freight ring experienced a split among the members in the early spring, but it was adjusted. The end of the series of bad years from drought and financial crisis, and fair promise of a succession of pros perous years, augurs a period of rapid de velopment and advancement for this fav oured young nation. In Australia the year has produced but a poor crop of transactions in this: market, the growing disinclination of owners to run the risk of coming into the hands of the Federal and State surveyors, and the good freights bbtainable homewards from India and 'in the Far Eastern waters, co-operating to this end. The aversion from Australian trade was not operative in the case of every owner, however, as some handy boats were closed at S3. 6d. on dead weight for six to twelve months, and some larger at just over 3s .on dead weight for three to four months, but in othei cases over 5s. on dead weight was demanded and obtained for short periods, and for six to twelve months 4s. to 4e. 5d., but, an 8,000-tonner was closed for one to two years at 3s. 3d. for the first, 3s. 9d.,or the second, term. Though one or two handy boats were fixed for voyages from India to Australia and back at S3. 71d: to Is. 9d. on dead weight, the large trade in coal between Calcutta and other Indian ports' was kept supplied with tonnage generally at 3s. to 3s. lid. but oneivery large ves sel accepted 2s. 9d. on dead weight, for a short period, and a few boats were success ful in forcing up the rate to 3s. 41d. and Is, Gd. on dead weight. THE FROZEN MEAT TRADE, 1904. In their annual review of the frozen meat trade sir 1904, Messrs. W. Weddel and Co.. London. state that the outstand ing feature of the vyear's business was the great falling-off in the total importation of the various descriptions of frozen and chilled meat, the reduction, as compared with 1903, being 12,264 tons, or 3.13 per cent The total arrivals of chilled beef from North America were 13,655 tons less than in 1903, while the chilled beef im .partations from South America increas ed from 11.450 toas in 1903 to 17,350 tons in 1904. Of frozen meats (beef, mutton, and. lamb), the total arrivals--20.,753 tons \--howed a slight decrease of 2,405 tons on the previous year's importations, the ehrinkano of 18,139 tons in the imports from .?ew Zealand (91,624 tons), and of 1,004 tons in the receipts from Australia (11,942 tons), more than absorbing the in crease of 16,738 tons in the imports from Argentina (137,167 tons). The following figures are given, showing the importa tions of Australasian and River Plate ,frozen meats during 1904 and the preced 'ing year: 1903\. 1M0. Frozen M?ates- Orceases.

For five months of the year not a single carcase was received, but latterly mutton came to hand in increasing volume, and consid erable quantities were afloat at the close of the year. Although, owing to its long continued scarcity in this market, Aus tralian mutton has lost much of its popn laritv in the United Kingdom, the gene ral quality and weights of recent arri vals were fairly satisfactory, and would appear to warrant the expectation that Australia may very shortly attain to a much more important position in this n~rket than it has held since 1896, when the receipts amounted to 1,533,189 car eases. Some excellent lamb came to hand from Victoria at the beginning of the year. and again at the close, but great irregularity has characterised the grading for quality amongst the consignments sent from other parts of Australia. Nei ther in this respect, nor as regards the quantity coming to hand in the second season after the break-up of the drought, did the output come up to the expecta tions formed on this side of the world. A number of shipments are now afloat, how ever. and these should do much to re esTablish this section on a more perma nent footing. The quality of the latest arrivals of beef from Queensland was emi nently satisfactory, and showed very clear ly that. although the quantity available for export may be relatively small as compared with receipts from other sources of supply, the quality is undoubtedly good. The beef was smaller boned, more compact, better covered, and more at tractive than any River Plate shipments of a corresponding wc'ght per quarter. It is only reasonable to anticipate that, in the coming year. when values in Queen6 land have adjusted themselves more near ly in accordance with prices ruling in London, an extensive trade in this class of beef may be re-established, although in volume and in continuity of sunply it is rnt likely to be able to rival its Ar rentine competitor. The latest agricul mral returns from the Commonwealth make it eleR; that the flocks are auickly reovering from the effects of the drought, hie- increase-in- twelve months- amount ing to 3,707,734 sheep and lambs. Only 82,478 head of cattle were added to the herds in the same period." Concerning New Zealand, the report states: "The opinioP was expressed a year ago that this colony had temporarily reached its limit of meat production, and the shrinkage in receipts of mutton and lamb in 1904, notwithstanding the attrac tive prices obtainable in this market, com pletely justified that view. The New Zea land agricultural returns on April 30, 1904, showed a further reduction in the flocks of the colony, which then aggregat ed only 18,289,533 head, as against 18,954, 553 in 1903. Although these returns re veal this further shrinkage in the total flocks, the number of ewes has actually increased, but the colony is, perhaps, in a somewhat stronger statistical position than it was a year ago, for exporting lambs. The favourable season now being experienced gives good ground for hoping that some slight recovery from the re duced lamb output of last year may be witnessed in 1905, and that mutton ex ports will, at least, be maintained. The number of cattle in New Zealand at April 30 last was 1,590,547, as compared with 1,460,663 in 1903. The increase of 132,884 head might justify the expeotation that the output of beef would be augmented ni the coming year, but the high prices ruling locally for stock will have to be reduced in harmony with values in Aus tralia, the River Plate, and London be fore any extensive or profitable 'exporting business can be done. Speakino gener I ally of the prospects of 1905, Weddel and Co. remark: "An improved consumptive demand may be looked for in 1905; and as Home supplies are not likely to be any heavier than they were last year, while the United States and Canada may show some reduction in their . exports, this country will have to depend more than ever upon Australia, New Zealand, and the River Plate for the supplies of mut ton, lamb, and beef. The River Plate will, doubtless, fully meet any likely re quirements so far as beef is concerned. It is possible (though by no means cer tainaowing to the recent rise in the value of wool), that Auttralian mutton exports mFy supply any deficiencies from New Zealandand the River Plate; but, on the other hand, the receipts of lamb from all sources can hardly be exuected to meet the nominal 10 per cent. annual increase in the consumption. On the whole, there fore, prices all round in 1905 are more than likely to rule somewhat higher than in the year just finished." PERTH PRODUCE MARKET. Messrs. F. and C. Piesee Thee.

Gd., while medium and inferior sterts again brought correspondingly lower prices. We anticipate larger arrivals dur. Ing next week. Wiheat. Two trucks to hand, which were,nbt offered. DALGETY'S WEEKLY REPORT. Messrs. Dalgety and Company. Limited report as follows in connecuon with their gally sales of produce for the week ended the 3rd inst. at Perth and Fremantle: Wheat.--London market is steady at 33s. per quarter of 401)., c.i.f. Melbourne and Adelaide markets are a shade easier at 3e. 4d. and 3s. 41d. per bushel. Local wheat: Dehleries continue on a heavy scale, although many farmers are still holding for prices higher than current values, Sales are now being effected at 3s. 3d. per bushel, delivered at Northam stores whilst at other country stations sales have been effected at 3e. per bushel upwards, according to distance. Genera'ly the local wheat market may be considered firmer, the chief inquiry being, of course, on behalf of the mills. At Perth and Fre. mantle consignments have been light These markets offer only a limited de mand. The prices ruling at these centres are not always' in sympathy with the larger centres. Sales have been effected during the week from as low as 3a. 4,d. to 3s. 5d. per bushel, although 3s. 5d. may be said to be ruling rates. Smutty wheat was sold at 3s. per bushel. During the week we] have handled, as agents, 1,900 bags. Chaff.-Fairly heavy supplies have come forward to Perth and Fremantle during the week until Friday when there were 41 trucks of chaff to ferth and 12 to Fr. mantle. This was too much for buyers to handle in one day. and values at the time of this report are a shade easier. Ruling rates to-day are as follows:-Prime green wheaten, guaranteed saond, light supplies, £3 15s. per ton; f.a.q. wleaten, guaranteed sound, fair sup. plies, from £3 10s. to £ 12s. 6d. per ton; medium wheaten. forming the bulk of supplies, is easier at from £2 17s. 6d. to £3 5s. and £3 7s. Gd. per ten, according to sample; inferior wheaten, £2 5a. per ton upwards: oaten chaff from £3 7s. 6d. to £3 12s. 6d. and £3 15s. per ton. Our private advices indicate heavy consign wnents during the next few days. and therefore we would advise growers to make s~me attempt to reduce consignments. We anticipate heavy supplies to maret until March, as many farmers are now selling t3 meet pressing financial engagements. We have every reason to believe that the quantity of hay cut this year is much leas than usual. and, as a natural consequence, when farmers have ceased to denress the market with consignments chaff should see a rise. As a result of heavy consign ments during the past few months, we have now over 1.200 tons 6f chaff accumu lated at Perth, of nhich a fair proportion is held by us on farmers' account. Oots. --Algerians are very firm in Mel Ixorne. Melbourne office quotes Is. 9:d. per bushel f.o.b. We have effected sales of South Australiar oats at is. 9d. per bushel, f.o.b.

Throughout the pmat week there has been a strong demand for all really prime grades, but medium and inferior have been plentiful, and the demand has been rather weak. Closing prices are as follows:-Prime green wheaten, £4 15e. per ton, very good demand; extra prime quality would fetch £4 17s. 6d. per ton; good quality wheaten, from £4 5s. to £4 ts. 6d per ton; medium wheaten averag ing £3 15s. to £.Cper ton.
