The -Wonga Wonga (s.), arrived on Monday evening at 3 o'clock, having made the passage from Melbourne in 45 hours.

We perceive that a renewal of steam intercourse between Svdney and Brisbane Water, has been made by Mr. Manning, in the running of a very fast little steam packet to this district. A first trip was made last Saturday, much to the satisfaction of the residents ; and we trust that every enoouragement will be given to this enterprise.

Newcastle.— Ob Thursday afternoon, Captain Knight, ef the Tamar, being on the Signal Station hill, saw a boat with only one man in it, endeavouring in vein to get into the harbour, which, owing to the wind and tide, he was unable to accomplish. Cap tain Knight immediatf ly gave information of the fact at the kar bour office, and Mr. Hescott, pilot, immediately went off to the rescue. In the mentime, the boat had drifted into the bight, and the man, finding she would otherwise go on shore, dropped the killiek. When Hescott got outside, he fortunately perceived him nearly three miles off, and bore down to him, reached him just at dusk, and found him lyingr at the bottom of his boat covered with the sail, and would, in all probability, have perished from cold and exposure if he had escaped drowning. The pilot endeavoured to tow the boat in, but, after many fruitless attempts, found the wind and tide teo strong for five athletic and fresh men, and was at last obliged to abandon her. After an hour and a half's hard pull, the poor fellow was landed at the wharf scarcely able to stand. It appears he had left Lake MaequaWc in the morning, in company with another boat, which arrived here safe before two o'clock ; yet the man never reported the situation of his comrade, nor attempted to asfist him. To the considera tion of Captain Knight, aad the promptness of Mr. Heecott, he probably owes his life, and humanity owes them thtmks for their laudable and successful efforts on her behaif. The boat is cot visible this morning, and has probably gone to pieces.— Newcastle Telegraph. Cozoxui.
