Maryborough Drapery. NO Brunch of Bueinoss, cxccpt perhaps I lie. Timber Trade, hRB attracted so much attention from the outside public. Or induced to much rivalry— present and to come— as the Drapery and Clothing. Much of this is dua to tho flowery and overdrawn reportB from ' Our Ovrn Correspondent,' to the southern press, and the excited condition of the pnbiic mind in rrgard to land, and while we command the de. Eire to be freeholders we think that 6ome arc 'paying too much for their whistle.' One thing however is certain, that notwithstanding the competition the piice of Timber is advan cing, whereas the opposite will result from the increase ol Drapery Establishments. MR. S+UPART, who has recently ' returned from Europe;, assures us tbj^jfcjatno time ia bis 20 years ex perience as a buyer has be enjoyed finch oppor tunities and advantages to bay as well ns he did while at home. Having; a large sum of cash he gftiocd access to and bought \t lowest pi ices from Manufacturers who under other circum stances would only sell to the largest wholesale Iiodscp, an advantage which he has arranged to continue, 80 that Ibe pnbiic of Maryborough may feci assured that nowhere in the colony can Drapery, Clothing, and all the Household Keeuisiteb be bought cheaper than in Maryborough. As tbe contract time to finish liis New Ware, house was the 1st September, Mr. StupaTt bought very largely, and these purchases arc now coming forward by each sailing vessel and steamer. Already there arc 26 cases by The Scotland, 15 by Dorunda, 6 by Catopaii, 8 by Chyebassa, and. about 100 in the Faith of Tny Compta, H. W. WateoD, and other ships nearly due. The consequence is that the present warehouse is so overcrowded that tlie goods must be sold to make way for goods to arrive. The Criterion Clothing Department has always excelled for Variety, Quality, and Price, but tbc New Stock of Boys' and Youths1 Qlothing just in eclipses anything hitherto offered, and the same remark holds good of the various depart, ments replenished by these shipments,- viz.f Drill*, Hollands, Mosquito Nets, Sheetings, fihirtinggj Quilts, Lace Cortains, Laces, Hosiery, Dress Materials, Prints, Calicos, Flannels and Haberdashery. There can be no question of the fact that when a community can buy tbe necessaries of life cheaply, tbe general aspect of the com tnunity improves, so that Mr.Stupart, by adding to the beauty of tbc town by erecting tne * Sew Drapery Palacj,' and by selling cheaper than ever, hopes thereby to be more than able to hold his own by meritiog a larger support by giviog the best value.
