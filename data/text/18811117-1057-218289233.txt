GEO, P. M. MURRAY, Rcturnlng- Officcr, Darling Downs. Warwick, loth Novembor, 1881. — - TO TIIE ELfiCTGnS-OP THE HAULING -:r -fir.,; GENTLEJIIiN,—' AHIloiigh'ln tho opinion, qf .som9 pf.your .number I; nctcd im- prudently in' resigning' my" 'sea'in Jthb Assembly as one of your representatives, yet I beg to assure you, ono and all, that I was actuated by tho highest motives of public policy. I value, as I think every member ought to value, the good, opinion of my con stituents, and when a number of my:consti- tucnts banded themselves together 1 as n representative deputation, and waited on Ministers and staled that I did not represent the feelings of my constituents on a question which had nlrcady received the sanction of the representative branch of tho Legislature, I felt that an indignity had been cast upon me, and nu attempt made to discredit my Parliamentary utterances as your representa tive. Moreover, I found that, not .satisfied with the deputatiomsing business, tho same parties were using tho Press and other avenues of publicity to degrade mo in the eyesofthe electors. Conscious that what I had advocated in thb Assembly iu the pur chase of the Canning Downs ostatc was the outcome of conscientious conviction, nnd'nn honest desire to servo my adopted country, I felt that it would be hotter for me to resign tny seat than/be mado tho victim of studied and continuous misrepresentation, instigated by certain members of the Government, . Having, waited some days for a candidate, to oiler himself to yob, wlio would possess your undivided confidence, ntul finding tbnt no such candidate was forthcoming, and having received urgent requests and solicita tions from all parts of .tho clcctorato to offer myself agaihtp the constituency, I havo con sented to do so, nnd uow appeal to yon for re election, and ask you to let mo know, through the ballot box, whether I still enjoy the confi dence you have twice during the post thrco years so generously reposed in me. I need hardly tell you that I am a decided supporter of the Hon., S. W. Griffith, tho Leader of the Opposition," and 'am still pre pared to : assist '-him' in his gallant strugglo against tyninny nnd corruption. ' No Quccnslandcr with any patriotic feeling cati liave'tho slightest faith in a Government kept in.pojvcr by " a solid phalanx" of sorvjle followers, many of whom cliag to tho Ministry: from purely selfish, motives, nnd.nrp support ing the Government bccauso tho Government support them. Tbe payment of £550 to Mr. F. A. Cooper, in direct violation of a resolu tion of the Assembly, for revising statutes which arc now found to bo all but valueless, and have to bc rccallcd for amendment, illusv tratcs the corrupting influences nt workfto obtain support." The financial policy.of the present Govern ment must, before long, land Queensland into a bogholc orqungraire, from which it will be difficult tocxtricato it. During the last three years f boy. have increased the public debt from ten millions to fourteen millions, chiefly expended upon non-roproductivc works; while, 'during tho same period, British and German immigration was stopped, nnd the -burden of interest- of this large debt conse quently falls upon a sparse population. They arc now alienating the best portions of the public estate on 1'cak Downs and elsewhere to their friends; and supporters at from 10s. to 15s. tiic acre, in very large blocks ; while, at tho same time, they nro charging men of small means, and cultivators of tho soil, £1 and £0 the acre for eighty-aero blocks. Tho interest on our public debt is now nearly £700,000 a year, or more than one-third of our annual revenue, and the colony is drained of this enormous sum annually to be sent to London to pay the interest on our debentures. In thc.facc of these facts tho public money is frequently frittered away. For instance, £2000 was voted to Mr. LandsborougH for his exploration of the Western country, whilo the claim made by Mr. 1'. O'Sullivan for n grant of £300 to the widow and orphan child of a public officer, who was murdered in tho performance of his duty, was scornfully re jected. To prevent a serious crisis, they will have to go on, year after year, torrowing. not, only to meet the payments of the interest, hut to carry on useless works beyond the re quirements of our small, and, I am sorry to say, decreasing European population. Gentlemen, do not bo led away by tho Premier's boasted prosperity of the colony. Tbe lavish expenditure of the borrowed mil lions among our small population must of . . necessity crento a kind of fictitious prosperity ; bat tbe re- action wbich is inevitable will fall most heavily upon the taxpayers in tho settled, districts, and particularly upon thoso who have made Queensland their permanent home. My political opinions on nil tbe great ques tions of tiieday are pretty well known to you, and I shall not trouble you with a recapitula tion of them here. I leave'inysclf confidently in your hands, feeling assured from your post treatment of me, I shall receive justice. I have the honor lo be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FRANCIS KATES.
