The imports for the port of Melbourne during the week ending the 20th ult., were of the value of £243,078, and the exports of £491,762; the balance' being in favour of the latter to the sum of £248,084. Specie was imported to the value of £25,000, and exported to that of £67,128. The articles of colonial produce ex . "ported wore Black sand tin), 15 tons ; bones, 228 tons ; bran, 2,500 bushels ; copper, 50 tons ; flour, 34-tons ; gold, 97 16oz. ; hides, 103 No. Live Stock Horned cattle, 102 ; horse, 1 ; sheep, 300 No. ; silver ore, 12 tons ; wool, 171, 800lb. In the share market there has been a larger amount of business doing. Bendigo Waterworks shares have been done at £1 5s. Johnson's Reef at £1 10s. ; Victoria Reef at 10s. 6d. to 17s. 6d. National Bank of Australasia have been sold at £2 17s. 6d. Holders of Colonial Bank of Australasia are now asking £6 10s. \- But little business has been done to-day in the import market, the arrivals having checked purchases, and country demand, has been lighter, The brisk business done last week has temporarily supplied buyers. Oats continue in good inquiry, and considerable sales have been made of colonial, at 4s. 3d., and Danish at from 3s. 6d. to 3s. 7½d. per bushel. The flour market continues very dull, and prices almost nominal, and the arrival of the Camilla, from San Francisco, Las further deadened the market. By auction no sales of any general importance have been effected. A numerously-attended meeting of the wool trade was held at the Exchange this afternoon, in consequence of an advertisement which has appeared in the journals, calling attention to a circular addressed to home buyers of wool by M. Aug. Philippi. About 50 persons attended, Mr. James Blackwood was called to the chair. The circular was read, and much conversation followed.- A letter of Messrs J. H. Clough and Co. was received, denying their participation in the views of M. Philippe as stated by him. This letter was generally considered satisfactory, and a committee was proposed to confer with Messrs. Clough and Co., and to obtain further explanation. A resolution was ultimately passed, condemning the practice of the combination of growers' agent and buyers' agent in one and the same firm. This, after Messrs. Clough and Co.'s letter, was not considered generally to be called for. " MELBOURNE MARKETS. WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 23. THE MILLS. Millers report a steady trade demand i at unaltered prices.

Power, Rutherford, and Co. supply us with the following report -"Fat Cattle The market has been only supplied with 3000 head this week, and many of those merely ordinary quality and light weights. Prices is consequence have risen co 1 siderably, although the previous full markets allowed of a stock of cheap beef being laid in for some time, We sold on Monday nearly 200 head Hyde's cattle, principally bullocks, at' an average of 27 16s, and on Wednesday over 200 head of the same mob at an avenge of £8 65. Those may be considered as topping Bales, for, had not the market been so bare, these prices could not have been realized. We do not anticipate a very full market next week, nor yet very high prices, for the general impression is that there will be no scarcity of beef this year. Prices are Best bullocks, from £0 to £11 ; second do., £7 to £8 10s. ; best cows, £8 to £10 6a. ; second do, £5 to 76s. Carvosso small lot of medium fetched good prices, ranging from 13s, 6d. to 65s" according to quality.' Fat Sheep The general appearance of this market is most depressing, and no prospect of a change for sometime. It is a matter of very considerable dilB culty to effect sales at a fair value ; nor should holders lose sight of this in giving instructions for sale. Best wethers are 10s to 17s. these are top-quality prices ; second do., 13s. to 16s. ; ewes, 11s. to 18s. 6d. ; lambs, 8s. to 14s. 6d, according to quality and quantity In. We have sold about 600 this week, at fair prices, Great fluctuations have taken place. The demand is rather better as the summer approaches. Store Stockings have sold 600 prime store bullocks, delivery on Billabong, at £4, at six months'; also 1,000 head, principally bullocks, at £3 65, terms six and twelve months' ; 2,100 wethers, rising four-tooth, full fleeced, at 125. cash ; 1,000 maiden ewes at 14s., un- shorn, at four months'. In stations nothing is stirring." Messrs. Dalmahoy Campbell and Co. report :-" Fat Cattle The total number offered this week was 537 head, of second-rate to inferior qualities. In the early part of the week prices ruled about former quotations, the quality not being of a very suitable description. Towards the close, the shortness of the supply rather a better competition amongst those compelled to purchase, and a considerable advance was obtained. Owl useful quality bullocks brought from £9 10s. to £11 6s. ; do. cows, from £6 16s. to £8 6s. ; second quality bullocks from £0 10s. to £8 10s ; do. cows, from £1 10s. to £6 10s. ; inferior at store rates. We sold 47 head of mixed quality bullocks, at from £4 to £11 53.; also 80 head, principally of inferior quality, the bullocks at from 92s. 6d. to £0 6s., cows at from £3 10s. to 3 per head. Fat sheep. 7,70 have been supplied for the week ; business throughout was very dull, and less rates have been, in most instances, submitted to than the former week's. Best quality wethers brought from 16s. to 17s. ; ditto ewes from 13s. to 14s. ; acco id quality wethers from 14s. to 15s. No variety of ewes -was offered ; prime quality would bring from 13s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. Most of the lots were of useful quality, and the small amount of business done can only be accounted for by the extensive purchases made by a number of the butchers in the end of last weak at clearing-out prices." HORSE MARKST.-Messrs. Purcell and Keighran's report states "that the horse market this week has been moderately supplied with unbroken stock, for which there continues a good demand, owing to the number of country buyers in town. The market is perfectly bare of fresh stock, and our sales were chiefly comprised of town lots. For cart-horses, inferior, £tO to £17 : light-harness, £9 to 1890. On Monday a lot of broken and unbroken horses, the broken at from £0 to £20 ; unbroken, from £0 6s. to £0." LABOUR MARKETS-The labour offices report a very limited demand for all classes of servants during the present week, which, however, may be accounted for by the inclement weather, coupled with the arrival of some 870 Government Immigrants per the Wanata Of the single women by this vessel 120 have been forwarded to the various outports, and the remainder are readily finding engagements at current rates of wages ; the married couples are also procuring on ployment in country situations. For farm servant! generally and country labourers there is, however, but the demand in town, and for mechanics, skilled workmen, and tradesmen, there is no inquiry whatever. SEAMEN are c fleeing considerably in excess of the demand, and rates of wages are consequently in Changed. CARTAGE Loading for the country districts and digging townships is offering freely, and teams are some what scarce. Owing, however, to the difference i listing between the members of the Carters' Society and those who have refused to join in their arrange Rents, prices vary considerably, and it is, therefore, difficult to report anything like a correct scale of prices, : The rates paying depending entirely on private or- " rangements.
