The Havilau arrived from Melbourne at an early hour on Monday morning, but Captain McEacharn was somewhat deceived by a light on shore, and having no previous knowledge of the anchorage came toanci.or gome distance to the southward, consequently she was not boarded till after daylight She left Port Phillip Heads at 1 sum. on February 13, and after experiencing fresh south and south-easterly weather arrived shortly after midnight on the 14th. The Cooboxg arrived on Monday at 11 a.m. after a (splendid run from Melbourne.
