Migration ; MfsttleFesI . « r V.- vV , v V V'.rt rr-ri, : ' " Most European Govern ments did not want their - people to migrate now, be cause there was a lot of work to be dene in .Europe. This was said. today, by Mr. E. Howard Nielsen, 29, of Copenhagen, an organiser of -the" Danish- Australian Immi gration Club, which has a list of 5000 waiting to come to Australia. He arrived with his blonde . wife on the Norwegian motor- ship Tai Yin at Victoria Dock today. "In Norway the organiser "of" the Norwegian-Australian Immigration Club was pro- secuted tor crying to oeveiop emigration to Australia." de clared Mr Neilsen.. The Danish authorities were not interested in emi gration and it was hard to organise a scheme to bring people to Australia. Mi' Nielsen was having no luck in finding a job in Mel bourne. so a friend gave him a list of Melbourne addresses to try. The first he wrote to got him a job with a firm which handles farming machinery. He hopes to become an Australian citizen and help other Danes to come to Aus tralia.
