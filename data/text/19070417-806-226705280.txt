THE LOCKED-UP LANDS, PAMPHLET BY THE IMMIGRATION LEAGUE. "Tho Peril of Melbourne" is the titlo of a pamphlet to to iseued towards the end of tho week by tho Victorian Land SeULmoivt, Division of the Immigration Lcugue of Australia. Tho object of the pamphlet, which luw boon pre pared by the lion, secretary for Victoria, Mr. Marshall Lyle. is to arouse tho intVreat ol all sections -of tho community to the urgent ne cessity for an enlightened and thoroughly up- to- date land policy, yvhioh will not only secure land for our own >eoplo without tho exasperat ing delays wliioli arc so fatal to sotblemcnt, but will provide for the absorption of tens of thousands of new producers, for whom there js ample roam Throe vary significant statements are made at tho beginning of the pamphlet, which (re marks tho Ago) tire worthy of t pccml Ounsidcvu- lion. It is pointed out that Micro are 56.245,76 naros of land in Victoria: and that while 34,518,526 acres appear in tne departs mental records as "occupied." only 4,269,877 acres ore under cultivation. The second statement j» that from 1891 to Deeemtor 31. 1996, Victoria lost by not emi gration by sea (by excess of doparturcs over arrivals) 77,068 persons, of whom 24,425 wont to Now Zealand. Tho tliird statement is that Victoria is threatened with further losses in tto immediate future owing to land in tho other States and in ihe Northern Territory being made available for thousands of settlers. It is admitted that tho first duty is to pro vide land for our own people betaro induce ments aro held out to immigrants, and it :c contended that tho aim should bo to mako the settlors so satisfied about their condition and prospects that their letters to friends in Europc- and America will prove the best advoitiacnioiits »wo could display to desirable immigrants. Instructive comparisons aro made between Viotoria and Great Britain and Denmark. Vic toria ia about the sizo of Great Britain, nnd tho agricultural production of the two countries are thus set out: — Victoria Great Britain.

Victoria, as be fore stated, has 56,245,700 acres, and it lias a population of 1,231,733. "Denmark has aa area of 9,500,160 acres, and a population of 2,449,540. Of this mimcbr 948,927 are engaged in agricul ture, against 126,840 in Victoria. The Norwe gian poet Bjornson testifies that the Danish agriculturists are the moul enlightened peasan try in the world. Victoria exportod in 1905 — .vlcat (including rabbits, buies, bacon and ham) to the value of £652,419 while Denmark sent away in 1904 c-ggs worth £1,404,333, and has in view ail export trade in that article of tho yearly value of £8,000,000. Wool is Victoria's principal export, but it is not'equal to the valuo of bacon (which is not Denmark's principal ex port), sent away from t'liat country namely, £3,448,444. In 1905 Victoria exported £2.501,990 worth of wool, £1,825,204 v. oilli of wheal, and £1,576,189 of butter and cheese, making a to tal of £5,913,383. Donmark's export of butter alone was £8,174,944, which exceeds the export from Victoria of wool, wheat, butter, cheese, flour, bkins and hides, hay nnd chaff, oatu, dried a«d freeh fruits and jams. The value of the agricultural product ion of Victoria in 1905 was estimated at £7,728,421, and of pastoral and dairying production at .£10.837,410, making a total of jj?18, 555,831. Eleven years ago the farm producfo of Denmark were estimated at £35,000,000 per annum, and enormous increases have been recorded annually since then. There were 1039 men employed in the Victorian fish ing industry in 1905, and the fish caught was valued at £68.000. The industry in Denmark finds employment for 15,000 men, and the value I of the product is. £6C0,C00. Victoria pays an nually £158,000 for imported fish. Denmark re- oieves annuutlv £250,000 for her export of fish. Agriculturally. Victoria :>s divided inlo eight "beds," and the statistics show that the one moat cultivated has oniy 19.09 per cont. of its area being made productive, while the others range down to a3 low as 0.08 per cent. A list of 18 "flowers of tho garden" is given, and it is stated that in 1887 a greater acreage was do- voted to ton out of the number tlinn there is now. A decline is noticed in the production of barley, peas and beans, potatoes, mangel wur- zel, beet, carrots, parsnips, turnips, chicory, hops, tobacco and grapes for wine making. Attention is drawn to the lesson to be learnt from all thcuo statistics. "Unless Victoria un locks her lands," it is argued, "Victoria must lose moro of her population. Other Australian Stales are making land available, and taking our farming population away. Agents aro con- dueling parties of Victorian farmers to other Slatcis. The results must be disastrous to the city of Melbourne and its suburbs. New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia are arranging for lands for settlers, and pursuing vigorous immigration policies. Victoria cannot prevent immigration into Australia if other States desire immigration. The "dog in the manger" policy is hopeless. Last year 8995 per sons arrived inNow South Wales in excess of departures. Last voar 215,912 immigrants en tered Canada, and they brought with them more than tho annual valuo of the total gold output of Australia. Wo want these immigrants hero, but wc do not believe in giving prefer ence to immigrants over fho genuine seekers after work and land who aro here. Wo want more work for all here, and a good deal more money. Wo do not want to flood the country with the idle and thri filers from Europe. Wo are not in favor of indiscriminate immigra tion. We do not want to to make life harder for any man or woman in Australia. We have a splendid country, upon which millions of money havo been expended to fit it for vigorous agriculture. But we hnvo "left it to the Go vernment." California and Canada have gone ahead so rapidly tocnuso committees of private citizens and publio bodice took up as publio du ties the business of seeing that people wero set tled upon the lands in thqr'e countries. Wc must do the same. Tho only way to keep un- umiiuuiB jmmigraiKs out oi iiuistralia is to bring plonty of desirable immigrants into it. The only way to secure the standard of living of tho white man in Australia is by having enough white men to defend it. The "standard of European civilisation mutt bo maintained in Australia. This continent has tho vastest areas of unoccupied or slightly occupied lands on the earth. Australia ha over 8000 miles of coast line absolutely unprotected. In our -present state we invite invasion. Asia is crowded with teeming millions always on tho vorgo of fnm- | ino. Eight hundred millions aro within a few | days' steaming time of our northern shores. We aro 4,000,000 — men, women ana children — and wo havo to provide for the defence of a con tinent.
