EUROPEAN AFFAIRS. (1 rose Our CoimidroM>f\T ) IO\nO\ Sin" " V bolt from the blue has fallen amidst the European powers. The revolution in Roumelia, the secret of which seems to have been admirably w ell kept, has suddenly re- opened the ] Eastern question, and the great matter of the moment is "Will the book be closed we without bloodshed * The deposition of the Turkish Governor Genernlut Philippopolis and the ab optional Eastern Roumelia into the dominions of Pi nee Alexander reconstitute at once the big Lu! arm projected under the treaty of San Stefano Lord Be consfield and the M Marquis of Salisbury were its lending,, opponents at the Berlin Congress and aided by Prince Bismarck and his Austrian nil), they were able to prevent its realisation The union of the Bulgarians has however, long been regarded as even that it should have come at this moment is li JW ever matter of rare surprise Nobody outside the two principalities expects I it and we have yet to loan the manner in which the revolution was brought about according to some accounts, it was the exclusive work of the Slavophile committees, which extend life a network over all the Lull an states according to others it was accomplished by the direct instigation of Rus born officials, in the hope as we hear, of upset ting the rule of Prince Alexander, and again it is declared to be the immediate outcome of the interview between the Czar and the Emperor Francis Joseph at leinster the opinion more generally accepted is, however, that it has been the work of the Bulgarian people themselves tanned and directed by none other than M hurevelell, the radical Prime Minister at Sofia. Various reasons are given for this belief It has been seen for some time past that Russia was losing her influence in But gunn proper His arrogance of Russian officers has had its natural result in disgusting the people of the principality, and, spite of all her eli wits conducted in the underground fashion which is hard trail to her, Russia has been unable to maintain her position Prince Alexander, having properly sided with his people, has given might) offence in St. Petersburg, and it is notorious that the chief aim of the Rus- sum Government in regard to Bulgaria was to bring about his deposition For the past 18 months the Prince has been critical!) placed, being in constant fear of some in aerial disturbance, for the promotion of which Russia has such unrivalled faculty Naturally), the situation must have grown in tolerable, and it is believed that the Bulgarian Premier has at length found means to come to the rescue of his master by a movement, which (as it promises to be successful must give speedy and effectual check to Russian designs the plot, which has been carried out with such skill, was probably unknown to Prince Alexander until he was asked to direct it Then it could be put to him in such fashion that he must either accept the invitation of his people or resign lines, at. any rate, in the most obvious expia Dutton of his conduct On!) a few weeks o Prince Alexander met M De Giers at 1 run second, and later on he was the rest of the 1 Emperor Francis Joseph during the military manoeuvres Pilsen Itianatunl to con i hide from the irritation which now prevails, especially in Vienna, that the Prince did not discuss his position at Sofia with thesedislin guished persons, and certain) that he did not disclose any intention to go to Philippa police He may have known that something was in the wind, just as the fact was known throughout Europe that agitation was going on in Bulburin proper for union with the people south of the Balkans. But the pear was not ripe for pinchin,;, and hence Prince Ucvaiidcr held his age Such, in the rule, is the explain mon of recent events b time most competent to the year Berlin was not better informed on the matter than St Petersburg and Vienna and in English official circles nothing was expected until the spring of i cxtyear the Porte seems to have been better instructed or at au) late to have had an ml king of what was possible does not follow that being forewarned turkey was in a street preparation that would not be in accordance with Turkish habits It appears that when Sir H D Wolff, the British Ililli Commissioner, arrived at Constantinople, and asked that the Turkish arms should be used in Egypt, the demand was put aside by the Porte on the ground that serious events were imminent in Europe which made it undesirable to send a single Turkish soldier out of the country Whether this had reference to what has since happened on the Balkans, or whether the Sultan was too! HIL, elsewhere one would think that at any rate the I once would have been prepared for eventualities which it pretended to foresee Worse than this there is nothing done when the revolutionaries begin to move, and the situation became clear show that it is almost too late the 1 Porte has protested and in 11 circular to the powers (only issued when it was found that there was a certain s j m pathy with Constantinople) it is announced that the Suit 111 13 resolved upon effectual!) exercising" his right under the 13th article of the Berlin J rest) of occupying Eastern Roumelia with Ottoman troops This is a splendid sample of 1 Turkish maturity If the Sultan does as he progresses he will be opposed and the Hume of war would soon be lighted throughout the East On Sunday) when he first heard that Prince Alexander had set out for Plulippopohs there was a whole cost is daring e 111 the province of Adrianople and if thud been at once thrown into Roumelia question of hours only-it is probable that the whole project of M Carey bill would have been nipped in the bud Now, the opportunity has largely passed Innes Alexander has proclaimed the absorption of the Southern State into Bulgaria and has rallied the people of Rmnielii to his standard They) have sprung to firms with enthusiasm and are now prepared to defend the bi" Bulgaria at any sacrifice to restore the in state quo seems impossible and Turkey had much better leave her cause with the ] European powers who are for various reasons not indisposed to help her Her first gunshot fired between the links and the carnations would pro Labis bring the Russians into the field since the Russian people do not side with the Government in this matter and would compel intervention-whilst it would most assuredly give the signal for a general uprising in Macedonia And then the deluge would be let loose since the Greek s, the Servians and the Roumanians would all find themselves menaced by the disturbance of the balance of power line Alexander has done what he could to mitigate the humiliation which the 1 uri s sec 111 his successful coup At the same time he has sought truce with the powers who pose as the "warehouses the treat of Berlin inn circular which he issued on leaving for Plulipno polis he professed that public opinion in 1 Roumelia 113 in his own principals) compelled his heading the movement and that he was actuated by a desire to maintain the public peace. He has since explained that s him" that he has taken the position of Prince of South Bulgaria he has acted in no hostile spirit to the Porte that he recognises the suzerainty of the Sultan and hopes the union of the principal of ties may be recognised as an accomplished fact It will be asked And what about the powers For the moment they seem to be watching the progress of events But secretly they are busy enough Much 13 involved in the possibilities of the moment Austria has an enormous interest in the situation, in Russia has scarcely less It follows that Germany cannot be unmoved At the outset the reception of the needs of the revolution was just a little peculiar The Russian Government, which had just been cementing a friendship with Austria at krt master, found itself under suspicion of bad faith, and was under necessity of making vic/ tous repudiation It has accordingly < ordered the Russian officers in the Bulgarian army) to resign and has stopped other officers setting, out from Russia 1 to join the standard of Prince Alexander It must however, be repeated that the Russian nation takes quite another view of the situation This was promptly reflected in the Russian press, which was wild with the idea that the Big Bulgaria was at length an accomplished 1 fact and that the Conserva- me party in England whose chiefs assisted by Yestriu had thwarted! the Suisicfuio arrangement but received a humiliating blow at Berlin on the other hand the annoyance was extreme from the fact that. 1 mice Bismarck has always plume himself on maintaining the sanctity of the famous document which issued from the Berlin Congress The "explanations which might arise it leave Alexander s i I ii n of the treaty should be allowed I to "go unpunished were appreciated but the means of punish me a prince with a nation at his back was less clearly perceived and this did not men 1 matters to the Cn man press In viewing the mortification was deep and intense H the outset the newcomers openly suggested ill it the C/a had a li) ed the 1 emperor false , fit Ivremsier and the old objections were taken to the nalia mon o i Hi I am Jin Jo Vustro Hunt Mr and t> her Indicate neighbours who more j once s rely on bel | protection the danger was a luminaries and pressing and in a few hours the funds of Hrvia Gre cc and 1 remains were found at him i King Milan returns I to 1 degrade the same day and the Servian army is now in process of mobilisation on the eastern and southern frontier It the e IUIIS Britain is to be disturb 1 lvm" Militia will fight for his own fund He C eel Govern mull is proposed similar me sures an I li is already called out the rescues Haly his --ofar luuleiioiuu undi lance is equally quiescent though she look a with complacency for difficulties between the three empires m couse money of what has happened Lord Salisbury) 8 Government are evidently greatly embarrassed It would be their policy to day as it was at Berlin to give help in pre enter" the lull pulsations of the projects of the Sofia Government and especially in view of the mission which Sir H D Wolff has in hand at Constantinople But the Prince of Bulgaria has become a persona india at the ] English court He is the brother of the Queen's latest favourite France Henry of Battenberg and waspiesentat the wedding of this predicting to the races Beatrice a couple of months ago the sympathies of the 1 n0hsh Court must add to the difficulties of Lord Salisbury who is left to himself would naturally desire to uphold the treaty in which with his former chief (Lord Beaconsfield) he bore such a prominent part It ought at the same time to be said that in the interval which has 1 ipso 1 since the her linCoiuriss Englishmen have lil ena buller appreciation of the But" must people parts no doubt because of the sense of independence which they have exhibited in their relations towards Russia and also because they have shewn themselves not altogether unworthy of their destiny There is conse- recently a disposition to say that Great Britain has no further interest in the political arrangements of Purl ey and her v ass is and to deprecate any intervention from this side of Europe The necessity for intervention of some 1 in 1 is however evere hasty urgent J veil of Purl ey should think better of her threat to make effective occupation of Roumelia there is serious (dangerous Macedonia, which is largely Bulgarian, seeking to throw off the turf ish joke and place herself under the protest lion out of Prince Alexander Then (sever ii Janefield s scheme for the in clusion of all Ballina in one state would be in a fair way of accomplishment but this would give mortal offence to the Greek s (who lay claim to Macedon was born in the line to Constantinople, to which they hope city in Italy to succeed) and to the '-cm ins, who are exceedingly jealous of any extension of Prince Alexander's power In fact he might see the long t liked of all men between Greece, Sun i, und Roumania come into name have active operation but a combina- tion like this would interfere with the Austen German scheme for the advance of the Austin n Hi to Salonica and thus we should witness the c min accident or over) erivedistur mee-pusaibl) with much by jod slicd-iuvolvni0 the whole of south eastern Europe It is unlikely that Russia even if she were not compelled to give a hand to lillico Alexander would be and by whilst matters were til in-, shape and the issue no man dare attempt to predict there can be no doubt that the powers realise the necessity which is upon them they admit the right of 1 urge) to restore the status, quo by force of firms but at the same time they advise that no irritant v ible step as to be taken by her There is tall of a collective intervention by the powers themselves in the calling.. together of a 1 mope in conference to consider the whole subject.
