IMMIGRATION BY PRIVATE ENTER PRISE. Says "The Pastoralists' Review" for Octo ber:-"The question of obtaining' immi grants by private enterprise' has been con sidered for some times 'm Australia, but it has never got beyond the consideration stage till quite recently: A Victorian or ganistion has been formed, its object being to induce settlers with capital and experi ence in farming pursuits to come from abroad and take up farms in Victoria, to be prepared by the company from large es tates, which will be purchased and sub divided. Similar enterprises are already conducted with success in Canada and the United States, and the British South Africa Company (Rhcdesia) might be cited as an ether e.ample. It is only to be hoped now that the Government will not see fit to in terfern, and that other similar companies will be formed. Government and private enterprise'can equally successful in the pro motion of immigration, and provided they work amicably together, there is a proba bility of a goodly increase in our popula tion. We want it. At present there are about 2.2 people to the square mile." IMPORT MARKET NOTES.
