The Codan is a line Danish ship, on her first voyage after leaving the builder's yard, and has made, for the' maiden trip, a favourable passage of 97 days. During her course down the Channel some very inclement weather prevailed, attended by bail and snow showers; but on the ninth day she passed Maileria, and when on a parallel where the N.E. trades might reasonably have been ex pected S.W. breezes kept the vessel on a taut bowline, instead of having the wind free. At tlii3 period there were from 20 to 30 vessels in skht but none within signalling distance, nor indeed throughout the voyage has there been any com municated with which would be of importance to the colonies but the Lady Alice, from Portland Bay, which barque had been on fire off Cape Horn, but the exertions of the crew had saved her from destruction. Some persons from the Lady Alice boarded the Codan when in 31° 38' S., 33* W., on 3rd April, and furnished the report that the wool had heated and taken fire in the after hatchway, but -with some difficulty the conflagration was sup pressed. The Lady Alice had experienced very bad weather, and had fallen in with several ice lwrgs, interesting sketches of which were made by the master. The Codan hove in sight on Wed nesday evening, and was boarded soon afterwards. Blie ii of a light draught and will therefore proceed over the bars without delay. The Norman, from Liverpool, arrived last even ing, after a passage of 99 days, with a full cargo' particulars of which will appear to-morrow.
