HOW TO REGULATE THE SELF DIGESTION OF \- BENGER'S FOOD. Begin preparing some Benger's Food. It is very interesting. Take the necessary quantity of Food make a smooth paste and then had the right quantity of hot milk. (See directions on tin.) While stirring the food you will notice it gradually thickens. This is caused by the natural starch cells In the food bursting. Wait a few minutes. It begins to fret thinner Natural digestion is going on. Both the Food and the milk are undergoing the changes which make them easy to assimilate. This happens while the Food is standing. For normal cases you let it stand for 15 minutes, but if it stands for 20 minutes the digestive process is further advanced. The important point is that you can stop this self-digestion at any stage to suit individual requirements. Benger's Food is for children, invalids, and the aged, and for all persons suffering from simple or acute in- digestion, dyspepsia, enteritis, etc. It is said in " tins by chemists, etc., everywhere. Advt. Lipton's Tea in the Pride of Five Continents, and is supplied to H.M. the King. All grocers sell it Advt. PUBLIC NOTICES. AUSTRALIAN MUTUAL PROVIDENT SOCIETY.
