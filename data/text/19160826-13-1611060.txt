An exclusive and comprehensive range of Spring and Summer Styles now awaits your inspection at the Mutual. The utmost discrimination and care have been exercised in selection of fashions, and only those approved of by the chief of designers find a place in his exposition of distinctive styles. There is a distinct piquancy about the fashions for the new season. Many periods have been drawn upon, rang- ing from Louis XVI. to Second Tin pire and Early Victorian-the Russian influence is very evident in a number of models. The development of the full skirt is the predominant feature crinoline effects are shown extensively in extreme creations, but the simple circular and open pleated styles will court General favour. The length is somewhat shorter than previous seasons. The reign of picturesque, wide brimmed "cartwheel" hats is setting The trimmings are mostly an aged in wreath form in order to preserve the graceful well defined lines of the hat. Eccentric bird and wing trimmings are a noticeable feature on smaller hats (which are not altogether discarded) for wear with tailor made. Boot and shoe designers have given full scope to their creative powers, resulting in footwear of distinct charm " originality. fancies in elaborate and lovely stories calls for very favourable comment.
