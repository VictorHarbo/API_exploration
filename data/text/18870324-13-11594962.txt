SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. \- POLITICAL. In consequence of the death of Mr. G J. Sands, member for Dalhousie in the Legislative Assembly, a contest is now going on in that electorate. There are two candidates in the field, Mr. J. Gavan Duffy, formerly member for that con- stituency, who was defeated by Mr. Sands in the last general election, and Mr W. Thomson, a local resident of influence. The polling takes place to- morrow. Mr Robert Harper, M.L. A. for East Bourke, is about to take a trip home for the benefit of his health. He leaves by the Orient liner Ormuz on the 1st prox. Nothing definite has yet been done with regard to the assistance to be given by these colonies to the Imperial Insti- tute movement. It is hoped that uni- form action throughout Australasia will be secured. The Queen's Jubilee demonstration is likely to be carried out on a large scale in this colony. A meeting of the mayors of the metropolitan municipalities has been held at the instance of the Premier and they agreed to recommend several different modes of celebrating the event. Subsequently they had an interview with the Premier, at which they submitted their suggestions. The matter is still under consideration. One of the sugges- tions, which has so far met with general approval, is that a statue of Her Majesty should be secured and erected in Mel- bourne. The provinces will also join in the celebration. It was mentioned in the last Summary that there was some excitement amongst the goldfields politicians as to the in- creased prospecting vote for this year. After much delay the Government have settled the distribution of the available balance, having divided the bulk of it into a great number of small sums, to be handed over to existing mining com- panies. Dissatisfaction was inevitable, and dissatisfaction has been expressed. The Government of this colony are making departmental and other inquiries into the question of the proposed reci- procity treaty between Victoria and Fiji. Sometime ago the Government of Fiji appointed a commission to consider the whole subject of reciprocity. This com- mission inquired into the existing and possible trade between Fiji and each of the Australasian colonies, and selected this colony as giving them a better open- ing for increased trade than any of the others. The most important export from Fiji is sugar, and copra is of next importance. As the basis of the treaty, the commission proposed that several manufactured and other products of this colony should be admitted free into Fiji, and that other such pro- ducts should be admitted at half the current rates of duty; and that in re- turn the Victorian Government should admit free of duty certain Fijian pro- duce, should admit other articles raised in Fiji at half the current rates, and should admit Fijian sugar at £3 per ton less duty that is collected on sugar im- ported here from any other country. The commission further suggested that during the currency of the treaty Victoria should not enter into a similar engage- ment with any other colony. That sug- gestion, however, cannot be accepted by the Victorian Government, nor is it likely to be pressed by the Government of Fiji. The Victorian Government fully recognise the importance of these proposals, and they have, although the report of the commission contains many important statistics as to the trade between Fiji and this colony, instituted inquiries of their own. In this connec- tion the good effect that such a treaty would have on the Victorian shipping trade is not forgotten. The French appear to have no inten- tion of evacuating the New Hebrides in the early future, according to the latest information to hand. The Premier has received from the Rev. A. Hardie, a letter from the Rev. D. Macdonald, of Havanna Harbour Estate, one of the Presbyterian missionaries in the New Hebrides. Mr. Macdonald states that so far from the French authorities reducing the number of their troops at the station, the Government are sending out other soldiers to replace those who have been withdrawn on account of sickness. Two French Roman Catholic priests, intro- duced by the instrumentality of a French man-of-war, have established themselves at Efate. These facts, Mr. Macdonald adds, are not indicative of an intention on the part of the French Government to end the occupation of the New Hebrides as soon as the necessity has passed. The purpose of the letter has been forwarded to the agent general for communication to the Imperial Govern- ment. SOCIAL AND GENERAL His Excellency the Governor was present on March 11 at the annual show of the West Bourke Agricultural Society and attended the luncheon, at which Sir M. T. Clarke pre- sided. Lady Loch had also intended to be present but was prevented from doing so by a sudden indisposition. Lord Deerhurst, aide de camp to His Ex- cellency the Governor, appeared at the District Court on March 10 to answer a charge of assault preferred against him by a well known bookmaker named Robert Sutton. There was also a countercharge in which Lord Deerhurst complained of having received grievous bodily harm at the hands of Sutton. Mr Panton, P.M., was accompanied on the Bench by nearly a score of honorary magis- trates, and the court was crowded to suffoca- tion. Mr. Purves and Mr. Stawell appeared for Lord Deerhurst and Mr Duffy for Sutton both charges heard concurrently. the facts appeared to be that during the last Christmas holidays Lord Deerhurst met Sutton at a pigeon match at Hurlingham Grounds near Brighton, and during the day lost wagers to him to the extent of £281. Some delay occurred in settling the debt and Lord Deerhurst was pestered by Sutton for the money. At length Sutton threatened to "post" Lord Deerhurst, at the Victorian Club as a de- faulter. Lord Deerhurst replied offering terms of settlement, and adding that if Sut- ton did not like to accept these he could post him, "and be d—d." The debt was soon afterwards paid, but on the 19th of last month Lord Deerhurst was in the back parlour of an hotel in Bourke-street, in com- pany with a friend, when Sutton entered with two companions. Sutton shortly afterwards demanded from Lord Deerhurst an apology for the expression contained in his letter and this resulted in a disturbance. No blows were struck but both parties considered that they had been technically assaulted. A few days ago Sutton was expelled from the Vic- tortan Club at the instance of Lord Deer- hurst and the first charge of assault was laid by Sutton next day. The hearing of the case occupied nearly the whle day. The Bench decided that Sutton and his friends had gone to the hotel with the deliberate intention of inciting a quarrel, and sentenced him to 14 days imprisonment. Notice of appeal was given. Sutton had taken his passage by the R.M.S. Carthage, for England, and intended to join the vessel at Adelaide on March 12. The mode in which the Queen's Jubilee should be celebrated in Melbourne was dis- cussed at a meeting of the City Council on March 14. A unanimous opinion was ex- pressed in favour of the proposal to erect a statue of the Queen in a prominent position in the city and it was decided to join in whatever other arrangements might be made. Next day the Mayors of Melbourne, South Melbourne, Fitzroy, Richmond, and Prahran had an hour's conversation with the Premier on the subject. The illumination of the city and suburbs, the deputation said, could be safely left to the loyalty of the local bodies and of individual citizens and Mr. Gillies added that the Government would see that the public buildings were illuminated. With respect to the proposed treat to the children of the city and suburbs, Mr. Gillies could not see his way to promising a Govern- ment grant in aid, as his doing so would necessitate a similar course of action in the country districts and that would involve an enormous expenditure. Concerning the erec- tion of a jubilee statue of the Queen by the metropolitan municipalities, Mr Gillies gave a qualified promise of Governmental assist- ance should the local bodies find themselves unable to raise the requisite amount. Speak- ing for himself individually, Mr. E.G. Fitz- gibbon, the town clerk of Melbourne ex- pressed a wish that the propose statue of Her Majesty should crown the central arch of the new Prince's bridge and thereby become the common property, the pride and the joy of both the northern and southern sections of the metropolis at large. Councillor Forbes the mayor of Prahran, on the other hand, said the suburban municipalities would prefer the statue to be erected at the eastern end of Collins or Bourke streets. Mr. Gillies gave a promise to consult the Minister of Lands as to the practicability of one of the suggestions made by the deputation, viz., that the oft- debated drive along the south bank of the Yarra should be taken in hand at once so that it might be sufficiently advanced on Jubilee Day to be christened "The Victoria Avenue." Tuesday being the 90th birthday of the Emperor of Germany, was celebrated b the Germans of Melbourne with unanimity and enthusiasm. The principal events of the day were the banquet in connection with the Victorian German Club and a gentlemen's social given by the Melbourne Deutscher Turn Verein. At the latter there was a large and representative assemblage of Germans. The hall was effectively decorated and pre- sented an appearance appropriate to the occa- sion. A portrait of the Emperor William was hung on the wall alongside a por- trait of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. Herr Wiesbaden presided and proposed the health of the Emperor. He said he was sure that they all loved their sovereign and wished him good health and long life. Under the present regime Germany had taken her place in the van of the nations, and Germans were everywhere respected. Its continuance would be the best guarantee of the peace and prospects of their country. The toast was drunk with enthusiasm and it was resolved that a cable message should be forwarded to his Majesty congratulating him on having attained his 90th birthday, and wishing him continued health and happiness. Flags were displayed at the German Consulate and other consular offices during the day. Friends of Trinity College will be glad to learn of another munificent gift to that in- stitution trom Sir William and Mr. Joseph Clarke who have already constructed at their own expense a handsome block of buildings for the residence of students. Sir William Clarke called at the college on March 11 and authorised the warden to proceed at once with the completion of the northern wing of the great quadrangle, which bears the name of the "Clarke Buildings." For some time past the applic- tions by students for rooms have been greatly in excess of the accommodation at the dis- posal of the council and the additions now to be made as they will be completed with all possible despatch will probably enable the college authorities to give admission this year to a considerable number of disap- pointed applicants. A ball to welcome Sir William and Lady Clarke on their return from Europe was held at the Masonic Hall, Melbourne on March 16, and was attended by about 500 ladies and gentlemen. The guests of the evening were accompanied by Sir Henry Wrendfords- ley, Captain Traill, A.D.C. to His Excel- lency the Governor; Captain Richardson, A.D.C. to His Excellency the Governor of South Australia; Lord Sandhurst and several ladies.

The weather has been warm, and indicators have frequently given expectations of rain, but only light showers have fallen, so that while the young grass lins sprung it has made no growth. If the ram keeps oft much longer the cold weather will have set in, and then the supply of winter grass will be limited. Ploughing 13 being pushed forward, but a continuance ot dry weather will Boon begin to im- pede operations, so that much depends upon the rains coming without delay Keports horn New ¡south Wales and Queensland continue to be favourable, nearly all parts ot these colonies having experienced good rains The agricultural statistics in regard to wheat were published before the departure of last mail. '1 he yield was up to expectation, agreeing with the estimates previously pub lished by The Ansti alasian. More recently the statistics in regard to oats and barley have been issued. The area under barley is set down at 30,874 acres, as compared with 71,112 acres lust year The area under malt- ing barley is given at 27,123 acres, as against 02,313 acres in the previous year. The total j leid of malting barley is 532,522 bushels, as compared with 1,032,173 bushels last }ear. 'The decrease in aten moy be accounted forby the unfavourable weather during the sowing season, and the low prices ruling tor the previous ciop T/hajp. is also a considerable tailing oil m the gross yield of oats.
