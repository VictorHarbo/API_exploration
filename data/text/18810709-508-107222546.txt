Wo pespsotfeily request yon? attention to tho facts mentio&ed; herein, promising that your time Bhjtil uy no means be wasted in the peroe&l; o£ thorn. Of all the articles wherewith you may furnish ycnr household, it is certain that none can return you (unless bv Eile), any portion of their coat, excepting only a Sew iig Machine. That alone is actually reproductive. la many homes it is the case that a sister or a wife adds to tiio income by t»Jring in sewing, matin? comfortabio earnings 1b proportion to her proficiency- Mora generally the wile, sister, or daughter augments the family iucomo in her industry with the hand-needlo by sarinp, in many little ways, money that must otherwise be speat npon articles inferior perhaps to those of her ova production. Now wo claim strongly that with the Wea'ilielEa dewing; IHsgMescs her industry will be rendered — by thirty fold— of jrreater value and effect. In a few minutes she will accompiisn what it would require hour6 of patient and weary wort to perform by hand. The whole, or a portion of her own clothing, tile children's, and even of her liiebaad's, may be made by her, without the wearisome application, the strained eyesight, the aching- baca, and tired finders, ??which, she has otten known. But her Sewinc Machine must be of snm-.icnt power to pierce several thicknesses of unwashed caliee, tweed, or moleskin, without tr-5u^le ?to herself or risk to the mechanism. It must wor^, ?practioably, the finest- as well as the coatEcst: fabrics ? muslin or mole^lin, lisse or leather. Shonld she wish to bind a coat cuff or child's frock, the machine nin;t fold the braid and stitch it in its desired place. When in underclothing a&ouyls; eeani is needed, ttie machine should fold that seam with out help from the fingers, and stitch as fast rs it can be drrren, straight and true, That can. only be done upon too Wonderful Wertheim Sewing Machines, and upon no cthors. In the child** eun- bonset, or the little stays, fine eords can be tttached, the machine guiding them side by 6ide with unfailing accuracy. Your white handkerchier, the sheet ot your beds, may be hemmed upon the maciiine, the appliances tor that wurpoea folding tht material to any width, and sewing at the sains timo. Fnling for under clothing, ruffling for dresses, quilting for bonnets, the Wert&eiin; StacMiaes ? ?will make far more delicately than is usually done by hand, and by their own appiiasces. Velvet trimmings for dresses they will stitch on more finely than by baud. Children's pelisses may be braided 10 times as quickly as by hand. We have a special appliance which makes its own braid, and stitches it on, thus sating- doubly. You may fititca your thickest belt with coarse nine-cjrd thread, or you may embroider your initials with your wife's hair upon tie finest cambric, with tfc.e same Werf&eissa; Famaiay Machine ! Now, the few lands of wori mentioned above, and a vastranpe besides, possible upon tlie.Wonderf.nl Wert hcim Machines, yon cannot accoraplish, You dare not at* \,empt UDOn the tov machines ol1 American niaic, mostly for use by hand, which hnro been j argeiy sold io default oi better, in New South Wales. Ui ail articles of furniture, it behoves yon lo see that you set aiirst-claes Sewing .Machine, the very best procurabJe. Now, we base our chums upon this test, lair and sureat least for tlje buyer, viz.:— — Wa will deliver bet one of tie Wertheim Hnchines at vour own.house for trial a-nd inspection — iree oi charge. Our instructress vriii call und carefully and patiently in. form the intending paichaser in its uses, and show any kind of work that sniy be desired. All this without say pre-payment whatever. Ycu can examine the machine at leisure, in all its parts; and satisfy yourself that what wo profess is true, and then you can say you will purchase it. Upon our Tiina- Paj-ment System yon may obtain the machine for small Eiontkly payments, ana there will be KO EXTRA CHARGE WHATEVER FOR I3SIEBEST ?upon the list prioe. If yon pay casn. down, an allowance o£ Is in the pound is m&de; -(5 per cent.), and this is the only difference between prompt cish and ticae payments. The machine will have far itore than paid for itself in its earnings or ss. vines during the time yon arrs cleariag-it off. Ton cannot by fair usage injure or damage onr machines ; but to make snre that oar customers shall be sat-slied, we underteie to keep any WerilseSEis BSacMne purchased from ns in perfect order and repair for two years — entirely free of etarge. We giairantee them for ten years, feat they shonld last your life-time, and you' may pass them on as heirlooms. No matter in what part a{ the country yon live, or ho*w £j from town, any of our machines may be had upon time-payment. 'ihey are packed witt great care, but if any part he broken in cairiage, that is at onr riek, end we replace it immeJiatelv — free of ehirge. Before buying, ask ns lor the names ot people \fiio are using the Wer&sselssi; llacl^iises. Most likely, some person whom you know in the neighbourhood has one, Dut ia any case, inguire ae to their merits from those who have already purchased. Catalogues, samples of work, and sheets, detailing their various performances, will eJbo be gladly supplied tree ©f charge. Information will t-e given at all times by our travellers, ex our offices, or by letter. Instruction in any Mud of machine- sewing will always, and &b; often as yoa like, be gladly imparted at our offices by instructresses, altogether free of charge. Fully illustrated and copious instruction books we can at ones supply in any one of the following languages, viz.: — Eng-lish, French, German, Danish, £n£sizn, iipanith, Italian, Portugese, Dutch. It is so strongly to cnu: interest to maintain the good re putation of the ' WertlaeisEi Sfaeiifnes, that we prefer to incur extra expense in explaining and teaching their ?nses to the public ourBslTes. Kesri j every purchaser irhofinds their fceneSt and is weii satisfied will say a kind word of recommendation to her friends. The Wertheim Family 'Mjushines are simple to learn, light in running, etrone, handsome, and durable. With the Eame tension, needle and cocten, you may sew, one after the other, 20 thicknesses of unwashed calico, three of belt leather, eifffct «f tweed, one of fine muslin, four of strong moleskin, two o£ mosquito net, 24 of brown holland.

Twecty-Sve years ago it was necessary to ^explain that the leek-stitch possesses enorxaonsiadraniageg ares the chain-stitch, and for 20 years in. nearly all civilised countriec the lock-stitch machines have almost or alto gether eupersededthe chain-stitch. The iock-stitch uses only one-third of the cotton required by the other. Each Btatch is complete end fast in itself. With the chain, etitch, which ie re*Hy not tewing at all, but only a looping apparatus ; if one etitch is broken the whole seam must np from end to end, A lady will flnd two yards of her skirt trailing On the gronnd. &. trenxleman's trousers (mzny a, oae) have tipped from the waist to the ancles.
