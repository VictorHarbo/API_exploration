INTRODUCTION. In Parliament during the month, though the sittings have been long, but little progress has been made with public business. It is a curious circumstance that while the Chief Secietary is stump- ing the country against the Legislative Council, he confesses himself unable to proceed with business in the Legis- lative Assembly, which he has more than once described as "hopelessly demoral- "ised." At the end of five months he has not sent one bill of any kind to the Upper House. All his measures have been defeated or delayed in the Lower, and the hon. gentleman his intimated his intention of abandoning his whole ses- sional programme, with the exception of the Reform Bill and the revenue bills required to make up the existing de- ficiency, and then he will wash his hands of the moribund Lower House, and go to the country. The Assembly has been almost entirely occupied with re- casting the financial measures originally submitted by Ministers, and the incom- petency shown by Mr. Berry and his colleagues in dealing with business matters has greatly aided to destroy their influence in Parliament. The hope is reasonably entertained that the ballot- box will show that the feeling of distrust is shared in the country. The reform issue, however, is approach- ing its denouement. The Government bill came before the Assembly to be dealt with in committee on November 11, and the Opposition decided that so far as they were concerned it was hopeless to attempt to improve a measure to every provision of which they strongly object. They therefore sat still, and the bill was rattled through pr0 forma in less than half an hour, the Clerk of the House reading the marginal notes of the clauses. The whole of the measure would have been advanced through this stage, but the Go- í - l-l--. 1""1 _ ,fl, tl,r, ernment were not ready to deal with the 6th clause which abolishes the Upper House in matters of finance by authorising pay- ments on the vote of the Assembly alone. Some of their supporters object to go as far as this, and Ministers postponed the clause until Tuesday, December 2. The question now is whether the bill, un- amended as it is, will obtain so much as the bare majority of the whole Houso re- quired by the Constitution Act. Ministers claim that it will, but they anticipate no more, and a bare majority would, of course, be indicative of a great revulsion of feeling from the time when their original bill of last session was carried by a majority of two thirds of the House. The telegraph will, however, have made known the result before the arrival of the present mail, as the third reading is appointed for December 4. It is to be noted that the Ministerial ranks are far from united about the Govern- ment bill. One section is strenuously advocating in the press that the plebiscite is sufficient of itself ; that its operation should be extended, and the remainder of the measure abandoned—the bill to be a plebiscite bill pure and simple. The Chief Secretary, however, who has notoriously had the plebiscite forced upon him, has declined to go beyond his pre- sent proposals, and has been accused of a desire to visit England with a bill from which the plebiscite could be dropped as an excrescence. Some of the local reform leagues have declared in favour of govern- ing on the direct vote of the people, but the Constitutional party is everywhere inculcating the view that the plebiscite is wrong, because it upsets the vital principle of parliamentary institutions, reduces the need of discussion to a minimum, and brings into force what in this sense may be called the brute voting power of the majority at the earliest instead of at the latest possible moment. If the bill goes to the country, the Opposition will be sanguine that the contest will result in a victory for the Service-Munro scheme.

'Iho controversy over the Education Act continues On the 6th inst there oegan a Bines of public meetings in Melbourne on tho question of religious instruction in Btito schoolB, m the proceedings of winch meetings a largo number of clergymen of the various denominations were invited to and did take part Three of such meetmgB havo been held, each of them under the presidency of the Dean of Melbourne, and the great majority of the speakers have been clerg} men The Rev Samuel Robinson (Presbyterian) moved resouitions approving of free, united, and compulsory education, protesting against those principles being administered in a pccularising Bpint, and urging that the state ou(,ht to give facilities for religious instruction without favouring denominationaham On these a series of amendments was moved by the Rev Dr Gilchrist (Presbyterian), ap- proving of the present BjBtem of education is a whole, but advocitiug tho giving of in creased facilities for imparting religious in- struction to the Btate scholars borne recognised bodies have dealt with the education question during the month At Ballarat there are two school boards of advice, and in response to an application ro ccutly made by the Ballar it Ministers' Asso ciation for the use of the state schools for the pnrpoBO of giving religious instruction to the Biholars, these boards have pledged them Belves, the one to consider any definite appli- cation for the UBe of a school building " after ihe children are dismissed from school, aud the other to recommend the Minister of Education to grant the use of the buildings under ita control for the specified purpose after the children are dismissed Under the existing law and system, the use of Btate school buildings for religious instruction after school hours is allowed by the MmiBter with the advice and consent of the Behool boards concerned , and the two Ballarat boards seem to have been under the impression that the local clergymen wanted Bomethmamore, and consequently they dealt very cautiously with the application mentioned At a subsequent meeting of the Church of England ABaembly for the diocese of Ballarat, the following re- solutions were carried - "1 Hut tins assembly deplores tho absolute ¡snoring of all religion in the present system of publie instruction 2 Tliat the effort« of the church should l»c directed to securing tho teaching ol tho facts and moralB of the Ilihlo in tho state schools by tho school teachers or, vv hero such an arrangement Is found tobo impracticable by tho Christian denominations 3 That tvvelvo members of this assembly be appointed to form (with twelve persons to bo appointed by tht d10 cue ol Hell ournc) a committee to tako such BU-I>S as the committee may tlunlc de&lrablo;

One of the strangers, who had evidently been a Bailor, stated ho waa at Rabbit Maud l8 years ago, and had then buned the cask From the subsequent remarks of the other Btranger, it seems ho had provided the funds for the enterprise, and that " nothing had come of it " The men returned to Mel- bourne, but information having been given to the pohce.a watch was kept on their move- ments by the police, who Boon discovered that they had arrived here from Boston, USA, about a fortnight previously. They were searched, during which process one gave the name of Samuel P Lowe, and the other that of W J. lloyd The latter hud a large quantity of money in notes of various kinds und gold. Lowe stated that ho had been on Rabbit Island 17 j ears ago, and thut there was a plant of gold there then, but that someone bad " sprung ' it between that date and the present, while Floyd mentioned that he expected a good thing out ot the specul i tion, that he had paid Lowe's expenses nil the way from Boston to Rabbit Island and back to Melbourne, that he was to havo re ccived two thirds of the proceeds of what they obtained from the plant, and that he was a dead loser by the transaction Ile then left for Sydney.

It is there fore in the power of the Assembly to make alterations before its final passage through Parliament, and in consequence an amount of uncertainty is allowed to hang over the trade of the port, which it is Renerally admitted ought not to be the case But os usuallj happens with Ministers more intent on forwarding their own particular interest and views, it comports more w.th tbo ideas ot tue present uovernmein., notwithstanding their professions to the contrary, that the substantial interest of the colony should bo allowed to suffer by the delay in passing even a bad tariff, rather than that tho country should be permitted to accommodate itself as eipeditiousl} aa poasible to the altered con dinon of affaira, and try to recover from the c\ ii effectB of a t vrilï of w hieb it may be stated that no belter could be devised to de- stroy our trade, and to enrich the few at tho expense of what certainly was, before the advent to office of a people's Ministry, the most proaperoua of any of the colonies in the southern hemisphere For tho last month the attention of the Government baa been directed towards tho paasing of tho Stamp Duties Act, and as if such a meaauro in itself could not ho sufficiently obstructiv e to trade, notwithstanding how simply it could he framed, nearly the whole month has been spent by the Opposi- tion and mercantilo membera of the House in endeavouring to obtain an act Bufliciently capable of raising the required revenue with as little injury to the trade of the colony as ia i ossible undei the circum- stances Deputations of bankers, oc insur- ance agents, and of merchants from the Chamber of Commerce, have alao waited from time to time on the Chief Secretary, each ivith ita own particular grievance to remedy and rectifj, and with varied succeaa, but, owing to the dilhculties placed m the way, the act, up to the time we are now writing, has omy just been periecled In any country no measure of i like character can bo looked upon with much favour bj traders, but more especially so in a new colony, where ita prin- cipal industries are in the course of develop- ment, and the necessary capital can only bo supplied by itB monetary institutos, through the discount of bills and their renewal, until such time as the produce of a years labour can be brought to market, and very quickly it became apparent that a grievance of this kind was likely to lffect the great wool and squatting interest of tina colony more so than any other, and drive that, our principal tiade to Sjdnej to obtain the necessary relief, because, though a 2s stamp on £100 by itself nppeiira small enough, when that baa to be renewed every three months, as it ia bound to be to come under the minimum rate of discount, the bill atttnip dut? on tho original Bum must amount to nearly 1 per cent by the end of the jear, md w hen the enormous sum thus advanced to the woolgrowers and sta- tion holders uf the colony is considered, tho -ifcniiicaucc of the objection miy well be imagined At the last discussion on tho subject, the object of the Opposition was to obtain a lived m ivimuin rate of £2 on such hills, in oider.by exempting the large sales of Riverinapiopcitj liking place in Melbourne, lint ttado might be retained to this colony.
