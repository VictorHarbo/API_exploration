Loss or an Ameeicak Basque in the Amoor E.iTBa.-^-By the arrival of the barque Althea at Hakadqdi '(Japan), ten days front De Castries Bay (news -which, we received here by the Sarah ;.Chase), we have dates firom the Amoor. River to 1st September, the ;barque Mongol, Captain Thompson, had arrived 'there ia 148 days from Boston, and 'whjle proceeding up the river in charge' of a pjJLot, got ashore on a sind-spit off i Cape Katarina, about 17th August, in, three fathoms of water. Before she could be got off, a gale came on, and the' sea made a clean breach over her. 'Viblient thumping carried away, her masts, and Jier hull filled witb water, leaving the vessel a total wreck. The captain and crew were lashed to the forecastle five days, but all were safely rescued and taken to De Castries. The ilongol was a new and beautiful vessel of ?530 tons, on' her first trip, and was valued at about 40,000 dollars, and her cargo -at about .80,000 dollars more. — San Francisco Weeltly Bulletin. The .baequb AuaeRA. Atjstralis, with immi grants, arrived from London at 7 a.m.. yesterday, after an unusually quick passage of 74 days from Gravesend, and 72 from Deal, which she left on the 28th Oct. She crossed the line on the 24th day out, and in the vicinity of the 'Crozets,' passed several icebergs. The highest latitude reached wao52 ° S., and it was whilst in the high latitudes the ship ran 100 degrees in 17 days, or on. an average of about . 260 miles a day. The Mewstone was made on Tuesday at eleven in the forenoon, and but for the light winds here ex perienced, the ship would have reached Hobart Town at least a day earlier. The immigrants, numbering 99, have all arrived in excellent health, and appear to be of a much more respectable de scription than any of those lately landed here. They are principally English women, and many ui wem ormg wiin tnem excellent uuucauiers, od tained from their last places of service before joining the ship. Whilst they speak in the highest terms of the kindness extended to them during the voyage by the Captain and doctor, they in their turn bear testimony to the very orderly conduct of our new arrivals. The names of the immigranxs having already been published by the Immigration Agent, it is unnecessary for us now to repeat them.^ — Hobart Town Mercury, 1.0th January. The whaling barque Aladdin returned to port yesterday, after an absence of twelve months, dur ing which period she-has taken thirty- seven tuns sperm oil. Captain Nicholls reports the following vessels :— New Bedford, U. S., off Lord Howe's Island, on the 25th October ; ship Gazelle, Cap tain Baker, fifty-two months out, with. 1600 bar rels sperm ; Alabama, Captain Coffin, thirty-six months out, 360 barrels sperm ; Junior, thirty-six months out, 250 barrels sperm ; and barque, An drews, Captain Naughton, thirty-eight months out, with 450 barrels sperm. Captain Nicholls also reports that he saw a Government buoy, with white and black chequers, with twenty fathoms of chain attached, drifting in lat. 34.40; long. 159.30 E. — Hobart Town Mercury, 11th January. Tub Julia Pbhcy.— The SocJthampton Sttlletin's Ken nedy correspondent -writes to that journal as follows:— Two weeks ago the brig Julia Percy, of Sydney, anohored in the outer bay, and remained some three or four days. This ressel had been about a year and a half since sent by Captain Paddon, late of New Caledonia, with a party of whites and Paoifio Islanders, to form an establishment on Lizard Island, a few miles off this coast, between the 14th and 15th degrees of latitude, for the purpose of gathering and curing beehe-le-mer, collecting tortoiseshell, and cutting sandal 'wood. The beehe- le-mer is said to be found along that part of the const in great abundance and of superior quality. Baring the sixteen months they were at Lizard Island, two shipments of the article had been made for the Chinese market, and the Julia Percy had besides about 20 tons aboard which had been cured since the date of ihe Inst shipment. In collecting tortoise-shell they had also been quite successful. Of Sandalwood they found some very fine samples, but represent the amount to be had as being small. All appeared to have been well satisfied with the prospects of business for such an establishment aB that they hail left. Beyond some petty thefts, the natives gave them no trouble. Altogether, from the best ^accounts we could obtain, it appears the materials for a valuable business (especially in beche-le-mer) are at this moment to be found on our northern Pacific coast. The establishment waB bro ken up in consequence of the death of Paddon, As far as possiblo everything has been transferred to Sydney, in set tlement of the estate of the deceased, but several of the men expressed their determination to return to the same place and business as Boon as possible. The vessel is on her* way to Sydney, hut is in a very unseaworthy condition. If she oan reaoh Keppol Bay, I think she will do well. You will probably have a visit from some of the party. ' Thb Loss op'thb Ship Mabitana and Twenty-sevrn Lives.— Intelligence was received in Liverpool on Tuesday by the Africa of the total loss of the ship Montana. The following :s from a statement by one of the Baved:— .'The ship Maritana, Captain Williams, from Liverpool, on 25th September for Boston, with fifteen passengers, cargo of about 9.0 tons of coal, 100 bales wool, and an assortment of potash, iron, and steel, consigned to Hessrs Page and Co., made Highland Light, Cape Cod, at 4.30 p.m. on Saturday 2nd November, and Bace Point Light at 8.45 p.m., -wind strong from eastward ; kept on her course for Boston Light, which was seen at 12.45 midnight, weather thick, when the order was immediately given to taok ship, but boforo she could be brought to the wind breakers were discovered, and she struck on Egg Rock, sometimes called Ball Hock, about one mile east of Boston Light. There was a very heavy sea on, -whioh constantly broke over the vessel with terrible violence. Notwithstanding this, the ship's long-boat, was soon got overboard. Five of the seamen got into it to run a small line ashore (not knowing where they were), to whioh a hawser was to he at tached, with the idea of saving those on board; but the boat was stove almost immediately, and the men hauled on board the ship. The other boats were also soon crushed to atoms on the davits by the sea. The masts were cut away at about 8 a.m., when nothing remained to be done but to wait patiently for daylight. The ship, being a very strong one, hold together until morning, leaking but little, she having no water between decks, but ohafing very harsh v on the rooks. About 7 a.m. on Sunday ..Captain Williams 'was amidships, -when he notieed that, the vessel was breaking in two. He shouted, ' Look out for yourselves,' but spoke no mere. The ship} separated just where he stood. He fell below, and wbb crushed to death as the vessel closed to together again. The scene whioh ensued ia desoribed as terrible. The affrighted passengers and crew had lost the guiding spirit of the vessel, and, amidst insense excite ment and confusion, they struggled against tho fearful death that stared them in tha face. Five seamen swam on shoro, and seven others saved themselves oa. tho poop. The remainder of the crew and passengers were swept off tho ?wreck and lost. The body of Captain Williams was found. His head must have been atruok by a timber, as ic was doeadfully jammed. The Maritana hnd a crew of twenty one, all told, and five male and ten fomale passengers.
