"I am a magistrate of this State, and think it my duty to state that I am indebted to Koko that my hair is still fairly thick although I am over 60 "I am a Doctor. I always recommend Koko for the hair to my friends and patients; it is the best hair tonic I have ever tried." "I am using Koko for my girl's hair as it was strongly recommended by my doctor." "My little girl's head was thick with dandruff; a 19 bottle of Koko completely cured it." "I have used Hair Tonics for years, but none did my hair much good but Koko; one small bottle stopped my hair coming out, although it was falling badly." "My hair was nothing till I used Koko; two bottles made it wonder- fully thick." "Three applications of Koko improved my hair." "One 1 bottle of Koko started the hair growing on a bald patch I had, when nothing else would make it grow." "I have found Koko marvellous for falling hair." "All my hair fell out through illness, but since using Koko it is thick as a broom." (NAMES GIVEN.) We have endeavoured to make Koko indispensable as a daily dressing for the hair to everyone who Wes it. Twenty five years ago we foresaw that increasing refinement amongst all classes would demand a cleaner and more useful preparation for the hair than was obtainable. That we have succeeded in making Koko for the Hair all that the daintiest and most discriminating woman could desire can be quickly proved with Trial Bottle for 2/-, obtainable once only from the Koko depots below.
