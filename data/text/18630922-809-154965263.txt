JAMES SIMMONDS ha3 great pleasure in an nouncing to tho public that he has EFFECTED mi EtsC-AGEMENT for THIRTEEN PERFORMANCES, ' (Under Distinguished Patronago), With MR GEORGE COPPIN, Who will appear in a round of his celebrated cha racters that havo been bo long and favorably asso ciated with THE DRAMA OF AUSTRALIA. FIRST APPEARANCE, SATURDAY, 19th SEPTEMBER. At the expiration of Mr Coppin's Engagement, the Theatre will bo closed for one week, to prepare for . THE GRAND DRAMATIC FESTIVAL Of MR and MRS CHARLES KEAN. EXTRACT FFOM THE LONDON TIMER. MR AND MRS KEAN AT THE PRINCESS'S. The brief fortnight is over, and Mr and Mrs C. Kean have terminated their farewell engagement at the Princess's, not to re-appear in London till they have returned from tho Australian colonies. In tho short timo of their sojonrn among us, how much has been done ! ' Hamlet,' ' Othello,' ' Tho Mer chant of Venice,' which aro three of tho principal plays bequeathed to us by Shakspearo ; the portion of ' Henry the Eighth ' in which the genius of our Kreat tragedian is most prominently shown ; ' Louis XI,' naturalised upon our stago by Mr Kean's excel lent acting : and Coleman's pleasant comedy of ' Tho Jealous Wife,'represen ted with such exuberant humor that it is almost impossible to identify poor Mr Oakley and his tyrannical spouse with the Danish prince and his^cousoience-stricken mother. These pieces, wo say, represent no small amount of mental or physical labor to be performed within eleven days. Every one of the principal characters severally put forward on tho list belongs to tho highest depart ment of art. Mr and Mrs Kean have left us amid acclamations and hearty wishes of success in a new and untried region, fairly earned by many years' toil endured in tho best of causes, the maintenance of the national drama ; and their admirable per formance during tho last engagement at the Princess's, newly impressing so many vivid images on our minds, renders us more painfully aware of the magnitude of our loss.
