AS RELIABLE AS STEAM AND FREQUENTLY MORE CONVENIENT. Purchasers of IMarine 011 Engines must frequently be sorely perplexed at the great variety of engines offered to them, and the very extravagant points of superiority claimed for many of these engines. In tending purchasers should therefore make all possible investigation before purchas. Ing an engine, becausee, where life and pro. peorty are at stake, as at sea, it is very obvious that only a High Grade Engine should be considered. There is no sense or reason in buying an engine Just because it Is low-priced; in fact, the engine may not even be worth the amount paid for it, how. ever cheaply it has been bought. There Is unqualified satisfaction In ownlng a boat fitted with a "Standard;" also there is never any difficulty in selling a boat fitted with a "Standard" Engine. It is not pos slble to build a better engine than the "Standard;" it it were possible the Stan dard Company would build it. "Standard" Engines can also be supplied for STATIONARY, , PORTABLE, and HOISTING PURPOSES. Australasian Depot for "Slandard" Engines, WAUGH AND JOSEPHSON, Goulburn-street, Sydney.
