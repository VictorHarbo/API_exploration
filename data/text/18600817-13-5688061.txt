CENTRAL PROVINCE ELECTION.-A MEET- ING of ELECTORS favourable to tho return of AMBROSE KYTE, Esq, will be hold at Swan Hotel Gertrude-Btroet, THIS EVENING, at 8 o'clock fbarp.____^___ TO the ELECTORS of the CENTRAL PRO VINOE. Gentlemen, It waa not my intention to tako part in publio life so soon after my return from England:; but from tho repeated solicitations which I havo received from BO many of my frionas, of all Bhades of politics, I feel it my duty to offer mysolf as a candidate for tbo Beat in tho Legislative Council rendered vacant by tho death of tho late Hon. John Hodgson. AB 1 havo hlthorto not taken au activo part in public affairs, It 1B Incumbent on mo, hi socking your suffrages, to express,my opinions on the chief political topics of the day. It is now generally admitted that tho Land question can only bo settled by mutual compromises ; and as I am most anxious to see this long-agitated subject dis fiosed of, in order that many measures of practical mportanco to tho country may receive a duo sharo of attention, I am prepared to advocate its adjustment upon liberal and equitable principios. A constant influx of population is essontlal to the development of the industrial resources of the colony ; and, ps our gold-fields fail now to attract a sufficient stream of immigration, I should bo glad to see such appropriations of tho revenue from timo to time as would securo this most desirablo object. My views on the quostlon of the " Abolition of State aid to religion" aro that, whllBt to tho towns and great centres of population tho grant for religious purposes might now bo dispensed with, it might still bo continued with advantage to tho thinly-populated districts of the interior. In the event, however, of a bill for the abolition of State aid again passing tho Lower Houso, I should offer no opposition to It. With respect to education, I advocate ono general relíeme, In flou of tho costly and comparatively Ineffl. dont systems which aro now in piactico. I am prepared to support any measures calculated to conservo and promote the great producing and commercial interests of tho colony. Our altered circumstances render a rovislon of tho tarin" necessary, I shall, therefore, if elected, givo tho subject my best consideration on its being brought under tbo notice of Parliament. The incrcaso of our publia debt and tho stagnant st ato of our rovonuo necessitate the greatest vigilance In referonco to our publio expenditure,-and I would therefore give my support to any Ministry exhibiting an earnest desire to practico a wiso economy in all branches of tho publio service Io conclusion, I may mention, for tho Information' of those cleetors to whom I am unknown, that I havo been a colonist for 19 years, and that my interests aro materially dependent upon tho prosperity of the colony. I am, Gontlemon, Your most obedient servant, J. P. BEAR. August 15. I860._ Bank SoUoes. COLONIAL BANK Oí AUBTRAL hIA INTEREST on DAILY \ BALANOESof CURRENT >3 per cont. por annum. ACCOUNTS.J THO. E.
