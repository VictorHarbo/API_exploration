THE CITY OF NORFOLK.— This splendid screw steamer 572 tons and 250 horse power, appointed to sail about the 20th of this month for Honolulu, Tahiti, and San Francisco, is well worthy inspection. Her length is 172 feet and breadth of beam 30 feet. She is fitted with several saloons of which the ladies' saloon displays considerable taste, combining comfort, with elegance, and is admirably ventilated. The grand saloon is superbly arranged and can accommodate upwards of fifty pas- sengers, whilst the dormitories, baths, cuisine, and other con- veniences display an intimate perception of what is necessary to make a voyage in her pleasant and comfortable. She is com- manded by Captain James Green, late of the clipper barque Fanny Major, a gentleman who we feel assured will lose no op- portunity consistent with his position, to render a voyage in the vessel he commands, a fond recollection. Her agents are Messrs. G. D. Train and Co. The steam-tug, Young Australian; cleared and departed for Portland yesterday. She is under charter to go round to the barque Nene Valley, wrecked near Cape Northumberland, and to take on to Portland as much of the cargo, spars, &c.;, of that vessel as can be saved. Eight labourers have gone round in the tug. — Empire. Loss of the Charlotte.— We are obliged to hold back, for want of room, an extract from the Port Elizabeth Telegraph, containing the particulars of the wreck of the Charlotte, 586 tons, R. Afflich, commander, with detachments of the 27th regiment on board, for Calcutta. The vessel put into Port Eliza- beth for water, and during a heavy gale her cable parted, the ship drifted ashore, and 62 soldiers, 11 women, 26 children, and 11 of the crew met a watery grave. Captain Afflich, son, and first officer, are among the survivors.
