NEWS AND NOTES The London Dramatic and Literary Club recently gave a Shakespeare com- ' memoration dinner In responding to the toast of the drama, one speaker said Shakespeare seemed to have been a strong Imperialist In this connection, he mentioned that there was one little passage in Shakespeare which had not received the attention it deserved from commentators, written, as it was, 300 years ago They should say whether there was any pro- phetic meaning in it whether it contained any secret provision of our national policy to-day. They should judge whether or not there was a subtle and auspicious reference to Birmingham at the present no rent The passage occurred in the first part of King Henry IV ' act 1, scone 1 It ran thus I Oiuishiill What he' Chamberlain ' Chamberlain (within) M hand I Die wet nurse selected by the eminent . physician Gmdo Beoelli for the expected Crown Prince of Italy and recently dilly ' installed in the Quirinal Palace comes I from San Vito on the latest Hills and I niihwtrH to the name of Maddnlcuu dull She is to receive 26 a month during her stay in the Royal Palace and as a month during her lifetime after her discharge When her foster child will have its first tooth she gets £100, when it will be able to speak another 2400 and a similar sum when the Royal baby can toddle unsupported When her service ' will no longer be required in the (jun I mind she is to have 2800 There was an item of news some years j back that a certain lady when appearing as Leonora va "11 Trovatore" swallowed some genuine poison from the rug and expired in great agony on the stage The mistake seems well nigh incredible be that how it may, realism was certainly carried too far in that instance Another instance in point, however, occurred in a performance given at Covent Garden during the present season Herr Mohwinkel who was playing Telrnmuiwl in "Lohcii gain" actually had his nose put out of joint by a too vigorous playing of the duel scene with the Knight of the Grail, us impersonated by Herr Know The latter has been a good deal chaffed about the affair, and the victim who takes to himself the whole blame for the mishap has gone to Germany. preceded we may assume by the injured feature According to the London "Daily News " the new German Cojnrigth Bill, limiting the term of copyright to 30 years which has now passed the Reichstag is likely if it become law to have more far-reaching consequences than seems to be generally supposed For by the Order in Council if 28th November, 1887 which gave effect to the Berne Convention, the author (or composer) shall not have only greater right or longer term of ojpj right than that which he enjoys in the country in which the work is first produced " This would apparently have the effect of at once setting free to all who chose to produce them "Die Meistersinger, Tristan and Isolde Day Hheingakl and D of Wor sure", while Siegfried and Gotterdammerung would fall into the public domain six v calls hence, and Parsifal at the end of 1912 The housewives of Eastern Canada find the domestic servant difficulty as acute -as we do here As industries open up new employments for women the supply utter h toils to meet the demand for help So Chinese have been employed in many Toronto houses lately, and hotelkeepers find the Celestial an excellent substitute for the old fashioned chamber maid.

Dining on the terrace of a Narbonne restaurant, he let the bank note fall into his soup. He laid the note on the table to dry, and a gust of wind carried it away. "A passing dog swallowed it, and the gentleman detained the animal, whose collar happened to hear his master's name. Indignant at his loss, the owner of the | note, sued the owner of the dog for lOOf. the value of the note. There was much legal hair-splitting, and at length the Court arrived at a decision which surprised most people, ordering the owner of the dog to refund the hundred francs. America holds the record in church construction just as it holds it in many other things. A church has recently been built there exclusively of vitrified clay, even the window frames are of the same material. The decorative features are white terra-cotta. The altars, communion rails, and front of organ loft are all terra-cotta. The entire ceiling is of brick and tile vaulting, the keystones being of terra-cotta, and the ribs of the arches and groans of moulded brick. There is not an inch of timber or a nail in the entire structure. Its acoustic properties are said to be remarkable. A good old story has been recently so vivid, and, as told in its new dress, it is certainly amusing. The scene is laid at night in South Africa, and the dramatis persons are two members of the Imperial Yeomanry, who are laying themselves down to rest. Says one in a sleepy tone, to the other, Jack, why did you volunteer for this confounded business?" "Why?" replied the other; "because I have no wife or kiddies to care a brass farthing about me; besides, I like war." "Well," rejoined the first speaker, "that is certainly curious; for I came out just because I have a wife and I like peace!" The conversation stopped here. The Paris "Siecle criticises severely the conduct of M. Etienne, formerly Minister for the Colonies, for his invertebrate action in connection with such matters of Anglo-French concern as the position of the New Hebrides and of Newfoundland. Of the former he says: - "England and France have made the re- empirical engagement not to establish their respective sovereignty over this group of islands. The islands are claimed now as a dependency of the Australian Federation by the British colonies of the Oceanian continent. It must be clear to those who reflect that in London a desire must be felt to present the coveted islands to the Commonwealth as an inaugural and gracious gift." Sir Blundell Maple, in the House of Commons, has been directing prominent attention to the imposition practised upon the Government with regard to the purchase of remounts in different parts of the world, and particularly in Austria. Commenting upon the hon. member's statements, a London journal points out that it would be interesting to know the average price paid by the various Australian Governments for the horses sent with the contingents to South Africa. It has been, it says, placed on record that these horses were exceptionally suited for the work. When the sixth Queensland con- ' tingent was mustering it was stated in 1 February last that "Mr Silas Harding was buying the horses in the Logan district and elsewhere, and getting what he wanted at an average of about £7 10s. per head.' 1 Smoke tinted spectacles are worn by the cattle which range the snow-covered plains of Russia. It was discovered that the glare caused by sunlight on the snow made them blind, and spectacles were fitted to them to protect their sight as they plucked the grass which sprouted through the earth's white mantle. We have heard of cattle out back wearing " green spectacles in dry seasons to make believe that every dry chip was a tuft of 1 green grass, but the smoke-tinted specs take the "cake."
