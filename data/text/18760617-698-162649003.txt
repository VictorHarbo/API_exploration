Edinburgh (s.), lor Torres Straits. The fine wooden ship Devon arrived on the 8th June from Lon don, completing her passage in seventy-nine days from the Lizard, experiencing remarkably fine weather throughout. Captain Hicks, reports that on the morning of the 2 1st March the Lizard light bore N.N.E., wind light and variable; passed inside of the Cape Yerdes and Canaries, and had a fine N.E. trade; crossed the Equator on 10th April in longitude 21*51 W.; the S.E, trades proved veiy light and were lost in latitudel9. S. and longitude 32*22 W., from thenoe light baffling winds to the meridian of tbe Cape of Gocd Hope, 'which was reached on 10th May. The easting was made in a parallel of 45* 8. with fine fresh breezes and splendid clear weather, allowing all bands to turn to and paint ship. The B.W. Cape of Tasmania was rounded on the 8rd instant, and since then baffling winds with a high confused sea. and. much heavy rain with thunder and lightning. Tbe Hawkesbury, from London to this port, was in comoanv in the choos of the Channel. The well-known Ebip Hawhesbury, trading between England and this port, arrived on June 11, after an excellent pas sage of 84 days. On tbis voyage she is under tbe command of Captain Carvosso, late of the La Hogue, and of his passage he reports Left Gravescnd March 19, and crossed tne Equator April 12, in longitude 21- W. Had a most tedious passage of 30 days from the Line to the Cape, the S.E. trades having failed alto gether. Passed the meridian of the Cape on May is ; from thence had a very fair inn of winds, with fine ?weather, with the excep tion of one gale. Sighted Cape Otway June 8, Gabo Island on the 9th, and entered .the Heads at 7 a.m. on the 11th, making tbe passage in S4 days from Gravesend. Daring the passage Mr. Leete, a gentleman who was making the voyage for the benefit of bis health, died of consumption, and one birth occurred. There arc two very valuable horses on board, one being the property of Sir ? Daniel* Cooper, and the other belonging to Mr. Andrew Brown ; both horses have arrived in splendid condition.

Tkjal Tjup'oi' the Taxba aooa-t is). — This fine little steam ship, originally laid down for a gunboat, but afterwards pur chased aud completed on account of Mr. Charles Parbury, for the intercolonial trade, went out for a trial trip on the 13th June. A number of gentlemen connected with the trade of the port availed themselves of invitations to be present, and as Compag j noni had orders to attend to their comforts, we need hardly say that tbe caterer provided an excellent luncheon. After leaving Parbury's wharf the steamer went down to Shark Island, then [ back to Fort Maequarie, before being tried over the measured mile. In doing this the first time she bad fair wind and adverse tide, with the same reversed returning. The average of the two runs was a fraction over 9i[ knots on 65 revolutions. This was considered very satisfactory, considering that the vessel was too light to give tbe screw a proper hold of the water. The Tamba roora is a very acceptable addition to our steam fleet, as she has large carrying capacity and very 6nug accommodation for a ? limited number of passengers. The barque Tuspan, which was reported as having foundered off Cape Byron, was the property of Mr. William Warburton, of South Creek. ^ The iron ship Loch Logan, which has been posted missing at ' Lloyd's has a crew of thirty-two hands all told. She left Liver- ? pool for Melbourne in October last, with a general cargo and no passengers, and not since heard of. — Home jffeKs, April 21. Lav-'oi of a Steaxkb. — On Saturday a paddle wheel steamer which has been built by Messrs.

The length of the steamer is*88 feet 6 inches upon the keel, 18 feet beam and 6-feet in depth of hold. Her draught of water is 1 foot forward and 14 inches aft. The build is of the Dutch class, and the coat bas a smart trim appearance, with a clean run fore and aft. the will be driven by a 50-horse power engine made by Messrs. Gainsborough, and imported by Messrs. Munroe, of Mel bourne — the first of the kind fitted in a steamboat on the Murray, but from their special adaptability for river boats they are likely to be generally adopted in the future. — Ricerine Herald, June 6. The White Stab. Ljnk. — The chief feature of the management of the company, and a very powerful element of its success, has been a determination to be in the van of all progress and reform tending to make Atlantic ocean travelling more safe, more speedy, and more comfortable. The management has been essentially one of spirit and of ' go,' reminding us somewhat of the bold and original commercial spirit of the Americans, who, it may be stated, have ever since its commencement made a favourite of tbe White Star Line, not the less because the steamers are close assi milations of tbe best American hotels, but because the vesse's are good and speedy, and arc just suited to the temperament of Uncle Sam's children. — Nautical Magazine. The ship Hesperides, 1338 tons. Captain Upton, chartered by the Agent-General for South Australia, has just sailed from Plymouth fcr Port Adelaide, with 464 immigrants, consisting of labourers and mechanics, married and single, and including sixty eight young single female domestic servants, the latter under the care of Hiss Chicken, as matron.

Tin; Sydney Marine Board held an investigation into the circum stances attending the collision between the steamship Maitland and the barque Britomart, which took place near the entrance to Port Jackson on the night of. Friday, the 2(-th ultimo The Maitland is a paddle steamer of 555 tons register, the property of the New Hunter Steam Navigation Company. She was on her passage from Sydney to Newcastle, and did not receive any material damage. The Britomart is a barque of 500 tons, regis tered in South Shields. She was on a voyage from Hobart Town to this port, in ballast, and lost her jibboom and figure-head by the collision. 7'he master and several witnesses ot both vessels were examined, and it was decided that the collision was acci dental. As both ship!- appear to have been carefully navigated, the Board did not feel called onto take any further action in the matter. Another investigation took place respecting the stranding of the Eliza at the Bellinger River. The Board examined the master and one of the seamen of this vessel. She was a ketch of 57 tons register, owned in Sydney, and insured ; in the attempt to cross the Bellinger bar on the 11th of April last she was struck by a heavy sea.on the starboard quarter, which caused her to jibe and go on shore ; she was eventually taken across tbe beach into the river, where she was repaired and dispatched for this port. The Board decided that no evidence had been adduced on which to Jooiid a charge of default against the master. With segard to the loss of the schooner Mary Ann Christina, a topsail schooner of 41 tons register, insured, and owned by Mr. Gardiner, of Balmain, and others, it was adduced that she was on a voyage with a cargo of coal from Newcastle to the Clarence, and arrived off the latter port on Friday, the 6th instant, as there was not enough wind to enter she stood off the land ; during the night the wind came in from the eastward and freshened up to a gale, with thick weather. At daylight the master bore up for the river, but ou ine to the heavy fresh running out, the vessel got ashore in her attempt to enter, and bccamc a total wreck. The Eoai'd came to the same decision as in the previous case. WESTERN AUSTRALIA. (From tlw. Perth Inquirer, May 17 .) Tin: onlv arrival at Fremantle during the month has been the Laughing Wave, from Singapore, with Straits produce. The de partures have been the Jumna and the Albyn's Isle, for Shanghai, and the Kebroyd and the Amur, for Singapore, all loadei with san- . daiwood, their aggregate cargoes amounting to about 1300 tons. Besides sandalwood the two latter vessels shipped a number of horses and sundries. The schooner Bungarec left for Batavia on tbe 25th ultimo with a batch of horses and cows, a large quantity of salted fish &c.; The A lice has sailed for Timor, in ballast, as also the Northern Light for MeUourne. The only other depar ture is that of the Laughing Wave for Port Adelaide, with pearl shells for transhipment to London. The Robert Morrison (553), londed chiefly with sandalwood, will be ready for sea this week. The Lctty Gales is still discharging inward cargo, and no engagement for her has yet transpired. The American schooner NaMalolc has proceeded to Flinders Bay, to take in a cargo of iarrab for Port Adelaide on account of Mr. Eldridge. We add the following items from the outports: — At Geographe Bay the Keaar, barque, has arrived from Melbourne to load with iarrah for Fort Adelaide.

The wreck near North- west Cape of the Austrian ship btefa.no, bound from Cardiff to Hongkong, is fully reported elsewhere in our columns. WRECK OF THE STEPHANO AND LOSS OF FIFTEEN LI YES. (From the West Australian Times, May 16.) The cutter Jefesic, 23 tons, Tuckey master, arrived at Fremantle on the 5th May; from thie pearling ground, bringing news of the wrcck of the barque 8tephano, 875 tons register, Captain Biagia MiloElavich,'an Austrian vessel, built in 1874, belonging to Fiume, bound from Cardiff to Hongkong, with coal. The only two sur vivors were picked up by the Jessie, about eighty miles south of the North-west Cape. - One is named Giovanni Jurich, 21 years of ago, and the other Michale Baccich, aged 17 years. The latter was a midshipman, and related to the captain of the Stephano. He is a well-informed youth, who, by tbe aid of Mr. John Vin cent, master, as interpreter, gave the following particulars:— The Stephano'6 crew numbend seventeen, including the captain Bnd an English boy named Henry Grosse. The vessel struck the reef about eight miles south of tbe North-west Cape at 2 p.m., 27 th October, 1875. The land had been seen the day before. It was very dark at the time of the wreck. The vessel was steering by her compass north by east, and at the time she struck was going at the rate of twelve knots an . hour; some of her studding sails were 6et; she lasted about two hours on the teef. and then turned bottom upwards and broke up ; some of the wreck floated ashore. The boats were attempted to be lowered, but they were cither dashed to pieces or capsized. The English boy was in one of these, and also the captain, who perished with five others, including one afterwards found dead on the beach. Ten of the crew reached the shore alive, eight on pieces of timber and two on the keel of a boat ; at first they only mustered nine. They existed three days on whatever they could pick up from the wreck. During this time the natives came and showed them some' water, and gave them fish, and handed the mate of the Stephano, who was one of the number alive at that time, a portion of a chart they had picked up belonging to the vessel ; by the aid of this the crew started for the Gascoyne, and after proceeding twenty miles they met another of the crew, who was supposed to have been carried south by the current. He had hidden' himself for several days, in the bush and satisfied his hunger wth wild flowers. He was the first man who died; his death took place on Christmas morning, and another died in the evening of the same day. The whole of the number managed to reach Cape Cuvier, and not finding water, they all returned to the well shown them by the natives. Here they remained for full a month ^without seeing any natives, and eating nothing but raw shellfish. When one day another lot of blacks made their appearance; but they were not so generous as the tret. Their women refused to give any fish away, and the black party very soon left; they did not threaten or offer any violence. Several other parties of natives came afterwards; some were kinder than others. Towards the end of February the number of the crew had been gradually reduced to four ; two of these 600n after died. Six of the poor fellows were buried ; but at tbe death of the last two, the survivors were too weak to bury them, and ' the natives, who had returned, were very frightened of the bodies, and would not go near them. Soon after this tbe natives left, taking Baccich and Jurich with them. They were too weak to walk, and the men and women took it in turns to carry them, wandering from one place to another. On one occasion they came across quite a hundred native men and women in one party, who, though they seemed to inquire about them, did not attempt any violence. By degrees theparty who had taken charge of the two young fellows became quite attached to them and tried to cheer them up in various ways, sometimes by patting them on the back and playing with them, and on other occasions by say ing,1' White fellar Charley Tuckey come soon now, and take you TienTsin.' At the time, Baccich said he could not understand wlwit wits meant by *? Charley Turkey.' Tlic'tfiryiring nun- were resfcued by Mr. Tdckey on April 18. ? ?. -? . NEWCASTLE. . .
