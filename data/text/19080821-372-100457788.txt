I bare been a ?offerer from Eczema and an irritating akin trouble since the age of 13. While an out* patient at one of the big London hospitals a doctor informed me that my disease was the result of looking after foreign horses. I hare had as many as 30 horses under my care, my father being a horse dealer and jobmaster. He (my father) was speaking one day to a friend of mine who mentioned that he -was being cured of an ulcerated leg, due to a horse-kick, by* Clarke's Blood Mixture.' I continued, however, to suffer until April 4, last, when my friend told me he was com pletely cured. Then I started to take Clarke's Blood Mixture* myself, and I am now com completely cured, after suffering and being disfigured tor several years. I am able to fol low my employment, and am very pleased to think there is suoh a valuable remedy obtain able for suoh a small sum. I should be pleased to answer any inquiries concerning my case.1'— July 17, 1903.

This is a good testimonial from the family Dae/or, the popular medical weekly, which goes on farther to say: 'It is certainly the finest blood purifier that science and skill have brought to light,and we can with tbe utmost confidence recommend it to our sub scribers and the public generally.
