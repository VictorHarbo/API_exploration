Extracts of testimonials certifying to the cure of a series ot prominent cases iu the above diseases having appeared iu this paper every Saturday during the past 12 months, I now beg to publish a testimonial regarding tho cure of a very serious and not at ail unfrequent com plaint. viz.. ENLARGEMENT of the PROSTATE GLAND, a complaint generally believed to be incurable except by a very doubtful and dangerous operation. This testimonial was not solicited, but quite spontaneously offered by the patient, who, haviug not seen me these last two months, came ou purpose to the city to express his gratitude. Unwilling to mislead any person, I distinctly beg to state that though my studies my knowledge aud my ex perience, guarantee a thorough genuine aud scicutiUo treatment to nli cases I take iu hand, 1 do not call my self a legally qualified medical practitioner, leaving it in all repose to my numerous patients, especially to those who previously tried in vain no uiany other treatments, and tins is by far the majority, to decide about my gene ral aud special qualifications. A. BRONNER, Specialist in Skin Diseases. Austral- building, 117 Collins-street, 16th August, 1895. To Mr. A. Bronnor, Specialist in Skin Diseases. Dear Sir,— Wishing to make known to other sufferers where, in csfie of need, they can find genuine treatment, I write you thcie lines, briefly stating the history of my cam, for pub- liihing purposes. 1 am now 50 yearn of age, und suffered thu last seven years from enlargement of ih>- prostate gland and connected debility of bladder aud kidneys. During this timo 1 was under thu trca'.mont of some of our moot eminent medical men (altogether seyen). amongst them the late Dr. Beaticy ; following their treat ment with the strictest care, but never receiving uny benefit from them. MY LIFE WAS a MidERY to ME. Following Mr. Robertson's ndvico, I placed myself under your treatment at the end of January this year, with the result that my condition immediately improved, and that sluce -the end of May 1 consider myself thoroughly cured, being now in the best of health. Though I don't wish my name to appear in print, 1 feel it my duty to strongly recommend any person suffering from a similar complaint to place himself under your treatment, and Mr. Robertson, of No. 415 Bonrke-street, who knows all the details ot my cuae, will kindly certify to its veracity. .1 am, doar Mr. Bronner, Yours gratefully, 13th Aueust, 1895. N'N' n&ving; myself been cured by Mr. Bronner from very serious sufferings similar to the above described, for which I had been moro than 3 years under uiediCAl treat ment, alio without any benefit, though at an expense of over £400, 1 tako the greatest pleasure to certify herewith tolhc veracity nftheubove letter, theoriglnsl having been brought to me by tho writer himself, a highly respected pensioner of the State.
