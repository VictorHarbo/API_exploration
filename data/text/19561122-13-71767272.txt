RUSSIA LETS MOTHER GO TO MORWELL CANBERRA, Wednesday: "Wonderful news/' Mr. Townley, Immigration Minister, said tonight announcing that the Soviet Government was allowing a 56-year-old woman to join her daughter and son-in-law in Morwell. 1 This was tlie first result of the Aus f tralian Government's appeal to Marshal ! Bulganin and Mr. Krushchev early this year to help reunite migrant families. Mr. Townley said the woman was Mrs. Lidia Himmelfarm, from the Don Basin, who was coming to join Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Van Acker, of South st., Denhams, Morwell. Mrs. Himmelfarb would probably leave Mos cow on Saturday and arrive at Copenhagen in time to join a charter plane leaving there on December 1 with 74 Danish migrants for Aus tralia. "It is appropriate that Mrs. Himmelfarb will arrive in Melbourne at the height of the Olympic Games, in which Russia is participat ing, and which offers a field for international goodwill," Mr. Townley said. Australia had sent the names of 716 relatives of migrants in Australia to Communist countries, in cluding 153 in Russia. If Russia allowed all these people to leave, some would have to travel between 1,500 and 3,000 miles in Russia and Europe before they em barked on ships and planes I for Australia. ; "The decision to allow' 1 Mrs. Himmelfarb to leave is , the first result of the Go ยก vernment's "Operation Re I union," Mr. Townley said. ! .
