COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE THE MAILS'. The RMS Pers, Captain R. Methven, with the mails for China, India, and Europa, left the bay on Thursday afternoon, the 4th ult., r The R.M.S S. China, Captain G. S Brooks, with the mails from England and the East; arrived in Hobson's Bay on Saturday, the 13th ult. - The Somerset, with the Torres Straits mails from China, Singapore, and Java, reached Sydney. On the 8th hit The City of Melbourne, with the American and Californian, mails arrived at Sydney on the 9th ult STATE OF TBAfaE ( During the month now closed business has been quiet, and unmarked by anything of an exciting or interesting character There has been scarcely room for speculation, even if there had been any inclina- tion to indulge in the feeling, and business throughout has been, restricted to supplying ordinary requirements. On more than one occasion the monotony experienced was disturbed through the interest imparted by the arrival of the first shipment of new hops, new fruits, Ice,, but the impression made was merely temporary, and failed to stimulate the general market; to any degree of liveliness. An improved demand for fencing wire and galvanised iron has also been a noticeable feature, but that has also been exceptional in its way, and any movements which have come under our notice have been strictly confined to the particular article which for the time rose into prominence, arid operations otherwise in the markets have been of very little account. The very unseasonable weather which has prevailed, and the frequent recurrence of deluging rains, have been a great bar to business, as though we are now well into summer, yet the state of the roads in the interior has been such that the transportation of goods across country to the townships which are any distance away from railway accommodation has been made a very difficult matter indeed, and freedom of intercourse has in consequence been very much interfered with thus considerably affecting business. The heavy stocks on hand of all descriptions of merchandise have added in no slight degree to the prevailing depression, and the losses which have thereby been incurred have had a most prejudicial effect upon trade in all branches, as the system of importing largely continues to be kept up, while our means of absorption appears to be narrowing rather than otherwise, hampered, as we are, on the one hand by being deprived through our protective policy of an outside market to which we might send our surplus stock, and by the new extension of our market in the interior, on the other, through the cessation of immigration. A great deal of this, however, is owing to the pernicious habit of ordering so many months beforehand the necessary Benson's goods so much in excess of our requirements, and were proper care and attention paid to this department of trade, doubtless much benefit would be conferred thereby. The political situation has given rise to much thought and anxiety in commercial circles. Since we last wrote, the members of the new Cabinet formed by Sir James M'Culloch have appeared before their constituents, and been returned, with the exception of Mr. Jones, Minister of Railways, and Dr. Madden, Minister of Justice. This latter circumstance, however, has not prevented the Government from meeting Parliament, and about eight days ago the financial statement was delivered by the Premier. The description which, in the first place, Sir James gave of the state in which he found our finances in the Treasury ought tohavearouaedindignation-alarm, it scarcely could cause, the elastic nature of our resources being such that no apprehension need be felt on that score, but unless a different system is pursued by future Governments the matter may some day be allowed to go too far, and our credit be injured. The main feature of the present budget is a deficit of £180,873, which is proposed to be met by a tax of 25 per cent on all incomes exceeding £500, the sum named being first deducted in all cases ; a tax of 5 per cent on all town properties over the annual value of £80, this sum being deducted in all cases ; a tax of 5 per cent on all country properties of the annual value of £80 and under £200, and a tax of 74 on all country properties exceeding the value of £200 per annum, the sums stated being in all cases first deducted, and the respective rates mentioned charged on the balance over and above. A tax of 2 per cent, on bank notes and a charge of 6 to 10 per cent, on all real and personal property of deceased persons beginning at £30,000. Sir James proposes to exempt from duty goods to the value of £1,065,977, returning a revenue of £113,894 This measure, however, is not to come into force until the 30th of June next, and the articles are not to embrace anything of a protective character, in this respect coming far short of the progressive and liberal measure proposed by Mr. Service. There appears, however, to have been no option left, Mr. Berry having so stumped the country and aroused the protection cry. The debate on the budget is now going on, and the result may not be ascertained before the present mail leaves. The wool sales have gone off steadily throughout the month, and the various auctioneers have succeeded in disposing of 26,711 balee altogether. The attendance has been exceedingly good and competition well sustained, though the stimulating effect experienced during the lost two years by the operation of American buyers has been com- pletely wanting this year. Satisfactory prices have been ruling all the month, but towards the close an easier feeling has been allowed to prevail. It gives us much pleasure to be able to state that not a single failure of any importance has occurred all the month. We are not and cannot possibly be free from the small town and country insolvencies, involving at most a few hundred pounds, which are occuring weekly, but we are led to understand that country bills are much better met ; there are fewer renewals or demands for assistance, and in this respect, at least, confidence appears more firmly established. Transactions in the general markets have been moderate. In bulk ales there has been nothing whatever doing. Bottled ales have been quiet, but on one occasion 6,000 barrels ofTennent's were cleared off. Bottled stout have only been marked by a moderate trade demand. Dundee goods, cornsacks, and woolpacks have been little dealt in, stocks being far too heavy to admit of any speculative movement The arrival of the Cingalese and North American has added to the previous heavy stocks held. h Candles have maintained firmness, but business has been checked by the determination of holders to stand for advanced rates. Company are still quiet Coffee has not been marked by any improvement Chicory, however, has advanced 1d, per Ib., say from 5d. to 6d. Manufacturers of cordage report an improving demand. In fish, the only feature is the great rise in tinned'salmon-from 8s. 3d. to 10s. 6d,, and the quittance of one entire ship- ment of 6,000 cases, with large sales subsequently. In dried fruits, considerable sales of ? new currants have been made, and on on the occasion 900 boxes news sultanas were cleared ' off at Old.' .BreadstuffshaVebeen'very quiet, and prices have varied little. Feeding grains have been 'much' more Sluggish than usual. In the first week of the month 27,000 bushels oats ' changed hands, but afterwards the demand slackened; and very little inquiry has since been experienced. Blasting ' powder has declined. ' Hops have been greatly stimulated by the arrival of new Rents on board the Northumberland, and nearly the entire shipment of 580 bales has changed hands. In metals, galvanised iron and fencing wire have been noticed. Rice has been largely dealt in almost entirely by auction! The Emma Master's, with the Sea and in addition to the ordinary sales of Victorian refined, ? amounting to 1,200 tons; theatres Otherwise comprise the cargoes of the ltramaJ Muller, 'Andaman, 'fiancee Mathilde, DemprfSt, Lutchken, amounting in > all to about 89,000 bags. Peas have'àlaObeen extensively noticed, and besides the other business done privately and by auction 8 600 - packages beer Mary Ann Holman wore cleared off this week. The timber sales embrace the cargo of Oregon'per Merchant, the new deals perLuctor et Erdergo, and 16,000 pieces old deals, with other shipments Tobaccoes meet with very fair attention. Wines and Bums have been exceedingly quiet The arrival of the Suez mail steamer China at Adelaide was _talegrapbed.on._huraday morning, 11th inst., and this, Steamer reached Hobson's Bay on the 13th: The City of Melbourne, with the Californian and American mails, reached Sydney on the 9th inst.

The report and balance sheet, which were of a satisfactory nature, were adopted unanimously. During the year 1,377 proposals for the issue of policies had been received, 1,023 of which were accepted, assuring a sum of £270,722. The increase of income from such policies amounted to £10,390 158. The retiring died tors and auditors were re-elected. Victorian Ice Company The half-yearly meeting of the Victorian Ice Company was held on the 17th November at the company's works, Franklin-street. Mr. Murray Smith, MLA,, presided. The balance-sheet was unanimously adopted. Mr Murray Smith was appointed chairman of the board of directors, and Messrs. Septimus Martin and B. Wilson were elected auditors. A dividend of £1 a share was declared. The Mutual Store (Limited), This society, established on the co-operative principle, held its third annual meeting on the 19th November, at the Duke of Rothsay Hotel, Mr. V. R, Kendall, chairman of dr report rectors, presiding. The directors' stated that there had been a gratifying in. crease in each department during the half year. The sales from April to September (inclusive) had' amounted to '£11,078 11s. 8d., and the transactions with affiliated -tradesmen yielded profit to the store to the amount of £1,523 ". 4d., making a total dr £12,001 16s. Since last report, 33 members had been added to the share-list, making the total number of shareholders On 30th September, 420/holding 1,631 shares. The net profit for the half-year was £272 4s 11d., equivalent to 17 per cent, per annum on the paid-up capital. This sum the directors proposed to retain at credit of profit and loss account in reduction of previous balance. In addition to this profits rebates amounting to £138 3s 6d. had been paid to members on their purchases from tradesmen co- operating with i 1 the society. The system of affiliated ' trades - men had worked well, and the transactions had been more than double those of the last half-year The 8 there was now established I on a profitable basis. and the directors de. stirred to ask the co-operation of all sham holders in extending the' business. The chairman said the percentage of working expenses would be found to have been gradually reduced, the total cost of management for the past half-year being under 99 per cent, on the business transacted, and the net profits equivalent to 17 per cent per annum on the paid-up capital. The report was adopted. Dr, M Crear and Mr. C F. Bradley were unanimously re-elëctéaTHrectorfl, and*Më88>s. L. A. Moody and II.'.W.iDanby auditors, for the ensuing year. '' National, Mutual Life Association.-The annual meeting of the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia was held at the Atbenrcumon the 21st November. There were about 35 shareholders present. Mr. Twentyman presided. The secretary read the following statement of the progress made by the association during the year ended 30th September last : " During the year, 1,377 proposals for assurances have been received, amounting, to £370,392; 304 of these were declined by the board, or were not completed, for various reasons, amounting to £100 870; leaving 1,013 proposals, for which policies were issued, amounting to £209.522; 10 proposals for en- dowments were also received, all of which were accepted, and policies issued for them, amounting to £1,200. There were, therefore, 1,023 new policies issued during the year, amounting to £270.722, No single premiums were received, and the new annual premiums on the policies issued were '£10,390 15s. 6d. Eleven deaths have occurred, involving claims to the amount of £5,098 18s. 11d. The result of the sixth year's business, after providing for all expenses. and claims, is an addition to the assurance fund of £7,303 12s. 6d.; and the assurance fund at the close of the year amounted to £22 708 8s. 10d. The total number of policies in force on 30th September was 1845. assuring £552,785 ; the annual premium income upon which exceeded £20,000 and the annual income from all sources at that date' exceeded £22,000. The new business transacted during the years more than 150 per cent, greater than that of the previous year, and exceeds the total amount of new business for the previous four years. The cost of obtaining this large new business has considerably in creased the expenses of the year, which including medical fees, commuted commissions, expenses of investigation, lea., amounted to £5,805 Is, but this expense is small competed with the resulting increase to the revenue of nearly £10,400 per annum. The reserves made for future expenses, contingencies, and profit, before declaring any bonus, were equal to 27.8 per cent, of the present value of the office yearly premiums, reserves considerably greater in proportion than those made by old-established offices. The small amount of the bonuses applied for in cash (£180) forms satisfactory evidence of the confidence of the members in the future of the office." The report and balance sheet were adopted, and the retiring directors and auditors were re-elected. MELBOURNE WHOLESALE PRICES CURRENT. The Argus Office. Tuesday Evening. In the import markets, business during the put mouth has exhibited little animation, and with the exception of one or two specialties which have risen into prominence, transactions LAVO been limited to supplying ordinary wants. There has been nothing what cr doing in bulk ales. Bottled ales and stout have met with a fair trade inquiry. Dundee goods have been quite neglected. There has been little done in conical ks, and woolpacks have been entirely lost sight of Candles have been very firm, but owing to advanced rates having been required business has been checked In consequence and there has been much less doing. Cements have not been marked by any appearance of animation. Chemicals, chicory, coffee, confectionery, cordage, malt, oils, oilmen's "stores, provisions, quicksilver, and salt, have had special attention directed towards them. In fish, a large business has been done In tinned salmon, and a car HE Id embie advance has been established. Fruits have been marked by the arrival of now. How hops have also reached here, and the market has been greatly stimulated thereby. In metals, galvanised-iron and fencing who have improved in value. In rite, a large business has been done. Sugars have been moved off extensively. Transact done in teas have Uko wise been of considerable extent. TobaccotH have been fairly noticed. Timber is very deprived, and a further decline has had to be submitted to. Wines and spirits have been particularly quiet during the month. Ale and Stout -There has been nothing whatever doing in bulk ales, the entire stock having been exhausted some time ago. Some inconvenience was at first felt at being SO complete! Y deprived of all supply, and almost any price would at one time have been paid for small parcels, but the want appears n from other been much dealt in. Early in the mouth, Torment's agents, for the purpose of checking the accumulation of stock, offered a concussion of 15, per dozen on the price of their brand, and immediately 0,000 barrels were cleared off in parcels, but ha\lugsjld so much the price again reverted to that quoted before these tranfcQctions(v]^,,ll8,lc68l0pcr cent, equal to 10s.

Of AllBopp'e, which according to settlers hog ranged from 6s, to 6s. 6d., there has been little offering. Trade parcels of Bass's triangle have been selling at Dr. to ON. 3d. ; less money has had to be taken when parcels have been attempted to be placed. M'Ewan's, now that all the old lots in the market have been cleared out, is Boiling atOs. to Da 8d. for new arrival'?. Blood's is quitted at De. to 6s. 3d.

Foster's has been quitted at 5s, 3d. to 10s 6d. Burke's has been placed at 10s. 3d., and of Ddmond's pig brand Wales have been making at 10s. to 10s. 3d.

The Benson is now on, and If nothing dec, the trade demand at least ought to have been characterised by animation, but throughout the month only the most trifling Inquiry has been experienced notwithstanding the very low prices ruling, and scarcely any business has been done save when sales have been forced at auction. This is entirely owing to the Immense quantities which have been shipped to this port from Calcutta, and there is now a Mr large stock hold which there is no moving Calcutta atHIccS to 15th October received last mail report the Scythia, Voorn, and Greyhound as loading 3,070 bales of gunnies," entirely for Adelaide, but astray uHjit like that is as prejudicial to this market almost as if made direct At the auction sales from week to week Calcutta have been moving off at 8s. to 8s. 6d., and Dundeca at 7s. 6d to 7s 10d but the market is really so weak that holders and Importers have been ashamed to offer more than 25 bales at a time in this manner. PrUatcly 8s. 3d. has been asked for Cal suites, and 7s. 10d. to 8'. for Dundee, and a few straggling sales have been made at up to our quota- tions. Damaged Calcutta have been placed at about 7s. 3d. Bran bags have been in moderate request at f>B. to 5s. 3d. for large size. Gunnis have been very difficult to move at anything like a price, and only faulty parcels have been sold at 3s. 6d. to 6s. 8d. Bouts and Shoes. There has been little doing in these goods. During the last fortnight no business whatever has been reported.

Candles A very much improved feeling has pervaded this market, though prices have not gone to a figure which would cover the cost, even at the rate ruling in London before the rise, and certainly would IOBO money at the price now demanded, a fact which must be very discouraging to shippers ; yet though, an advance has been sought to be established merely to the extent of covering cost In the circumstances referred to all endeavours have as yet proved fruitless. Holders have required 11d, to 11d, for best brands, and 10½d, would be taken for others In less repute ; but buyers have unless actually compelled to purchase, refused cooperation over 1911 and so the conflict has been maintained. An attempt has also been made to affect the market by greatly exaggerating the reaction at home with the decline in tallow, without avail, however. Fortunately, the other colonies appear to be very bare, and some large orders have come forward, thus helping greatly to relieve the market. In the early part of the month tOld. an_i_0Bd. was realised for faulty at auction ; the following week tOld. to lOjjd. was obtained for faulty and sound, and last week 10d. was realised for damaged, about 2,000 boxes being quitted altogether in such lot-, while IDjd. was offered and refused at same time for a line of 1,000 boxes in sound condition. Privately, in tho course of the month about 7,300 boxes have been taken up in bond, to arrive and on the spot, a great portion being to execute export orders.

The market was quiet for the greater as of the mouth ; an impetus, however, was imparted I the arrival of the Northumberland with the first ship dent of now fruits ; the movement, however, was but temporary, as owing to the increased cost by steamer necessitating a higher price only trade parcels has been quitted.

Flour and Grain.- The market forbrcadstutTshasne been active, and values have had a tendency to wear ness. There has been a little fluctuation, however: the price of 'flour having ranged from £13 Up. to £1 10s the most of the sales cffoctedhavlngboon at from £13 6s. to £13 7s. 6d. At these figures the mont opened for business, and at similar rates the market now closes. Transactions, however, have not been of much account, and sales throughout have been limited to supplying mere trade requirements Supplie in the first part of the month come forward from the country districts on a fair scale, but during the latter part these have been very much curtailed, and the market in consequence has had a much firmer tone This has been more particularly noticed in regard t wheat, an actual Improvement of a penny per bushel having been established Infacoot the weaker fell in flour. But that has been owing to the fact the though the demand has been comparatively light, consequence of the larger millers being sufficiently Stocked, yet the supply of late has been short of even the trifling demand experienced, and for the last three or four weeks Adelaide descriptions have been kept out of competition by the proportionately lower price ruling here than in South Australia. Sales have been of a most restricted character, and both privately and by public auction, only the most trifling parcels seldom exceeding 100 bags In a line, have been move off. The price obtained recently has ruled at Os. 7d. t 3s 8d. for northern, and 6s. 6d. to Ce. Ojo. for weston: while Adelaide has been quitted at 6s. (k, to 0s Old Bolt Mount Gambier grown having been sold as low a Ga. Gd. Hitherto the price here has been too low to ad total Adelaide wheat coming in, but the quotation this week having fallen there to 6s. and 6s Id., sales c new wheat deliverable in December and January born at same time reported to have been made at 4s 6d t 7s. 6d., the probability is that prices In our market will also fall. Feeding grains have been much nog lected more especially oats, and particularly so during the last fortnight. The month opened with large arrivals of New Zealand, and during the first week of the mouth sales to the extent of 27,000 bushels wor effected, chiefly New Zealand stout and milling qualities, at up to 3s. 6d. and 3s. 10d. In the course of the following week the business done was very much flaltei.aitd still less has been done during the last fortnight ; most of the transactions recorded have reached us through the auction mart, few sale heating for the last two weeks been reported pi 1 vately.

For some time pass Stocks of Ball's have been accumulating, and nov holders would accept 7d. to 7d., but there is no! touch Inquiry. The value of Kalrncs has also declined in like ratio, and we believe that for a shipment of 2,000 packages cold this week Importers had to be content with Cid., and we quote up to 645. Of other brands there is scarcely any stock, and quotations are in mind). Hops -The arrival of the Northumberland with the first shipment of new Kent is the principal feature of the market, and though the shipment comprised USO bales for this port nearly the entire quantity has since been placed, close on one-half going into the hands of one buyer alone. The qualities have varied considerably, and while trade parcels have been disposed of at 2s. 4d. to 2s 3d. large lines have been quitted at 1s. 10d. to SP. A fine of 50 bales superior packed in tin-lined cases has been lately sold to arrive at 26. This week 40 bales Kent's and Sussex were disposed of by auction at from Is. 6d- to is. 9d. A shipment of 40 pockets American hops was taken up the. 8d. Under these circumstances business in Tasmanian has been completely at a standstill, and sales have been confined to the disposal of small lots for actual requirements, 18. 10d. to 2s. being the very outside which can be obtained for best qualities. Common to medium are quoted at 1s. 6d. to le. 5d. Half There has been little to notice in this product. A good trade demand has been experienced, and brewers' parcels have been selling at 11s. to 11s. 8d., while 10s. 9d. would be accepted for large parcels. In such quantities, however, few if any Bales have been effected, a steady demand for trade requirements only having been kept up. a Motáis,-Buslnoss generally has been quiet, and little activity has been perceptible Galvanised iron and fencing who have of late been more prominently noticed, hut with that exception nothing of special importance has come before us. Pig iron has maintained a quotation of £4 15s. to £6, but only trade sales have been making at the price. Galvanised iron, English ordinary brands, 26-gauge, are now moved off at £28, white best brands, same gauge, rcallBO £30. Bar and rod iron have been slow ; we quote £11 to £12 10s.

Fencing wire, which previously met with only a moderate demand for actual requirements, 10 days ago attracted attention, and the market was cleared of best brands to the extent of a few hundred tons ; the quotation is now Dim at £20 for No. 8, £18 to £10 being required for Nos. 6 and 7 ; other brands can, however, be purchased at £1 less money.

A very good trade demand, however, has been kept up throughout, five-ton parcels going off very freely at £18 to £18 10s. in bond, while small country orders have been executed at £22 103. duty paid. In other descriptions a very large business has been done, chiefly at auction, and within the week a reduction on Melbourne mill dressed Java has had to be submitted to of £8 to £4 per ton. Just as the last mail was leaving the Java description Imported by the Emma Muller was offered publicly undressed, when 210 tons were disposed of at £20 16s. to £21 duty paid.

Rangoon dressed brings £10. fault Trade in this product is confined to supplying ordinary trade wants, and very low prices still rule, in consequence of which come parcels to hand have been stored by Importers rather than face the prices now offered ; beyond the disposal of small lots there has in consequence been little to refer to in the way of Sales.

Sugar A considerable trade demand for Victorian refined sugar has been the characteristic of this staple, and though few large lines have been taken up, yet in the aggregate a very satisfactory quantity has been got rid of, fully 1,200 tons having been quitted.

MONTHLY WOOL AND STATION PRODUCE REPORT. Messrs. B. GOLnsnnonou and Co. report Wools large business has been transacted during the month, 48,220 bales having been catalogued at the sales, and 32,000 bales sold, thus making the total disposed of since the opening of the season over 40,000 bales. Prices for the best clips have been well maintained at last month's rates, but inferior descriptions have not been so Arm, and must be quoted a shade lower. Choice lots of washed have, as usual, commanded a full share of competition, and the boat clips of greasy have also been in good demand, a proportion of them having been taken for the American market. The total purchases for that country to this date have been about 3000 bales, of which the Emma Muller will take 2,800 bales for Boston, and the Skerryvore about 600 bales for New york. It is probable another vessel will shortly be laid on to take about 1,600 bales. Although these operations are on a limited scale when compared with last season, they are larger than we could have anticipated when the depressed state of the American woollen trade is taken into consideration. | The remarks we made last month on the condition of the clip have been confirmed on inspection of further quantities A large proportion of the greasy lots are in lighter condition than last year, but they are also frequently more tender In the staple, which may be attributed principally to the scarcity of food for the sheep during the dry autumn, The washed wools are in about the same order as lost season, except so far as regards the tendency to unsound staple which is sometimes observable Burr and seeds are fully as much or more prevalent than usual, but most of the lots have been freely skirted, in order to rid the fleeces of these defects The classing hoB generally been carefully done, and there is an im provement in the general get-up. some of the boat clips are in magnificent order, and show the perfec- tion of breeding ; indeed, it seems difficult to hollows that it is possible to make any improvement in them So far as regards the quality of the wool. There is a noticeable increase in the yield of coarse wool, and in some of the country districts, where the pasturage and climate are suitable, the Lincoln and Leicester breeds have been introduced very successfully as a cross with the merino. A larger frame and heavier fleece is thus obtained and although the merino is the sheep specially adapted for Australia, there is no doubt that the English breeds have, under special circumstances, shown more profitable results, and they are evidently growing into favour, more especially with the smaller farmers, who can thus utilise their limited areas of land to better adv&n; tugs. The English advices received by the lost mail were to the 1st of October, and they confirm the telegrams which reached here during September, reporting a considerable reduction in prices at the August and September series of sales. The returns of shipments reaRed in these sales are generally unsatisfactory, and up to this date there seems no sign of Improvement Telegrams announcing the opening sales of November, which were to commence on the 23rd ult., are daily expected, but owing to an interruption in the line they have not yet reached the colony, consequently the buyers have no later data on which to base their operations. < Owing to the showing having been so much delayed by the wet and unsettled weather, the quantity forwarded in time for February salts will scarcely be equal to last year, but much of couraodoponda on the packages roads by the ships, and on the date the sales commence. Up to November 14, 00,007 bales left this colony, and the Great Britain, s s, which Sailed onthe 27th ult., with 8 274 bales on board, will no doubt deliver her cargo in time, as also the Northumberland, which is appointed to Ball on the 8th Inst, with about 4,000 bales, thus making a total from this colony of about 74,185 bales. The shipments from South Australia to the same date (November 14 are about 63,000 bales, and from New South Wales 14,000 bales, to which may probably be added the AV Whampoa, s s., which is to leave Sydney on the 11th Inst., with about 8,000 bales. We have thus a total of 149,186 solos from the three colonies which may be expected to reach London in time and if the sales do not commence earlier than they did this year, probably 10,000 bales more may be added to the number, thus making the quantity about equal to this year. Attention has been drawn during the past year to The desirability of opening up a direct trade with the continent of Europe, and an experimental cargo, con listing of 2,600 bales of well selected wools, will be despatched In a few days, per Lady of the Lake, far Antwerp. Negotiations have also been entered into with a view of inducing shipments to Havre for the French market, and considerable orders to purchase have been received ; but it is doubtful It a commencement will be made this season owing to the plans having been insufficiently matured. It is, however, understood that the French Government is favourable to the project, and is prepared to offer special inducements in order to establish a regular line of wool ships from this port, and thus secure a first choice of the splendid merino wool for which this colony is so justly celebrated.

HASTINGS CnmxaiiAM and Co.'s Monthly Re- port.-" Season 1876-70.-Wool.-Tho receipt of wool for the month have been on a large scale, favourable weather having greatly facilitated transit from country districts. Since commencement of the sales on the 27th July, as advised in our last summary, public auctions have been held at regular intervals here and in Geelong. Up to date the catalogues have comprised 46 000 bales, of which 88,000 bales have changed hands. In Geelong about 8,000 bales have been sold. Growers in many instances have preferred to accept prices ruling here to taking the risk and uncertainty in shipping to London, whilst buyers in their turn have shown an inclination to purchase freely, consequently a larger proportion than usual of the catalogues submitted has been disposed of at about the values established at the opening sales. Quotations for all descriptions continued firm at rates given In our last circular until the 17th alt J with a slight decline was noticeable, owing to the completion of orders for February sales in London, The demand, however, is still active at the prices given below. From our list of Shipments Jewell be observed that exports show an increase of about 8,000 bales upon those of the corresponding period last year. Assuming that the first series will commence at same date as last year, viz., 23rd February, it is probable that the whole quantity shipped to date will be available but should the Bales be fixed to take place at an earlier period, as in the two hours previous, there will probably be about 100,000 bales for disposal, which will be equal to what was offered last season. There have been several purchases for the American market, but not to the extent of the large transactions of last year, the high prices then paid having in many instances resulted in heavy losses to shippers. The absence of competition from this quarter has been most apparent in superior and light greasy sorts, of which descriptions most of the larger clips have been shipped to London on owners' account. Some attention has recently been directed to the port of Antwerp as offering a direct market for our wools, and one vessel is on the berth by which an experimental cargo will be despatched. Freights are obtainable at 6d. for washed, and 6d. per lb. for greasy, per sailing vessel and Id. far washed, and 6d, per lb. for greasy, per steamer.

Cotton and Co. report :- " Wools Since we despatched our last monthly circular this market has continued very active, and a large business has been transacted. In addition to a consider able amount of operations in the Geelong marked There have been 22 public auction sales held in Melt bourne, at which over 45,000 bales of wool have been catalogued, and about 33,000 bales sold. There has been very brisk competition on the part of buyers, who displayed an evident desire to secure suitable clips at prices leaving very moderate margins on latest advices of London rates, and many growers who, in the first instance, were indisposed to sell at the decline established at the opening Bales (and reported In our circular by last mail) have since accept the position, and availed themselves of the advantages offered in this market in preference to taking thorisksattoudant on shipping to the London sales, superior clips, both in greasy and washed descriptions, having realised high rates, fleece wool inhljb.clas« condition (hot-water washed) fetching up to 2s. 4d. per lb., and greasy, of superior breed, reaching as follow 14d. per Ib., which pi lee was obtained at the sales at our warehouses for a lot branded ?

After the vessels laid on for departure from this port to arrive in time for the London February sales had completed their engagements, there was a manifest Blackness, and prices receded about 6d. per Ib., and the sales have Blnco scarcely presented so animated an appearance as at the commencement of the season. There has been an unusually large proportion of tender stapled wool this season, as noticed in our last ; the condition, however, has been light, and power grass seed and burrs are noticeable, ox. cent in the small clips from farmers of crossbred, Lin! coln, and Leicester descriptions, which, as a general rule, are much infested with the burn, as well as being; as a general rule, Boat In without having been skirted very materially depreciating their market value!

Stations -There has been a good deal of inquiry about this description of property during the mouth, and some large transactions have been carried through. We have several negotiations now pending which we anticipate will result in business being effected. As a noticeable feature we may call the attention of European capitalists to the fact that investments are being made here In stations by private investment companies, as is evidenced by the sale recently reported of the Till Till station in Riverina, with 70,000 Sheep, to the New Zealand and Australian Land Company, Limited. With the plethora of money and low rates of interest in the European morrow markets, it can scarcely be wondered at that the strong flow of investors is being turned towards out- Aust frailan securities, which probably offer higher returns than any other description of property in proportion to risks incurred. Sheepskins Since the date of our last report, prices, for both green and dry skins, have considerably declined the quality, however, of the) skins offering has generally been Inferior, which, to some extent, will account for the depreciation in value We have had a large supply forward, and the following are present quotations, viz.: For butchers] green skins, 3s. 3d. to 6d.; pelts, 2d. to 1s. 6d.; dry skins, 3s. to 63. each and station skins in bales, 6th to 7jd.|por,lb.

During the early part of the period since on: summary the attractions of the spring race m» interfered with business in the mining market Since then a good demand has been experienced transactions to a good extent effected. The parties on the South Garden Gully line, gender have all received favourable notice In consequence the richness of the stone discovered in the lion derry mine. This company have had the sole yield of 1,090 oz gold from their first crushing of tons quartz, and further rich yields are confide expected, the root, though small, continuing to s gold freely. Shares in the Londonderry Company Tribute and In Gordon's Tribute have risen over 60 cent., and the companies further south have advanced, though to a less extent. The improver. has given great satisfaction in Melbourne, a ideal of money having been invested in these in by Melbourne shareholders. The news of the body decision of the Privy Council in the share forfol Sulla appealed by the Garden Gully United Oom; caused a temporary fall in the market value of shores, but not nearly to the extent which many anticipated, and they have since quite recovered amount of the fall. As, however, other similar s are pending, the company have decided not to do any more dividends till too reserve fund he suffice to meet all claims, and the price will probably rest a little for a time at least The Pandora, Victory, Unity companies have all advanced In prices, close firm. With the exception of the hon and companies, which have had good support, tow of other Sandhurst companies have had much extent: and as is usual in such circumstances prices 1: generally been in favour of the buyer. Magdala 0 pony, Stawell, have had a fluctuating market favourable report from the mining manager Indo some speculative transactions, and a large rise t place in market rates, and though the full adye has not been maintained, they chose a g deal higher than last month. The mail will probably be unsteady till a proper trial of stone is made by crushing, and this seems all distant prospect. Newington have had motor business at about full previous prices. The n from this mine Is anxiously looked for, as it is then they are about the depth at which the continuation the North Cross Reef should be met with. LI business has been done in other Stawell compoo Eaglehawk Limited and Old Beehive, Maldon, h been in request, and the latter dealt in to a g extent at largely advanced prices, good-looking BY having been met with. Eaglehawk Union and of Maldon companies neglected. Specimen-hill, Day ford, have had good support. Euroka Cons Castlemaine, have risen a little. Walhalla com pal have had little business. Now North Clunes h been quitted at lower prices. The mining company of Ballarat, Creswick, Maryborough, and ot districts have had little Melbourne basin The market for investment stocks has shown much animation generally, but a demand continues for Victorian Government deb tures at previous quotations ; while for bank she the demand has been in excess of the shares offer on the market, and rather higher rates rule at etc. The City of Melbourne Bank have made the process arrangements, and are now a bank of issue.

ALFRED WOOLLEY and Co. report:-, " Throughout the last four weeks we have had a steady influx of tonnage, which has supplied the place of the numerous departures, and kept our harbour well filled with shipping. We have no marked improvement to report in business, as freights' remain without material alteration, the only notice' able feature being an increase of transactions, and a firmer feeling generally prevailing. Tile engagements' have been rather diversified in character, under-. brace charters for stock, wool, guano, cooks, and the first of this season's cereals from South Australia to { England. For the last-named trade there is a model note inquiry for Iron vessels, at our quotations, which I should Increase by reason of the very large crop of (the wheat there, unless the growers withhold It for high prices, or in the hope of coercing ships to accept low rates of freight, which theymaydowithvoasolson the spot, but we scarcely think it can extend hot and that, inflow of the greatly improved freight advices from Calcutta and other ports by latest telegrams IV c are therefore of opinion that South Australian grain freights must advance It steady shipments are to go forward to England. The coal trade would scorn to be at its dullest, and " a reaction does not speedily Bet in, the deportation will seriously diminish, and very probably bring about its own remedy In the necessary reduction of the price of coal next year ' For London The following vessels have cleared with full cargoes, viz., Shannon, Lincolnshire, City of Agra, Juliet, Ben Ledi, Ben Cruachan, Miltiades, Loch Ard, Gicelan, Macduff, Moravian, Holmsdale, City of Florence, Ben Lomond, Renown, Achilles, Loch Katrine, and Sam Mendel, carrying In the aggregate a 03,272 bales wool. Shipments to date of this season's { clip now amount to 130 000 bales. On the berth there ' ore 14 vessels, exclusive of the Steamship Northumberland, of which themojorityarolfllllog up rapidly, besides two vessels loadingatOooiong,and one of Portland Bay. Freights are firm at hand. and 1d. for steamers, and for t sailing; vessels at 4d. to 5d. per lb, with satisfactory prospects of their being fully upheld throughout the season, the tonnage on the way and advised as loading being unusually light For Liverpool The Great Britain sailed on the morning of the 27th alt, with i 63 passengers, and 8,278 bales wool. For Antwerp- The Lady of the Lake will sail shortly with a cargo of ' wool. For New York The Skerryvore is advertised to sail next week. For Boston The KinmaMullor¡ was fixed to take on a cargo of wool. For Calcutta - The Cingalese sailed on the 20th July with 150 horses ; the Clyde and Evelyn proceed via.

Da Baty and 'Co report :-" Ulnoa our lajV circular to the Bell ult we have to odvlsogrott activity on the loading berth for United Kingdom, Um utmost efforts having been used to despatch vessels in order to reach London in time for the February wool sales, which has led to following clearances during the mail month: Shannon, 1,292 ; Lincolnshire, 1,026 ; OKf of Agra, 1,074 ; Juliet, 1,243 ; Ben Cruachan, 1,40 ; Miltiades, 1,462; Ben Ledi, 1,057; Lord And, 1,624; Grecian, 1,272 ; Macduff, 1,130 ; Moravian, DOT. Holmsdale, 1,267; City of Florence, 1,200; Bon Lomond, 986 ; Renown, 1,203 ; Achilles, 1,520 ; Loch Katrine, 1,200; and Sam Mendel, 1,033; 18 ships, aggregating 22,100 tons register, with 03,172 bales wool and other colonial produce, for London and the Great Britain, as., 1,794, for Liverpool, with 3,278 bales wool in all, 19 vessels, 23,894 tons register, carrying 00,650 bales wool for the United Kingdom, during the mail month just expired. This shows an excess over the similar period last year of 17,783 holes. Our berth is now occupied by 15 ships, aggregating 21,730 tons register, for the United Kingdom, comprising the following vessels, viz : Allanahow, 1,589; Ben More, 1,409; Loch Maree, 1,681 ; MerrooruB, 1,671 ; Rodney, 1,447 ; Romanoff, 1,246; Stratton Audley, 008; Thomasina McLellan, 1,788 ; North American, 1,075; Altcar, 1,288 ; North cumberland, 1,400; Melbourne, 1,857; Yorkshire, 1,050 ; Loch Vennachar, 1,600 ; Cityol Corinth, 1,200 ; whilst the Skerryvore, 348, Is loading for New York ; Emma Muller, 606, for Boston and Lady of the Lake, 643, for Antwerp. The rates for the United Kingdom have been fully maintained, abroad by the withdrawal of the Thoeeolus and Evelyn, and are quoted as follows: Wool- Old. per lb. for greasy, and 2d. per lb, for scoured ; tallow, 50s. ; leather, 008 back (ground), 60s. ; do. (chopped), 00. ; wheat and flour, SEs.; ores, 18.; copper, la. per ton of 30cwt; preserved meats, 35s. per ton of 40 cubic foot, per sailing vessel; whilst steamer rates for wool are JJ. and 1d. per lb. for greasy and scoured respectively. The passenger traffic is. as usual at this season of the year, not brisk, the favourite steamer Great Britain having left with a very limited number. In reference to South Australia, although the prospects are very bright SB to an abundant harvest, the low rates and dulnesS of inquiry in the home market for cereals have prevented any activity In engagements, or Inquiry to load at South Australian ports for the United Kingdom and only one engagement has been effected as quoted below, the rates viz., from 47s. 6d. to 50s, offered for forward charters, being too low to induce acceptances. The clearances for India embrace the following voasota:-Cin- galese, 698 tons, for Calcutta, with 150 horses and 60 sheep; Elcono, 1,181, oud Thessaly, 1782, both In ballast, for Calcutta ; whilst the Clyde, 1,140, and Evelyn, 1,079, are both under engagement to load horses for same destination, the former via Madras. The arrivals during the month have more than com- pensated for the heavy list of departures, thus fully supplying our tonnage market with vessels, of principally large capacity. Owing to the depressed state of the coal freights several vessels have left In ballast for India and the East, in preference to accepting coal charters at rates which would not compensate them for the delay incurred In shifting ports and loading. The engagements during the month comprise the following charters British ship Andaman, 965 tons, to load wheat at a South Australian port for the United Kingdom at 508.; German barque Emma Muller, 505, hence to Boston with wool on terms which have been withhold ; French brig Coton, 231, from Adelaide to the Cape, at 46?.; British ship Clyde, l,14},thonco to Calcutta via Madras with horses, £1,000, in full, ship finding water ; British ship Evoljii, 1,079, hence to Calcutta direct with horse, £000 ; British barque Cuba, 320, Fremantle to Shanghai with sandalwood, 55s.; British schooner Eunice, 257, hence to Colombo on private terms ; British barque, Strathdon, 408, Newcastle to Astoria (Oregon), 208.; British barque Halls, 377Noncastloto Hong Kong, 20p, Gd ; French barque Deux Freres, 420, New castle to Hong Kong, 20s. 6d. In coal freights were unable to report any marked improvement in rates or demand for tonnage, although we look forward to an early improvement consequent upon the heavy falling off of shipments to the East of late. The following are the rates Hong Kong, 20s. 6d. ; Shanghai, 21s. ; San Francisco, 20s.; Portland (Oregon), 200; Bombay, 20s.; Singapore, 10s. 6d. ; Mauritius, 23. Intercolonial business is very depressed In general, and rates from Newcastle can only be quoted nominally at 10s. to Hobson's Bay. in consequence of the depressed state of the freight market, there has been no inclination to invest in shipping. SeVeral VCBSOIS have been offered privately and by public auction, but for above reason and low news of offers, have not succeeded in finding purchasers, and there are no sales to report."
