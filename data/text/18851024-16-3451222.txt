TENDERS HAVE BEEN CALLED FOR THE GYMPIE LINE, which, when completed, will render this property invaluable, as there will be TWO RAILWAY STATIONS CLOSE TO THE ESTATE. THE SALE OF THIS ESTATE SHOULD WELL COMMAND THE ATTENTION OF SPECULATORS AND INVESTORS, i FOR ITS PROSPECTS ARE SIMPLY IMMENSE. AS THE CITY EXPANDS, WHICH IT MUST FOR YEARS TO COME, ALONG THE SUBURBAN RAILWAY LINES ' l WILL BE THE DIRECTION THE FLOW, OF POPULATION MUST TAKE, ' AND, AS SAME INCREASES, BUILDING ACCOMMODATION oats BE FOUND, AND LAND FOR SUCH MUST GET SCARCER, The consequence will be that in a short time land any whoLe in the vicinity of a railway station will bonoxtioliujioiaible to get, and if obtained at all it must certainly be at a long price. It is not difficult to foresee that this must as a matter of fact become a particularly busy spot In a few years' time some of these sites will be almost equal to the city for hotels, stores, and other baBtneas purposes Just consider what land must be worth at the junction of ihtBi) two important Unas, then. Why, the land that can be bought now at a merely nominal price will turn out to be a fortune to the lucky purchasers. Apart altogether from these promising pro spa the fencing, the Estate as a convenient stand for rural residence sites is not to be surpassed, situated on the site of a beautiful ridge, commanding extensive views of the picturesque country which surrounds, gifted by nature with many excellent qualities, which are not to be found in other places under such favourable circumstances, the auctioneers can recommend it as an investment which is bound to pay handsomely, and as the owner's' instructions are positively to soil, now is the time to speculate.

ARTHUR MARTIN & CO. have been favoured with instructions from the Proprietors to sell by public auction, ON THE GROUND, ON SATURDAY, 24th OCTOBER, commencing at 2 p.m. sharp, THE SHERWOOD TOWNSHIP ESTATE, comprising 268 Superior Residence Sites, being subdivisions of subdivisions A and 6 of Por- tions 06 and C of Portion 97, County of Stanley, Parish of Oxley, This Property is situated in the heart of the beautiful TOWNSHIP OF SHERWOOD, having long frontages to the main Oxley and Rocky Waterholes roads, two important thorough fares on which there is considerable traffic, with- in a stone's throw of the junction of the SOUTH BRISBANE AND IPSWICH RAILWAY LINES, the former of which passes right through the Estate, and also within a few yards of the SHERWOOD RAILWAY STATION, so that two Railway Stations are almost on the Estate. It occupies the very best position in the township. In its immediate vicinity are the Presbyterian and English Churches, the National School, fee., Sec. and consists of rich soil, capable of growing fruit and vegetables of any description, so that the residents can have a splendid garden without the slightest difficulty. It is distant some six miles, and monthly return tickets cost only 3d. a day from the City, but at the same time railway communication brings it close enough to meet the requirements of every- body in every-day life. The Fares for Season Tickets are much cheaper than Omnibuses or Tramways, whilst the trains pass so often and so regular that this place is suitable for the residence of the BUSINESS MAN, CLERK. MECHANIC, LABOURER, Etc., engaged in the bustle of the busy city during the day time, with the advantage of being in a position to inhale the free and invigorating country air. The immense relief and comfort derivable from a home in a quiet and handsome rural retreat, and the healthiness of same, which is universally acknowledged, should serve as a sufficient inducement to buy in the SHERWOOD TOWNSHIP ESTATE, but a still further inducement offers in the fact that this property must, from its advantageous position at the junction of TWO MOST IMPORTANT RAILWAY on which the traffic is increasing day after day at an enormous rate, MUST RISE HUNDREDS PER CENT IN VALUE. The duplicating of the line to Ipswich will have its effect on the value of properties situate any where along the line, and every month will tend to INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY now offering Another important point which must not be overlooked is that all lands within a convenient distance of the city are already disposed of. With the facts before us that the population of the city is increasing at a marvellous rate, and that building accommodation must be found somewhere, it can be seen at a glance that the speculative prospects of this estate are bright indeed. To those who are desirous of securing CHARMING RESIDENTIAL SITES removed from the hustle of the city, but at the same time convenient enough to attend to business, a better opportunity than the present will never be offered. 'J'ko most complete arrangements will be many in the way of SPECIAL TRAINS to convoy intending purchasers to and from the sale free of charge. Lithographs Ready. Title, Real Property Act.

Returning-officer for Enoggera. Brisbane, 11th October, 1843. TO THE ELECTORS OF ENOGGERA. GENTLEMEN,-As your junior member, J. L. Bale, Esq., has been compelled through ill-health to resign his seat in the Legislative Assembly, I now, in response to the request of some of your number, beg to offer you my services. I have taken a warm interest in political matters since Separation; and have noticed that the lines of political parties in this colony have over been very strongly marked. So long as there are men of opposite principles and temperaments so long will there be political parties and government by party. The party represented by the present Opposi- tion have always appeared to me to be fully alive to the interests of their class, but under the guidance of the present leader, Sir T. M'Ilwraith, features of policy far more dangerous to the permanent welfare of the colony than any manifested by his predecessors, have been put before us with a daring and political recklessness that almost took away the breath of the community. As you are aware measures were proposed, and a course of policy initiated, that would, in a few years, had he been allowed to carry them out, have so changed the character of the population as to almost, if not altogether, shut out Queensland as a Hold suitable for European immigration. The encouragement given by Sir Thomas M'Ilwraith to the pastoral tenants to acquire at a very low price large blocks of the public lands of the colony as freeholds ; his proposal to give millions of acres of our best lands to syndicate", to induce them to construct railways, of which they themselves would be both managers and proprietors, with the promise to sugar-growers, some of whom had secured large selections at much below their real value, that they should for that industry have as much " coolie labour" as they required, are proofs of the dangers to which I have referred. The policy of the present Government appears wisely to bothooppositoof this. Meanshavobeen taken to prevent the aggregation of large landed estates, and to try to secure from the leaseholders a much larger revenue. and while admirable facilities are offered for bona fide settlement, in accordance with the selector's means, the acquisition of land by him in blocks larger than he can utilise is discouraged. The construction and management of our rail- ways-the highways of the colony it is proposed to keep under the control of the people's Parliament instead of having some of them under the management of comparatively irresponsible and in some cases unprincipled syndicates. The policy of the present Government is also to induce a stream of suitable European Immigration, as large as the colony can conveniently absorb. Servile labour of any kind, is, I believe, undesirable because demoralising to the colony, and in many cases to the labourers themselves. No possible pecuniary advantage can over recoup the colony for a lowered moral tonic. As some electorates in the interior have found it impossible to secure men who would truly re- present their views, because those who would do he could not afford to give their time, No , I am in favour of the Payment of Mom bers' Expenses Bill ; I am in favour of the construction of branch railways wherever there is, or is likely to be in the near future, population to warrant the experi- ment, and am in hopes that there will be sufficient surplus revenue within a short time to allow one to be constructed within your electorate in the direction of Samford. In a colony like this, where the rainfall is so variable, if some means were devised by which water could be conserved, or, better still, if by wisely directed efforts, the great and of currants of water said to exist could be utilised, a boon would be conferred that would considerably improve the whole aspect of pastoral and agricultural occupations. I am glad to see that the Government is giving this subject their serious attention. So long as they go upon their present line of policy, of legislating for the colony as a whole and not for sections only, and manifest the same ability, energy, and disinterestedness in their administration, they will have my hearty support. I hope at an early date to have the honour of more fully explaining my views to you in public meetings. I am, Gentlemen, Yours truly, ROBERT BULCOCK. M E. ARCHIBALD McNISH FRASER, ALBION.
