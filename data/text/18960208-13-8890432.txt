Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to colds on the coast it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. it is most comforting to allay ing irritation in the throat, and giving strength to the vote, and it never allows a cough or mishap to become chronic. No house should be without it, as taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain. " Mr. W. G. HEARNE Dear Sir-Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven stars, during which period I was scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so distress- ing that for nights in succession I had to sit up I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other treatment had failed For a year previous I had been getting very much we worse, and at the time I obtained some medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment, until I became, as I am now, quite well Your sincerely', IK WALKLEY, littleness, Sydney."
