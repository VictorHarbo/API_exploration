OOMMEliOiAL. Aoe OIHcc, Saturday Evening. Export entries were passed at tho Customs to ' day on 8880 oz 5 Awt of gold, all for shipment per Water Nymph, for London. Last week ha3 lieen me of the very dullest ex perienced for some time past. It opened dull, \ without any movement in tho import market, and continued without animation until Wednesday. Thursday was a holiday, and since then business ' haj been entirely at a standstill. There has been but very little change in last week's quotations, but generally speakinc prices have boon rather in favor of the buyer. In consequence of two of the ? creditors holding out, — whose claims, however, only amounted to about £900, — Messrs. Miller Brothers have been forced into the Insolvent Court. Tho dividend which their estate will now pay will, it is expectcd, be something far short of 6b in the poun-1. Spirits generally have been ' iu little request. Geneva is scarce, but even tho best j brands do not reelise over 17«- Brandy has suffered .? a still further decline, and a lies of Marteli's dark \- lure taken place at 10s, with 2£ per cent, off for ' ' cjah; Tho ruling figure, however, is said to be 10a 3d. Ale and porter are dull of sale. Bass's No. 3 has declined to £8 10s ; no sales being re ported at higher rates. Bottled ale is also little inquired for, and prices are hardly so steady. Provisions generally are rather easier. The de mand for hams and bacon has considerably fallen off, and with these as with other articles ot con sumption it is said that colonial produce is com ing into active competition with imported goods. Sinclair's first-class hams are not worth more than from Is Id to Is ljd, and bacon can be bought on rather better terms. For cheese of really good quality there is a fair demand,, and prime samples of North Wilts have been quitted at from Is 2d to Is 3d. Butter is very little in quired for. There is a good deal of inferior in the maiket, and even prin.e samples aro not worth more than about lOd per lb. Sugar fully maintains our former quotations, with a steady demand. There is scarcely any Mauritius remain ing in first hands. The Victoria Sugar Company quote yellow at Mi 10s, and second counter at £45 per ton. The stocks of tea on hand are very largo, and none but the best congou is at all sale able. For this the price remains unaltered. Gun powder is quoted at 3s 3d. Coffee continues very firm; plantation has been quitted at lid. A quantity of that arrived in the Marion, in barrels, has turned out to he native, instead of plantation, and as stocks are limited, prices are likely to re main very steady. Light weight and inferior candles are easier, but Price's Belmonts maintain their value, and are quoted at Is 4d for 1-lb packages. Bice is hardly worth so much. The Formosa has arrived with 460 tons, and sales are reported at £18. The flour market continues extremely dull, although quota tions nominally remain unchanged. Town made is saleable in small parcels at from £16 10s to £17, and Adelaide sorts at from £17 to £17 10s. Wheat is rather lower. Victorian has been quitted in large parcels at 6s 6d, and prices range from this figure up to 7s. Adelaide is worth from 7s to 7s 6d. In oats there has been a considerable im provement ; the demand has increased, and prices have correspondingly advanced. Good sample* of Scotch have been sold as high as 3s lOd and 3b lid ; and California have been quitted as high as 4s id. A parcel of 10,000 bushels is reported to have changed hands at 4s. Danish are worth 3s lOd, and colonial from 4s Id to 4s 4d. This demand . for oats has also caused maize to look a trifle better. The supplies coming forward are also very limited, the crops in New South Wales having been con siderably damaged. The selling price is now tole rably steady, at 5s 3d. Oatmeal is worth a trifle more. Colonial is quoted at from £25 to £26* Malt has declined in value, and sales are reported aslowas9s6d. Really good samples, however, are worth from 10s to lis. Tobacco is unsale able, except in small quantities, for immediate consumption. The stocks on hand are very large, and there is no prospect of remunera tive prices being obtained for some time to come. Sales of Eagle have been effected at Is 3d, and Black Diamond at Is 2Jd. In ironmongery there is little alteration to report. There is a better feeling in corrugated iron, Scotch 24 to 26, 61t to 8ft sheets, has sold at £31. Quicksilver is rather firmer, and parcels have been quoted at from 2s 3dto 2s 4d. Ewbank's nails are scarcely so steady, and the demand has Bomewhat slackened.
