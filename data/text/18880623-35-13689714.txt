NEWS BY THE MAIL. OUR LONDON LETTER. LONDON, MAY 18. Too much importance must not be attached to the unfriendly observations which fell from Mr. Labouchere in the House of Commons on Tuesday night, when the ratification of the agreement for the Australian auxiliary squadron came before Parliament. The senior member for Northampton is a man who cultivates eccentricity, just in the same way as other people cultívate eloquence. His one aim is to say something different from other people. He cares little what other people say, or whether he is right or wrong in differing from them.

There is not much "exhibition" about this institution. It is designed more as a plea- sant lounge for Londoners during the summer months than as a display of Danish products. The gardens have been laid out in pretty style, there are two first- class bands playing daily, there is a Switchback railway cunningly constructed to run along an ímitation rango of Arctic mountains a theatre in which are pro- duced tableaux vivants from Hans Andersen's plays, and a real Danish village.
