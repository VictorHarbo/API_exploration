Glenelg, October 17,1881, 291 LBSBLS BAIL WAYS. G Who has called upon the Government to Buy either one or .both of the Glenelg Lines ? NO ONE. What warrant have they then in Taxing the country merely to carry out some fad of their 0T5E'' NONE WHATEVER. If the Government Buy the Holdfast Bay Line, will they reduce the fares on the Port Line to same as Glenelg Line for similar dis tance ? SCARCELY. so, i means a greater loss to the country to satisfy snob a fad. If not, then Glscelg people look out, for they will bs bound to bay both lines, and you wiil have to pay 25 per cent, more than you do now. Amalgamation—Who has opnosed the Ataal ga,Mii°i? HO ONE. Who asked for it to bo allowed ?—233 persons, and residents and regular travellers on the line. So long as the Government have the right to purchase the Holdfast Bay Line, they oaa always prevent any evils from a monopoly, therefore there is no justification for purchase of either line or pretext for opposing the AMALGAMATION. 291-3 E33 PE^ITIOjy for CON w.a_ STRUCTION of BRIDGE at the JJLD PORT will be for signature at Newell'd raofcsl, Alberton, on Wednesday evening, IStb iust3nt, from 7 p.m. to 9p.m. A GENERAL MEETING of those interested in the above will ba held at Bayers4 Hotel, Port Adelaide, on FRIDAY EVENING, 21st insfc., at 8 p.m. 291-3 C*-OMOHEKE &GBI3SSON; YUIsD.— The H.A.O.B.
