ALIEN IMMIGRATION; No Reason for Alarm. A 'Quota' Law Impracticable. In oider to counteract the widespread im pression prevalent in the Commonwealth that persons of foreign birth are entering Australia in numbers so large as 'to men ace the preservation of the preponderant British element in the population, the following statement has been issued by the Prime Minister's Department, setting out the position and pointing out that there is* no need for undue alarm:— The Present Position. For the three years and six months ended September, 1024, the average annual excess of arrivals in, over departures from, Australia of British peoples was 29,120. During the same period the average an nual excess of arrivals over departures of persons of foreign birth was 4,610. The average annual increase in the population by excess of birth over deaths during the same period was 82,000. Assuming that only 20,000 Britishers (a decrease of 0,120 .on the above figure) .came here each year during the next decade, and that 20,000 aliens (an increase of 15,390 on the figure above given) were admitted annually dur ing the same period, also assuming that the natural increase in the population re mained stationary, the British population ot Australia at the end of 10 years would represent 06 per cent, of the total, a dilu tion of the present British preponderate to the extent of only two per cent. In all probability, however, the number of British assisted migrants will, when the new agreement about to be entered into by the British and Commonwealth Gov ernments and- the Governments of the six States is in operation, show an increase over the number who arrived during the period above stated. T.he number of un assisted British migrants is unlik»ly to decrease. It is safe to assume that the gain ? by natural increase, which is gene-, rally cumulative, will also be greater in the ? future. From present indications, in view of the agreements entered into between the Com monwealth and certain foreign Govern ments to restrict the issue of passports or the granting of visas, it Is likely to be some years before the number of foreign arrivals reach 20,000 per annum. The Italian Government : have agreed to limit the granting of passports ; to persons who have been nominated by persons in Australia and who are in possession . of £40 each. In the case of Greeks, Jugq Slavs- and Albanians the British authori ties, at the request of the Commonwealtih Government, are limiting the granting of visas to passports to 100 per month in eath case, and visas will not be granted to per sons unless they are individually in posses sion of £40. The Foreign Element. The census of April, 1921, showed that the number of persons in Australia' not born here, or in the. British Isles or New Zealand, was 139,073, or slightly over 2$ per cent. The number . owing allegiance to foreign Governments was 48,529. or 0.08 per cent. During the past few years, and particularly since July, 1924 (when the latest Immigration Restriction Act passed by the United States Congress came into operation), there has been a quicker move ment of peoples from Southern Europe to Australia. During the 3J years ended Sep tember 30, 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign-born immigrants numbered 16,148, a figure representing about 11.6 per cent, of the total foreign born persons who were in Australia when the 1921. census was taken. The following table particularises: — April, 1921, to September, 1924 (3J years). Excess of Nationality. arrivals over departures. Males. Females. Persons. British ? 65,644 36,275 101,919 Italian ?

The United -States law came into effect on July 1, 1924. In the lieiht of this fact the following table, which shows the 'excess .-of arrivals over depar tures of person,* ,» of various European nationalities from July 1, 1924, to Novem ber 30. 1924, is of interest:— A . - ? to «5 II ' ? * t * I * & li fc'S f?*«JtnOfcHE Finns ? 74 68 43 39 6 230 Greeks .. ..137 257 143 182 205 924 Italians .. ..194 259 599 418 462 1,932 Jugo-Slavs .. 46 122 205 81 239 693 Maltese .... 5 83 16 71 46 221 Serbs. .... — 27 3 43 34 107 Albanians .. t t t 28 78 106 Totals .. 4T6.. 8161,009 8621,070 4,213 tNofc separately recorded. The average number of arrivals from the countries mentioned during the five months' period indicated was. therefore, about 842, at the rate of 10,104 per an num. It has been pointed out that dur ing the 3J years, ended September, 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foriegn persons was 16,148, at the rate of 4,614 per annum. The above table shows they are arriving at th« rate of over 1O00O per annum, a large percentage in crease,, but not a very large actual in crease.

If the rate of their ' incoming ' during the five months' period mentioned 'is maintained, 6,584 will have- arrived here during the year ending April next. The number of Italian and Greek migrants to Australia averaged under 150 per anuVim during the 30 years prior to 1901. .

The United States Act. In, May, 1921, the first Immigration Re striction Act was passed by the United States Congress! This Act introduced the 'quota' system. The quota was limited to 3 per cent, of the number of nationals of each country .who were domi ciled in the United States, according to the census of 1910. This Act operated for a year, and was replaced by the Act which came into force on July 1, 1924. This later Act reduced the quota from 3 per cent, to 2 per cent, of the number of nationals domiciled i:i the United States, as determined bjr the census of 1890\. ? The reason for this ip significant. The great stream' of so-calli'd Nordic im migration flowed to the United States before 1890 — the 'new' or Southern European immigration , came -later. The figures in the following table are strik ing, and show the great reductions effected by the new Act in the quotas of such countries as Czecho- Sloyakia, '? Hungary, Italy, Poland, Greece, Russia,. Rouinania. and Jugoslavia. Quota Quota Reduc on 3 p.c. on 2p.c. tion. basis, basis.

States even with its wide spread consular services found it extremely difficult to effect the quota law. The Ooji gress committee in reporting on this mat ter, said: — 'The most troublesome adminis trative difficulty encountered since the enactment of the 3 per cent, law has been the enforcement of the numerical limita tion. The actual, physical counting of human beings arriving by ship and train has been a task of magnitude. Mistakes have been made. Steamships have raced to port in efforts to land pas sengers within time limits. ' Delays -md disappointaients have brought hard ships- ' Distressing appeals for relief in individual cases have assailed the officers charged' with enforcement . df the lnw. Senators and Representatives have been besought to aid either in nullifying the statute or in mitigating its force. All these troublesome obstacles are confidently expected to be eliminated in the event of the enactment of the new Bill. The Bill contains provision for enforcement of the numerical limitatiqni not by counting im migrants upon their arrival, but by count ing 'immigation certificates' issuable at American consulates overseas. The plan, briefly, is to isBue for each nationality a number of immigration certificates to bo placed in the hands of intending immi grants as they obtain American visas- upon their passports. Each certificate has a validity of two months, to the time of taking ship. Therefore, the intending im migrant, having obtained his passport, bis immigration certificate, and his visa, is at liberty to proceed to the United States in the full knowledge that he will not be de barred solely by a qnota limitation. He must, however, undergo further examina tion at the port of entry, and be able to pass under the provisions of the 1917 act. It is expected that the number of those who cannot pass will be greatly re duced by reason of the preliminiivy inves tigation. There should be no arrival of 'excess-quota' cases, and there need be no racing of steamships. If this. Bill reduces to the minimum the number of arriving aliens that must be turned back, it will have accomplished one of its important purposes.' It seems to be impracticable for Aus tralia, which has no foreign service, to enforce a quota law. Another signiricant passage in the report of the United States Congressional Committee is the following: 'The decision by the Committee to limit admissions of 'quota immigrants' to 2 per cent., based on census figures of 1890, in stead of 3 per cent., based on the census of 1910, was reached after long and care ful consideration of every clement of the entire immigration problem. An impelling reason for the change is that it is desited to slow down the streams of the types of immigrants which are not easily assimi lated. Naturalisation does not neces sarily mean assimilation. The naturalisa tion process cannot . work well with the continued arrival in large numbers of the so-called -new immigration. The new type crowds in the larger cities. It is ex ploited. It gains but a slight knowledge of America and American institutions. It has grown to be a jpeat undigested mass of alien thought, alient . sympathy, and alien purpose. It is a menace to the social, political, and economic life of the country. It creates alarm and apprehen sion. It breeds racial hatreds, which should not exist in the United States, and which need not exist when the balance shall have been restored.'
