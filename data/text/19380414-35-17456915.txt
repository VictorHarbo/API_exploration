SHOTS FIRED IN PARLIAMENT. Assassination Fear. NAZI DEMONSTRATOR. COPENHAGEN, April 13. A young man made what was at first thought to be an attempt on the life of Dr. Karl Steincke, the Danish Minister for Justice, when he fired two shots in the Parliament building. Dr. Steincke was not hurt. The incident occurred while the Parliament was debating the new immigration law to which Danish Nazis are opposed. The young man was sitting in the visitors' gallery with a number of others of his age, believed to be Nazis. It was revealed later that the shots were fired not with the object of harming anyone, but to draw attention to Nazi leaflets which the demonstrator, Erik Westergaard, showered down on the Chamber. The pamphlets accused Parliament of corruption and misgovernment. Westergaard was arrested. Dr. Karl Steincke has been a member of the Landsting (Senate) since 1918. He was President of the Danish Insurance Court from 1921 to 1928, and has held Cabinet office for a number of years.
