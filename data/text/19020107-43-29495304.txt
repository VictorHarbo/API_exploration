Allu sion ia aiiide to this essential in a report which has been famished to the Blin icter of Agriculture by the commercial repretentAtiva or his department in London. He renarka that "although the Copenhagen committee has reduced the price of Danish butter by 4a. 6d. per cwt., bringing it down to only about 6s. 6Ji per ewt. iii excess of the price of Australian, it has nut al'ered ihe price of Australian batter to any appreciable extent. If by reguhr feedii.g the Aaolralian cows could be made pro dttctive and butter exported to England all the year round, there is no doubi | that there would be less difference between the prices of Australian and Danish baiter in England. The cessa tion of the arrival of Australian batter for half the year requires ? fresh intro duction of the commodity, and English I people an conservative iii their idea*. I and want a reason for giving np Danish 1 batter to tt?tt afresh on the Australian i when the aeaaon comes round." A mimuubu poem from the pen of Mr. Rudyard Kipling, inspired by thf position of affaire in South Africa, is published in the "Times." In the poem, whkh is ringing and passionate in tone, Mr. Kipling appeals to the British nation to face toe necessities of Imperialism by accepting the con scription system of aiaiutaining thr strength of the army. He condemns, in vie* of the serious obligations of life, tbe-is?inense importance attached to the pastimes uf cricket and fool ball. Finally, the "laureateof Empire" accuses the British of *' fawning on younger na tions" to supply them with meu who cau shout aud ride. - Thb Premier *nd Mrs. Peacock spent their holidiiys at Port Fairy, and the Attorney-General and Lidy Gillolt Hud the '•'■_ Solicitor-General aud Mrs. Agar Wynne are staying at the Ozone Hotel.
