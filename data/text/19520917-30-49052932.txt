MISFORTUNES FOLLOW A WEDDING AT SEA In March this year a young Danish shlp's steward, Mr. Karl Pedersen, and his bride (top left) were married in a small fishing boat at sea off the port of Hull, in Britain. Yesterday Mr. Pedersen (right) was photographed at Fremantle, writing to his wife whom he has seen for only two hours since their wedding. Mr. Pedersen. who is chief steward of the Danish freighter Norden. was attend ed by misfortune on his wed ding-day. After a voyage from New Zealand and Canada his ship .arrived at Hull and his fiancee came from Denmark for the marriage. It was found, however, that they would have to reside in Britain for nine months be fore the marriage could take place. A Danish pastor in Hull then came to the rescue and on the day before the Norden was due to sail for America the Pedersens were married in a fishing boat outside the three mile lhmit. Pressmen attended the cere mony with the boat pitching and rolling in a rough sea. The best man, a friend of Mr. Pedersen, was the Danish in ternational soccer player Viggo Jensen, of Hull City. On arrival back at Hull two hours later the bride left by car for Bradford to obtain a visa from the American con sulate. Because the driver of the car took the wrong road she arrived to find the consulate closed. She immediately returned to Hull and found that the Nor den's sailing date had been advanced and the ship had sailed half an hour earlier. Immigration officials and the ship's agents had waited until the last moment. The couple have not seen each other since that day and the Norden is now on a char ter run to Christmas Island for phosphate.
