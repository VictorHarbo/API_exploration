Jt was solely used for aeroplanes, and was selected after exhaustive tests had con- clusively demonstrated that it possessed greater tensile strength than any other known material.

Cessation of hostilities alone saved Ger- many from a crushinr aerial invasion. (3) After the war tile British Government had 40,000,000 yards for disposal This was purchased by.leonard Martin at 30 per cent below present manufucturing cost Daa id Jones hnv e been fortunate in securing a limited quantita It is now offered to the Attrition public for the flrt-t time.
