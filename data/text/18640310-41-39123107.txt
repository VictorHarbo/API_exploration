The SARAH is another addition to the colonial fleet, having been purchased by Messrs. Joshua Brothers, of Melbourne, and it is certain a finer bris has seldom made her appearance in Port Adelaide, being quite new from the yard of Messrs. Pile & Hay, of Suuderland. Her dimensions are 119 feet over all, 24 feet beam by 12 feet depth of lioliL and her capacity is such that she will draw but 12 feet when 320 toas of cargo are on board. In construction, the latest improvements in ship building have been adopted-iron frame, double diagonal planking, with fore and aft sheathing of oak; indeed, throughout her appointments are so faithfully executed that she classes ten years at Lloyd's. It is gratifying to notice such vessels bauW from the colonies; and in conclusion, it is equally so to meet old faces in command. Messrs. Joshua having selected for master one of the best men on whom such choice could fall; for in addition to hU well-tested nautical knowledge. Captain Craig has the esteem of a wide circle of acuuiintance. The brig has made an excellent passage from Melbourne, and came to for orders at the Lightship anchorage. . The Harwich was towed to the Lightship on Wednesday morning. . TheSPVRTAXisa very fine brig from Portland Bay with portion of her original cargo from London on board. She anchored on Tuesday night, and was boarded early on Wednesday The Adeline Burke arrived in ballast from Dunedin, and will load cereals as soon as she moor* in harbour. VESSELS IN HARBOUR.
