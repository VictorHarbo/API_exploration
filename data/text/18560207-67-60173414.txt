It is not my intention at present to enter into a de. tailed explanation of my opinions, as I intend personally to wait (so far ail am alilo) upon tho electors-loan then better ; explain them.' I would, however, briefly allude to one or two topics. . ' : : . 1 ' With respect to the New Constitution, es now the law of tho land, though in favour of tho elective| principle, I 1 am disposed to give it a fair trial, and if riot found to meet the wants of tho'colony I'shall be ready td support I a more useful arrangement in tho' selection of members for the Upper House. '" '';' \- j I ara of opinion that nil'mensures calculated to facili- tate the mea'tis of transit to and from the interior should be supported, as 1 bolieve they are' required to open out and develop« new sources of wealth to the colony. ; j With respect' to education, I shall support all mea- sures calculated to promote the same, being of opinion that the more* general diffusion of knowledge is indis- pensable to'the welfare of all classes. !

'¡TÍ* ENTLEMEN-^Hoving finished my addresses tc \JC ' ' you, in varieus pupers issued on Saturday, the 9t\t Fébruary.T think'51^ needlessly expensive tb keep thosi . addresses ' in''print. I think that the candidate who th dulges'in;muçh expense to secure his election pays toe "dearly for his whistle." As I intend, if elected, to do you all tho good I con; I have a right to study my own economy as I should that bf the public. Tho gigantic expenses incurred by some candidates would lead ono tc the belief that they were actuated mero by a vain ambi- tion than n; hearty desire for actual sen- ice. As long as 'thè practico is expected ' or. countenanced, a very riçh candidate obtains an ascendency over a poorer, and porhaps a more meritorious man.' And, believing the system, ó most' pernicious one, I shall try its effect by my own example at the risk of my prejudice. For these reasons; although I can well afford expense, my .ad- dresses will not bo repeated, trusting that. your good sense will admit the, propriety bf this novel step. Be- sides, I prefer coming amongst you, and U£til then! I hope you will do mo and yourselves tho simple justice.of refusing pledges. I trust, also, that, while offering to .serve yon, T shaU treat ovcry other candidate with tho strictest delicacy ; for, to say tba least, 1 think it highly discreditable' for ono candidate to attempt to exalt him- self by tho abasement bf the other; believing, as I do, that- mesi in !the aggregate, are generally just, and will yield tho honour tb him, whose sense 'of right is not only just nnd strong, but who is the most likely to fight the political battles of his constituents, while contending for their rights with that fearlessness and ability and just conception, which mark the champions of civil and reli- gious .freodbmi All Meetings T. may call shall bo pnblic, and 1 shall invite oil opposing candidates, for I only ask I what through my life I havo alwnys conceded myself, a j fair field and no favour. As for friendship, it should be ¡ out bf the question ;, your intorests and those of your children'bro too important to be tampered with. Merely ! to gratify à friendly feeling is to injure yourself, simply to please your, frferjd. ! Every mian who joins the Coun- cil of tho nation gobs for. good or för evil. The present crisis .is momentous, and as I lovo my country, I enly hope that the recipient of your important trusts will be fully oqunl to the magnitude of the task before him ; able; whèn necessary, not ' only to maintain his own ! ground, but to assail that of his adversaries, in the cause ' of freedom, and of right; ; i He who . approximates td this standard of excellence, is for you'to judge.' " I have the ambition and the will, i-and by God's help I will. . ' . . _ ' i ?

I BOW beg eave to redeem tbat pledge. Education I consider of the greatest possible impor- tance to this young and rapidly increasing colony. Every assistance should be afforded by the Legislature to foster the educational establishments at present in existence, and to encourage the formation of new one3. Hoods.-The present means of transit in the interior is most unsatisfactory, and far behind the rate at which the colony has progressed in other matters. The differ- ent lines of road at present most generally used should be put at once in such a state of répair as would enable the traffic to be carried on in a more satisfactory manner than at present. I consider the state of the roads at present a disgrace to thc colony. The. Lands.--Without indicting injustice on that much abused class, the squatters, the Government ought, as the leases fall into their bando., to reserve a,sufficient por- tion of the land fit for agricultural purposes, for sale to small farmers, and encourage in every way settlers te cultivate the soil, and prevent our sending away annually to a foreign state a large amount of money (in bullion) that would otherwise be circulated in the colony. The New Constitution, although full of imperfections, which the'.new Legislature will have the power to remedy, I consider a great boon te the colony, and hope its provisions will be carried out in such a manner, and in such a spirit, that we will show ourselves. worthy of the privileges conferred on us. Religion.-I wish to afford to every ene that which I desire to enjoy myself, a perfect freedom of conscience, and wish tp see avery person practise sincerely that religion which he professes. Everybody is supposed to belong to some Church or other-all baye equal rights, and let them enjoy the privilege.in the manner most conducive to their happiness. I remain.
