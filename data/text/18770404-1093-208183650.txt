The action of the Phosphodyne la twofold—on the one hand increasing the principle, which constitutes nervous energy, ana on the other the mo3t powerful hload and fiesh generating agei-i . known; therefore, a marvellous medicine for rent vating impaired and broken-down constitutions. I' quickly improves the functions of assimilation fa such a degree that where for years an emaciated, anxious,. cadaverous, and semi-vital condition ha. existed, the flesh will rapidly increase in quantity and firmness, and the whole system return to a state - of robust health. The Phosphodyne acts electrically upon the organization; for instance, it assists nature, to generate that human electricity which renews and rebuilds the osseous, muscular, nervous, membranous, and organic systems. It operates on the systen*. without exciting care or thought upon the individual _ as to the process. It moves the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, stomach, and intestines with a harmony, vigor, yet mildness unparalleled in medicine. The Phosphodyne gives back to the human struc« fare, in a suitable form, the phosphoric or animating element of life which has been wasted, and exerts an important influence directly on the spinal marrow - ana nervous system, of a nutritive, tonic, and in-. vigorating character, maintaining that buoyant-, energy or the brain and muscular system which renders the mind cheerful, brilliant, and energetic*, entirely overcoming that dull, inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience ih' all" their actions. The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are fre quently shown from the first day of its administra tion by.a remarkable increase of nervous power, with a feeling of vigor and comfort, to which the patient has long been unaccustomed. Digestion fc improved ; the appetite increases wonderfully ; the bowels become - regular; the eyes brighter; the skin clear *nd b Mil thy; ana the hair acquires strength, showing the impor tance of the action ,of the Phosphodyne on the organs of nutrition. . Finally, the Phosphodyne maintains a certain de gree of activity in the previously debilitated nervous system; its use enables all debilitated organs to return, to their sound state and perform their natural func tions. Persons suffering from -Nervous Debility, or any of the hundred symptoms which this distressing disease assumes, may rest assured of an effectual art-' even speedy cure by the judicious use of this • liost in valuable remedy.
