TERRIFIC SUCCESS TERRIFIC SUCCESS TERRIFIC SUCCESS OUR NEW PROGRAMME. West's two hundredth programme was submitted before a crowded audience. The sub- ject-, evoked great enthusiasm. The management has accurately gauged the taste of the pit turn loving section of the citizens of Adelaide. The star film was a drama, entitled "A Frontier Child. The scenes were founded among the Indians. The feeling of the natives treachery was a delightful incident, and the ultimate triumph of the father a judiciously treated subject. Pathe's European and Australian Gazettes contained their usual rich variety of interesting pictures. "The "Lock" was a fine dramatic item. The tableaux were especially beautiful, and the tints and tones added charm TO the general setting;. A scenic film of considerable value was "The Gabes Oasis" (Tunis). It was in colors. "Beetles" was a remarkable trick Contribution that greatly puzzled the audience. "The Mountains are Made" was a grand scenic film. Extracted from a lengthy and flattering: criticism published in the "Register" (Adelaide), September j, 1914. Musical Accompaniments by De Groen's Vice regal Orchestra. West's Princess.. 1?. and 2/.
