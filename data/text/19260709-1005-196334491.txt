i FEDERAL BUDGET « : Financial Relationships With States i SCHEME FOR RE-ADJUSTMENT Commonwealth To Operate It This Year FURTHER TAXATION REDUCTIONS CUSTOMS TAXES ON PETROL, TYRES, AND CHASSIS FOR MAIN ROADS MHLBoriiWK. Thursday. The Budget Ava.s introduced into llie House of Representatives In tli" Common wealth 'Treasurer .( J)iv En rle Pane) t o-n i i»h t . Messrs. Malionv, B'.nkeley and Metiralli nlTcred strenuous opposition to Mr. Bruce "s proposal to postpone private members' business to allow ol the delivery of the Budget. This motion was agreed to at 3.10. Dr. Page occupied 75 minutes in his Budget speech, the principal feature of whieh was tilt proposals relating to the adjust men) ol Federal and Slate finances. Under these, as a processor to the abolition ol' the per capita, pay ments,' the Federal Government proposes to operate the scheme lor one year in order to give States tune to re-adjust their taxation. in llic Bill to abolish the capitation payments an additional clause, will be inserted to enable the Commonwealth to pay over to the Slate Go vernments land tax, entertainment tax and estate duly for the year I9'2ti-'27, collected at the rates which existed in l!)2o-'2(>: also -10 per cent. of the in come tax at last, year's Federal rates. If the taxes actually collected by fl»e. Commonwealth for the State Governments in 1S)2b-27 do not reach the total which would have been payable on tin capitation basis, the Common wealth- will make good the diHeri'iite during R2b-2< by advancing the shortage to the State Governments this year in anticipation of the collet- tion of' the arrears. Dr. 'age to-night made the following supplementary statement re gard in his Budget speech. lie said last year s transact ions showed a siu- pltis of revenue over expenditure of ;C2J2<,415. This amount Avith the surplus of £ (i5:),529 brought forward gave an accumulated surplus of £2,78(5.01 1. .Of this amount £2,500,000 was expended in anticipation of a surplus, leaving a net surplus remaining of £280,044. in tl el ive ring liis fourth consecutive iBmlget speech Dr. I'age said on this occa sion the financial proposals of the Gov ernment were being placed before honor- > able members witliiu the lirst eight days of the financial year. It had been his aim to present the Budget as early as possible, and thus give Parliament full opportunity to exercise 'its control of the finances. Further stabilisation of Una nee generally was' assisted. The commercial, trading, and. industrial community was then able, at the earliest moment to make its arrangements conform, with the tie- i mends which would be made by taxation.! Tlq operations- of the States and of large i numbers of private persons were also in fluenced bv the scheme ' ot. Commonwealth.! expenditure. Although the i»i ftrriiLrititm j now included in the estimates ot the rev-1 epu'e and expenditure under general heads was, in his opinion, sufficient to enable , the House to ileal with the Budget, he ; proposed, a s earlv a.s possible, to present j to .the House that deiailed information -whieh.it had. been the practice to supply "iu the past. Last year the. division of the estimates into three part's showed at a glaiue the result arising fro'nt the ordinary admin-; istrative activities of the Government, the surplus or deficit' on business under-- takings, and the cost to the Common- wealth of administering the territories under its- control. A further division, niiglit now prolitabiy be made. the. j capitation payments and other grants to . the States were in no sense expenditure of the Gonitnon wealth. Hitherto these, paymoiits-.liad been shown under part 1 of j the estimates, Avliich provides for depart- meats and sei-A'iees other than business j undertakings and territories. The result gave an erroneous impression of the volume of Commonwealth expenditure. A- further division of the estimates had J therefore been introduced, ami would be j sliow-n as "part IV. payments to or fori the States.'' In this part would be shown j payments to the States, including pay-j mouls out of special taxes, special pay incuts to .Western Australia and Tas- j mania, relief to Western Australia in re spect; of the north-west, grants to States t for main roads const ruction, the cost of collection of tax"s for Slates, ami inter est on loans raised by the Commonwealth for the States. This part would show also the revenues specially raised for tlie States. as well as general Commonwealth revenue alloefited to the States. The financial operations conducted by the Commonwealth on behalf of the. States would thus be distinctly shown in ttle Com mon weal tli Budget. PART I. DEPARTMENTS AND SERVICES- OTHER THAN BUSINESS UNDER TAKINGS AND TERRITORIES OF THE COMMONWEALTH. EXPENDITURE, The chief increases in the actual ex penditure, 1925-20. over the estimate are as follows:— 1 nteresl and sinking fund on' war loans, war pensions ami other war servit-es. £311,405; invalid ami old age pensions, £472,382; bounties and otiu-i special appropriations. £195,348; ordinary votes of departments. £130,752: other in creases and decreases — net increase £.b4. ah/ . , Jotal increase, fcl .1 /4.2o t. The main increases in the expenditure, on war services are in connection with interest on war loans and war pensions. The estimated interest was based tut the assumption that, on the conversion of the £t>7,UOO,OOli war loan in December last, only one-hall' year's interest at the in creased rate would fall due for payment witliiu the year. The conversion loan, .however, was Hoatcil with the right ol con! ributors of new money to receive in terest from the date of their subscrip tions. War pensions exceeded the esti mate by £It5!,6U4. i The estimate for invalid ami obi age pensions expenditure was calculated on the basis that the increased pension of: 2/15 per week would come into operation ill .January. Increased payments operated from September. The effect of the wine export bounty, together with preference granted by Great Britain, enabled Australian niaiiti facturers to compete even more success- fully than was anticipated with the con tinental Avi lies. The boufiiy actually paid, dm to the increased export, was therefore £172.109 in excess of the es timate. An unanticipated amount of £26,992 was paid to the Commonwealth Oil Refineries. Limited, in accordance with the Oil Agreement Act. 1 £'"«. The b.-tlauec of I lie increase under bount ies ami other .special appropriations is made up of iron and. steel products bounty, £3 1 .(KM. nm.| sundry other increases ami flee teases. Of the increase. in Treasury expenditure. £518,183 is. fo'r minting silver t-oiit to re place British coin withdrawn from cir culation. Tin: annual coinage receipts due to the profit oil this replacement were £267,03(5 in t xce.ss of the e-,ti males. £25.4(5') Avas provided for science ami industry invesrigai io.tt. wher as when the Budget was framed it was content plated that this amount would be paid from a trust account. i The increased, interest on loans raised ( for the f slates results from the estimated ; loan raisings bring exceeded, litis money \ is recovered from the States. SURPLUS FOR THE YEAR. In addition to the expenditure set out I above the following moneys not provided for ill the Budget- of 192->-2ii were paid to trust fund in anticipation of a sur plus in the accounts nf the year: — Naval construction, £1.000,00(1; special provision for air services, l,tl( K) ; science and in dustrv investigations ami endowment for 1 scientific research. £250,1100; special pav- i nieiit for debt redemption, £1,000.000 — j £2.500,000. I There remained at the close of. the year a surplus of £280,944, which it is proposed! j 1o set aside for: — Prospecting for oil and 'precious metals. £100.000: invalid and old age pensions ami national insurance. £! 8(5.044. REVENUE. i The chief increases in the revenue were:— Customs ami excise. £1,008,883; direct taxation. £1,0(54, 124: coinage. ll'IR < ii '< iiiniiSt. A ii 1- 4Li I iii it unln ,'HMI.

PART II. | BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS. The receipts ami expenditure of busi ness umlerta kings do- not show any con siderable variation from the estimate. The actual expenditure of the Post Ofiice was £1(1.(554.880. being £558,445 in excess of t lie estimate, whilst the revenue was ,tl0.i.2;>1 in excess of the estimate the actual receipts being £10.815,251.

PART III. TERRITORIES OF THE COM MONWEALTH. The actual expenditure on the ter- j fit (tries of the Commonwealth was £4(5.547 less than the estimate. An amount of £50,000 was provided for the transfer of staffs and ofiice equipment to the Federal Capital: the general transfer was i not. commenced as was anticipated. NEW YEAR. j The Budget for 11)20-27 is framed in | a-cconla nee with the Government's pro I posals for the readjustment of the finances as bt tween Commonwealth ami States. . Moie particular reference to these pro- | posals wdi be made at a later stage.

LOAN EXPENDITURE. The estimated expenditure for works out of loan in 1925-20 was £1(1,270,014; the amount: spent .was £7,iiS2.08i). The items of expenditure in . 1920-27 are:-- -Lainl and buildings for the Post - mast or- Goneral 's Department and con struct inn and extension of telegraphs ami telephones. £5,110(1,(1(10 ; Common wea It li railways. £1.474.500; Graft on- Kout h Bris bane railway, £1.000,000; naval bases limiting 'lock, aviation buildings, muni- lions supply buildings and other defence works. £5s7.5(iO; advances for purchase of wire .-Mid wire-netting, £500,0(10; im-1 in igra i ion - -a d va ii i-es of passage money I £554 8.380; River .Murray Waters Act J £2;i2,50(I; subscription to capital of Amalgamated Wireless, Limited, £250.001; sundry works of various departments, I £1Ji..5.51: subscription lo capital of Coin-j mon wealth Oil Refineries. £50.000; loan to, f I ' 1" I' i I 1 I I" V lit \ i.H ( !

I WIRE NETTING. | With a view to increasing the carrying capacity of our pastoral areas and assist- 1 ing the Stale Governments to extend their seliemes for providing settlers with material for vermin-proof fences, the Com mon wealth Government last year under took to lend £3, HOC, 001), at the rate of ! £500.000 a year for six years, at coiices- l sion rales of interest,. 'I In proposals of tlie Commonwealth having recently been agreed to by several States, the Govern ment will shortly bring down a Bill to , give effect to its promise. J MIGRATION. j With tie' exception of New South Wales, all the Stales have accepted the terms of tin agreement which contem plates an. expenditure of £34,000,000 and the absorption of 450,000 migrants iu ten vears. To examine and report- up«u Ho- .schemes submitted, to frame and sub- | mit proposals for other undertakings. U , consider the best means of developing Iour resoii rn -s, lo investigate the condi tion of existing industries, and the pos sibilities of establishing new ones, the | Government proposes to appoint an ex pert commission. ' NATIONAL DEBT. | Tlie outstanding feature of the National Debt operations in recent years is, the sys tematic reduction of the War Debt.! Though new borrowing is increasing the . amount of the gross debt, the Common wealth has, since the war, practically limi ted its loan expenditure to developmen tal ami reproductive works, which pro vide revenue-producing assets lo offset- the i new debt cleared. Australia has £28.500,000 less war debt, to-day than four years ago. In the same period the net debt fell by £400,000, de- Spite the fact of the I'ost Office created over £1 (5,00(1,(10(1 of new assets during that time, and many other necessary pub lic works were provided. The gross debt, at June 30. 102(5, was: — War debt, £5504.54(5,(5455 : debt incurred for the States, £83,408,850; other debt, £70,48.8, total gross debt at June 30. 102(5, C45S,4455,U37. The net debt at Juno 30, 102(5. was £55558,841,470. On tin same basis, the gross debt at June .->o, j'igg, was £41 (t,d i u,,)!.)'), and the j net debt at June 30, 1022, was £339.U02,1(>5. j As the population in this four-year j period increased by 481,885, the net debt j of the Commonwealth is now £4/10/(5 per head less than in 1022. 1 These statements show clearly the im provement in the position of the Com monwealth. The gross debt at the beginning of tlie tiiianci: I year was £-130.048, 0fi2, the in crease during the year being £27,495,575. Of this amount. £14,5 1 3,5(54 was raised by the Commonwealth for the States. The gross debt also includes the recent Lon don loan of £0,000.(100, practically all of , which will be available for works In lie carried out. in tlie financial year now commencing. SINKING FUND AND DEBT j REDEMPTION. j Substantial contributions were again; made last year for the redemption of the public debt of the Commonwealth. ' The total made available during 1925- .in ror ine rearm prion ot debt was £5,495,909. DEBTS OF THE STATES. The latest particulars available of the public debt of this States are those for June 3d, 1925, when the deists were: — N'ew South Wales, £215,5131,110; Victoria, £128,445.5(55; Queensland, £9(5,389,06 < ; South Australia. £74,780,8555: Western Aus tralia, £(5 1,493,2(5!.; Tasmania, £255,894,4 J (5; total. £603,334,254. These amounts represent the gross debts, without any deduction for the substan tial revenue-producing assets construct ed by The States with the loan nioiievs raised. In Australia, most public utili ties are provided, by the State Govern ments. whereas, iu other countries, these services are, in a much larger measure, . provided by private enterprise. For this reason, the public debts of the Australian States are of a nature quite different from those of most other countries. In 1924- 1 2.), the State undertakings in Australia produeed a net revenue of £ 1 9.460. (ISO,! which represents the earnings available for the payment of interest on the debt. Tl... s.-. ..; .. . . . , . ," "(.in- si ii sing limns HHa.1 £18,630,9;) 1 . On all loans now raised by the Commonwealth for the. States, an ail- t ana I sinking fund payment of 10/ per cent, is made by the States to the Nat ional Debt Sinking Fund of the. Com monwealth. AGGREGATE OF COMMONWEALTH a AND STATE DEBTS. Omitting debts which are included both in the Commonwealth and in the State debts, the gross debt of the ('oniiiioii- walth at June 3d. 1926. and ije States at June 3(1. |«)g5, Vvas £990,(542,-1 19. Fronj .this there may be deducted sums held in 1 cash I iv the ( 'omiiioinvealth. sinking funds, and moneys to In repaid in cash in respect of certain assets. These total £90.749,884. Total Commonwealth and State debts, without allowance for assets created by the expenditure of loan moneys I on public works, £89!), 892, 535. The gross debt ot Australia per head of poiiula-' tion is £1(5(5. AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCIL. J he loan operations of the Common wealth ami of tiie States other than New I South Wales were undertaken during the i past year in accordance with plans made by the Loan Council, whieh was formed in order I hat the loan business of the various Governments might be carried on without dash or competition, experi ence has shown that the Treasurers, act ing in concert, ran secure better terms than if they acted independently. COMMONWEALTH BANK. I The Commonwealth Bank, which was! founded in 1912, and given central bank- ing ( unci ions and a board of directors in 1924. is intimately associated with) tin loan operations of the Common wealth f Government. The profits of tlie last three, years, namely. 1923 (£328,0(1(1 ) , 1924 ' (£2(51.(1(10). 1925 (£452,000) show that the b.-i ii k is making progress under nor mal conditions and under the new man agement. 1 he Savings Bank branch of the Com monwealth Bank shows remarkable ex pansion. Iu I91-). the deposits amounted to a./. -1011,0011; in .June, 1925, thev were ,t,lS,(i(iii.iHi(i: and in (he next six months they increased to £35,300,000, diiefiy as a result of the taking over of the State Savings La irk iu Queensland. On Decem ber last the deposits amounted to nearlv £44,(111(1,0(1(1. 'I hese del nils show sat isf'actory progress and are a cheering indication of success ful iiKinagenienl. Australia is enjoying a period of good finance to which the nmn-' ageiiifiit of the Commonwealth Bank has 1 largely cent rilniteii. . K-Ujaal CREDITS DEPARTMENT. . The Rural ('ndits Department nf the Commonwealth Bank is passiii'- safely J through its initial stages. Alreaov it e- handling wheat, frozen eggs, dried fruits, wines am osiniridium. All-gat ions that thi ll ura I Credits Department has been uu- able lo function in particular cases on, invest igal ion have been found to lie based) upon instances in which no proper secur ity fur advances couJd be given. The Act) requires thai tin; produce on which ;,q. va n i- os may be made shall lie placed un-! tier the legal control of the bank. Tliisi legal control may be given either by way of debenture or/by placing the produce in a store or on a' ship, and by handing the covering documents to the bank. In even j case then must, of course, be a sufficient 1 margin between the value of the product and the advniiVe. No good purpose would In- served iu taking uncommercial risks. It. is in the interests of the primary pro ducers themselves that the rural credits business shall be conducted . on a sound basis. : HOUSING. In accordance with the policy aiinouiiccil prior to last election, the Government, iu consultation with the board of the L'oni- J mon wea 1 1 h Bank, is preparing the details of a scheme to be submitted to Barliainent ' to enable tlie Common wealth Savings Bank to assist in 'the provision of homes for the people, .bofli by new construction and by purchase. For this purpose funds up to £20. (MM), 000 in all will be provided. Tin Commonwealth has already provid ed 28.813 war service homes, and this has assisted to meet the acute shortage of houses.- It might here be mentioned that since the War Service Homes Department, was reorganised in ,1922 no losses have occurretl. ' PART I. DEPARTMENTS AND SERVICES , OTHER THAN BUSINESS UNDER-! TAKINGS AND TERRITORIES OF THE COMMONWEALTH. 1 now come to the annually recurring expemliluie out of revenue for 192(5-27. Total ex-poiidituri is £49,287,443; cxpon-| tliture of previous year, £52,5184,247; re duction, £3,0915,804. Tin- chief items of decrease are: Naval ."construction, £2,500,000: special payment y for debt redemption, £1,000,000; science and industry investigations, £350,000; de fence equipment for air services, £250,000; prospecting for oil. and precious metals, 1 £100,0(1(1; ordinary votes of departments, £80,322; wine export bounty, £67,109; miscellaneous services, £49,027; additions, new works and buildings, £30,009; total, £4,432,407. From these decreases it will be neces sary to deduct the following increases: — Invalid and old age pensions — partly due in the fact that the increase of 2/6 per ii'iKil." 1 1- 1 i 1 1 f 1 4 1 1 In of i o n i sltsl nrif it i ti i en f i" I « l 1 1 l l l l I tl O l \ \ tl l tilll HUl UjJtJ (I I I for the full financial year, £747,618; De fence Department, £19(5,172; interest and sinking fund on works loans, £160,309; bounty on cotton ami cotton vain, £150,000; war and repatriation services. £51.300; sundry increases and decreases under special appropriations — net increase, j £30,204 — £1,335,603; net decreas-e, 1 £30)96,8(14. Decreases have been effected in direc tions where the administration is in a position to control the expenditure. The increases of (.'onimoiiwealtli expenditure are almost wholly a resuit of a policy, "which meets the legitimate demands or the people — as in the case of old age pen sions and defence. Tin contention that the Commonwealth r Government can substantially reduce the | cost of administration of the several de part meats may be considered in the light of the details now appearing in the Bud- get. The annua expenditure under the ordinary votes of the departments has, during the last, six years, been reduced by £ 58,334, notwithstanding that in the J mean time tlie population has increased j by approximately 60(J,U()0, anil despite the j fact tli iit arbitration awards have con sistently increased salaries and other costs in all the departments. Tn .1921-22, 1he cost of tlie Commonwealth depart ments per head of piqrulation was 10/9; in 1926-27 it will lie 9/2-. If the expendi ture iu 1920-27 were- made at the jie i capita rale of .1921-22, tlie expenditure would he £3,290,951, or an increase of £-196,810 over that eoiiteinjilat ed. This comparison indicates clearly that the. strict est .supervision is being main tained over expenditure, wlille at the same time the Government- is seeking policies. such as the amalgamation of the Common- 1 wealth and ytnt.e Income Tax Depart- 1 infills, which will reduce duplication and permit ol: substantial savings. Tlie pro- i posed adjustment of Commonwealth and j State finance will probably result in ad- I in in istrative savings to the people of A us |tra!ia ot nearly £1,000,000 per annum un- necessarily spent under the present dupii ca tion. DEFENCE. The five-year programme announced in the .Budget of 1924 to improve the arm v. Hie navy, ami the air services, and lo enlarge the organisation of a iiioeiiions ' supply, is being actively pursued. The bidding oi two 10, noil- ton erui-crs, two submarines, and a seaplane-carrier is pro ceeding. The Government has agreed to make a payment t<> the New .South Wales Gov ernment of £135,006 as a .subsidy towards the cost of a float ing dock at Newcastle, on the understanding that the dock will be capable of accommodating the new cruisers. During the past financial year a satis factory advance was made with the de velopmenta i services. Additional per sonnel will be enlisted during J926 27 to provide for the manning of the mibninr- j iocs, the cruisers and the seaplane-car rier, and for the establishment of a new Air Craft Squadron. The training of an additional quota of Royal Australian Naval Reserves ami Citizen Air Force training will continue., .Provision is be ing made for the building and filling of 111 /ill f ! 11 L INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS. Tin hope that the researches of tlie Royal Commission on National Insurance would lie sufficiently advanced to enable the Government: to bring down, during last financial year, a national insurance scheme iu connection with old age and sickness, unfortunately, has not been real ised. Accordingly, in September the Gov ernment obtained legislative authority for ; an increase iu tlie rate of pensions from 1 7/(5 to 20/ a week in anticipation of the adoption of national insurance. In addi tion tin statutory limit of income plus pension \jras increased from 30/ to 32/6 a week. This increase was additional j to the previous increase of 5/ a fortnight j made under the present Government in September, 1923, The amount paid in pensions during .1925-26 was £8,252,382. It is estimated tfiat an amount of £9,666,6(16 will be required fur pension purposes during 1926-27. These figures afford a convincing proof j inai iiic i oiniiioii wea ini realises us ouji- gations to the aged ami invalid members ! of the community. The Government, is i still of the opinion that the present method of providing reiief does not ful fil all requirements. 11 is looking for ward to tlie time when, as a result of the inquiries of the National Insurance Com mission. it will be in a position to pre sent to .Parliament a national scheme for f old age, sickness, and unemployment. j HEALTH. 'I lie recommendations of the Roval Coiu-| mission on iieaiin. wtiicli reported during last financial year, have been taken eurn- I estly iino consideration by the Govern- iinenf. If will not In- practicable imme diately to bring into operation the exten-j sive programme included in the rec.om inendnt ions, but the Government has made provision to give effe.-t to these recom mendations as far as is possible. » A conference between the (.'oiiiiiionwealt.li and State .Ministers of Health is being held duriijg the present month to agree oil tlie Imsl methods to this end. ' SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL 1 RESEARCH. j The Institute of Science and Industry has been reorganised under tlie name of tlie Gouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research. A sum of £250, Ot'O lias been I paid to its credit in a trust account to i enable it to function effectively. As a first step investigations will be begun into tlie following main groups of problems: — Animal pests and diseases; plant pests and i diseases; food problems, especially cold | storage; fuel problems, especially liquid fuels; and forest products. A sum of £166.666 has been set aside as an endow ment. the income from which is to b, used to provide assistance; (a) to persons engaged in scientific research; and (b) in tlie training of students in scientific research. Tlie work of the Council will be car- rim! en in close co-operation with tlie seknli'ic and technical departments of the Biate Governments, the universities ami other scientific bodies throughout the Commonwealth. Hxisting institutions will be used to the fullest extent practicable. The Council will co-operate with the Brit ish Department of Scientific and Indus- tiial Research. During the year 1925-26 important pro gress was made in the work of the Aus- I trill ia ii Commonwealth Engineering Standards Association. The organisation j of the power survey committee and panels I lias been coiuplef ed. Reports on certain special subjects will be available for pub ncai io a almost immediately. COTTON. For some years the Coin moil wen I Hi Government has joined with the cotton- growing States in guaranteeing prices for seed cotton. This method of assisting the growing of Australian cotton, how ever, lias not been wholly satisfactory. i and the Commonwealth Government, after full consideration, has come to the con- I elusion that this industry can best be I assisted by means of a bounty. The Government believes it to be a sound econ omic policy not only to encourage tlie growing of cotton, but also spinning of cotton yarn and manufacture of cotton goods in Australia. There does not ap pear to be any reason why eventually the whole of Hie Australian crop should not be manufactured into cotton goo-is in Australia. The Government, a cord: ug- ly, proposes to ask Piirlianie.it to grant, as a first stiqi towards this objective, a '(.u.::y oil seed col Ion and on ilie spinning of cotton yarns. The bounties are es timated to total £150,600. DAIRY PRODUCE. During year the Export Control Board saved the industry nearly £20,000 per an num by obtaining a reduction in marine insurance, has regulated the export of but ter to Great Britain, and, in co-opei'ation with its London agency, has been able to prevent: violent fluctuation in prices. The improvement in quality brought about by pasleurisatioii, tlie staiidardisa- . tion of the product under the national j " Kangaroo " brand, and orderly market l ing have resulted in bringing tlie Lon don trices of Australian butter to the New Zealand level and almost to the Danish. The Paterson scheme has at the same time assisted to maintain local prices. Trade with the East in butler, cheese, and other dairy produce has expanded. Tlw> Piiivf'Diiiiciit, lias ainiroacheil the. States with a view to the encourage vent of fodder production and conservation, to the better education of butter and cheese factory managers and employees, and to the establishment of dairy colleges. SUGAR. On September 1. 1925, a three years agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments commenced to operate. Tlie agreement secured for consumers additional concessions estimated at £282,000 per annum, including £124,000 for reduced prices of sugar for the pro cessing of fruit products. The 1925-26 season produced approximately 520,000 tons. The surplus of 213,094 tons was 1 exported. 198,315! tons sent to Great Britain enjoyed the Empire preference duty of £4/5/7 per ton. 14,781 tons sent to Canada secured there a preference of £4/12/ per ton. EGGS. The annual value of the production of eggs is now approximately £10,000,000. An encouraging export trade has been develop ed and regulations will shortly lie issued iirescribing the grades and .standards for export. The expansion of this industry should provide opportunities for the settle ment of large numbers of people. The De partment of Markets is assisting various organisations to improve the system of oversea marketing. ADVERTISING AUSTRALIAN PRO DUCTS IN GREAT BRITAIN. In co-operation with the Dairy Produce Control Board, Dried Fruits Control Board, and the Australian Fruit Caiiuers' Assoeiu- tion, (he Government is subsidising a- scheme of trade publicity in tlie I'jiitoiJ Kingdom on a pound for pound basis, the Commonwealth liability being limited to £50,6(16. Another subsidised scheme of publicity has for sonic time been carried on in Great Britain in relation to Aus tralian apples. PREFERENCE. j During the year the concessions of duty j resulting from the preference granted by Great Britain to Australian products have ! amounted to £1,178,06(1. Sugar accounted | for £S46,00(i of this amount. The reeipro- j cal tariff' treaty with Canada lias already been of advantage to producers of A lis- i traliaii butter and canned fruits. There are also prospects of a good market for Aus tralian dried fruits. BOUNTIES. During the year .1925-26 bounties total ling £498,582 were paid on primary and j secondary products. £242,065 was pa:d j on galvanised sheets, fencing wire, wire netting, and tractors. During the year the payments under the Export- Guarantee Act, which was passed to assist the oversea marketing of pri mary produce, amounted to - j3,066. PART II.— BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS The estimated revenue and expenditure of Business Undertakings for 1926-27 are as follows: — Postmaster- General 's Department. — Re venue, £11,441,00(1; expenditure, £11,294,480; surplus, £1-16.526. Coin mon wea I tli Railways. — Revenue, £499,006; expenditure, £9(53,3liS; deficit, £4(54,368; net deficit, £317. S48. It will be noticed that in providing these purple utilities t tie Government, is not using them as a means of raising revenue. The Post Office can in no way be character ised as a taxing machine, whilst the Joss on Com mon wea I tli railways is provided out of general taxation. POSTMASTER-GENERAL ' S DEPARTMENT. It- is estimated that the revenue from all sources for 1926-27 will be £1 1,44 .1,000. which is £625,749 greater than that for 4925-26, and represents an increase of 6 per cent. i lie esi una i.eo ex peuui i uic or me i osr- luasler-GejicraFs Department for tin cur rent year is £11,294,48(1; the actual ex penditure in 1925-26 was £10,(554.880; re sulting in an increase in 1926-27 of £639.606. Owing to the liberal programme of capital construction, the charges for in terest and sinking fund have grown by £188,5! 12, leaving an increase of £-151.688 in I lie ordinary working and administra tive costs of the Department. Arbitra tion it wards have greatly increased the ex- penditure, and with an extension of postal ; telephonic and telegraphic, facilities, fur ther increases must be looked for. These, however, are offset by an increase in the earnings of the Department. In the esti mates for 192(5-27 it has been necessary t;o provide £177,000 to cover increased salaries ' of postal employees payable under the Public .Service Regulations and the Public Service Arbitrator's awards. When the additional assets, now being provided by . loan expenditure, reach their full earning capacity, it is expected that the increase in working costs will be more than pro vided from the additional revenue earned. TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE DEVELOPMENT. During 1925-26 approximately 41,000 ad ditional telephones were connected, of which .13,210 were in the metropolitan areas. It is anticipated that, in 492(5-27, 46,606 additional telephones will be in stalled, of which 25,000 will be in the country areas. The number of telephones in use throughout the Commonwealth now exceeds 400,000, nearly 1 for each 100 of population. Australia now stands seventh on the list of countries from the stand point of telephone development. The United States is first, with 45 telephones per 100 of population; then follow Canada Denmark, N'ew Zealand, Sweden and Nor way. The policy of the Government is to pro vide. in the interests of national efficiency, the funds necessary for the expansion of the telephone svstem. The Government's progressive policy has resulted during the past two and a half years in the addition of 100,000 telephones. The expenditure for 1925-26 approximated £5.050,000. F < i v 192(5-27 a sum of £4,500,000 is provided. In recent years no increases have been made in the telegraph and telephone tariffs, but on the contrary a number of conces sions have been granted. The present. I tariff's arc amongst the lowest in the world, and, as a result of increased costs of labor and material, many sendees arc. now be ing operated at a loss. The anticipated revenue for 1920-27 would be increased by £3,580,000 if the American rates operated in Australia. WIRELESS. Owing to difficulties beyond tlie control of the Commonwealth Government, the beam services to England and Canada lia.ve not vet roiiiiiieiieed, but are expected to l ii iii-r i on in oanuary nexr. me nroaucasi- ing services have now bee.otn ' a vcigiiiscl feature in tlie life of tlie community, and j are contributing in no small degree to mitigate the sense of isolation in sparse ly populated arras. The regulations arc now being reviewed to determine whether any changes arc necessary in the interests I of the multitude of listeners, who now number 118,000. Wireless stations ati Wave Hill and Ca moo weal were opened I during the year and have already proved their utility. PART III.— TERRITORIES OF THE . COMMONWEALTH. The estimated expenditure of the Ter ritories of the Comtii'oii wealth for 1926-27 is £435, 55.9; the revenue, derived exclu sively from Northern Territory, is estiin- mated at £555,000; leaving a deficit of £400,539. PART IV.— PAYMENTS TO OR FOR THE STATES. The reason for showing the payments to the -States as a separate section of the 1-ln t ! trf»f m!p/w»i1\\- Ii/wmi nvnlutiin/l rIMn»cn payments can ' iii no way be regarded as expenditure of the Commonwealth. MAIN ROADS. hi 1923, the Commonwealth granted £500,000 to the States on a pound for pound basis for the const ruction of main developmental roads, and in the subse quent years, sums of £500,000 and £750,000 were provided on a similar basis. The re sults of these expenditures have been so satisfactory that the Government, in con ference with the States, recently evolved a scheme of national road development cou- j tcmpiating an expenditure of £555,000,000 tin a period of ten years. Of this sum, £20,000,000 will be contributed by the Com-, monwealtli, £5.000,0(10 being from existing! sources of its revenue, and £15,000,000 will be obtained f colli additional collections or revenue from road users through the Ctis- ronis. The Conunoiiwealt Ii will distribute its controbufion on a basis of area and population, three-fifths according to popu lation and two-fifths on area. ' The States' contribution of £15, 000, 000 may be derived cither from revenue or from loan. Where the State contribution I '661 ILN1U tl > J »v 1 Ct/Ill.

Provision is made for the permanent maintenance and upkeep of roads constructed or rccon- strio-tod under the scheme. The roads included in the scheme are: — (1) Main roads which open up and de velop new country; (-) trunk mails be tween main towns; (3) arterial roads to carry concentrated traffic from develop mental main trunk and other roads. This will in effect be the first instal ment and form the basis of a national roads scheme. When completed it will be capable of extension in siu-h a manner that the whole of our Cut nve mads con struction will dovetail into the works in w proposed. ADJUSTMENT OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE FINANCES. Oil .I'll in 4 I explained to the House the proposals of the Government for a per manent adjustment of the financial re lationships of tin Commonwealth and the States. The Commonwealth Government', proposes to withdraw the present capita tion payments which are paid from year to year. At the same time it proposes lo discontinue the imposition of certain Com monwealth taxes. This will enable the ! State Governments to recoup themselves for the loss of the capitation payments by raising equivalent funds by their own taxation methods in the surrendered fields. Out of the remaining revenues of the Common wealth special grants, amounting to £(»()(), 060, are to be paid to the States iii the first year. It is pro posed, further, that Western Australia and Tasmania should receive assistance to (lie extent of £453,000 and £378,000 re spectively on account of spec i a I difficul ties and disadvantages. ' The principle underlying the proposals is that, a.s far e.s possible, the authority wliii-h expends money shall have the re sponsibility for raising it. Departure from that principle lias led to the costly dupli cation of existing agencies, which collect x-iiuil'.i i flin v'lnin iiomilo niiilin f different laws. Under the new scheme this waste of administration will be eliminated, with the saving of approximately £400,000 to the taxpayers of Australia. Practically every argument advanced! by the State Governments in regard to these proposals ignores the vital effect of the war on Federal finances. If the, war had occurred before Federation tlie I Common wealth would clearly have re quired an amount equal to the Customs and excise revenue to meet its war and nt !ii»f nhlitr.M f initQ In mich iv-ii niwt lm m«rw . w x , » . X . . .J X . X . X . x x_ . it is idle to suppose that the Common wealth would have been required to pny a share of the Customs revenue to the State Governments, and at the same time to raise direct taxes similar to those raised by the State Governments. The obvious course would have been to do what the (..'oininouwoaUli now proposes, namely, give each Government separate fields of taxa tion. coupled with full responsibility for raising the taxation it requires. The present system of uniform capita- j tion payments to each State is palpably on a wrong basis, because two States -al ready have been forced to apply for special grants, whieh practically means the adoption of a graduated settle of capi tation payments. At the present time, if Commonwealth policy should stimulate, the development of one State and retail development in another, that State which is benefited litis its industries enlarged, its ! population increased, and receives an ad- ditioual payment by reason of that fact- i In the State which is not stimulated j ie J the same way population may remant I stationary or decline, and its payments | may become both absolutely and rela tively less. If any payment's are to be made, and if there is to be balanced de velopment in the Commonwealth, it is evi dent that just as for special industries there need to be special tariffs, so to meet the conditions of each State there I must- be differential and not uniform pay- | meats. In all the payments nihde by thrt Commonwealth to the States except the j capitation payments, some basis other than. | that of population has been adopted. All" . other Federations have rejected a system 1 of uniform per capita, payments to their | constituent States. j In the field of direct taxation to be I vacated the Commonwealth has been eol- | lecting sums of money in excess of th« capitation payments which are to be dis continued. Including the special pay- . incuts to the States, and on the hypotlu!- j sis that the State.- Governments will raise in the vacated field only as much revenue 'as the Commonwealth now pays them, the State taxpayers would be better off to the ' extent of £1,527,S52. j It is neither necessary nor desirable, that the States should collect this .£1,527,852 from the people. I The Government has given very careful ' and earnest attention to the various ub- Jjeetions made by the State Governments | to the Commonwealth proposals. It, liow- . ever, is firmly convinced that these jyo- posals are sound in principle and should j be translated into statute form. To meet the objections, however, that the States- j have not sufficient time to put the re quired machinery in motion for .1926-27, the Government- lias decided to ask Bar liainent to pass such legislation as will enable the Commonwealth to operate the .scheme during the first year, instead of ; leaving the arrangements to be made by 1 the State Governments. This will give- | to the State Governments and Parliaments I an additional period of twelve months iu | which to formulate their plans for rais- . ing the necessary revenue. I In the Bill to abolish the capitation | payments an additional clause wit be in serted to enable the Commonwealth to pay over to tlie State Governments land l tax, entertainment tax, and estate duly ' for the year 192(5-27, collected at the rates "which existed in 1.925-26; also 40 per cent, of the income tax at last year's Federal rates. The arrears of taxes imposed by the Commonwealth in respect of years prior to 1926-27 will belong to the Common wealth, but all the taxes imposed by the Commonwealth for the States, whether collected in 1926-27 or in subsequent years, will belong to the State Governments. If the taxes actually collected by the Com monwealth for the State Governments- iu. J9Z0-Z/ uo not reaen tne total wnicii would have been payable to the State Governments in 1926-27 on a capitation i basis under tlie Surplus Revenue Act, tlio Commonwealth a v i 1 1 make good the differ- | ence during 1926-27 by advancing the . shortage to the State Governments this year in anticipation of the collection of the arrears. The result will be that in 1926-27 the State Governments will receive at least as much as would have been payable '.to them as capitation payments under a con tinuation of the Surplus Revenue Act? No change of State taxation laws will lie necessary until 1927-28. They will | thus have a full year to consider liow ' tliev will adjust their taxation, and _ during that year they will be guaranteed against any loss under the now proposals. In 1927-28, when the State Govern ments have readjusted their laws, they may experience some little difficulty 'Tin. collecting, before the close of the yesu\ a full year's revenue in respect of the taxes thev impose to replace the discon tinued Federal taxes. Any shortage of their own collections in 1927-28 will, how- ever, be fully compensated for by the arrears which they will receive in that year in respect, of the Federal taxes im posed on their behalf. The States of Queensland, South Australia, West Aus tralia, and Tasmania will also receive in 1927-28 the adjusting grants, totalling £600,000; originally proposed in t'lio States' Grant Bill in respect of 1926-27. Thus the Commonwealth, by operating the new scheme for one year in the man ner proposed, wi.il overcome the most pressing difficulty under which the State Governments felt. they would suffer. Tlie State Governments will have time for a readjustment, a guarantee against loss in the meantime, and arrears to make good any shortage of tax collections when they commence to collect the taxes. Bills will be submitted to Parliament for tlie repeal, as from the end of the year 192(5-27, of the Land Tax Aj\ty the F.nt.ertaiiiiiieiits Tax Act, and the-; istiite Duty Act. For the year 1927-28 the Com monwealth will abandon 40 per cent, of its income lax. In the case of Western Australia a special addition to capitation payments was ' provided for in Section 5 of the Sur plus Revenue Act of 1910. That special addition to the capitation payment is in cluded in the special relief of £450,000 now to be given to Western Australia, and consequently the payment to Western Australia in 1926-27 out of the special taxes will be correspondingly reduced. Doubts have been expressed by the State Governments as to the accuracy of the Commonwealth estimate of the yield nf the direct - taxes to be surrendered.; ' r The actual collections of these taxes for the year just closed show that the Com monwealth somewhat, underestimated tlie . amounts, and should entirely' dispel tlie. - fears of the State Governments. ESTIMATED REVENUE FOR THE YEAR. , Apart from the special taxes to be raised for payment to the States the re venue for 1926-2-7 is estimated at CXI (Kin li.fi : 1-1 II :> I revenue t'nv t.llC i previous year was £08,996,261," showing a 1 decrease of £7,614,261. The chief items of decrease are: — Land tax (additional land tax is being I raised for payment to the States of . I £2,1 1 1,000), £2,321,923; income tax (au-, ditioual income tax is being raised for .payment to tlie States of £4,05(5,600 ), £4,408,015; estate duties (additional estate duties are being raised for payment to the States of £1,300,000). £1,361,337; en tertainments tax '(additional entertain- i.iomJl fiiv io lioimr »«oi «»/! f'/ir iHIVIlW'Ilt'. tO "'vino uia io the States of £326,000), £410,309; coinage (withdrawal of British silver coin discon tinued), £157,036; net profit — Australian note issue, £148,062; sundry snvali increases and decreases — not decrease. £108,666; 'total decreases,. £8,9 1 .),5!7S. From these (le- i reases must be 'deducted the increase?, in ( .'list oin s and excise revenue, £1,501,117; net decrease, £7,(514,2(51. It would be convenient at this stage to bring together for the information of . hoii. members the total direct taxation Jt V.jf # 'aa Avliicli it is proposed to collect during the curjeiit .yCiii', including the speciul taxes to be raised for payment to the States. The comparison of these taxes with 1925-2(5 is as follows: — .1925-26 3 92(5-27 £ £ Land tax-.... 2,521,925 2,311,000 .

This estimate is made in view of the experience of recent years, ..combined with the excellent sea- | so n a 1 prospects and anticipated good prices for the bulk of our exports. INCOME TAXATUON. In the Budget- Speech last year a de tailed history pf the variations of Federal income taxation was given. Income tax was first, collected in the year 1915-16, and, the . rates were increased from time to j time until. .the .peak was reached in 1921.' Reductions of more tliaii 1.0 per cent, were i 0 made ;in ea.eh of the years 1922-23, and 1.924-25 the. exemption was raised and last year, a further reduction of 12 A per i cent, was made. The income tax per head lias in these ways been' reduced by 47 per cent, since 1921-22. , , During the current year it is anticipated i that. £6,450,000 will be collected for Com- I moil wealth purposes, and £4,056,000 for payment, to the .States, making a total in all of £10,506,000. The income tax to be -raised for Commonwealth expenditure re presents £1/1/1 per head of the population, and the tax to be collected for expendi ture by the States .33/3 per head. s LAND TAX. The estimated revenue from land tax iii ' 1926-27 is £200,000. Tlie Cbiiimonwealtli will raise, in addition, £2,110,000 on or dinary land .tax assessments during the year. This amount will be paid to the j States. I OTHER DIRECT TAXATION. ' The revenue to be collected iu 1926-27 on estate duties and entertainments tax is estimated at £100,000. This amount arises wholly, from arrears of assessments for . the. previous y.ear. In addition £1,626,000 will be co.leetcd in respect of assessments of t.Jie current year .and hand ed over to the States ' . The war time profits .tax docs not up-1 JL ply .to, profits derived after J.une 30, 39 19, and tnuisactions .under this head are purely adjustments of old assessments. During the year it is expected that the refunds of tax .will exceed the .collections by £20,0.66.. j -SUMMARY OF FINANCES, 1926-27. | Tlie position of the year 1926-27 may be summarised as follows: — Estimated revenue," £51,382,000; esti mated expenditure exclusive of business undertakings, territories, and payment lo or fpr be' States, £49.287,443;' defic't -(« 1 business undertakings £317,484; deficit on territories of ti.ie Conimonwealtlr; £400,539; contribution from general revenue for payments .t.o or for the States, "£1,226, 7 89 ; total,, £51,232,619. .N,et surplus on account of transactions for 6.926-27, £149,381. The total grants and special payments to be ni.ade to the States are £10,513,789. ' j'l:c surplus available towards these pay ments is £.1,226, 789, leaving £9,237,000 to be provided by special taxation: This amount Jt :, is proposed to raise by; special > Customs taxes totalling ' ! direef taxation totajling £7,787,000. ' .This 'statement itself dernonstrates the' W.is,dpm ,:of the Government's action in placing the financial re.ations of the C'om- inonw.ealtii-.and the States on a more satis- ' factory basis! It shows clearly the .extent to .wiiicli the Gommon wealth during 1926-27 lnust, remain in fields of taxation. f.i which the. Spates already operate, in ' order - to raise .Revenue to be handed to tlie States for expenditure by the States. The statenient of Commonwealth re- eeipts'.and expenditure fufnislies an effec tive -reply: to the i claim of the State Go vernments that they have a moral .right to a share of the ;Cusioms and excise re venue. Part T. of the estimates shows that the legitmate expenditure of . the Com monwealth, quite exclusive of payments to the States, requires not only the total Customs and excise revenue, but revenue from direct sources in addition. In fact war and defence services cost £34,019,906 and invalid and old-age pen sions £9,000,000. The burdens of the war, of the adequate development of the national defences and of the obligation to provide pensions were imposed upon the Commonwealth long after t-he constitution was framed. These services alone cost £43,019,906, or £2,519,906 more than the total Custpm'.s and excise collections. During the last three years the Govern ment has made reductions in taxation and postal charges of an annually recurring A amount of £5,690,000. It lies also sub stantially .reduced war debt, has instituted a progressive defence policy, paid £1,250.000- in bounties to .stimulate in- dustrie j and improved, at an increased annual cost of £3,600,600, the lot of the old and the infirm. This year finds it able to carry these cumuut"ve reductions and concessions. Under the .Commonwealth 's financial proposals tlie. State Governments, when imposing taxation in the field vacated by the Commonwealth, will have the opportunity of giving further relief to taxpayers totalling £1,527,85.2. The .Commonwealt h Government is meet ing its own obligations which arise from the ordinary functions of Government, from the lossss incurred in providing public utilities, from the burden of d.u- vel.opm.en.t. of its territories and ..from the Ndmn:fnd8 for financial assistance from S.tnte Governments to raise their develop ment t.o the genen-J standard. Jt is ncc.essary that, the States should also meet their obligations and,, themselv.es, make the necessary provision for that purpose. To, facilitate this action on the .part of the States, the. Commonwealth proposes to vacate certain fields of taxation which are more than sufficient to yield the pre sent capitation payments to the States. The Commonwealth Government's policy is ultimately to vacate the whole field of direct taxation. It will still pursue its programme of strict economy and tax re duction, thus giving the States a con tinually widening scope to indemnify them selves for the withdrawal of the per capita payments. The financial proposals of the Govern ment have now been unfolded. Its policy since its accession to office has been to secure the balanced development of Aus tralia as a whole. Its actions have been directed to establish both its own financial position and that of the b'lates. The re demption of war debt in Australia, the r activities of the Loan Council, Com- 1 monwealth abstention from raising new Joans for its own purpose in the A us- I traliaii market, Commonwealth co oper- 1 ation with regard to migration, Common- ' wealth concessions regarding soldier land ettlement, bounties to stimulate industries j in vyious parts" of Australia, Common wealth policy with regard to lmificfltinu pi railway gauges and national main. road construction, national efforts to im prove marketing conditions, the provision of better facilities for postal and tele phonic communication and reduction of direct taxation— all have tended to make the States' financial' position easier than it otherwise -would have been. INCREASED PETROL DUTY. Mr. 3'rafeteii, Minister for Customs, moved an increase on the petrol duty by 2d. a- frail on," 35 per cent, on rubber and other tyres, and 21 per cent, on chassis. The debate was adjourned, after Mr. .Hughes had protested against such an im portant matter being postponed white they discussed Sir W. _ Elliott Johnson's liquor at Canberra motion. Mr. Bruce said the Budget proposals, including the petrol duties, would not come on that day. LIQUOR AT CANBERRA, i Bir AV. E. Johnson denied that, as the Opposition had suggested, there was any agreement to give him a special opportun ity of discussing his motion that Parlia ment disagrees with the ' proposal to allow liquor at Parliament House, at Canberra. He. denied that Parliament lutd -the right to give its members special privileges at i Oaiiiuerra, which had been dry for 15 years, j Messrs. Mahony, Blakeley, MeGrath and ! Coleman interjected, accusing fSir W. E. Johiison of gross exaggeration, and were repeatedly called to order. < | Mr. MeGrath moved an amendment authorising the issue of licenses to hostels Under control in Canberra.
