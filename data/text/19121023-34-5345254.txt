MOTHER WRITING FROM! WALLAROO S.A., to married and single women, advises mern if they wish to keep strong and in the best health to always keep and take LEE Tome MRS. E. STEER, writing from Wallaroo. South Austral--, tells a few straight honest truths to women in general, which more than any other document proves the value of this great family medicine. . No mother, especially youthful ones should be without this medicine, because it will do for them what many so- called remedies fail to do.

"5s M Having heard that you would be glad of the names of anyone cured by Clements Tonic, I add my testimony, seeing none life it anywhere. "I thought it might benefit others, as it was said to me when rearing my family. I found by its use I had the brightest, healthiest of children, and so they continue-a boy 17, and three girls, 15, 15 and 20 years ' respectively. Neither of them knows That earache, toothache, or head to ache is live. "I attribute it to nothing but the consistent use of Clements Tonic, as neither their father nor is very strong. I would use about three bottles at different periods when run down or out of sorts, and then would enjoy the best of health. "I would recommend all young married women to use it, as it is such a grand nerve and muscle strengthener. (Signed) MRS E. STEER." The value of CLEMENTS TONIC cannot be over-estimated.
