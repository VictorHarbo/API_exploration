. ? ♦ A MONTH TO FIND HUSBANDS. Much amusement has been caused at the immigration station at Ellis Island, New York, by the urgent petition of two pretty blue-eyed Danish girls, Al lild Anderson and Ingcborg Jansen, of Copenhagen, for permission to depart immediately for Winona (Minnesota). They, the 'Mail' says, are the cheer ful victims of an eccentric will made by their grandfather, , who bequeathed them each a half-share of 600 acres of fine farm lands on the condition that they marry within thirty days of their arrival in New York. By the terms of the will, which the two cousins ex plained to an interpreter, title to the lands will not be finally vested with either of them until they become mo thers. If at the end of five years one of the cousins has a child and the other has not, the motherless one will 1ob« half her land to the other. If neither has children at the end of five years the entire property is to revert to a male cousin in Denmark, Both girls departed for Minnesota, confidently declaring in broken English that they would find good husbands within the stipulated term.
