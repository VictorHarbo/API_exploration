COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE . I \--. Argua Office, Saturday Evening. _xport entries were passed to day at the Customs for 909 ounces of gold, the whole being for shipment to Hong Kong in the Kitty Simpson, on Chinese account. There was a steady demand for parcels 01" gold for shipment at the beginning of tho week, but since the departure of the Royal Charler this market has been altogether inactive. Tho Tates at which the bullion brokers are buying] are ;-JE3 16s. to £3 10s. 6d. per ounce for Castlemaine, Sandhurst, and Ararat, £3 I64. 9d. to £3 17s. 3d. for Mount Korong; £3 17s. 3d. to £3 17s. 9d. for Dunolly, Maryborough, Fiery Creek, and Avoca; £317s. Gd. to £3 19a. Gd. for the Ovens, and £318s. Gd. to £319s. 6d. per ounce for Ballaarat. The escorts have brought down the follow- ing quantities.

That from Raglan to the Avoca will be discontinued, and a fortnightly escort from the Mount Ararat gold-fields to Raglan, and thence to Melbourne byway of Ballaarat, will be estab- lished. The escort from Ararat will be de- spatched on every alternate Friday, and that from Ballaarat to Ararat on every alternate Wednesday. Tho reporta from Ararat are still very good, BO far as the yield of gold is concerned, laut owing to the continued drought none but picked stuff is boing waBhed. The reopening of the old main lead near the Camp at Mary- borough has been attended with great success, and several fortunate parties have reaped handsome rewards for their perseverance ia following up this lead. Nothing new has transpired at Ballaarat. At Mount Korong ! tho existence of very laige quantities of auriferous quartz, not very richly studded with the metal, has been made evident by recent prospectings. Nothing appears to bo required in this (district but machinery less costly in its working and moro saving: or In Other words, the discovery of some cheaper and more thoroughly exhaustive process of extracting the metal from the matrix than any At present in use. The discovery of two now quartz veins at Bendigo is reported ; one by Mr. Ballerstedt, ouo of the very first Viotorian miners whose attention was attracted by tho Ímartz reefs, and the other by a company ormed on Iron Bark Gully. At M'lvor the puddling - machine proprietors aro still oomplaining of want of water, while the quartz-miners are being retarded in their operations in deep sinking by the power of the springs in this neighbor- hood. Several nuggets, varying from l8 to 33 ounces, have been received ra town from this locality. At Steiglitz the opening up of sera Tal not very extensive but rich loads is reported, while the existence of enormous niasses of auriferous quartz, too poor to be pro- fitably crushed by the appliances at present available, is provea beyond a doubt. There has only been one vessel despatched for England this week, but the shipments of gold were large : ounces.

The money market has been lather tight Queing chiefly in conséquence of the ad- vances made by the banks on several nrticles of consumption tailing duo. These advances were obtained under the impression 1 h at a moro rapid riso in prices would occur than has taken place. -Except in this parti- cular the market is easy. The banks charlu 7 per cent, for discounting bills having under Üö days currency, and 8 per cent, mínimum íor those having over 95 days to run.

Tho fine hall will be completely fitted up during the next week, when it will be made use of as the rcBort of the mercantile and trading classes for a place of meeting. The arrival of the royal mail-ship Emeu was made known by the hoisting of the mail- bag at an early hour this morning. The Emeu has made an excellent run of fijfty-nino days, having brought London dates to the 17th June. Nothing reliable has transpired with reference to the futuro arrangements for the mail service. The Australasian, originally intended for the line between Australia and Suez, has been launched, and is to proceed to Calcutta as soon as she can be got ready for sea. It is expected that the next mail will bring full intelligence on this important matter. In the meantime every explanation that has reuched him should bo given by tho Australian manager of the line. The Melbourne mails by the R.M.S, Emeu, the first portion of which arrived at the Ge- neral Post Office at 11.45 a.m. on Saturday, consisted of 218 boxes, and one supplementary bag, containing in all 37,763 letters, of which 1,260 were registered, and 61,000 newspapers. There were also received during the same day mails from Tasmania and New Zealand, con- taining 930 letters, and 700 newspapers, with 33 mails for other ports. Tho following is a summary of the mails brought by this vessel for the several Austra- lian colonies:-For Melbourne, 218 boxes ; for Geelong, 30 boxes: total for Victoria, 248 boxes and 1 supplementary mail. For Sydney, 106 boxes. For Adelaide, 51 boxes. For Ho bar Town, 41 boxes ; for Launceston, 14 boxes : total Tasmania, 65 boxes. For Wellington, 29 boxes ; for Auckland, 18 boxes : total, New Zealand, 47 boxes. For King George's Sound, 7 boxes. Making a gross total of 514 boxes. The English money market appears to have been easier than at tho time of the de- parture of the previous mail, but the mini- mum rate of discount at the Bank of flag- land remained at ö.per cent. Consols had been îeiaarkably steady during Juno, the fluctuations having scarcely reached f per cunt. We «ive the following latest intelligence from the City article of the Times of the 17th J Juno :- ' The funds opened this morning at tho Improved prlcos ol' yo»torday, but in conscquouco of a oonsldor I able rouowal of tho pressuro for money tho market soon bseame weak, and remained without rccovory to the closo. Consols for tho Dth of July wore first quoted 0 31 to ft ox dividend, and the final transactions wera at OS to ¿. The conscious | ness that tho speculation for a rise has again assumed ! largo proportions seems to croata timidity, and satoj I aro accordingly pressed tho moment any temporary I 1 c iicumstances occur to produce an unfavorable tone To-day the domand for advancos at tho Bank was vory active, and tho hopes of au Immediate reduction In the rate of discountexporicncodaproportlonatooheck. Tno letters from Paris and the aspect of tho Bourso scour to indicate that the prespeot of a downward move, moat on Thursday next on the part of the Bank of Franco is also uncertain. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214 ; Reduced, 02$ to j ; New Three per Cents., 02 J to ¡ ; Exchequer Bonds, OSg to J; and India Bonds, 8s. to Is. discount. | The European Times of the loth June, in ita [monthly review of the markct.says: Tho money market is easier and tho supply im- proved, but tho Bank minimum rato of discount re- mains witho at chango at 0 percent. The largo pur- chases of gold out 0/tho recent supplies, which cannot 'fall far short of three- quarters of a million starling, by the dlroctors of tho Bank, have led to the strong bollol' in monetary olrcles that, at an early date, a reduotlou will be announced. Indeed many parties wore san- guino enough to bollovo that such a stop would b3 taken at their " Parlor" on Thursday, but caution ; has still to bo observed, especially us tho bank has re- ; ncwed making advaobos on stook, which may lead to a resumption of the activo outward demand of the pro clous motáis. It is cloar, however, that an early ro- i taxation nuy bo looked for. Tho domand has boon ' moderate both at tho Bank and " out of doon';" ani, at the discount IIOUBCI first-class aliort-datod paper has ' been easily negotiated under tho minimum Bank rate i , In tho St°°k Ex°l'an8o tho r&to; on Govornmont Soca. rltics ranges from 0 toOJ porcont., according to porl,«i.

Much attontlon has rocontly boon paid by tho com merdai world gouorally, and by capitalists ii) this country in particular, to the position of tho Rank of France, owing to tho groat drain of gold from England to enablo hor to maintain hor reputation, at perio is vhon from scarcity of tho precious motal, short arrivals, and high ratos for money, moro than its vaiuo had frequently to bo paid. A chango, howovor, has no v takon placo, and tho roturas published in tho Jíbniíciír for the month aiding- 11th Inst. show an incrouso in catii in hand of 1(5,725,000 francs in Paris, and 81,036,000 francs in the branch banks. Its favorable position, it was bollovod, would causo a reduction in tho rate of discount from G per cent., nt which It his stood for nearly ten months, to 6J por cont. Thli I bollol was however prouiaturc, and though disappoint- ment has beon folt by many speculators, tho stop has hoon mot by general approval. Many rumors aro afloat, willoh must bo cautiously rccoivod, amongit others that tho nowly appointed Qovornor of tho Bank, SI. do Ooriiiiny, was quito opposed to any roductlou lu tho rate of discount, hut that ouo of tho first acts of lils administration will bo to ontor into another contrae-, Vtlih tho Mossra.

ENGLISH COMMERCIAL INTELLI- GENCE. (FROM OUIl OWN CORRESPONDENT.) [The following appeared in our second edition of Saturday :-] J London, 16th June. Tho arrival of the Australian mail at Mar- ' seules was tolegraphed in London on the 6th inst. Tho lottere by that route wore delivered on the 8th ; and the heavy portion of the mail via Southampton arrived on the 12th. Although tho Columbian was several days be- hind her time, great forbearance is exercised by the mercantile community, as the Mail Company have displayed and aro displaying every effort to carry out thoir important en- gagement ; and, in the House of Commons tho otherjiight, Mr. Wilson, the Seoretary to the Treasury, in answering a question with rofer-, once to tho Australian mail contract, said that ' tbo company had conveyed the mails to the entire satisfaction of the Government. It Is , thought that the small quantity of gold sent by the new route will induce the company to i lower their freight for the precious metal, the 1 present high rate precluding shippers from availing themselves of the saving of timo effected by the overland journey. The speclo movements of tho last two weeks La vo been very important. A number of Aus- tralian vessels have arrived, bringing large quantities. The aggregate value of gold which reached London during that time has been little short of £2,000,000. Notwithstand- ing this large supply, the market still keeps tight, and the rates of discount high. The mercantile acceptances which had to be mot oa the 4th caused a severe pressure (whioh has only slightly relaxed) at the beginning of the month; and the pressing demands at the Bank, and in Lombard- street, very materially reduced the reserves at the discount establishments. The con- tinued extensive shipment of silver to the East, too, has a perceptible effect, although all the remittances are not supplied by tho London market. The mail to bo despatched to India on tbo 20th inBtant will take out tho heaviest quantity ever shipped, - probably nlonnnn £1.(100.0(10. I The bonds of the Corporations of the town I of G colong and thoso of the city of Melbourne respectively are henceforth tobe quoted in the 1 official list of the S took Exchange. I The state of the Manchester markets is vdry 1 unsatisfactory. Profits are reduced, and the ¡ demand being not equal to tho supply, a large extension of the system of shoit time has been adopted, which will causo discontent among the operatives. Several failures have boen nnuouueed-one firm to the extent of £100,000. lu most other manufacturing districts trude is active, but tho diminution of profits is everywhere complained of. The first colonial wool salos of tho season, which commenced on the 80th of April, termi- nated on the 29th ult. From a circular issued by Messrs. Southey and Son, wo find that the sales included 16,320 bales of Sydney, 21,509 baleB of Port Phillip. 8,252 bales of Van Die men's Land, 9,026 bales of South Australian, 398 bales of New Zoaland, 85 bales of Swan Hivor, and 7,604 bales of Gape, making a total of 62,1'13 bales, besides 1,016 bales of East Indian. Messrs. Soutkoy add that "tho os- borne prices paid in tho early February sales had a very prejudicial effect at tho time on both the wool and woollen trades, and, notwithstanding the giving way after- wards, it soon becamo apparent the estab- lished rates at that period checked consump- tion in tho manufactuiing districts, dull mar- kets having prevailed for many weeks. Under such disadvantages, together with continued high rates of discount, theso sales opened. , Our home buyers mado most dctorminod efforts to start prices at a material reduotloa : this was checked by the great support given at the early sales by buyers on foreign ac- count, who secured nearly fifty per cent, of the wool offoied at the early sales. Prices de- clined a little in tho second week, but soon recovered, and proceeded to the ead with inoreasinç firmness, Many superior maiks, in high condition, both from Sydney and Port Phillip, were supported by all classes of buyers, and sold very nearly at February prices." A portion of the wools from Port Phillip and Portland Bay was badly washed, and was consequently sold under the prevailing figure. It is expected that a consi- derable reduction will take place before any extensive transactions are entered into. Our farmors have commenced shearing, and the heavy clip which ÍB anticipated favors tho opinion that the price of wool will fall. The annual meeting of the Now Zoaland Company was to have boon holdem the 28th ult., but Ihe attendance being too small to localise tbo meeting, it was adjourned for six .weeks A meeting of the shareholders of tho Bank of Australasia was held on the Sth inbt, Mr J W. Henderson in the chair whon the roport and accounts were unanimously approvod of, and a dividond and bonus at the rate of 20 per cent woie declared '1 ho guarantee fund now amounts to £200,000 The new charter, it is expected, will still further assist in developing the busi- ness of the bank The chairman alluded to the increasing competition in tho colonies, mid warned the meeting against relying too much on a continuance of such a high divi- dend The last 'WeBt India mail brought mtolli gi nee that a great discovery of gold had beau made at Upata, in Venezuela It is alloged that the gold is exceedingly puro, and the quantities realised aro beyond bohof In re- marking upon the circumstance, the Tim's City aiticle writer says, that " the existence of these mines has been known for several years, and, although the atatomont now made of then wonderful richness is probably a groat exaggeration, there has long been reason to suppose that they might be found to yield a íeturn to any individual laborers, at least, equal to the aveiage obtained either in Cali- fornia or Australia " In the IIouso of Commons, on the 5th inst., the Ohancolloi of the Exchequer made a statement with referonco to the payment to the Danish Government for the abolition of the Sound dues. Tho country has agreed to pay the sum of £1,125,206, in return for which the Danish Government undertakes to main- tain lighthouses andothor aida to navigation, and to further reduce the transit dues. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, having a balauos of nearly £2,000,000 in favor of the nation on last year's account, is enabled to pay down at once the Bum demanded by the Danes with- out adding a shilling to tho debt of the coun- try. The vexatious charges hitherto ox acted are now got rid of, and tho shipping in- terests proportionally benefited. As the redemption monoy will have to be paid duilng thenoxttbroo or four months in specie or its equivalent, the effect on the monoy market will be increased stringency. At the half-yearly meeting of the Penin- . Bular und Oriontal Steam Packet Company a dividend equal to 5 per cent, for tho half-year was declared. The Orm of Evans, Hoare, and Co,, largely engaged In the Australian export trado, has suspended payment, The shipments of the houso, which consisted principally of wines, spirits, and beer, are supposed to have been on & scale much beyond its available capital. Tho liabilities are stated to bo nearly £200,000. A meeting of tbo Australian and Boyal Mail Company (not the European and Aus- tralian) was held on the 10th inst., when tho report was adopted. A suggestion for trans- ferring the property to a new company tros not approved of ; and although a fooling for winding up waa expressed, yet the board was ultimately strengthened, and it was decided to endeavor to got temporary employ- ment for the vessels. Tho depressed condition ot railway pro- perty excites the alarm of shareholders. A public meeting has just been held to con- sider tho propriety of presenting a momorlal to the Board of Trade, praying for a redress of the many grievances under which this de- scription of property labors. It was stated by one of the speakers that upwards of £800,000,000 had beon sunk in railways in this country, and it was argued that legisla- tion on railways had hitherto boon unsound and unsatisfactory. The following occurs in ono of the City articles of The Times :~ " Some weeks back attention was called to a disclosure in the Sydney newspapers of a method by which tho London underwriters .wero liable to be defrauded. Itappearod fro-a a letter inserted in the Sydney Herald that instances had occurred where the consignóos of cot tain descriptions of unmarketable good j contrived to get thom certified as damaged by sea water, so as to enablo the shippers to como upon the underwriters for the difference be- tween their nominal and realised value.
