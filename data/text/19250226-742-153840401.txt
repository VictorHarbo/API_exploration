FOREIGN MIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA INTERESTING FACTS AND FIGURES. AUSTRALIA'S 98 PER CENT, BRITISH POPULATION The following information has been issued by the Publicity Branch of the Prime Minister's Department: The impression is widespread that persons of foreign birth are entering Australia in numbers so large as to menace the preservation of the preponderant British element in our population. THE PRESENT POSITION. For the three years and six months ended September, 1924, the average annual excess of arrivals in, over departures from Australia of British peoples was 29,120. During the same period, the average annual excess of arrivals over departures of persons of foreign birth was 4610. The average annual increase in the population by excess of births over deaths during the same period was 82,000. Assuming that only 20,000 Britishers (a decrease of 9120 on the above figure) came here each year during the next decade, and that 20,000 aliens (an Increase of 15,390 on the figure above given) were admitted annually during the same period, also assuming that the natural increase in the population remained stationary, the British population of Australia at the end of 10 years would represent 96 percent of the total — a dilution of the present British preponderance to the extent of only 2 per cent. In all probability, however, the number of British assisted migrants will, when the new agreement about to be entered into by the British and Commonwealth Governments and the Governments of the six States is in operation, show an increase over the number who arrived during the period above stated. The number of unassisted British migrants is not likely to decrease. It is safe to assume that the gain by natural increase, which is generally cumulative, will also be greater in the future. From present indications in view of the agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and certain foreign Governments to restrict the issue of passports or the granting of vises, it is likely to be some years before the number of foreign arrivals reach 20,000 per annum. The Italian Government has agreed to limit the granting of passports to persons who have been nominated by persons in Australia, and who are in possession of £40 each. In the case of Greeks, Jugo- Slavs, and Albanians, the British authorities, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, are limiting the granting of vises to passports to 100 per month in each case, and vises will not be granted to persons unless they are individually in possession of £40. THE FOREIGN ELEMENT. I The census of April, 1921, showed that the number of persons in Australia not born here, or in the British Isles or New Zealand, was 139,073, or slightly over 2½ per cent. The number owing allegance to foreign Governments was 48,529 or .08 per cent. During the past few years, and particularly since July, 1924 (when the latest Immigration Restriction Act passed by the United States Congress came into operation), there has been a quicker movement of peoples from southern Europe to Australia. During the 3½ years ended September 30, 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign born immigrants numbered 16,148, a figure representing about 11.6 per cent, of the total foreign born persons who were in Australia when the 1921 census was taken. The following table particularises, viz. April, 1921, to September, 1924 (3½ years): Nationality Excess of arrivals over departures.

The action of the United States of America in adopting the quota system to restrict the flow of immigration to that country, has had the effect of diverting immigrants from certain European countries to Australia. The United States law came into effect on July 1, 1924. In the light of this fact the following which is self-explanatory, is interesting: Excess of arrivals over departures of persons of various European nationalities, July 1, 1924 to November 30, 1924 (5 months). Finns, 230; Greeks, 924; Italians, 1932; Jugo-Slavs, 693; Maltese, 221; Serbs, 107; Albianians (not separately recorded), 106. The average number of arrivals from the countries mentioned during the five months period indicated was, therefore, about 842, at the rate of 10,104 per annum. It has been pointed out that during the 3½ years ended September, 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign persons was 16,148- at the rate of 4,614 per annum. The above table shows they are arriving at the rate of over 10,000 per annum, a large percentage increase, but not a very large actual increase. The following table shows the position in regard to the movement of Italian and Greek people to Australia. ITALIANS.

In May, 1921, the first Immigration Restriction Act was passed by the United States Congress. This Act introduced the "quota" system. The quota was limited to 3 per cent of the number of nations of each country who were domiciled in the U.S. according to the census of 1910. This Act operated for a year and was replaced by the Act which came into force on July 1, 1924. This later Act reduced the quota from 3 per cent to 2 per cent of the number of nationals domiciled in the United States as determined by the census of 1890. The reason for this is significant. The great steam of so- called Nordic immigration flowed to the United States before 1890 — the 'new' or southern European immigration came later. The figures in the following table are striking and show the great reductions effected by the new Act in the quotas of such countries as Czecho Slovakia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Greece, Russia, Roumania, and Jugo-Slavia.

The Congress Committee in reporting on this matter said: "The most troublesome administrative difficulty encountered since the enactment of the 3 per cent law has been the enforcement of the numerical limitation. The actual physical counting of human beings arriving by ship and train has been a task of magnitude. Mistakes have been made. Steamships have raced to port in efforts to land passengers within time limits. Delays and disappointments have brought hardships. Distressing appeals for relief in individual cases have assailed the officers charged with enforcement of the law. Senators and representatives have been besought to aid either in nullifying the statute or in mitigating its force. "All these troublesome obstacles are confidently expected to be eliminated in the event of the enactment of the new Bill. The Bill contains provision for enforcement of the numerical limitation not by counting immigrants upon their arrival, but by counting immigration certificates issuable at American consulates overseas. The plan, briefly, is to issue for each nationality a number of immigration certificates to be placed in the hands of intending immigrants as they obtain American visas upon their passports. Each certificate has a validity of two months to the time of taking ship. Therefore, the intending immigrant, having obtained his passport, his immigration certificate, and his visa, is at liberty to proceed to the United States in the full knowledge that he will not be debarred solely by a quota limitation. He must, however, undergo further examination at the port of entry and be able to pass under the provisions of the 1917 Act. It is expected that the number of those who connot pass will be greatly reduced by reason of the preliminary investigation. There should be no arrival of excess-quota cases, and there need be no racing of steamships. If this bill reduces to the minimum the number of arriving aliens that must be turned back, it will have accomplished one of its important purposes." It seems to be impracticable for Australia, which has no Foreign Service, to enforce a quota law. Another significant passage in the report of the United States Congressional Committee is the following: "Decision be the committee to limit admissions of quota immigrants to 2 per cent, based on census figures of 1830, instead of 3 per cent, based on the census of 1910, was reached after long and careful consideration of every element of the entire immigration problem. An impelling reason for the change is that it is desired to slow down the streams of the types of immigrants which are not easily assimilated. Naturalisation does not necessarily mean assimilation. The naturalisation process cannot work well with the continued arrival in large numbers of the so-called new immigration. The new type crowds in the larger cities. It is exploited. It gains but a slight knowledge of America and American institutions. It has grown to he a great undigested mass of alien thought, alien sympathy and alien purpose. It is a menace to the social, political and economic life of the country. It creates alarm and apprehension. It breeds racial hatreds which should not exist in the United States and which need not exist when the balance shall have been restored."
