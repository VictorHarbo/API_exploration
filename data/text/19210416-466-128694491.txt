There is a method of bunting out stump* with chemicals, and it has been published in these columns It is, however, djumrutx, unle-wt very great care is taken. The process was to I-ore a hole into the sturup with a 2in. auger and pour in a mixture of equal parts of nitric actd and sulphuric acid. th»n plugging the hole with a wooden plug dipped in paraf fin. Ono acid has to be added to the other very slowly, and the plu^ put in with care, or it may be Mown out and tbe operator injured. Though very effective, we prefer to recommend one of the other processes which we append. The first is to dig a trench ibout Sin. deep and the same width all round I tie stumo, clearing awav the dirt so as to expose the roots ;nd part of the stump below the ground level. No < hw.ijng of the roots is necessary. Kill tbe trench with dry wool small dry roots, good sound chips, or chunks »f dry wood of anv kind cut sho»t. When this »vo--d is U alight, cover up the hole with earth, and dig tip around. A good plan is to pare off of the turf and da<« the »ods turf side next to the wood. The (ire must be kept closelv covered up. At first a few curls of white smoke should be allowed to appear, but, say next _v. the Are should be so banked over that there is hardly a si en of fire to be seen. In this way, one person care keep 20 or 30 stumps going at one time. and. if »he work ii rroperly dm*. it will bum the stiunos out. The bank should not be interfered with for three or. foi:r weeks, and sometimes the burniitr will continue over m'»nth. A soft wood stump may be removed 1 v U-t iir; ;. ltr>jp hole, say lin.. in a downward direc tion to a dentli of Ifiin. to 20in. Kill the hole with * kerosene, and. as the oil nenetratcs the wo hI. 1111 the hole a train. After each filling, cover the hole with a wood plug. After a month or two, apply fire to the oil in the hole, which will entirely consume the stump. J.C.B. er;).-1. If the painting is valuable you lad better »et the work done by a professional.
