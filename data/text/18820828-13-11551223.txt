SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL SUMMARY. Moderate progress has been made with the Railway Construction Bill during the past fortnight. When the last mail left, 43 lines out of 56 had been voted. Since then one line has been struck out—a suburban extension from Albert-park to Elwood; and a railway from Cranbourne to Yallock (the first section of the Southern railway to Port Albert) has been substituted for the line from Jeetho to Queensferry, a town- ship on the shores of Western Port. The remainder of the proposals of the Government were adopted without altera- tion. A strong effort was made by the Sandhurst members to carry a line from that place to Seymour, in place of the proposed railway from Wandong to Sand- hurst. Both extensions pass through Heathcote, and would establish a con- nexion between the North-eastern and the Melbourne and Echuca systems. The Government recommended the Wandong route as the more direct communication between Melbourne and Heathcote, and also because it connected Kilmore—a town lying to the westward of the North- eastern line—with the metropolis.

across the British Channel, and still he had to say that na far as he knew, and as faraa his observa tion could penetrate, he know of no country under the sun which was so abundant in all that was necessary to constitute a great, powerful, and free nation as was Aus- tralia (Cheers ) lhese colonies would be managed best by our having, an unfailing and fruitful faith in the resources and powers of each other, and in endeavouring, while serving ourselves honestly, to sorveour neigh- bours OB best we might, and pulling together in cordial union towards one great result (Cheers ) That specially hold good of new countries, and looking at the map of Australia, he thought it would puzzle the most astute man to say what real advantage there waa to any single individual in that part f Australia known os Victoria and New'' South Wales by its being under two Govern ments (Cheers ) It was a compact field, in its resources it was nearly alike Its climate was nearly the same and it waB as compactly carved out of the map as any country well could be under one Government What he desired to illustrate by this re terence to tbo possible union of the two colonies waa the simple madness of creating antagonisms and oppositions between two colonies BO naturally suited to be one and which were peopled by men and women of the Bomo (.reat race (Loud cheers ) Wo at least mie,ht work together m the future if we liked (Hear hear) 1 he united popula tion of Hueo two countries waa at tho I rcecnt timo considerably over a million and a 1 alf and tina population placed at ninet that of the rest of Australasia shows I ow powerful they should bo (Cheera ) Going from these two colonies to the othera in ti e group a vers different state of things waa to bo found Oueeual ind had an extent of territory double the Bi/e of that we poa teEEed unitedlj or very nearly ao It had I oui dlesa richea of ti e soil and under the eoil but it had aclimato which in all pro 1 ob htj would bring about great troubles in the inttoduction of the diflcrent races South AuBtraha had also an unwieldy territory wl ero in all probabihtj similar complications will ariEe If there were troubles in the future they would nee from tho necessity of introducing diflcrent racea to undergo the ordinarj lal oura of commerce in those dia tant parts of AuBtral a lhen in that immense territory which waB now known aa Western Auat aha we found a land which was rich and which m many respects waa enpable of sustaining a largo population but wl ich through Eomo Btranpe fatality haa hitherto la n in almost a dormant Btate But that would not luat forever and the time would come when we would have, on this continent of Aua traha a teemine, population-BO large indeed that wo would bo i,reat among the powers of the world lhe two most populous coloniea should look to all these considerations and trj to lend aeBistai co one to the other BO OB to promote the hoi i test aottloment for build ing up the nation that waa to be (Cheera) He loped that every day would bring us nearer and nearer to some federal o"rco ment (líenewed cheera ) Aa to what the oi inion m other parta of the world upon AUB trolm waa le thought 1 o would offend no bod} in saying that both in America and in I ngland there were instances of a surprising amount of ignorance in that respect lhere Vfete intell tent men in America and I ngland who Billi btheved that Melbourne and Sydney were email villages and that Australia waa a I loee where men and women could not live without suffering great privations It was grat fjing hov ever to kuovv that this iguor ance waa steadily melting away and that a clearer knowledge of ua was spreading among tie populations of the world In the little compact kingdom of Belgium he noticed that there waa on active feeling in favour of cultivating an acquaintance with Australia lho manufacturers and merchants thero wanted wool iron ore and the various things which we produced and at tho Bame time to open up markets for the Bale of the articles which they produced and the same would gradually become the case in Germany m 1 ranee and in the other countries of Northern Turope aB well aa in our parent countrj During his tour ho had tried to forget that he belonged to New South Walea andto Bpeak of thi-ee coloniea aa equal and united bj 1 indrcd tics He trusted that ev ery day would bring about a cloBer relation Blnp between the coloniea and he for one would do his utmost in that direction He did not believo that anjone who know anything about him would suspect lum of desirn g disconnexion with Lngland ( No no and cheera) It waa hia earnest boje that in Eome form or another that con nexion would go on through unending jearB (Cheers ) Lut ho did desire to seo a day when we would not be dependent upon! ng land for anything-when we would not be dependent upon her should a time of trial and open war arise even for defence (Hear hear ) He did not want theao coloniea-rich and capable as they were-defended Bhould a I me of war atlee by wringing out money fr^ce the down trodden taxpayers of 1 ngland (Cheera ) W o ought not to look to 1 upland for ai j help of that kind In the future ahe would have auflicient to do to hold her place and to BUBta n her glorj-which glory WOB ours OB well aa hera She would have enough to do in that direction without waating her resources upon countries such as we were with all tho elementa of self government and which were perfectly capable of providing for themselvea in every possible emergencj (Cheera) What he wanted then waa a clo'o relationship a better understanding a better huBbandmg of tho resources of these colonies so that at an early day they m Bht be able not only to frame their own lawB and to build up their own institutions but to prepare for every consummation which per tamed to nations (Applauae ) Amongst the other toasta celebrated were I rospenty to Victoria and lhe Colony of Ivew South Wales On the

sufficient quantity of suitable stone from the quarry at Mount Difficult in tho Grampians, near Stawell for the erection of the front of I arliament house have Bent in their report In 18S0 the Berry Government determined that the front of tlio Parliament houBO Bhould be built of \ ictonan freeatoue, and in spite of many warnings and I rotéete tbej eolccted the Stawell stone of which n few exceptionally good aamples had been exhibited m Melbourne let a contract for ti o work to Mr Samuel Ameaa and con etructed a tramway to the ¡uarry at a C03t of over £20 000 Ihe juarry waa previously lea°cd to the peraons who had eulo"ised and promoted tho Btone and a clause was inserted in their lease that they Bhould supply such etonea aa might bo re quired for any jublic building I avour able reports about the stono wero obta ned from several experta and from two boards of inquirj but the quarry waB never oponed properly and the-, reports were consequently based merelj on samples and theories Ibey w»ie however accepted and acted upon by the then Government and the results have been-delaj waste of monej and failure _be committee in the f rst place find that the work is delayed m consequence of a dif culty in obtaimn" atone according to sample as required by the contract They then cue a Btatemcnt of the facts elicited in tho course of ti eir investigation lheir in luirj waB directed principally to three i oints -1 irst the character of ti e sample stone the aupen ontj of w Inch they found waa bej ond question second the character of the stone sent from the quarry to the contractor and with regard to tins the great bull of the evidence showed that a large proportion of it was i o only inferior to the sample but was unfit in con sequence of inferiority of texture clay veinB and rrackB tobe placed in the 1 arliament buildings -hird the character of the stono obtainable at the quarry and this evidence they say is of a very con tradictory and unsatisfactory kind lliey recommend that tho quarry should be opened up ly putting in a gullet to determine whether stone can be procured of the si/e and quality required It is estimated that a gullet would cost £1 00 and the committee say that the work should be undertal en by the Public W ork3 department It will take four months to test the quarry In the meantime the committee think that Mr Arness s con tract for the erection of the front of the 1 ar hament building should be annulled by mu tual consent In conclusion they earnestly BupgeBt that Parliament should consider tho propriety of noing granito instead of free stone the former being one of the finest and moat durable stones in the colony ATTEMPT TO MURDrR ARCHBIaHOP GOOLD A deliberate attempt to murder the Moat Reverend Dr Goold Roman Catholic Arch

In fact, einco the departure of the former German consul, Mr Weber, it haa lost prestige to a very considerable extent The arrival of Sir Arthur Gordon ia daily expected, and in the present state of things it is quite possible that his visit may turn the wavering Beale in favour of British interesta, and give a pre dominating power to EngliBh influence ' MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL The Argus Office, Saturday Evening The R M S S Ravenna, with the outward Australian and New Zealand mailB, left the bay at 7 o'clock on the morning of 13th ina i The Ravenna, being a through steamer, went to London via Bombay.

The Chimboraro cleared the Heads at 25 mmntes paBt 8 o'clock on the 22nd, and was signalled off Cape Otway at a quarter past 2 o'clock in the afternoon. This steamer, m addition to general freight, shipped a quantity or frozen mutton at Sidney, and there waB also a quantity put on board here, OB well as wool and othor colonial products. A large shipment of trea sure was placed on board of the value of £0-1,928 There waB also a quantity shipped at Sydney The R M S S Clyde, after a quick ran from Colombo, arrived m the bay shortly after i o'clock on the afternoon of the 20th uiBt with the mails from England and the E vat.

The amount p-ud in compensation to the victims of the Joli mont accident is set down at £15 000 The nioBt striking items in the report are-first, that the North eastern line during last year echrsed all former results, by realising a not profit on working equal to 8' per cent on ita capital coat, and secondly, that whilst thore has been a decrease in the amounts earned from the carriage of stock on the Northern and North eastern systems, there has been an increase in both the Weatern and Gipps Land lines In 1870 the amount earned from tho carriage of stock on the Gipps Land line wa3 Í3 299, in 1880 it reached £9,491, and m 18S1 it amounted to £13 511 It will bo of Borae intereat to state that the shipment of Glasgow pipes ex _.och Ven nnchar, which is now being discharged, has been exan ined by Mr Davidson, engineer of the Yan Yean department, who has found that each pipe has been cast faucet down- wards Each will be carefully inspected, and none will be accepted which have been manu- factured in any other way.
