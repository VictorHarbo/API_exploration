SUMMARY - FOR EUROPE. (CONTINUED FROM THE SUPPLEMENT TO THE ARGUS.) THE GOLD-FIELDS. Without any very splendid or startling finds, either of country or nuggets, the new year has opened with very fair prospects for the miners. The late discoveries have been of a nature calcu- lated rather to afford room for expansion over a wide extent of ground than induce men to crowd together on smaller, though, in the or dinary acceptation of the term, richer spots ; and we have not now to learn which is best for the great majority of those following this pur- suit. These richer spots have been found on some of the older diggings; but the most important discovery of late has been in the opening of a new field at the Pyrenees, apparently of great extent. The first rush was to the Mountain Creek, where very good ground was struck at the outset; but this becoming soon inconve niently crowded, prospectors scattered abroad in all directions, and their efforts resulted in the distribution of the population over a wide area, and the opening of other fields, miles apart, and at different sides of the ranges, richer and more extensive than the diggings at the Mountain Creek. So far as the country around has been yet examined, and until a few weeks since it was in comparative solitude, it is auriferous to an extent sufficient to support a vast population for years to come, on the alluvial ground alone, and amongst the ranges there are indications of reefs without number, but whether impregnated with gold enough to pay for extraction will not b3e ascertained at present, as digging offers a better chance for immediate remuneration. The sink ing in any part of this district yet tried does not reach below 30 feet ; and, although no clearly defined leads have yet been found, the patches of alluvial ground are so close together that the number of unproductive holes put down has not been great in proportion to those bottomed on gold. The yield averages about an ounce to the load \- a very paying return under the circumstances. The new field prior to this - Rutherglen, or the Wahgunyah leads, as it is indifferently called - is of quite a different character, and does not afford such a scope for many people. There the leads are narrow, and in deep sinking, with an average yield about the same, still only remune rative in parts, and not adapted for the support of a large population. In Gipps Land there have been some discoveries of late of ground fit for sluicing, by the different prospectors, in the rivers and streams among the mountains and ranges ; but nothing at all suggestive of the wealth anticipated from the new Kiandras so confidently looked for six months ago. The truth appears to be, that we must expect little more from Gipps Land except auriferous deposits, calculated to pay small parties, in places, and to a greater extent strong parties of sluicers, making use of the water so greatly abundant, but with the disad- vantage of very bad roads to contend with. Ground of this nature exists apparently to a great extent among the ranges, but it can be but slowly taken up and occupied. In addition to this greater scope for the miner on new ground, he has water more plentiful than ever before at this season to enable him to keep the pud dling mills going to advantage on the still re- munerative portions of the older fields, so that the decline in the escort returns ought to be stayed this year, if it is to be stayed at all. Turning to the older fields, we see most clearly the advantages derived from quartz-mining, in the steadiness of the returns from the Bendigo district, the first in which the reefs were opened to any extent, and now almost wholly dependent on these for the gold produced within its limits. The quantity of alluvial gold diminishes from year to year, while in an inverse ratio the yield from the reefs increases, and the deeper these are worked the richer they become. Only last week a lot of quartz specimens from the Catherine Reef was on view at Sandhurst, of the gross weight of 300oz., 250oz. being gold ; and the week before half a ton of stone from a claim on the Johnson's Reef was crushed, and yielded 350oz. of gold. This last stone was raised from a depth of 300 feet. Some very large returns have also been obtained lately from the Inglewood reefs, where alluvial mining is almost at an end for the present. By far the richest of these, as yet, is the Columbian, and short as is the time since this was first opened, the quantity of gold produced is already very great. Last week a parcel of 114 tons of stone from one claim on this yielded 1,500oz.; and two or three weeks since 240 tons of unselected stone from the next claim yeilded 1,400oz ; a lot of 186 tons from another claim produced 657oz. We have before had to announce even greater yields than these from this same reef, which is only fairly opened in three or four claims as yet. A small parcel of 15 tons of picked stone, from the first claim opened on another reef in this district, produced 470oz. on being crushed three weeks since. Good returns from smaller lots of stone we could enumerate to an extent wearisome to the general reader ; and so will conclude with the results obtained by a party of lucky pro- spectors from their claim on a reef discovered a very few months since, in quite another part of the country - at Morse's Creek, in the Ovens district. The total quantity of stone actually raised by this party in four months was very great, as the lode is wide, and easily worked; but they have had, during that time, only 826 tons crushed, the total yield from which was 4,130oz. of gold, or an average of 5oz. to the ton. These large yields are, of course, excep- tional, but they are increasing rather than de- creasing in number and proportion as quartz mining extends ; and we may safely say, as we have often done before, that the reefing interest generally is in a most prosperous and healthy condition. AGRICULTURE. We are now well on with the harvest, and the weather still maintains its unsettled character - a few warm days occasionally, alternating with days of such cold and rain as in ordinary seasons are only experienced in the midst of winter. Only this week, in the height of midsummer, we have had another of these extreme changes, ac companied with heavy rain, which has caused much inconvenience, and no small loss to the farmer. Fortunately, the changes are rapid, and the rains do not continue very long; still, they cause much interruption to the work of the harvest field and penetrate to the heart of many a half- made or unthatched stack, necessitating an ad- ditional expenditure in high-priced labour, which, with the present prospect of low prices for most descriptions of produce, cannot well be afforded. Now that reaping is general all over the colony, labour is found not to be so scarce as was anticipated a few weeks since, and there has been a reduction of 5s. per acre on the rates first given. From £1 to 25s. an acre is the general rate now, and men are working more steadily at this than they did when in the receipt of more. A number of the Chinese, too, have taken to harvest work near several of the gold-fields, and are a great assistance to the farmer at the present pinch. They do not cut one-half so much in the day with their small hooks as would the same number of ordinary European reapers, but they remain long in the field and are careful to leave no grain behind, so that employers find it highly advantageous to secure a gang of them at ths moderate lates of remuneration with which they are satisfied. The straw generally being heavy this season, and much of the corn laid, it was feared that little work could be got through with the machines, but this difficulty also was magnified, and instead of machines standing idle, the trouble has been in finding men enough to follow as binders. As to the actual yield of grain this year opinions vary much. Even in some places where there was no visible cause for any deficiency the grain is proving to be light as compared with the straw, and altogether light compared with what might have been expected from general appearances ; but complaints of this nature are not general ; and where the crops have been uninjured by the caterpilllar and the land is good, and has not borne too many crops of grain, the aver age yield of wheat is expected to reach 30 bushels to the acre. The caterpillar has done much mischief, however, in some places, principally on the older farms ; and a heavy hail- storm which passed over some portion of our territory last week beat out much of the grain that was standing ; so that there will be the usual proportion of reducing causes to bring down the average of the whole colony to probably but a few bushels over 20 to the acre. The yield of oats is expected to reach from 5 to 10 bushels more, according to the locality ; and the produce of potatoes will be large. As may be supposed from the nature of the season, grass is unusually abundant, and the English grasses particularly are thriving as they never did before in this part of the world. Although at this time of year green blades of any kind are usually few and far between, now everything in the way of herbage is fresh and green, except the annual grasses and herbs, which must decay when their seeding time is past. As a consequence of this abundance of feed, fat stock are still most plen- tiful, and good meat continues cheap. The autumn shows of stock and grain will com mence shortly, those near Melbourne to wind up with the annual grain show, which, this year, will have more than ordinary interest, as then first a decided opinion can be formed of the character of the grain from which the samples for the Great International Exhi- bition will have to be selected. At our last show of this kind here many persons who were well qualified to judge declared that such a col lection of samples of splendid grain could not be got together in any part of the world, as the growth of one country ; and it was hoped that tiro should bo able to send to the next world's fair tpecimens of our agricultural produce that would ¡ommand as much attention as did our gol 1 m former occasions; but the elements have icen against us, and, however plump an I rull the grain may be, scarcely a stack of ¡rain of any_ kind has boen got together with jut a sufficient exposure of its component wrts to the rain in the field to obtain for it ihe weather-boatcn appearanco formerly unknown tero. If our grain has suffered thus generally ia ippearance, we will have some compensation, for >ur home show at least, though not for tho pur- pose s'ated, in tho superior excellence of the -oots and torage plants of all kinds, which not ¡nany years since wero so meagre and altogether »significant ia comparison with tho grain, Sines .ho date of our last summary the Melbourne trial >f reapers has been held, the result being, as on tho occasion of the trial of mowers, tho nnrkod iucoess of the one-horse machine made here by R.ntiin>nn nnd Cn. fills munbilla lind tri min jin aero and three roods and a half, and performod its work well and cleanly in an hour sind 43 minutes, without the least distress to the horse. The two-horsa machine, by another maker, which look tho prize for reopinç, cut 3 acres and 3 roods in 2 hours and 57 minutes. Pleuro-pno-i monia is still extending its ravages. One herd of upwards of 80 head was destroyed last weak, and the cattle belonging to the owner's brother, vihir-h wero formerly running with thèse, are no v found to bo extensively diseased. A bill to give increased powers in preventing the spread of ft a disease bos boen brought before Parliament, but I he absorbing interest of late political movements has prevented it from receiving much attention as yet. THE WAH IN NEW ZEALAND. Via Sydney we have Now Zealand papers with important news from the seat of war. The dates arc from Now Plymouth to the 3rd inst,, and Auckland to the 5th. The following narrative is compiled from tho official despatch of Major- General Pratt, and tha Auckland papers : Tho followintr is the despatch from the Major Gc lierai commanding to His Excellency the Governor of Now Zealand : " Camp, Waitara, 31st December, 18GD. " Sir,-I havo the honour to report for the information of your Excellenoy and the members of the Government, that the excessive rains having ceased. I was enabled to move out from New Plymouth' on the 28ÍU inst., in order to attaok a large body of the Waikatos, who had occupied a very strong position at Matarikoriko, on the left bank of the Waitara, aud not far from Iluiraugi. " My force, after being joined by parties from the Waitara Camp ana the other positions, amounted to 000 rank and file of all arms, whick was all I could muster, after leaving the town and other posts iu, security, and required somj atsUitance from H.M.S. Cordelia and H.M.G.S. ¡Victoria ; and I note this in consequeuco of ths great mis-statements which are circulated re- garding tho amount of force at my disposal for aggressive operations. " Having halted at the Waitara Orup, now my base of operation, I marched from tlionca at half-past 3 o'clock on the morning of lho 29th, and reached Kairau, opposite tin Matarikoriko mound and pa, and 000 yards dis- tant from it, at half-post 6 a. in., and proceeded to throw up an entrenched camp, for the security of the troops during the subsequent operations. This was done without molestation, until abouti 9 o'olook, when a very heavy fire was opeuoi upon us from a line of rifle-pits, extending for COO yards, just 100 paces from us, and running along tho edge of a deep ravine between us and the pa, having very precipitous banks, and at tin bottom of which was a dense forest and dejp »swamp. Firing was opened upon us also fron skirmishers in the high fern, nearly all roan J the entrenchments. This was promptly returns 1 "fay our skirmishers, the troops, and howitzers ; and heavy firing was kept up on both sides until 6 o'olock in the evening, by which time tho rj doubt, which had been carried on the whole tim J, being completed, it was garrisoned, and a porto J of the force returned to camp. " Next morning (30th December), at daylight, on my troops reaohing the redoubt, I found that the enemy had kept up a constant fire during the sight, which was as promptly returned. They liad a white flag on the pa and line of rifle-pits ; and the redoubt was heightened and stronjrthene i during the day, without a shot being bred on either side. . _ " On the 31st, at half-past 3 a.m., I again inarched out, but from the information wilton reached me on the road, that the enomy WAI leaving the rifle-pits and retiring from the pa, and that it was not unlikely that it might bo occupied by another party of the onemy whj .were known to be coming up from tho north, I at once sent an order to Colonel Wyatt, com- manding the entrenchment, to ascertain whether the rifle-pits and the pa were occupied, and if not, to take possession of both without a moment's delay. This was immediately done by a party of 200 men of the 65th and Naval Brigade, under Colonel Wyatt and Commodore Seymour, and on our force sighting the pa, we had the satisfaction ot seeing the British flag floating over it. " The result of these three days has been that the proud Waikatos, who had threatened to drive' us into tho sea, havo instead been thomselrei driven from one of the most formidable positions I ever saw, chosen by themselves, and that, toj, .with singular sagacity, into the dense bush, and we occupy positions to keep them thero. " Our casualties havo been throo killed aud twenty-two wounded, whioh is small, considering the shower of bullets pourod upon us for suoh a length of time. " I cannot as yet ascertain the exact loss of the enemy, but it niUBt havo been great to have ' induced them to suffer the mortification of aban- doning their .pa and position without another Gtruggle ; it is known that at least five chiefs havo been killed, amongst them To Ahitana of ICgatiawa," and Karira of Ngatiamniapoto, a ni further particulars as to names aud numbers will ho sent hereafter. " I have now to bring to your Excelleuoy'/j notice tho conduct of tho Naval Brigade aud | troops of all arms ; their duties have been mo ii .laborious and incessant ; skirmishing through tiru high fern over the hoad, fired at by uuseeu foes, and carrying on the work of the entrencatnen; uudcr heavy fire, too much cannot bo said i i their praise. " The officers of all ranks vied with their tan in carrying out their respective duties, and it.wiil be my great satisfaction to bring the names o' many ot thom to the notice of the authorities at the Horse Guards." The Southern Cross says : " Mntarikoriko was taken on Sunday morning, after 22 hours'hard fighting, during which tim j 50,000 rounds of ammunition are said to havj bei'ii expended by our men fighting ¡u the fern, and about 120 of the enemy killed and wounded, with the loss on our side of 3 killed and Vi wounded (only two of which are dangerouscases. J Seventeen were ' rought up by the Tasmania» Maid to îîew Plvniouth on Monday. " A truce was granted to tho enomy on Sunday, to colleot their wounded and bury their dead. '" The enemy is said to have agreed to take care of any wounded or prisoners who may fall into their hands. They aro reported to be very numerous in the valloy near lluiranga pa, aud, ' have sent word to the general that tlioy inteu 1 fighting for it in earnest, as they havo large re- inforcements coming Bouth to their aid, ""The Cordelia was ordered to proceed to ths nWhite Cliffs, for the purpose of harassing the 'reinforcements of the rebels as thoy came up southward." . i *. The correspondent of the same journal, writing < f rom'Taramvki on tho 2nd inst., reports : " The troops marohod to the position thoy ia'-' tended to occupy on tho morning of the 29th ult. Au they 'expected to be attacked on the way, somo pf the troops were extended in skirmishing' 'order through fern six feed high, and ns it wai early in the morning, they got, wet tbiough with* the dew. The troops took up a position abren; of the pa, but rather inland of it,, a gully ruo"-, ning between the two, the head of whioh was a' little inland of the position, and tilo end of it in A' .swampy piece of timber, so much lower than tin > level of the pa and camp that the tops of tha, " trees, 100 feet high, were not, visible from the ,camp ; in ihe gully facing the camp, and on tin ' t sloping side of it from tho na, were open galleries like terraces, one behind another, comparatively ,,'shallow, with a bank left to sitjon in them. These galleries had traverses at intervals tocas 'off a raking fire, and the lineal extout of them -Hit.i about 800 yards. "The working party was throwing up the en- trenchments of the camp( and skirmishers were thrown out on tho four sides bomo lime bafor. ,tlio natives made any sign-between one andtwj j hours- and the i-kirmiBhers had adran_3 .-»iliiinDO yards of tho natives, before tho latter i opened fire, which they did from three sid si a-, otioe ; two of 'these proved to bo mere feints, th j, i 'main file! settling in front. Mauy narrow o soap 31 , took place, bat many more wore wounded. I'.-oru this time the Aro of the enemy continued willi, but little interruption tor 2t,boura, when' thj, i -natives ran up a white flag from tho ,pa, an I a* ..puny of them with a white flag advanced bsUlty wilina a hundred yaids of the uoopj, M&jftin;* , ing i ti a flag in the ground, waited nil the Ils/)' ¿lr. Wilitoa came up to th*tu, wlien tiley ask* ( fur a cessation of hostilities, to rcmjve tiij.r dead and wounded, and because they did not want to fight on a Sunday. The general agreed to th » truce, and hoped to have the two 56-pounderj ii position by the time hostilities were to re-oom mepce. When, however, the time was up, the natives had departed."

The voyage has been, on the whole, a healthy one, though four deaths occurred during the same-one, a soldier, from dysentery ; a seaman, from consumption j and two boys.-Southern Gross, Dec. 25. The following telegram was received by Sir Henry Barkly on the 21st inst. : "SYDNEY, SUNDAY, 3ï.at. " The Prince Alfred arrived at 2 o'clock, with nowa to the 14th inst. As she was coming out of New Plymouth she met the Tasmanian' Mtid from Waitara, which she left that morning at 7 o'clock. The troops had just commenced nn attaok upon the rebels, and there wasaloudand continued diseharge of musketry and artillery. The result. was not known. The captain of the Tasmanian Maid reports that he had seen COO natives on the march on Sunday morning, the 13th inst,. within 20 miles of New Plymouth. The General is well in health, but is afflicted with sore eyes, which are prevalent throughout the camp. Accom- panied by his staff, he has surveyed all the pas along the coast, from the White Cliffs to Mimi. They are both numerous and Btrong. Toa troops are in excellent health and spirits, an i anxious for the fray. The preparations on out- side are said to be perfect." THE VOLUNTEERS. The chief events connected with the volunteer movement since the date of our last Summary have been a grand matoh in connexion with the Victorian Rifle Association, and a night muster of the metropolitan rifle companies. In our last wo mentioned that an association had been formed in the colony on the basis of the National Rifle Association in England, and that the fir-t matches in connexion with it were to como off oa the 29th and 31st of December and the 1st Janu ary. They took place accordingly on those dayl There were altogether seven matches, three con- fined to the volunteers alone, and four opon to the publie generally. In oaeh match there wero 240 competitors, and as everyone did not enter for all the matches, some 360 persons altogether took part in tho contest. The \olunteer matches were-1st, 300 yards j 2nd, 300, 500, and 600 yards; and 3rd, 600yards. The four all- comers' matches were at 200, 300, 500, and 600 yards'. The firing the first day was at 300 yardB*. and the shooting at this range was excellent. The highest number of points scored out of the five rounds which each competitor fired was 11, which were made by Sergeant Giss, I of the Fitzroy Company. This is two in exoass of what was made at Wimbledon. Mr. C. Mason, I of the 1st St. Kilda Rifles, scored 10 points, 8 of which were made in three shots, the amount | being attained by two bulls'-eyos and one centre. | The shooting on the second day, Monday, the I 31st of December, was not so good as on the 'Saturday, the day being very unpropitious, sud- ' [ 'den squalls and smart showers of rain prevailing. The 200-yardB matoh came off on this day, 10 points being the highest score, but nine of tho competitors made this. The firing at 500 yards' In the second volunteer matoh, also took place this day, and out of 90 who competed at the 600 yards' range, 41 were disqualified from, firing at GOO yards', as they had either not scored 7 points in all at the two first distances, viz. 300 and DOO yards, or had missed the target altogether at the latter range. We should mention that at the 240 who entered for the match, 218 actually fired at 300 yards', but 128 of these were disqua- lified from competing at 500 yards', as they hal not made 4 points at the first distance. Tuesday, the 1st January, was tho last day of the matches, ,No. 6 matoo, 500 yards, for -all comers, came off first, then the firing at 600 yardi' in No. 2 match, and after that the all- comers' matob, at 600 yards'. In match No. 2, a( the three ranges, :the 30 best «hots wera entitled to compete la match No. 3, at 609 yards', the prize for which was £25 presented by J lis Excellency the Governor, and *25 added by 'the association, together with their gold medal. Captain Badcliffe, the commanding officer of the Carlton Bille Company, was the fortunate winner, and received the congratulations of His Ex- cellency, who, with Lady Barkly, visited th* 'ground both on the first and last day, staying a considerable time on each occasion. A number of visitors were present during the diff.ren', matches, and for the gratification of both competitors and visitors the band of the Volun- teer Rifle Regiment played during the intervals between the firing. There were four targets for the shooting, anil they were of the same size as those used by the volunteer« at home. It wai remarked during the proceedings that most of those who had already earned for themselves a reputation as crack shots were nowhere ia the matches, nearly all the prizes being taken by ? gentlemen previously nnknowa to fame. The puzes, which amounted in value to upwards ni ¿500, were distributed by the Governor to the buccessful competitors on Saturday, the 5th January, in the Exhibition Building, m the pre- tence of a largo audience of ladies and gentle- men. Sir Henry Barkly, in addressing those present, gave every praise for the excellent shoot-' mg that liad been witnessed, and observod th it it was a source of great gratification that out of 26 prizes 25 had fallen to member^of one, or other of the volunteer corpj. The prizes, whioi varied ia amount from UlO.'to £30, with the ti caption of the, one of £50, were in son» instonoes presented in money, and in othors ia plate of some kind, at the option of the reci- pient. The next series of raatohes in connexion - ., with the association will como off about the end of Juno; and, on a proof of how successful tin association has been in raising funds we may state that, after providing the prizes, and payinr all the expenses attendant upon the proceed- ings, a sum of £400 still remains m hand to go to defraying the expenses of the next serios' of matches. Amongst the prizes to * be awarded thoro will be a gold cup, value 100 guineas, presented by tho anonymous donor of the £1,000 towards the exploration fund. The match in whioh this cup will bo con tonde 1 for will be open to volunteers from any of tha Australian colonies, but to none others. The night muster of the voluntoors took place on the nightof Thursday, the 10th, orrather tho morn- ing of Friday, tho 11th January, and wascon \- fined to tho metropolitan and suburban oom Sanies of the rifle regiment-viz. Melbourne, Weat lolbourno, North Melbourne, Carlton, Fitzroy, Collingwood, Richmond, East Collingwood, Haw- thorne, Emerald Hill, 1st and 2nd Kilda, an 1 Prahran and. South Yarra, in all 13 in number, and^who resided within a circle of some 20 milo ina circumference. Tho number of the riflemen no- minally enrolled in thesocompnnies is aboutl,250, but their effective strength may be put down a1-, a little over 1,000 ; and of those some 800 turne 1 out at 3 a.m. at theunnotifiedbuglocall,sounded in the respective districts at that nour, though, i i consequence of about three of the districts bein; rather moro distant than others, thoy won alarmed half an hour earlier. By a quarter pas, 4_ o'clock tho whole body had assombled on the high giound adjoining the Prince's Bridgo Bar- rack^ and, under command of Colonol Pitt, throw cut pickets, and made every preparation for re- ceiving an imaginary foe. After executing some manoeuvres they were dismissed about half-past 6 o'olook a.m., and marched away to their respectivo homes, together with the three bands, viz. the Regimental, and thoso attached to the Carlton nncTCollingwood companies, which had accom- panied thom, having first icceived the thanks of the colonol for the speedy manner in which they had turned out. The whole volunteer force now numbers some 4,200 men, of whioh n littto over 3,000 aro rifle- men, 600 artillery, 350 cavalry, and about 250 forming a naval brigade. Sinco our last summary some little display of feoling has taken plaoe in reference to the oldest cavalry corps in the colony, tho R. V. Yeomanry Cavalry. This was originated soma five years ago, and numbered in its ranks many gentlemen of high social standing in the colony. The greatest strength the corps evor attained was about 130, including 13 officers. Latterly, however, although thero was a supposed effective roll jjf about 90, it had been found impossible for many months to secure a largor average attend- ance at parade than 20. It was, therefore, proposod that the corps should bo incorporated with the mounted artillery, a body of gentlemen "..who were artillery only in name, really always doing duty as cavalry, and it was thought that the united force might make tho nucleus of a respeotablo regiment. The matter was referred to the members themselves, and both corps agreed to the amalgamation, at a publio meeting of the two that was hold, about a fortnight back. Tho officers of the two oorp3 wore accordingly gazettod to the new rogiment, ?which is styled tho 1st, or Royal Victoria Volun- teer Cavalry Regiment, each oflioor taking the same rank, precedence being determined by " seniority, in tho new corps that bo held in the old.,' Since then, however, the mombcrs of the "Yeomanry have held a meeting, from the pro- ceedings at which it appoars that a number of them have withdrawn their consent to the amal- gamation, which they state thoy only agreed to . under the supposition that if they did not join, they would bavo to leave altogether, as the Yeomanry would bo dono awoy with. Thoy have now discovered that such is not the case, and they have, tuercforo, determined to stick by their old corps, which of course is at presoat without an officer at all, but this state of things they proposo to remedy by appointing, at an early .day an adjutant and sergeant-major. From cor- rí cspondeuce that has oeen published in con- nexion with the matter, it seems that the uniform, &c;, which was paid for by the membors of the yeomanry themselves, cost about £34, and this nas ¡ probably one reason why few recruits were obtainable-whilst that for the now regiments ri ill only cost £5, and the amount will be paid by Government. Amongst the other good signs in regard to the ) volunteers, we may mention that matches between a selected number from two companies liuve been commenced, and promise to create a good deal of emulation. Other matches, too, are t ery general, and rifle shooting, oven as a pa.i time, is beginning to excite as strong a feeling of interest as orickot itself. POPULATION. The population of the colony on the 1st of January may bo stated as 550,000, of whom 340,000 wore males, and 210,000 females. The latest official returns published wore made up to the 30th September, 1860; and by adding to these ascertained totals the average quarterly in- crease by births over deaths, and by immigra- tion! over emigration, wo arrivo at these figures. Preparations are being made for taking tho oen t-us in April next, in accordance with tho views of the Imperial Government ; but as the book« of thoTcgistrar-general aro carefully made up in this partioular, for reliable data, tho above com- putation will be found substantially correct. There has been a continuous falling-off in immi- gration throughout tho year 1800. Tho balance of arrivals over departures numbered only 5,876. In 1859 there was a balance of 11,743; in 1858, of 18,239; in 1857, of 42,812; in 1858, of 21,044 ; and in 1835, of 40,124.
