Tho original Capitol has been expended in the purchase of twenty-four acres of land near Woodvilk, yielding an unlimited supply of clay, in the erection of Kilns, providing and erecting steam-engine and brick-making machines (by one of which 1,000 brickd per hour may be made at a small working cost), the erection of drying sheds and other buildings, and supplying working plant. The preliminary expenses have been met, includ ing sonie losses on experiments inevitable in the ccrciuencement of such an undertaking, and the machinery is now ready for a fair start. The bricks made before the Machine was erected have been nearly all disposed of, and an unlimited demand exists for bricks of all descriptions. The Company holds n contract for supply of ordinary bricks to the Government, and it is believed that the superior quility of pressed bricks which their machinery will enable them to turn out, and for which constant enquiries are being made, will render the im portation of bricks from Victoria unnecessary. The large and increasing demand for bricks at the Port and Semaphore can be most advan tageously supplied by the Coaipany, as the proximity of the works to the railway will enable a aiding to be constructed at a small cost. The Directors hare already become personally liable for an amount in excess of the subscribed capital, which the Shareholders, who are few in number, are unable to supplement. They confi dently appeal to the public to take up further Shares, in orderly firmly to establish an industry which will speedily prove an excellent invest ment. Application for Shares, £100 each, may be made until noon of Saturday next, to the Sec retary, at the Office of the Company, Grenf ell- street; or to the Directors, Messrs. Theodore Hack, Port ; Josliua Gurr, Currie-street ; Jas. Anderson, Currie- street ; W.

PULSFORD W. J. PAULL A. M0UNEUX. At a meeting held on the 27th January, at White's Arbitration Room. — His Worship the Mayor, E. T. Smith, Esq., occupying toe chair— it was resolved that a Committee should be appointed for the purpose of promoting the formation of a Company having for its main object the obtaining of a daily Supply of Fresh Fish for the City and Suburbs of Adelaide. It is freely admitted that the supply of fresh fish is at present totally inadequate to the public requirements, and that the prices demanded for that which is placed for sale almost prohibits its use as an article of diet. There can be little doubt that very large quantities of fish could be disposed of at moderate rates— say 3d. to 4d. per lb.— and that a plentiful supply at such charges would meet with a good demand. J From explorations made, within the past three years, by the Co-wry Fishing Company, it has been proved that an almost inexhaustible source of fish supply exists within a reasonable distance from the city, and that it'is only necessary to provide a sufficient number of safe fishing smacks and a swift steamer to enable tbe Promoters to bring tothejmarket a full daily supply of fresh fii h, equal to all requirements, at such low pric*s t« th« public as will place this accessary food within the reach of all, whibt nt the same time handsomely recompensing the capitalists and the employes of tbe proposed Company. It is therefore proposed to form a Public Company, under the Limited Liability Act, for the purchase of a swift and. commodious steam ressel and a number of fishing cutters, to supplement the plant now owned by the Cowry Fishiug Company, which will become incor porated with tbe new Company, the Shareholder* receiving ia paid-up Shares an amount equivalent to £4,3C0 for their interest in one steamer, four cutter*, two centre-board boats, several small boats, fishing gear, &c;, and alLthe plant now belooijiag to the said Cowry Com^ Of the 5,000 Shares in the proposed Company it is intended to iasae 2,500 to the general public, to reserve 350 for offer to the employes of the Company, and the remaining 2,150 are to be allotted as fully paid-up Shares to the Cowry Company for their present plant, which will be handed over in good order and free from all encumbrance as soon as the Articles of Association are signed. IS; is proposed to add to the plant tbn3 acquired another steamer 2 about 110 feet in length, with all latest improvements, capable of steaming twelve miles per hour, and to use this for bringing up the fish from the stations. In addition it will be necessary to procure sixteen good strong cutters, capable of standing any ordinary weather. These will be stationed on the various fishing grounds, and the steamer will collect each day's catch, landing them in the early morning for the market. The smaller boats will be used in the various bays for the purpose of catching net fish, which will De wanted to afford^chotce_ 'Application ^Shares may be made np to Monday, March 1, 1830, to Mr. W.
