As to the first charge, you will find by tho subjoined state ment that Morang has this year received more than its share by nearly three hundred pounds; and as to the second allegation, I have examined the minutes of the proceedings of tho council during the last year, and find that tho voting has been generally of Ja mixed and not of a party nature, and that I have not otocrvcd an occasion where Morang, by a combina tion of the other councillors, ha3 been outvoted, ex cept once, when the question was debated as to whether tbe general expenditure should then be ap portioned to tbe different tidings, or at a subsequent period of the year. 1 am, Sir, Yours respectfully, JAMES RYAN, Secretary Shire Hall, Epping, 26th September, 1674.

IMPORTS of SEWING MACHINES for 1873 The Imports of The WHEELER and WILSON MACHINES Show an increase of over 160 PER CENT., or Four times more than Singer's, As proved by the Journal of Commerce.

These qualities aro owing to the Rotatory Hook System on which they arc constructed, and which combiue GREAT SPEED with surprising durability and simplicity.
