We have frequently endeavoured in our advertisements to indicate the safe and wise course to follow in selecting a. piano. In view of the prevalence of business methods which often result in unsuspecting buyers purchasing Instruments which re- present no solid value for their money, we today indicate what to avoid. - AVOID Till! BOGUS PIANO. There are unfortunately hundreds of pianos sold annually in Australia which bear fictitious names. Demand a piano basing a well proved and honoured manufacturer's name upon it. AVOID NEW MAKERS ADVERTISED BY NEW FIRMS. The Australian market, by reason of its isolation from the art centres of the world, is peculiarly suitable for the exploitation of new and unknown instruments, by means of extensive advertisements, which are frequently modelled upon those of famous manufacturers. AVOID THE SECONDHAND PIANO, so frequently advertised as a halt of catch the unwary. In, purchasing your piano at ALLAN'S you has- the guarantee of dealing with a firm who have for 100 years been noted 03 supplying pianos of the highest quality, and their prices are lower than those asked for the best of the largely advertised but little-known instruments.
