EARLY DISASTERS RECALLED. In Mr. Thomas Welsby's "Early More- ton Bay (Reminiscences)," a list of wrecks in or near the bay since 1847 is given, but prior to that date there are no authenticated local records. The shipping disasters chronicled by Mr. Welsby, particulars of some of which he obtained from the "Moreton Bay Courier," are as follows:— Sovereign, paddle steamer, 119 tons, South Passage bar, March 11, 1847. Countess of Derby, barque, 329 tons, South Passage, October 31, 1853. Courier, brig, 336 tons, burnt at Cleve- land, January 16, 1851. Venus, brig, Freeman's Channel, November 21, 1855. Pheobe Dunbar, ship, 700 tons, Amity, May 5, 1856. Young Australia, ship, North Point, near Cape Moreton, May 31, 1872. St. Magnus, barque. 289 tons, foundered off Cape Moreton, March 18, 1875. George R. Crowe, barque, burnt at Brisbane, January 19, 1887. Scottish Prince, barque, 950 tons, South- port bar, February 3, 1887. Gerd Heye, Danish barque, 850 tons, Moreton Island sandhills, July 16, 1889. Kate, paddle steamer, 147 tons, run down near Pile Light, November 11, 1890. Bellinger, schooner, near Swan Bay, April 4, 1892. Dickey, steamer, 143 tons, Caloundra, February 4, 1893. Aarhus, barque, 640 tons, Smith's Rock, February 24, 1895. Grace Darling, schooner, 69 tons, Bul- wer, March 14, 1894. Cambus Wallace, barque, 1651 tons off Swan Bay, Stradbroke, September 3, 1894. Mystery, steamer, Southport bar, De- cember 20. 1897. Some of these wrecks, of course, have no relation to Southport. Of the re- mainder, it is obvious that none can be the wreck discovered at Southport, as they have been all located. Mr. Welsby states in his book: "With few exceptions I saw all these vessels within 24 hours of their going ashore." Coote's and Lang's books on the early history of Queensland contain no records of wrecks that would throw any light on the mystery, but the "Australian Dic- tionary of Dates and Men of the Time," by J. Henniker Heaton, gives a compre- hensive list of wrecks and shipping disas- ters which, in one or two instances, may afford material for further inquiry. The particulars given in the "Dictionary of Dates" are, of course, exceedingly brief, and there is always the possibility that the location of the wreck as given may be open to correction. The following are included in the list :— Everton, 904 tons, with railway plant, driven ashore at Moreton Island, Queens- land, and became a total wreck, May 19, 1863, Princeza, brig, 141 tons, wrecked at south entrance to Moreton Bay, March 15\. 1863. Teirpan, barque, 222 tons, from New- castle to Brisbane, sprang a leak and foundered in 40 minutes. Crew saved, in lifeboats, June 6. 1876. Star of Australia, steamer, A.S.N. Co., left Sydney with 17 hands on board for Rockhampton ; fate never known, Janu- ary 24, 1865. Boomerang, schooner, left Newcastle with five hands, for the Clarence River, and never arrived, January 12, 1885. Annie D, schooner, left Sydney for Richmond River, but never afterwards heard of, January 12, 1868.
