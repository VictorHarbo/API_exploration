E 171 L E 0 T 0 R c5 OF C A N T E X1 li U R Y ! rj VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who will not pander to the selfishness of the few to the in- jury of the tnuny (for the sake of catching a few stray Votes), and then call it protection. VOTE FOR TERRY! who is a liberal in Religion, Education, and Politics, who will support all good measures and oppose aU bad ones. VOTE FOR TERRY ! . who advocates the expenditure of half the Land Fund in making good Roads instead of inundating the Labour Market. VOTE FOR TERRY! who bas shown the means by which every man who is will- ing to cultivate a Farm, can obtain one-where the rich lands of the country are most valuable, and where, by mentis of water carriage, ho cun bring his produce lo mar- ket at a cheap rate. This may be effected by the simple plan of giving 99 years' credit, on paying five per cent, interest upon the amount of purchase, as a yearly rent in advance to the Revenue. So that, if his Fifty Acre Farm cost fitty pounds, his rent would bo but Fifty Shillings a year. This plan loaves the small capitalist the means whereby to cultivate and stock his Farm, until ho can afford to pay olf the purchase money. This is the sort of protection to benefit the counti v.

Who has shown the only reasonable means of bettering the condition of the mechanic and working man, that is, by lessening the supply of labour by one- half, and carefully classifying the description of that imported, according to the requirements of the colony-for labour, like other commodities, is a question of supply and demand. This is the protection which reason dictates, instead of placing a prohibitory tax of 25 per cent, upon your food and clothing, and which the political tinkers call Protection. VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who v, ill oppose the shameful charge of a double tax upon 5our carts and dravs. This IS Protection. VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who will advocate Railway Reform with reduced fares for passengers, horses, and vehicles generally. VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who will tax the squatters in proportion to the number of sheep and cattle they possess, thereby compelling them to contribute their fair proportion to the revenue. VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who will oppose the introduction of Chinese ; who, by in- termarrying with the degraded portion of our white popu- lation, are becoming the progenitors of a piebald race In Australia, to be the companions of your children.
