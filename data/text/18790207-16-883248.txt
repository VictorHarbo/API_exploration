THE BRISBANE COURIER PUBLISHED DAILY. Friday, February 7, 1879 The 'Statistics of the Colony for the year 1877, compiled from official records in the Kcgistrar-General's office, is very late, as usual, in appearing, but wo must Bay for it that it contains a great deal of interesting information dissemi- nated through numerous tables and quite a wilderness of figures. The sta- tistics are arranged under eight dis- tinct parts, namely, population, in- terchange-accumulation, finance, law and crime, social statistics, production, and vital statistics, these again being each subdivided under different headB. "A statistical view of Queensland since sepa- ration from New South Wales," appended, shows tho comparative advance made from year to year since that epoch, and offers satisfactory proof, so far as mere figures can do so, of the steady progress made. From this compendium we learn that out of the 173,283 persons comprising the entire population of tho colony on May 1, 1876, the native born Australians num- bered 70,906, of whom 58,773 were natives of Queensland. Of the re- mainder, 36,203 were bom in England and Wales, 24,883 in Ireland, 9374 in Scotland, and 9889 in Germany. There were, at the date of taking the census, 62,892 adult males, of whom 31,403 were unmarried, and 29,078 adult females, all of whom were married except 3417, or about nine single mon for every unmarried woman. The total population was pretty evenly divided between the towns and rural districts, although, according to a note in the tabulated statement of the Eegistrar General, the people are principally en- gaged in either pastoral, agricultural, or mining pursuits, 95,783 being residents of towns, and 77,500 of the country. The total population of the colony had, from the 1st of May to the 31st December, still further increased from 173,203 to 203,084 souls. The increase of schools, mechanics' institutes, and charitable institutions is classed by the Registrar-General under the head of " Moral and intellectual pro- gress." As applied to the first two the classification is not objectionable; but with regard to the last named it is not so clear that the increase of charitable insti- tutions, and more especially the great increase of the number of persons who receive relief from them, can be taken as a safe indication of progress, either moral or intellectual. There is nothing to show the nature of tho rolief granted; but the fact that for tho year 1877 no less than 5680 persons, out of a total population of 203,084, were in a position neccssi-. tating application to charitable insti- tutions for relief is a very question- able index of " progress." In 1860 we had 41 schools, attended by 1820 scholars; 6 charitable institutions, in which 397 persons were relieved, and no mechanics institute. In 1870 the number of schools had increased to 173 with 1S.043 pupils ; there were 1271 sub- scribers to mechanics' institutes, and 17,633 volumes in the libraries; and there were 16 charitable institutions which re- lieved 2611 persons. In 1877 the schools numbered 346, with 41,500 scholars; the mechanics' institutes had 3572 subscribers and 38,557 volumes ; and the charitable institutes had been augmented to the number of 29, and the persons relieved to 56SO. The quantity of Crown lands sold by auction has fluctuated considerably. In 1860 23,587 acres were sold for £37,978; in 1S65 the sales reached 145,799 acres for £224,403; in 1872, only 9459_acres were disposed of, which realised £15,731, while in 1877 298,668 acres were sold for £39S,192. Since Separation there has been a steady, if not a satisfactory increase in the number of acres placed under culti- vation, the greatest being in 1877, which showed an excess of 20,000 acres over the preceding year ; the total number of acres being 105,049, which included 8744 acres of wheat, 44,718 of maize, 4603 of pota- toes, 276 of cotton, 15,320 of sugar cane, 655 of vines, and 30,833 of other things. Cotton is the only crop the cultivation of which shows a falling off, and it has de- creased from 14,674 acres in 1870 to 276 acres in 1877. There is an increase of 3044 acres of wheat and 3013 acres of maize over 1876. The number of squat- ting runs increased from 1300 in 1860 to 4790 in 1876, and 5932 in 1877, the latter year showing by far the greatest in- crease of any year since Separation. The total area under lease in 1877 was 210,502,476 acres. The increase in live stock has been greatest in horses, which, numbering 23,504 in 1860, had reached a totaPof 140,174 in 1877. The horned cattle numbered 2,299,582 in 1877 as against 2,079,979 the previous year, being the largest annual increase recorded ; but both sheep and pigs show a decrease for the same period, the former of more than a million. In 1860 we had 13 mills, manu- factories, and works ; in 1871 the num- ber had reached 611 ; in '1874 they decreased to 509, since when there has been agradualincrease,the numberin'1877 being 573. These mills are not classified, but the greater number are doubtless employed in connection with the mining industry. The largest quantity of gold conveyed by escort was 234,85loz. in 1877, and the next highest amount was 178,308oz. in 1872. We raised only 4397 tons of copper ore in 1877, which produced 544 tons of refined copper, valued at £26,810; while in 1872 the quantity reached 19,631 tons, which pro- duced 2448 tons of copper, valued at £196,000. In 1877 we produced 2519 tons of tin ore, worth £94,462, as against 2325 tons the previous year, but which realised the larger amount of £102,030. Our yield of coal has also increased, but there is a marked depreciation in the value of that commodity also. In 1876 we raised 50,470 tons, value £26,470, while in 1877 the total output was 60,918 tons, value £25,G59. The number of letters passing through the post had increased from 279,379 in 1860 to 4,096,907 in 1877, the latter number being about half a million in excess of the previous year, and there was also a corresponding increase in the transmission of newspapers and book-packets. In shipping we have had a large increase in the number of ships inwaid from year to year, the total tonnage of which in 1877 amounted to 490,077 tons. Our exports seaward of wool, tallow, gold, sugar, and coal all show a steady annual increase, that of sugar and coal being greatest in 1877\. In 1876, 50,397 live stock, value £21,885, were exported, while in 1877 the number was only 1068, value £9197. The value of the fresh and preserved meat exported seaward was in 1877 £87,804, as against £88,962 in 1876, and £50,003 in 1875. A groat falling off appears in the export of ex- tract of beet, the value of which in 1877 was only £2169, as against £42,000 in I 1871, and £46,000 in 1870. The aggre- gate value of all our expoitshas increased from £523,477 in 1860 to £4,361,275 in 1877; the latter year showing an increase of more than half a million sterling on its predecessor. The value of o^r imports has increased during the samoperiod from£742,023 to £4,06S,682, the amount for 1877 being an increaso of nearly a million sterling on the imports for 1S76. During the year 1877 our 357 miles of railway were travelled on by 198,210 passengers, and 5033 miles of telegraph line were utilised to send 512,093 messages. The Savings Banks' transactions of the colony had increased from 163 depositors, with a balance-credit of £7545 in the bank in 1860, to 5 I 14,383 depositors and a balance-credit U of, £702,312 in 1877, tho increase ! being regular from year to year during 1 the intervening period. The de- posit returns for other banks show an equally satisfactory increase, the total annual deposits having risen from £286,917 in 1860 to £3,912,257. The advances made by the banks have increased in a corresponding ratio. In 1860, the total advanced was £490,861, which amount kept advancing from year to year until it reached tho respectable sum of £4,017,554 in 1877. Tlieso figures relating to banking, in directly show, by tho magnitude the transactions have attained, that the material prts perity and the wealth of the country has increased to a very great extent. The revenue of the colony for the firs! year after Separation amounted to CN8,589, and the expenditure to c161,503. In 1877 the former had increased to £1,436,581 for the year, and the latter to £1,382,806. The Straits Times of December 19th says it is rumored that his Excellency tho Governor of the Straits Settlements has no iatentton of returning to Singapore, and that he will be suc- ceeded by Mr. Pope Hennessy, and adds that it it is be toped that the Colonial Office will not ?jerituro oa the experiment« - j- ? .> Yesterdat was the nomination day for the Mulgrave election. We learn that the only nomination received was tint of the hon. T. M'llwTaith, Premier and Treasurer, who is, there fore, now duly elected. A fresh case of Bmall-pox among the R.M.S. Somerset's passengers was reported yesterday, the patient being a European, and a supposed stowaway. A correspondent who has been engaged in the saddlery business in Brisbane for many years past writes to express his conviction that articles of good substantial quality do not need protec- tion, as they protect themselves againBt slop made or inferior goods. At the same time he thinks that in some way the saddlers should be protected from the effects of large quantities of saddlery, &c;, now manufactured in the gaol. To the residents of the Woongarra Scrub belongs the honor of being the first rural district to make application to be proclaimed a municipal shire under the provisions of the Local Govern- ment Act. Now that the residents of one dis- trict have thus set the example, it is to be hoped that others will follow, and prove that they are worthy of the boon and prepared to exercise the rights of local self-government. On Tuesday last a cricket match was played between the licensed victuallers and the muffs, which resulted in an easy victory for the former in one innings and 28 runs. Although the ground was rather sloppy the cricket displayed on both sides was excellent, especially the batting of Mr. Greaves, who put 32 together in fine style. Luncheon was provided by Mr, Hamilton in his best style, to which ample justice was done. The following are the cricketing fixtures for to-morrow afternoon :-The First Stanleys and the Alberts will resume their match at the Hamilton for the challenge cup. We believe that a scratch single match will take place be- tween the same cl'ibs at. the conclusion of the above game. The First Waratana meet the BrunswickB at the Stratton ground. The Second Stanleys try conclusions with the Kedron Club at Kedron, and the Second Waratahs have ar- ranged to play the Leichhardt Club at the Green Hills. We understand that a cricket match between the officers and non-commissioned offi- cers of the No. 1 Artillery Brigade against the men of the same battery, will shortly be played at the Hamilton. A disturbance of a very unseemly character took place at Ben Allah's entertainment last night, whon the lessee of the Queensland Theatre who was amongst the audience, insisted upon interjecting remarks offensive to the performer and irritating to those who had come bent on amusement of a less exciting sort than a baccha- nalian wrangle. There is usually a feeling of brotherhood honorably distinguishing the Bohe- mian craft of players and such as woo the favor of the public that shuns any ungenerous inter- ference with a rival performance, and we regret in this instance it should have been bo flagrantly departed from. The lesBee of the theatre might depend for filling his houBe upon the excellent character of the entertainments he has provided without endeavoring to damage a competitor by creating a disreputable scene on his first appear- ance. A telegram was received yesterday by the Customs authorities stating that while the cutter Prospect, of 11 tons, laden with sugar from the Herbert River for Cooktown, lay at anchor off Hinchinbrook Island, she was attacked by the blacks. The Prospect had a crew of twelve men, who were in the cabin when the blacks came on board, and who fired on them through the scuttle. After some time the blacks left the vessel, taking her boat with them. In the encounter the captain was slightly injured. A search was made for the boat next day, but without success. There is no doubt that the natives in and about the Straits want a sharp lesson, but in this instance there seems to have been a culpable want of vigilance on the part of captain and crew. No watch kept on deck apparently, and nothing known of the natives' approach till they were actually on board. The Prospect's people may count them- selves very lucky that they were not roasted in their own ship. We suppose the blacks failed to remember how easy it would be to have done it. A TAiR of runaway horses attached to a car- riage caused some excitement in town yesterday afternoon, but fortunately did no harm. It ap- pears that the carriage and horses, which belcng to Mr. S. Davis, were standing opposite the Civil Service Co-operative Store, in Edward-street, in charge of the driver, there being no one else in the vehicle, when something caused the hoi ses to start off at a violent pace, at once throwing out the driver, who states that at the moment he was arranging the cushions behind him. The horses tore along Edward-Btreet at a furious pace and safely turned the corner into Alice- strett, kept along Alice-street to William-street ; again they turned the corner in safety, and maintained their furious pace until they reached the inter- section of Queen-street. Here there aro-e a dif- ference between them, one attempting to go along tho North Quay and the other wishing to turn into Queen-street. This caused one of thom to fall, and shortly afterwards the other, when soveral bystanders rushing up secured the animals by their heads. With assistance at hand, they were got up again and it was found that ono of them had been badly cub and bruised, but neither the harness nor the carriage was at all injured. Mr. Walters, of Charlotte-street, volun- teered to drive the horses back to their owner's establishment in Edward-street, and this he suc- ceeded in doing, although they several times at- tempted to get away again. In accordance with a battalion order calling a special parade, about 200 mon of A, B, C, and D Companies Q.V. Rifles last evening assembled at the armory under command of Major Snelling, accompanied by Acting-Adjutant Hut- ton. Captain Macfarlono was in charge of B Company, Lieutenant Thynne of A Com- pany, and Lieutenant Oseubould of C and D Companies. Tho battalion was formed into columns of companies, and was marched down to Petrie's Bight, accompanied by the battalion band. Here they were put through a number of column and battalion movements, all of which were performed in a creditable manner. They wore afterwards marched back to the armory, and before dismissal were reminded of the inspection parade before Colonel Scratchley on Saturday, at which they were all requested to attend. No. 1 Battery, Q.V.A., and band, under command of Captain Webb, marched over to South Brisbane, where they went through a number of field movements in a satisfactory manner, afterwards returning to the armory. From the Brigade order appearing in our advertisement columns it will be seen that Nos. 1, 2, and 3 Batteries of Artillery, the Engi- neers, A, B, C, D, and E Companies "of the M.A. Battalion of Rifles ; and Nos. 1, 2, and 3 Com- panies of the Cadets, are ordered to parade at South Brisbane on Saturday next, at 4.30 p.m., for inspection by Colonel Scratchley, K.E. The men will be paid for their services, in accordance with the regulations. - The telegram announcing that Prussia and Austria have concluded a definite treaty annul- ling the clause in the Treaty of Prague provid- ing for the retrocession of Northern Schleswig affords another instance of the cool disregard of -every honorable obligation which marks the diplomacy of this latter«half of the nineteenth century. When, in 1863, Prussia dragging Austria at her heels invaded Denmark pro- fessedly to enforce some claims advanced by the Germanic Diet, she took possession of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein by "right o£ con- quest." The seizure waa a forcible spoliation for which Count Bismarck never deigned to offer any excuse, unless a paraphrase of Warren Hast- ings', " I wonder at my own moderation," embodied in a despatch to the English Govern- ment may be regarded in that light. But when Denmark had been compelled to succumb, and the Treaty of Prague settled the termB of peace, a clause was inserted as a sort of salve to the public conscience of Europe providing that the inhabitants of Northern Schleswig, who were purely Danish, should be given an opportunity of deciding by popular vote whether their terri- tory should be returned to Denmark or remain under German rule. Without any breach of charity we may conclude that the German Chancellor never intended, when signing the treaty, to give this provision effect. He never did so, and many of our most industrious Danish immigrants to this colony are North Schleswigers who, having reluctantly made up their minds that their country would never be rescued from the iron rule of Germany, determined to seek in Australia that liberty which they had formerly enjoyed, and of which they had been forcibly de- prived. The promise in the treaty waa made by Prussia and Austria to Denmark, and guaranteed by England and France ; but Prince Bismarck invariably refuses to fulfil a promise which no one is strong enough to compel him to fulfil. After the conclusion of the treaty, Prussia re- tained the duchies under some vague under- standing that they were at the disposal of the Diet. In course of time Bismarck's policy of breaking up the federal union of Germany and humiliating Austria developed itself, and the latter Power, awaking to its position, declared war. In the bill of indictment drawn up by the Austrian Government against Prussia, every possible grievance was brought forward, and among them the continued neglect of Prussia to give effect to the clause concerning North Schleswig. The campaign of six weeks which followed crushed Austria, destroyed the Diet, and gave Prussia the com- mand of Germany. Schleswig and Holstein were quietly absorbed, and no more was said about taking the vote of the unhappy Danes Nor has anything more been said about the matter until now when Austria and Prussia con- clude a definite treaty on the subject. We can only liken the agreement to one between two old " pals" who had been concerned in a robbery, and who, after a lapse of years, agreed formally never to bring up the unpleasant subject in their mutual intercourse. It will be noticed that Denmark, the victim of the robbery, is not mentioned in this little agreement-nor are the guaranteeing Powers taken into consideration. There can be nothing more consoling to the contemplative mind than to notice how our civilisation tends to bring the eternal principles of truth and justice to bear on the intercourse of nations-the mil- lennium must be very close at hand. The weather was, yesterday, either cloudy or raining at nearly all the stations, from which re- ports were received. Toowoomba, Dalby, Roma, Mitchell Downs, Charleville, report a cloudy sky, At Cunnamulla and Taroom the weather was fine, but at Blackall it was raining, although the quantity of rain that fell is not stated. Rain was also falling at Aramac, where the direction of the wind was south-east. Nearer the border, as shown by advices from Stanthorpe and Goon- diwindi, fine weather prevailed ; but as Tenter- field reported south-east, cloudy, it would appear that rain was approaching that neighborhood. Along the northern coast, we notice that it was raining yesterday at Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, St. Lawrence, and Cardwell, and cloudy at Mackay and Cooktown. At Rock" hampton, 2'20ln. of rain were registered during the twenty-four hours. Rain was also expe- rienced at Gayndah, Bonana, Springsure ; and at Ravenswood the sky was overcast. Georgetown reports cloudy weather, and Normanton and Kim- berley fine. With regard to the other colonies, the weather was fine at Sydney, the wind being north-east, and very hazy at Melbourne, with an easterly wiud. We bear that it is in contemplation by the members of the Musical Union to produce a series of enjoyable concerts of a miscellaneous description during the present season. For some time past the society has been languishing from various causes, and we regard the recent infusion of fresh blood into the managing body as a step in the right direction. We can say thus much without reflecting in the slightest degree on the retiring members of committee. The very best men are apt to become lethargic in honorary otflcos held by them year after year. An entertainment was given at the Old School of Arts last evening by a conjuror and ventrilo- quist styling himself "Ben Allah." The first part of the performance consisted of a series of feats of legerdemain, some of them very clever and interesting ; while the entertainment was enlivened by selections on the piano and violin, the latter instrument being handled by Signor Benvenuti. Some very clever ventriloquism was given in the second part; but the display was interrupted and brought to a premature close by one who, whatever his provocation might have been, should have refrained from such conduct, if only from his own connection with the theatrical business. Some valuable gifts were distributed among the audience before they left. "The Duke's Motto," from its success in London, where it rau for an unprecedented number of nights, Mr. Fechter taking the lead- ing part, has proved itself one of the most interesting plays for which we have to thank French playwrights of late years. It was very well put on at the Queensland Theatre last night, Mr. Dillon appearing as Henri de Lagar derc, and assuming the disguises that circum- stances force upon this loyal gentleman, that of Henrique: the Armorer and Esop the Hunchback. In this last character we thought Mr. Dillon appeared to more advantage than any we have yet seen bim in. Some of the situations are so strikingly dramatic-notably the one in which the highborn Blanche de Nevcrs signs the mar- riage contract with the despised hunchback that tho audience were kept throughout in a condition of excitement. Blanche de Nevcrs found a graceful exponent in Miss Pender, who looked and acted the part in an entirely satisfac- tory manner. The very great tax upon a com- pany of this constant change of piece prevents our finding fault with a few little hitches re- quiring the prompter's aid, but to-night, when the same play will be repeated, these will proba- bly be avoided. The play is a capital one, and should secure r full house.
