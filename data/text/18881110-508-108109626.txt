I Sydney. : I Directors will be elected at First Meeting, which will be held I in about a month I These two valuable properties are placed under offer for the I extremely low sum of £6750, on easy terms. The extra capital I is being raised to prepare for contingencies, improvements to I estate*, or other expenses which may arise. I It is estimated that not more thso- S3 or 10s will need to be I caiJsdup. I The 22 acres of City Land will subdivide into over 5000 selling I feet, with valuable water frontages, and should readily realise I £6000. I The Suburban Land is alreadr subdivided into absnt £03 I quarter-acre blocks, and should realise, at a low fitnire, £8000. I This estimate of £14,COD is based on present selling price of I the land, and if the property lie held for a couple of years, it is I estimated double that price could be realised in subdivision. [ Theses properties have been inspected and selected as the I mo?l eligible in and around Perth, and investors may rely on it I that no more genuine venture has ever been placed before the I public of New South Wales or adjoining colonies. I No Promoters' Shares are to be issued, every share Tanking I alike as to calls, £c. I The properties are placed under offer to Mr. G. Dyson, who I ' has inspected them on behalf of the proposed Company, for the I sum of £6753, and are being sold under circumstances highly I iavorable to the proposed Company. I The expense? of the Company need be very small, as Mr. G. I Dyson, who has had considerable experience in disposing of I laud in subdivision and economically managing estates, will, if I the Company feel disposed to accept his offer, placehis services I and offices at their disposal for a nominal sum, and a cornmis I (lion on profits. To show his faith in the concern he is prepared I to tako from £00. to 1000 shares should that number be I available. f I The Company will be a terminating one, and no other pro I pcrties can be purchased without express sanction of the I Shareholders. ! The tweaty-two acres are in a good position right in the City, I and have about fifteen chains frontage to the Swan River; they I are adjoining Government reserve, 'and close to another reserve I for public gardens. It is about ten minutes' walk from the Town I Had, and can be approached either by macadamised road or I rrater. Every block of land between this and the centre of the I city, with the exception of Government reserves, which almost I EUi'zoun d this estate, is laid out in town lots, and not an acre can I be purchased at the price this is beng offered at. As will be I Keen by the official plans, very few blocks cf land available for I subdivision **'?' be purchased in the city of Perth, and already I such biocts are being readily bought up by Melbourne and other I speculators, and it may safely be said that in a few months I blocks of land situated as this is, and of such an area, will be I eagerly sought after, but unobtainable, except at a very much I higher figure. | What will twenty acres of citr land be worttt in a few years ? ! This Company vrUl do well to secure it, and obtain a gift while I tbere is a chance. I The 830 quarter-acre blocks of land are almost in the city, I being bat a few chains from the boundary. It has been care I inllv inspected, and is without doubt a valuable estate, being I nearly all elevated, and overlooking the city and the beautiful I ' waters which separate it from the city. It has frontages to two I main roads, and therefore is very accessible. It is very advan I taireously subdivided into quarter-acre blocks, pegged out and I cleared. -The Company wili not therefore lose an acre of land I lor streets, or be nui to expense in regard to subdivision. Bsti I mating each block, which is 66 toe; frontage by 165 feet deep, at I £10 (.which is a low estimate!- this estate alone would realise I £8C03, being more than the cost of the two properties nowunder I o'-ier. I That the progress of Western Australia has been slow op to I the present period is not to be wondered at when the circnm I stances are looted into. That such a fine colony has remained I so long, as it were, a blank, is a lasting disgrace to the British ? nation, or those who have had the controlling power of its I destiny. Languishing for want of capital and population to I dwelop it, the wonder is that the population has not decreased. I Eampered nnd restrained from borrowing the necessary capital I to carry on any public works, it is somewhat a miracle that its I han&ral; of people have not before notr openly rebelled, end I claimed the right, to manage tfc e ir own affairs. Almost worn out I by waiting for the turn of the tide, the people of that colony have I not yez fully realised what is within their grasp — Responsible I .Government, or a constitution similar to our own. Will anyone I who has watched the progress of our own colony since v.e were I grant''! a right to manage our own affairs deny what will be I the result of that boon to Western Australia r What will be I tneiesiil; of the first loan after Responsible GoTernmeat is I granted:- Wili it not have the effect of rapidly increasing- the I population, and stimulate numbers cf slumbering industries? I It will cause such, a rise in the value of property that no such I field as Western Australia Trill present itself for the capitalist. I The day Responsible Government is granted to Western Aus | tralia will be the most joyful or.e ever witnessed there. That I Responsible Government is within its grasp is a certainty. It I U coniidently expsctea there that within r.he next few weeks, or I months at most, everything will be settled. I The railway from Perth to Albany is almost completed. The I 3Iidlfti:d Eailway is again commenced, and German immigrants I are to settle on land eminently suitable for vineyards, orchards I and agriculture. The Goldiieids are no myth, but an encour I lijius and promising reality. The latest GoldSelds are only a I isTi days by sood road from Perth, and machinery is now being I erected on tile field. Numbers of people are wending their way I Oi'.ilj to tlic-ra, and it is anticipated that in a few months a great I n=h will take place. I All these developments will assuredly cause a marvellous rise I to takfl l-iice in the vckie of land, and those who secure the ? picked blocks vox; will have chances which no others can have. ? Early application for shares' is necsssary, as a number are I o!re jdy applied for. I Sbsres tviU be allotted in order of application, arfd all money I rer-irced within one month from date of Prospectus, if required I EKinber of shares are not applied for.
