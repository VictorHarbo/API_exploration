Thi Black Swan The Black Swan* ^hitherto knoWa at' a small coasting steamer, with occasional occupation on the Par- j ramatta River, has recently undergone a complete meUunor-; phoeis, the alterations and improvements being so general as that no resemblance to tho original vessel is left. She has been lengthened to her present size of 113 feet, fitted with an excel lent and roomy saloon on deck, while there is cabin accommoda tion for upwards of forty cabin and steerage passengers. Itmay be said that the entire hull has been renewed, and that in this res pect the vessel Is quite equal to new. 8he has been fitted with new boilers and with patent wheels, while her machinery has undergone an entire and most costly refitting ; indeed, we are informed that the outlay on this steamer has exceeded £4000. She will carry aboutfifty tons of cargo, at a draft of water not ex ceeding four feet, steaming a full average of ten knots per hour. -Ve believe that nothing yet has been decided a a to her future employment.

Favourable winds and fine weather prevailed during the run pcross, which she accomplished in nine days, flighting the coast of New Zealand on the 18th. Through a succession of heavy W. and 6. W. gales, she kept the high sea until the 25th, on which tday she came to an anchor in the roadstead, a light wind blowing ioff the land at the time. The weather, however, suddenly (changing, she was caught at her anchor by & strong Westerly gale, accompanied by a heavy sea, and the vessel being by the head made bad weather of it, pitching bows under. The captain prepared to run; but while unshackling the chain at sixty fathoms, she gave a tremendous plunge, shipping a heavy sea over her bows. This terrific strain was more than the windlass icould bear, for it broke right in two on the port side, and the whole of the cable ran out to the clinch, seventy fathoms of y, bich and the anchor were lost. The Willing Lass succeeded in gaining the offing, and on the 28th was towed safely to the wharf ;by the Lioness steam tug.— West Coast Times, November 86. ' MAURITIUS.
