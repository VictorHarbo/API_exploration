Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron chitis, distressing cough, difficulty of breathing, hoarse ness, pain or soreness in the chost, experience delightful and immediate relief, and to those who aro subject to colds on tbe chest it is invaluable, as it effects a coin- ptctu cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irritation in tbe throat, nnd giving strength to tbe voice, and it never allows a cough or asthma to necotnu chronic. No house should lie without it, as, taken at the beginning, a doic is generally sufficient, and a completa cure is ccrtalu.
