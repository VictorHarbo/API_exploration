NORTHERN EUROPEANS. Welcome as Migrants. CANBERRA- June 2i. Any suggestions for Increasing the flow ol Northern European migrant* to Australia which may follow the publication of the Overseas Settle be welcomed by the Commonwealth. There is no possibility that the Commonwealth will announce any Bpeclal Inducements to nationals of one or more foreign countries com pared with those of other countries. Actual conditions laid down to govern Ule admission or aliens must apply generally. But it is felt that by taking steps to advertise to Northern Europeans the advantages offered to migrants by Australia, they would come here in greater numbers. Conversations al ready held with the Danish emigra tion authorities by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) are a start in this direction. He will prob ably also make similar approaches to other countries, such as Holland, Nor way, and Sweden. Australian Immigration figures for 1937 show a greater relative increase In Northern than In Southern Euro pean migration compared with the previous year, although the total number of southerners was nearly three times as Kreat. In 1937. 4019 additional Southern Europeans settled permanently in Australia, about double the 1936 fig ures. The number of Northern Euro peans, however, trebled— 1533 com pared with 512 in 1936. The largest Individual national increase last year was of Poles (494 compared with 106 In 1936), closely followed by Germans (428 against S3 in 1936). The increase for the quarter ended last March compared with the corresponding quarter of 1937. was continued— Poles 122 (74 In 1936), and Germans 119 (65) . ?
