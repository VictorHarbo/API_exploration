Gkntlk.vikn, — At tho urgent request of a largo number of the electors of Ovstlomaiue, I olFer niysolf as a candidate for your suffrages. I maintain that tho Legislative Assembly, as re presenting the mass of tho people, ought to possess Iho cntiro control of tho country's finances, and am prepared to support tho Tariff passed by tlio lato Assembly, although I believe Fevorul unimportant items may require to bo modiiiod hereafter. I am in favor of a liberal adniinistration of tho Lnnel Act, lSii'o, believing that tlic settlement of tv yeoman class on tho lands will bs conducivo to the- permanent prosperity :md hap]).:ness of tho country. I am in favor of the total abolition of the export tluty on gold, nt T consider it to bo a tax on tho labor of iho miner, who, in toiling, very often for a maintenance, has to undergo risks and privations unequalled by ' ny other class of tho community. With the view to a reform of tho constitution cf tho Legislative Council, I am preparod to support my mca&ure;, having for its object tho extension of Llio franchise, by reducing tho qualilication of both electors and members, so that that branch of tho Legislatxire maybecomo a fairer representation of tho intelligence and wealth of tho country than an at present constituted. With regard to the questions of Protection and Froo Traele, 1 would decidedly tax such artiolos as wo iro in a position to produce or manufacture hero for ?evenuo puipo&cx; ; whilst 1 would admit those arti :les of every day consumption, such as sugar and ;oa, duty free. I believe that a moderate amount of protection to ndustiinl enterprises would very soon plauo us in the jositioi-i of being exfiorleivi instead of importers ; nnd he ineaiii thereby all'ordod for constant emp oyment o the laborer would do moro for tlio country than ny system of frco or assisted immigration. 1 shall endeavor, so far ns the short time at my lispofal before the day of election will permit, to seo on personally and explain my views moro fully ; anel f you do mo tho honor of electing me ns ono of your opresoninlivcs, my best endeavors will bo used to iromoto the interests of Casllemaine, ill an industrial s well us a political point of viow.

BUTLER, Secretary, rjnO~THE ELECTORS^OF'EAST^MELBOURNE. GektIvEMEN, — For tho third timo, I offer myself for re-election as ono of your representatives in the ' Commons' of Victoria. Tho present political foud has arisen out of an in disposition on the part of the Manchester class of importers and middlemen's refusal to pay a very small sharo of taxation. Thoso traders make this country their homo but for a few years, aftor which they take their elcparturo for other climes, nnd with overflowing pockets, and with coarso jibes and sarcastic sneers on thoir tongues at colonial society, they libel our institutions anel elofame our social condition. They also, through thoir organised subsidies, havo maelo a cat's paw of tlio Council Chamber. They havo, by tho samo means, won the favor of a portion of tho press ; and havo immortaliseel themselves by rcpeatodly in sulting our most gracious Queen, in tho person of our impartial and inelependent Governor. The aim of this class is to fix tho burthen of tho taxation on other shoulders limn their own, to dia courago all manufactures, to subvert tho Laud Act ; and abovo all, anel worso than all, to rob us of tho suffrage. Aye, to rob us of tho eternal, uualienablo birth right of all freo men. Think of that, you bank clerk, you shop assistant, you artisan. You aro to bo enfranchised, togother with him who follows tho plough or wields the pick — as witness Wilborforco Stephen at Brighton, and Murray Smith at Williamstown, the nomiuees of this precious cliquo, on tho question of tho manhood suffrage And remember, my countrymen, wo havo growing up amongst us that elotestablo class 'shonoen,' who will strive to got tho upper hand, which, ploiso God, they never will, so long as wo havo the power of voting, and voting by ballot. On offering niysolf for ro- election last time, I did so independent of all classes ; but when the timo ar rived for discussing tho question of protection, I found the Government woro honest in their profes sions. I found that, not only in thoir valuable Land Act, but in tho revision of tho tariff, they stuelieel tho wol faro of the peoplo. Then it was I supported them with my heart and soul, and shall continuo to elo so until tho solo and cntiro right of raising nnd spending tho revenue of this country bo concodod, without equivocation or reservation, to tho people's representatives in the Assembly Chamber. When a prudent timo shall havo arrived, I will dun for anothor instalment of protection ; nnd as soon as possible I hope to have tho pleasure of assisting to shape tho Council Chamber, bo that it shall be really a representative institution. Should I be honored again by your ro-olectiug mo, I promieo to bring you back that honor unsullied, as I havo hitherto elono ; and I trust I shall nevor bo found amongst tho ranks of a small-mindod cli-iuo of ob structionists, but that I may over bo in tho van, whoro the welfare of tho country demands. In conclusion, 1 beg of you to wipo out of your oyos tho dust which tricksters aro using when thoy quoto you tho ' Constitution.' For conturics, jurists and political economists of tho highest order of intellect havo disagrood, and will continue to disagree, as to tho construction of a sintenco or the philosophy of financial oceinomy. And if I am not presuming, I would say it is for you to do that necessary anel common sense act, of helping to build up for all classes of our population employment siutablo to their varied physical developments. 1 am, faithfully yours, ?
