A mail will close at the Post Office as follows : FOR LONDON.-By the Sulacia, on Saturday (this) evening, at six. The barque Emma has been purchased by Mr. Joel Joseph for £1200. She will be placed in the Moreton Bay trade, and her light draught of water, when loaded, will be of great advan- tage. Her accommodations for passengers are first-rate. The Miranda has made a quick trip to and from Port Albert ; off the Dromedary on the 17th instant, she exchanged signals with the Roman Emperor, hence for Calcutta; also a brig bound to the southward, unknown. The Charlotte Jane, loading for London, takes the oils imported by the George and Inga, U.S. whalers, and the Spec, brig, from the South Sea Islands. The Oceanie, from Manila, has had a lengthy Ïassage of sixty-eight days. She called at the sland of Panjee for water, and met light and baffling winds throughout the voyage. A num- ber of monkeys and three Manila deer are im- ported by her. The Lady Margaret has had a long passage of seventy-seven days from Calcutta. The barque Sumner, hence, arrived on the 6th No- vember, after a fair passage : she lost thirteen horses on the voyage, and three after landing ; one of them, the property of Mr. Macarthur, bolted from the grooms, and having broken his fetlock it was necessary to shoot him : this was the only one lost shipped by Mr. Macarthur. The Lady Margaret was caught in the southerly gale on Sunday evening, and had her mainsail split off Jervis Bay. There is a splendid Arab horse named Glencare, imported by Mr. Hopkins, by this arrival.—Feb. l8. The Santipore, from New Zealand, was off the Heads last night, but did not get in up ta the time of our going to press. She got in on Sun- day evening, and took a pilot on board, who very wisely took the ship to sea when the southerly squall came on.-Feb. l8. The Whitney, barque, was to sail for this port and Sydney, from Shanghai, about the middle of January. The Caldew, for Sydney, left Shang- hai with the Statesman. The ship Duke of Portland, hence, sailed from Shanghai for Lon- don the 30th Nov.-Melbourne Daily News. The Bounty Hall, bound from Hongkong to Bombay, having on board a valuable cargo, con- sisting of sugars, silks, hats, and quicksilver, was totally lost on Investigator Shoal, in the China seas, on the 6th September. The captain and crew, in all l8, reached Manila in the long- boat, after undergoing many privations and ex- periencing much liad weather; they were in the boat for six days and five nights, with a very small allowance of water and provisions. The above information was kindly forwarded by Mr. R. W. Guillara, late chief officer ofthat ill-fated ship, and now an officer on board'the Oceanie. The Bounty Hall was fully insured, and belonged to Messrs. Buttersley and Chisholm, of Liver« pool. The American ship Hannah Eddy, from Boston, bound to Hongkong, with a cargo of spars and lumber, was totally lost in the Straits of Gaspar on the 13th october. The captain and crew have arrived at Batavia. The Danish ship Creole was also lost in Gaspar Straits about the middle of October.-China Mail, Nov. 14.
