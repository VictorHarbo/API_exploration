Legislative As- j sembly. yesterday, : :when',: ;Mr. Forde, the - member::- for : /Rock- hampton, ' moved that,: in .the':, op-: inion of thc House, the time-had arrived for re-modelling r . the Commonwealth, v ' : Constitution' providing for, the sub-division of Australia into a greater numbes of self-governing States, and also ' providing an easy method. ;for. the'"people-.'of àhy'.'dis'trlct,' csuch" ' aa Central , or- Northern1-Queens- land, . to /attain, self-government; ' Mr. Petersen opposed the motion,, alleging, that Mr.. Forde;.-' was en . deavoring ,to''!create'. a unification and conversion < of ; . Central ? ^Queensland into a "glorified municipal' area." ' . Mr.* Petersen ' held the view: that the present Federal Constitution provided . the necessary: form of décentrai . isation legislation. The debate took a generally unsatisfactory \- turn,, and no finality- was reached,' thc motion being talked out. . . Brisbane, 'July'6. - . Mr. Forde, member , <for. . Rock-, hampton," moved'-, in- the Assembly that,'in the opinion "of the House', the time' had arrived for remodellirig/thë' Commonwealth. Constitution, provid- ing for'the subdivision of Australia into ' a- greater .? number "of. .self governing States, and also , providing an easy method for the people of any district, such- as Central ' or. Northern Queensland, to obtain .self-' government; He claimed that public opinion, in all the States was behind- the de'eeh-. tralisation .movement. . ,. ?.' . , ! . . ' He pointed but that' reform', in the direction of ' creating greater ' facili- ties for self-government must come from the Federal Parliament. Aus- tralia, was unique, among .the'.;coun- tries of the 'world, he' said, for the naucitv of lits sub-divisions.' já . Mr. / 'Petersen . said ; the mover's if «peech', was merely .a ; repetition of N^ancierit- history, and was purely .a Unification . speech, ' opposed ' to the. spirit of . the great movement that had been in progress -in, ; Central Queenslander, the, last SS years. He challenged Mr.' 'Forde to advocate, unification in ' Central ' Queensland. , Mr. Forde -only too well'knew'that, he had signed, his party- pledge eh-' deavoring to create unification ; and conversion , of Central Queensland into a; glorified municipal' area. "." Mr. Petersen said he wanted ito', have a' division, .and moved as an amendment, that Parliament in Feb- ruary consent 'to 'the ' creation : of ai new State, ? comprising.1 the' territory known as North Queensland, and .an- other comprising Central. Queens- land. There was no need, he said, to. gp beyond the ..present. Constitué' ,' ,'tion, 'which ^/pr'ovidëdi 'tliàt^^ selfv , ; .gover'pmenty could.Vbe'.-'öbtiine'd :. by taking..the necessary, steps^^^ Ford*, came along, .ppsihgVas.'; the' po .' litical Moses' of Central'Queensland.' He had never .quoted the. resolution which Mr.' Higgs. ha4. moved .in .the; House of Representatives', and which .'was- unanimously carried,- assenting to . the principle'' bf« 'forming- 'new States in . Central and Northern Queensland. ' Mr. Forde's motion was merely'a'phase of his own po- litical self-boosting campaign. Mr. Green seconded the ' amend- ment,'saying' that he stood for sep- aration, and did not want unification of a glorified ..municipal councils go- verning ne"W'States. They wanted the sovereign rights of sovereign States. Messrs. Gledson and Hartley 'sup- ported-the motion. MOTION TALKED OUT. Mr. Collins, who . rose amid . cries of "talk it) out," also 'favored the notion. Mr. Vowles moved that the' ques . Uon be now put, but the Speaker, de- clined to put the motion and allowed vrMr. Collins to continue. ~-: ÄS Mr. Forde whispered to Mr. Col ^JhjA,. and thc latter suddenly _. sat down, amid derisive opposition laughter. . However, Mr. Winstanley, from the Government side, rose, and was Îtill talking ,when the Speaker left he chair. .u , Mr. Forde's motion, therefore; was fractically','talked. out .by the mcm ers. on his own sideb and it will now go, to the bottom of the, business .'paper.
