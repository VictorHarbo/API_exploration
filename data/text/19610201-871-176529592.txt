SPECIAL PUBLICITY FILMS SCREENED Delegates fro the Convention saw two Commonwealth Film Division films used in immigration publicity overseas to inform potential migrants of life and conditions in Australia. One of the films, "The Way We live", which is produced in Eastman Colour, runs for almost an hour. It was made for the Department of Immigration after detailed investigations overseas of the type of film most needed to inform potential migrants about Australia. The film is being produced in seven languages — English, Dutch, German, French, Finnish, Danish and Swedish — and in two editions each with special scenes for British and European audiences. The film tells of a typical migrant family who, after working and saving for three years, are able to put a deposit on an average suburban home. The other film, "Australian Food Parade", was made for the Commonwealth Department of Trade and the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales. Its aim is to show British people how Australia grows and produces the food it sells them.
