Tuk I'uoruPiioBE. —Commodore the hon. James R. Drum Bond und I bo offloers oi her Majesty's dockyard, Woolwich, were a few nights ago engaged in tenting a newly-discovered ' light, denominated 'tho photophore,' intended for light - bouses and all the purposes of lights at sea. A paddle wheel Htmim-russol, having on board Mr Ferdinand Silas, a ' native of Holland (tho Inventor of the photophore), left the \- dockyard Jetty .at half-past right o'clock, and, having hoittcd anc of the new lfghU at the in fit bead, proceeded slowly down tho river for a short dinUnce, while a number of the lutrauents placed along the banks wero lighted up, the pn\t rod gUro of which was easily distinguished from that of ? all other lights, and wu alsu p ronounovd to be more hrilliant. Commodoro Drumaond, remaining stationed Mi the jetty, direoted a course of signals fey th» constant lighting and extinguishing of the Bhotop'noro, which was elimlarly replied to by the inrentor vn board tho steamer. One of the instruments attached to a line win thrown into the watur, without being previously 1 lighted, and On rising to the surface it sh'it f. rth a pbospho Tlo buun, which uccordinx to the inventor's statement would fteep alivo for tenor twelve hours. It was repeatedly trailed under water, wiion the light »f course diwpponred, but un regaining the nurfacu, it seemed to struggloaj it were into Hit, and In nn instant shone out with renewed brilliancy. The light, although of a peculiarly strong description for the 1 purpoits of uttravtlng observation, possesses, nevertheless, \- aa dort'.rucllvo nor incendiary cliuructer.

On the Stli of August six sons of the Thames effected a lUnding at Dieppe, to compete for the different prizes offered at tho rrgatta, which took place on the 7th. Our countrymen soon booamc aware that their rivals wcro Runieronn aud determined to offer the strongest possible re alliance tb any English thit uiight present thcmsclvus. Iu .fact, the Frenchmen felt apprehenslvo that tho snmo ' in ' trodoiB1' might again appear who performed so gloriously a short time ago at tho Paris Spring Regatta held at St. Cloud, st which tho English beat the beat men of France at the very inoracxt they were made acquainted with the victory of Mageutu. Our aquatic friends took tho offensive, and on the 7th took up their position to struggle against the plckod orows of Paris, Havre, Itouen, and Dieppe. Paris, indeed, was well roi .resented, a very spirited French gentleman hav ing for the last three months trained six of tho bent rowers in France to compete for tho supremacy, and lie had already ahallengod Mr John Arthur, «f Paris, who bus always taken so active a part In upholding tho. honor of English aquatlcx : In France, to row any English orew for tho championship. Mt Arthur wus too happy to toko up the glove, mid invitt'd ?or Londoners to Franco, not only to Dieppe, but to Itouen and Parli, also to nBsist at three grand regattas given on . occasion of tbo Emperor's fotc. - At Diappe the races wore far four-oared and six-oarcd figs; and a auconu four-oared race as a prize of honor for toe viotors of the above rucos, a bandsomo gold cup, (rivcu by tbo Kmporor. Thirteen boati started for this four-ourod prize, a purss of £10, and a gold medal. The weather was \- - delightful, tho sea quito smooth, tho shoro lined with tho , . elioot Dieppe. At threo o'clock tho signal gun fired m Srgpare ; a aocond pop mude overy man bend the blade of Is oar. A few minutes sufliced to ehow the Union Jack had a slight advance, but Uiey wcro not yet disentangled from two of their adversaries, although it was ovldont that the long quiet stroko of tho J9rifrll»h orcw would lait'Iongcr than the ovor-quiok enor S stic stylo nfth« French. By degrees thoy Increased their ittnnrc, and hud the pleasure of showing tho others tbo way over the eourso. Tho crow was ooraposcd of Thomns White, A. Chitty, W. Bell, and K. Bain. Th^ same crew w«ruj»ined by Q. Driver, undE. Boll, and soon sUrtod for the six-oared race for a pristo, a pur»o of £10 Hnd a gold medal. Ihe same «uocess, with a creator advantage, followed. Tho nrxt day tlio racn for tho Emporot'i Gold Cap took plaoo, and was won, by our countrymen. After the abovo »uecciicM our little corps pushed forward to Rouen. Race* for pairs, four-oared, nix-onrod, and soulling boats were offered. Tho first event was tha pair Bared vaoo. Tilt Engll V crew, W. and E.
