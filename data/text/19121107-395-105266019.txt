Ladies afflicted by Superfluous TT»ir» [should no longer delay ip taking th® Dannebrog treatment, which is now Ten familiar to Society, Professional, ana Business Women in Adelaide, and it is justly celebrated in Melbourne (whore Madame Frokjar of the Boyal Massage College, Copenhagen, has practised wita it at 165 Collins street for 10 years), In Sydney, Perth, Ballaiat, Bendigo, Gee long, and other centres. Hundreds oJ women hail Dannebrog as a blessing to womankind, because no other remedy can so satisfactorily destroy superfluous hairs. No woman is looking her best if she >iag hairs on her faoe; and even slum people pity the unfortunate woman wiih 7 moustache or a beard. Old age is made more ugly by long hairs on the ffoin, and young women desiring marriage simply cannot afford to have hairy faces. Daa nebrog helps to keep the married woman looking younger.
