TEE NEW VI CTOR1AH IMMIGRATION REGULATIONS. (From the Age of February 19.) THE immigration régulations proclaimed in last night's Government Gazette bear the marks of hasty preparation, and we think that on examination of them it will be found that in this case the adage " the jl more haste the wo^e speed;' will he found to be applicableT Some alteration was rendered requisite hy the circumstance c that the appropriation clause in the Land I v Act of 1SG2 has been repealed, and that j u the amount to he spent on immigration , a must be fixed by the Assembly from year j u to year. But the very fact of that repeal j £ should have been interpreted by the Go- ' vernment as an intimation that the Legis- lature were desirous of dealing with the whole question of immigration. The ab- surdity of making regulations for the dis- tribution of a fund which has no existence, does not seem to have occurred to the Government. Iustead of being deterred by this little dimcttlty, the Miuistry have drawn up the regulations, which are to come into force on the 1st day of March next» upon the supposition that a much larger sum will be at their disposal in the present year than in the past. It is a wonder that it did not occur to some member of the Government that it would have been well to ascertain the amount that was likely to be at their disposal, be- fore making regulations, which must be modified should the Assembly not agree with the somewhai louse notions of the Ministry on the subject. Before entering into the merits of the new rules, it must be evident that a stupendous blunder has been committed in making them at all at the present juncture. They cannot have any effect except to bind the Government to a contract which they may never have the power of completing. If Parliament had not been sitting, the plea of necessity might have been urged for a tempo- rary act of usurpation by the Execu- tive over the Legislature. But there is no room for such a plea. The old regu- lations might have done very well until the Estimates for immigration bad been laid before Parliament. There is even reason to believe that the action of the Government is ultra rires, for the Im- migration Act makes repeated reference to the Land Act of 1SG2, and the very ma- chinery of the immigration department is declared to be dependent on the fund ap- propriated under that Act. We will now call attention to the par- ticulars in which the new regulations differ from the old. The number of females to be introduced free was formerly fixed at an average of 150 per month, or 1800 per annum. There is now to be no limit to the number. Formerly the regulations contained no reference to the nationality of such females. Henceforth British subjects and natives of Germany and Switzerland will be eligible. Why the French, Bel- gian, Danish, and other nationalities are to be shut out does not appear. Formerly single females only were eligible for free passages. The new rules create a new class-" married people of the class of small farmers and laborers." The number of these is to be limited to the requirements of the colony as indicated by the amount annually voted, and to be se- lected from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, in proportion to their respective populations. Formerly this limitation was in force for only nine months in each year ; now it is absolute. Surely it would have been soon enough to have made regulations for this class after Parliament liad discussed the propriety of making any provision at all for free immigration of this kind. The description is wide enough to include capi- talists and paupers from the rural districts, and there is a very strong probability that the Assembly will object altogether to the importation of such classes as free immigrants. It is only by an unwar- rantable stretch of the provisions of the Immigration Act that " free " immigration of this kind can be recognised. The Land Act 1862 provided for " assisted " immi- gration only. The new Act makes no pro- vision at all. There is no material alteration in the rules relating to passage-warrants issued in the colony to residents desirous of bringing out their relatives. The amount reemired to be paid remains unchanged except in the case of males between fifteen anil fifty, for whom the payment is reduced from Ü5 to £i, the reason for which is by no means obvious, female immigration being Btill the great desideratum of the colony. The next division of the regulations per- mits persons residing in the colony to take out passage-warrants for laborers or ser- vants without specifying the names of the persons to be introduced, on.payment of the same sums as those required for the bring- ing out of relations duly nominated, namely, from £1 to .£4 each, according to age and sex. It appears to us that a larger sum might fairly be demanded on such open warrants. Strange to say, the new rules are altogether silent regarding tho introduction of persons other than Lritish subjects skilled in special industries. The most important innovations are con- tained in the fourth part of the regulations. It is there provided that *' persons resident in the United Kingdom" desirous of ob- taining .passages for relatives and " friends" -a designation which may include any- body and everybody-may obtain warrants on application to the Agent-General. Un- der this provision it will be an easy matter for poor-law guardiuus and others interested in clearing out the useless and dangerous classes, to muke arrangements with an intermediate party for tho negotiation with tho Agent-General, so that he will have ' great difficulty in ascertaining the character of the persons nominated for passages. The most objectionable of all tho regu- lations is the very last, which provides that " warrants may bo issued in favor of single males or families who may he de- sirous of embarking in ships selected by themselves," on payment of sums of £2 and upwards, the Government becoming re- sponsible to the shipowner to the extent of JËI'1 for each statute adult. This will open a, wide door for the introduction of the most gross abuses. It is u system which was tried twenty-five years ago, and uni- versally condemned.
