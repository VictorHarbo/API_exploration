VICTORIA. The following is Irom our own correspondent under date of August 16 : — Pending the departure of the Melbourne mail the go!d maiket has been very dull, and a further decline of 6d. per ounce has taken place in addition to the fall caused by the reduced rate of exchange on London last week.

Ihc large cargo of New Zealand wheat has been transhipped to Sydney, and our market is now wholly dependent upon Ade hide supplies. The cargo of Chilian wheat per Inge borg is still held for 15s. per bushel. Bran continues very scarce, but green food will relievo the market in a fesv days. The following is from the commercial article of the Argus of the 16th instant : — The official returns of the Immigration Board for the month of July aro of little interest, except that some thing like a ' rush ' of the mining population towards the Sydney gold-fields has taken place ; but this 'rush' does not appear to have been ' so extensive as is repre sented in the Sydney papers.

The Argu* of the 11th has the 'following wholesale prices current : — Arqut Office, Saturday evening. The unsettled state of the weather during tbe past week has added to the general dulnes* of trade. Al though orders from the country are coming in freely, especially from the Ovens, they are accompanied by a limit as to rate of cartage, which will not admit of their being executed. Under these circumstances the course of trade in Melbourne is confined to speculative opera tions for the spring, which are not, however, by any means active. . : : The Arrivals of vessels from extracolonul potts since Saturday last have comprised two from. London, one from Liverpool, and one from Boston, U A, with general cargoes, and one from Faabouxg, with a cargo of Danish oats. ? .;. ' There have been few changes in prices, except in the market for breadstuff*, which has been, completely un settled.' Adelaid* first has been sold at £25 10s., and was offered at that late this afternoon. The state of the roads has done much to check the upward tendency which was evinced on the receipt of the news from Val paraiso.. -Although stocks in town are not by any means large for the season of the year, there is nd other outlet for them than that of the town consumption. The quantities hitherto sent in from. South Australia have not been heavy, but it is expected that prerent prices will bring forward supplies, and that any further advance will be only of a temporary nature. In Sydney and in Tasmania the markets are equally unsettled. Wheat is now worth from 9s. 6d. to 10*. Chilian flour, £24. Oats are held firmly at 6s. to 6s. 3d. for Tasmania-, and 5s. 9d. for Scotch. Rice is looking upwards. Bran is worth 2s. to 2s. 3d. Liquors. — Martell's brandy has been sold at 14s. 3d_ and United Vineyards at 13s. 3d., but transactions are by no means numerous. The good low qualities of brandy are getting into request Whisky has suffered a further decline, and has been offered at under 7s. Old torn is scarce in bulk and plentiful in case. Wines are dull, but the demand for summer wines continues. Holders are not, however, anxious to quit, except at full prices. Bulk ales have shown an upward movement, but we do not alter our quotation?, except for Bass's Xo. 1, which haft been sold at £10. Bottled beers are without change. Tobacco. — Nothing doing. Groceries.— Recent advices from Mauritius and from Singapore have imparted firmness to the sugar market Candles are again looking down, and Belmonts and Hale's have been offered at Is. 3d. Stocks are known to be coming forward in large parcels by several vessels now due. Coffee is a trifle easier. Dried fruits are enquired for. Oilmen's stores maintain their prices, as it is ex pected that the coming season will be a brisk one. Tea is dull of sale, and heavily stocked. Congous are quoted at from £5 15a. to £5 17a. 6d. for ordinary, and £6 to £i 5s. for good ; but the trade hold off at these rates. Salt is adv-ncine. There are enquiries for hops. Provisions. — Batter and cheese are difficult to move ; haras, best English, are irorth Is. 2d. to Is. 3d. per lb.; bacon, Is Id. Oils and Paint3.— Very little doing. Metals.— The orders at present down from the interior give promise of a profitable spring trade in iron. Zinc has dec'ined. Rolled steel is not worth more than from £10 to £42. Sheet lead has been sold at £33. BnildingMaterials.— There is no change in this market Slates are cot so dull. Sundries.— Earthenwara is scarce. Opium, Patna.has realized £190. Good invoices of boots and shoes are saleable. In soft goods the trade stands still till the spring season advances. The same paper in its issue of ths 14th has the following : — The flour m-rket continues to be entirely unsettled, a fluctuation of from £1 to £2 being quoted daily. This arises in a great measure from the state of the weather preventing all transmission of stocks to the interior, and confining the dealinsrs of speculators to the supply of tne town trade. The cargo of the Ingeborg as still kept out of the market. A sale of 4,000 bushels of New Zealand wheat was effected by auction, at 10s. 7d. per bushel, for shipment to Sydney.
