PRUSSIA-ITS HISTORY. A correspondent has kindly famished as with a brief history of Prussia, abridged by him from the Encyclopedia Bt Uanmca, with an ad dinon by himself It may be of interest just now, when it has become o question for argu mont whether or not the rapid success of Prussia will bring out a love of conquest, dangerous to the peace of Europe The past history of the country_will throw some light on the proba bilities of such a result, for or against Tho germ-the agglomerating nucleus-of the present kingdom of Prussia is the province of Brandenburg, which was at first a marquisate, in later times an electorate, and then ennobled by giving to Prussia its present dynasty of Hohenzollern monarchs Brandenburg at the begmmngof the Christian era was inhabited by Teutonic or German tribes When the migrations of the Scandinavian and Teutonic tribes -commonly known as the ' Northern Hive -had thrown these hordes of stnrdy barbarians npon the south of Europe, the abandoned territories of Brandenburg were oc cupied by Slavonic races, who spread themselves westwards as far as the Elbe To protect their frontiers from these foreign rates the Kingsof Ger many established in the ninth ceotury a line of military colonies, under the charge of Markgrafs, or Wardens of tho Marches Of these Wardens tho most valiant and powerful was Albrecht the Bear, who may he regarded as the real founder of the Marquisate of Brandenburg One of his successors, the Markgraf Louis, a Bavarian, acquired the dignity of an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, and thus Brandenburg became an Electorate The country subsequently fell into the hands of the Emperors of Germany, from one of whom Brandenburg was purchased by Frederick of Hohenzollern, a rich Burggraf or Imperial Commissioner of N urnberg Frederick was solemnly invested with the dignity of Elector at the Diet of Constance A D 1417 Ttom this Frederick, the first Elector of Bran lenburg, has sprung a long line of able rulers -most of them bearing his honored name who, by steady attention to the labours of the State, and by patriotic devotion to the interests of their country, hovo raised this originally poor and distracted electorate to its present proad position as one of the foremost powers of Europe, and given it an influence which is already powerfully exercised, for the progress of popular intelligence, freedom of thought, and civil liberty The royal dynasty of Prussia, through its founder Frederick, derives its designation from the castle of Zollern, or Hohenzollern, in Sua bia This stronghold and a small contiguous territory were originally held by two brothers, Conrad and Frederick The younger, as we hove seen, beosmo Burg graf of Nürnberg, and is thus the ancestor of the present king of PruLSio The descendants of the other brother retained possession of their patrimonial estates until 1851, when tbey resigned them to the king, and received rank in Prussia as princes of the royal blood The rule of Eredenok was eminently benefi cent, he was the blessing of blessings to Bran denburg, desolated hitherto by intestine feuds and enfeebled by the oppression and lawlessness of its nobles The country now learned to know the blessings of peace, security, and pros- perity The qualities which distinguished the administration of this prince have been the common inheritance of most of his successors - unswerving adherence to the essential principles of their anoestral policy, prudent tbriftiness in avoiding all unnecessary expense, and a strict attention to the military organisation, as well as the industrial progress, of their father land Joaohim II, " the Hector of the oampaigns against the Turks, became Elector m 1535, and having with Luther renounced allegiance to the See of Bomb, he confiscated the immense re venues of the bishoprics, and applied them to the endowment of schools and charitable insti tutions Anxious to enlarge his territory and to aggrandize his race, he obtained the co înfeftment of the country called Prussia, at that timo ruled by a Duke who was a prince of the Hohenzollern family, and thus a kinsman of bis own Through the marriage of Joachim s son with a princess of Prussia, the province of Eastern Prussia was, in 1618, incorporated with Brandenburg by right of inheritance As to the previous history of Prussia proper, we find the Pruzzi, a tribe of Slavonic origin, occupying from the earliest times the shores of the Baltic, lying between the Vistula and the Niemen These heathens had long resisted every effort to spread the Christian faith among thein, till, in the 13th century, the neighbour ing kingdom of Poland, which had Buffered from frequent inroads, invited the Knights of St George, an ecclesiastical order of Teutonic or German origin, to join in a crusode against these barbarians The undisciplined valour of the Slavonians could ill withstand the skill of the mounted warriors who fought under the banner of the cross, and the whole country was in aBhort time subjugated and possessed by the German Knights Their enlightened rule and fostering core oaused agriculture, commerce, and the fine arts to spring np and flourish, under an inclement sky and on the extreme verge of eivili sation But seeurity and commercial opulence beget luxury, and the degenerate knights ere long were obliged to acknowledge the feudal sovereignty of Poland In 1525 this religions order embraced the Reformation, and vas there upon dissolved, but its master retained his former rank under the secular title of hereditary Duke of Prussia The Elector Joachim s matri montai sagacity paved the way for the absorp- tion of this duchy, and a political arrangement of his, by which tho principalities of Silesia ultimately fell to bo inherited by his family, led to the " Silesian Wars " of 1756 63 His grandson laid the foundation of the Bhenish possessions of Prussia by acquiring the duchy of Cleves on the Bhine At the ontbreak of the " Thirty years War " (1618 1648), Prussia, as a leading Protestant state, should have taken the foremost place in the defence of civil and religious liberty, bat her rulers sought to save her from war by as sunung a position of apparent indifference In consequenoe of this ignoble policy she suffered more than from actual war, her territory was invaded and trampled nnder foot by both parties, so that in the year 1640 the country presented to the eye a sad scene of desolation, towos and villages in ruins, commerce paralysed and almost gone, even the tillage of the fields neglected, famine and pestilence stalking through the land In this the hour of her deepest misery, the firBt of her great Frederick Williams ascended the throne, at the early age of twenty years His wonderful exploits as a military commander, the vigour and wisdom of his civil government, and his steady efforts to give his small state a place among the nations i of Europe, have won for him the grateful reinem brance of his countrymen, who still fondly call him " the Great Eleotor Having formed and trained a small body of troops, tbe Branden burgers of Prussia, as famous as the Ironsides of his cotemporary Oliver Cromwell, be soon recovered all the territory which had escaped the weak grasp of his father By skilful strategy and by strenuous valour he drove the French out of the Rhineland, which had been wantonly seized by them without even a declaration of hostilities Anxious for the unity of the state under one governing head, he greatly restricted the power of the Stande, or Parlia- ments, which, like our Lnglish Parliament, consisted of the representatives of the nation, and deprived tbera of the right of voting tbe supplies His prudent economy and strict at lennon to finanoe enabled him to maintain, without burdening his people, an army of 40,000 thoroughly efficient soldiers His son, Frederick I, who began to reign in 1688, pursued the patriotic policy of his father, and at last reached the summit of his wishes, the elevation of his country to the rank of a kingdom Ou the 18tb January, 1701, with the consent of the Emperor of Germany, he placed the royal crown on his own head, and in memory of this eveot insti tuted the Prussian order of the Black Eagle, a decoration which has always been sparingly be stowed Thus was usher"d lu among the monarchies of Europo a kingdom which, in the short space of 170 years, has now reached shall we say-the first place and influence on tho continent In tho war in which Britain joined with Ger many to resist the ambitious projects of Louis XIV, I redentk, single-banded, drovo the Frenohfrom their «troug positions on the Lower Hinno His Brandenburgers fought under the eye of the great Marlborough, and materially contributed to the glory of Blenheim and bis other victories His Queen, Sophia Charlotte, of Hanover, was the sister of our King George I, and was well known for her literary tastis and friendships But neither tho father's love of regal pageantry nor the mother's philosophic elegance seemed in any degree to affect their son Frederick William I, who in his youth took pleasure in nothing bnt military parades, field sports, and the carousals of his companions When he became king (1713 1740) ho drilled his soldiers-amongst whom he had a regiment of giants-till they exhibited the faultless regularity of moving machines He established a system of punctu i lity, frugality, and order-now an heirloom, and by carefully onconraging immigration, and stimulating all kinds of domestic and social in dastry, he kept his domain free from heavy burdens, maintained a well filled treasury, *aud thus secured the means of prompt action in war-an example which his successors have iiot been loth to imitate This royal martinot, this lover of strict conformity both in church and state, this hater of all the amenities of daily life, and of all foreign polish, had a son who hated most things that his father loved and loved most that he hated Believing that the welfare of the State (and in the estimation of a German everything must yield to this) could be preserved by a strict adherence to his kingly maxims and practice, the disciplinarian father ourbed, nay crushed, such of the natural ten dencies of the boy as were not of this mould, and compelled him to give his whole mind to the de tails of military affairs and ot civil government The skill thus rudely and painfully cn forced afterwards burst forth as a brilliant meteor, to the disaster of his enemies and the astonishment of the world In 1740 the youth mounted his father s throne as Frederick II all Europe called him "The Great,' the Prussians fondly remember and love bim as their "OldFritz,' he is one of the heroes of history-and of Thomas Carlyle Without waiting to taste tbe sweets of royalty, he at once plunged into war by demanding from Maria Theresa, daughter and heiress of Charles VI of Germany, the Silesian principalities which had been unjustly withheld from the "Great Elector ' With a chosen band he beat down all opposition and seized and held Silesia Jealous of the rising power of Prussia, his neigh hours, Austria, Russia, Saxony, France, and Sweden, secretly entered into a coalition to rob Frederick of his territories, and to reduce bim to his ancestral rank and dimensions as Marquis of Brandenburg Having secret intelligence of their intentions he resolved to strike the first blow, and taking the field with 70,000 troops, he suddenly appeared before Dresden, the capital of Saxony Thus began, in 1756, the famous " Seven years War, which, like a con tinning hurricane, strewed tho provinces of Germany with carnage and desolation For seven years Frederick never entered his capital, in the camp, aad in the field, the Spartan liko training he had received from his inexorable sire enabled him to endure and to perform things incredible With the maternal solicitude which will sacrifice comfort, and even life, for the well being and safety of the child, Frederick directed the storm away from his own door, and sent its devastation upon the territories of his enemies When driven back by superior numbers, he turned liko a lion at bay, to defend his own frontiers and repel all inroads This system, which the present war seems to imitate, was maintained with such tenacity during the whole war that at its close Prussia, although only a puny terrier in the grasp of a band of plundering mastiffs, was less exhausted m her strength and resources than some of her assailants Truly the bear, that with ravening jaws attacked the stores of the industrious hive, and found to his pam that bees have stings, does not lack his counterpart in the history of nations In short, this contest raised Frederick to an honourable place among the greatest captains of all ages, and displayed the noble qualities of the nation which he was called to govern, and which by his genius he caved from spo hatton and ruin. Encompassed by enemies stronger far than himself, he found only one ally and friend, the King of Britain, whom private interest and the ties of blood led to aid him with men and money Lven this aid was withdrawn in 1761, on the accession of George III, and in the hour of his greatest need he was left to struggle alone In this " Seven years War, he fought at least a dozen great battleB, often he suffered terrible defeats, which would have prostrated any but an invincible hero, retiring behind lines of defence, which his genius m fortification could construct in forty-eight hours, he defied his enemies to attack him, ex- hausted though he was, or, sallying from his lair, he sent the annies of his ablest adversaries flying ia dismay before bim At Rosbach, in 17o7, he defeated the Frenoh, who had an army three times as numerous as his own-a defeat which rankled in the Gallic breast till the wars of the empire brought the viotones of Jena and Auerstadt to efface the remembrance of it In the same year, under equal disad vantages, he beat the Austrions at Leuthen, commanded by Dann, their ablest general Next year, at Forndorf, he chastised the Russians for their insolent pillage of his borders The three following years (1759 60 61) were years of uninterrupted reverses, but only served to show, in bolder relief, the patriotism and en durance of his people But fortune smiled again, and at last, in 1763, Maria Theresa, drained of hor resources, and unable to prolong the contest, agreed to the peace of Hubertsburg, by which Bhe disgorged Silesia and gave it to Frederick, its right- ful owner Henceforth, till the close of hiB life, the king devoted himself anweaxiedly to the internal improvement of his country By assisting in the first partition of Poland he ob tamed the province of Western Prussia, an important enlargement of his territory He was succeeded in 1786 by his nephew Frederick William II, whose licentious habits, religious intolerance, and blunders of policy rendered his reign a sinking contrast to that of the great Frederick. When the revolution broke out in France in 1789, and a Bepublio had been established there, the Prussians, and Aastrians interfered to compel the French to take back their king They were ignominicusly defeated, and Frederick William consented to cede the whole of his possessions on the left bank of the Rhine, a territorial frontier which France has long coveted Frederick William III ascended tbe throne in 1797, at a critical time, for the injudicious rule of his father had spread the seeds of dissatisfaction throughout the country, and as his neighbour's house was already burning fiercely with political and religious sentiments of the worst kind, there was danger that his house too might soon be in flames But the moral rectitude of tbe youth ful king, the simplicity of his manners, and his earnestness of purpose soon won the full oonfi dence of the nation In the preceding reign Prussia bad bound herself to absolute neutrality in the wars of the Trenoh, but when in 1804 Napoleon Bonaparte, the gifted but am bicious servant of the republic, had made himself its master, calling himself Emperor of France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia joined in a coalition against him All of them soon felt the weight of his mighty arm, for on the fields of Austerlitz, Jena, and Friedland their forces were broken, and their kings were glad to accept any terms wmch Napoleon chose to offer Dur ing the depression and humilia ion of the next seven years tbe whole military organization and internal administration of the country were quietly revised and regenerated by the patriots ¿tem, Hardenberg, and Scharnhorst To the last of these especially, tho Prussian army owes those admirable arrangements which have not only made the service honourable, popular, and mu nal, but have also enabled it to humble, wubin the last four years, two of the strongest nations ia Europe This system first obtained legislative establishment nu the 3rd September, 1814 By it every Prussian must at the age of twenty enter the army division raised in his own district, and must remain in it three years, in exceptional cases one year, he then returns to hisbome and engages m any omi employment, but for two years moro he is reckoned a soldier of the reserve, and may b called upon at any time to join the regular army From 25 to 32 ho belongs to the first levy ot Landwehr or home troops, from 32 to 37 he is lu the second levy, and from 37 to oO he is a member of the Landsturm The first levy is cillcd up in time of war, as now, the second when there is danger to the conntry, and the landsturm to do garrison duty when the country is invaded lhus by the law of Prussia the whole male population, up to the age of 50, moy in a great emergency be sum moned to arms This organisation enabled Prnssia to take the field at once on the sudden return of Napoleon from Elba, and although the indomitable Blucher was driven back at Ligny, yet ho sonn rallied, and leading his troops " Forwards, ' through soaking roads and fields of grain, be arrived at Waterloo just in time to assist in the final charge To his cavalrv was left the task of pursuing the fngi tive Trench-a remodelées pursuit, whioh strewed the high *oad to Paris with thousands of the dead and dying At the Congress of Vienna, which settled the affairs of Europe after the downfall of Napoleon, Prussia endea voured to regain from France the purely Ger man provinces of Al«ace and Lorraine, which were originally part of th| Germanic Confedera tion, but her demands were unheeded These provinces she has now taken from Franco by the strong arm of might, giving effect to right During the peaceful years which followed 1815 various sJutary changes were introduced-all of them fitted to secure the permanent prosperity of the State The King, by ediol, restored to their full power the " Stinde,' or provincial parliaments, which consist of representatives from the nobles the burghers, and the peasants, and as he had imposed on every citizen the duty of qualifying himself for the defence of hiB country, by making a knowledge of the art of war a national accomplish ment, so ho resolved to establish a tho roughly national system of education, even in the financial exhaustion of 1808 he bad founded and endowed the University of Berlin, which has already become one of the most famous in Europo In 1816 he published a law com pelling all parents to give a suitable education to their children , and notwithstanding the par simony of his government he was liboral towards education, for he provided parish schools, normal schools, and gymnasia or grammar schools throughout his kingdom In 1840 he was succeeded b; his son, Frederick William IV, the late king At his accession he was eminently popular, he exhibited a bril haut power of speech, great mildness of dispo sition, and manifold kindness, as well as an earnest admiration of English institutions Under him Prussia continued to show a rapid development in all the elements of material prosperity-in foreign trade, in the arts and manufactures But the political earthquake of 1848, whoae voloanio centre was Paris, convulsed Prussia as well as most of tho other nations of Europe In Berlin the populace demanded a more liberal constitution and reforms Their demands were mingled with patriotic ones for " Defence against the common enemy," " Close alliance of all German States," " Recovery of the Unity of Germany" (ones which have now been answered), but soon a reaction set in, and in the hands of an aristocratic party the king became less liberal than before Nevertheless, we may still regard Prussia as, like ours, a con stitutional country, in which no money can be spent and no law passed without the consent of the representatives of the people The present king William I has now reigned about ten years, and as his son, the Crown Prince, is married to the Princess Beyal of England, it is expected that the influence of the liberal opinions of longland will ere lung be felt m the government of Prussia. Since 1848 the party of " German Unity" has grown rapidly in number and power, they desire to gather together under the leadership, and as far as possible under the sovereignty, of Prussia, all the states that are German in na tionahty and language, and thus eventually to re establish the German Empire By the un- scrupulous statesmanship of Von Bismarck, her present premier, and the valor of her soldiers, Prussia has already accomplished part of this programme The Danish war of 1864, and the Austrian war of 1866, have en abled her to acquire from Denmark the German speaking provinces of Schleswig and Holstein, to exclude Austria from active interference in German affairs, and to bind all the German States to herself for the protection and promo- tion of common interests In the present war Prussia has seized, apparently for lasting pos- session, the German provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, hitherto incorporated with France, and if she is ultimately victorious, in making a j trea'y of peace she will donbtless insist on terms such as will permit the full accomplish- ment of " German Unity "
