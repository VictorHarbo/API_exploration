The iron clipper ship Loch Vennachar has completed another successful voyage from the Clyde to this port. The Loch Vennachar is one of the fancy vessels of the Glasgow Shipping Company's fleet, and during the 10 or 11 years she has been in commission, she can show a very fair record of fast passages. On this occasion she has also done well and in addition to a full general cargo she brings a number of saloon and tween deck passengers. Captain Bennett is again in command, and it is almost superfluous to note that the ship has come into port as usual, clean and trim, and in admirable order on deck and aloft. The Loch Vennachar left Greenock on March 19, and got out into the open ocean by way of the North Channel. A departure was taken from Instrahull on March 20, and thence fresh south westerly winds with thick foggy weather and a high troubled sea had to be endured until March 25. The weather then moderated, but the winds were from the S W quarter until April 2. Two days after this dato the ship entered on the N E. trades in lat. 30deg. N. and Ion. 21deg W., and had light winds all the way across the trades latitudes. San Antonio was passed and sighted on April 9. Light airs and calms prevailed afterwards to lat. 2deg. S. The equator was crossed on April 18 in Ion. 25deg. W. The S.E. trades were taken in lat. 4deg. S. and Ion 27deg. W , and the shíp was favoured with moderate breezes while the trades lasted. They were succeeded by northerly and N. W. winds. The prime meridian was crossed on May 12 in lat. 38deg. S., and the ship's track across the Southern Ocean was laid on a parallel between 39deg. and 40deg. The prevailing winds were from N W to S W., just the points to suit the Loch Vennachar, and some very good running was made while these breezes lasted. At times there was an increase in force of the wind, and on May 28 a very heavy gale came up from the southward. The gale was accompanied with hard hail squalls and there was a high cross sea. One sea of unusual violence which broke over the ship sent the second officer flying, and he had an arm broken in his fall. The injured limb was set, and he is now doing as well as possible. The longitude of Cape Leuwin was crossed on June 5 in lat. 40deg. S., and varible winds with thick weather and heavy rain continued until passing Cape Otway at half past 5a.m. on the 12th inst. The Heads were entered on the same date, 84 days from Greenock, or 83 days from Instrahull. The only vessel spoken during the voyage was the Myrtle Holme, from Lyttleton, N Z., for London, in lat 27deg 29mln E. and Ion. 20deg. 54 min W.
