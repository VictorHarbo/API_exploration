DANES PAY LESS TO MIGRATE NOW $50 for family DANISH families wishing to settle in Australia could now travel at a maximum cost to them of $50 for the whole family, the Minister for Immigration, Mr Snedden, said. Previously, the cost to a Danish family comprising a man, wife and three children was as high as $470, even after Government assistance. Mr Snedden said he had been concerned for some time that Danish assisted migrants had been at a disadvantage compared with assisted migrants from other countries because they had been unable to receive the full benefit of assistance with travel costs. Raised twice 'I raised this with the Danish authorities on two occasions last year', he said, 'and, as a result of our discussions, put to them a proposal which would enable Danish migrants to receive the full benefit of Govern- ment assistance while still complying with Danish emigration laws. "That proposal has now been accepted.' Under the Special Passage Assistance Programme, the contribution by settlers travelling on Governmentarranged transport is $25 per adult No contribution is required for children. Before the present arrangements were agreed on, all Danish settlers travelled on ordinary commercial transport. They had to pay the difference between the Australian Government's contribution and commercial fares. Mr Snedden said that some procedural details still had to be worked out. However, it was hoped that the new arrangements would begin operating almost immediately.
