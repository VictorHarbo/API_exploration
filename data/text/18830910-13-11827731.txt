SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. roLirrcAL. The end of November has been fixed as the date for holding the Federal Com on tion, and the present session of Parliament will hardly be prolonged beyond that date Representatives of the whole of the colonies will meet in Sydney, to discuss questions he mug directly on federation, and the annexation of New Guinea and other Pacific islands to Australasia The number of delegates has not yet been fixed Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, are favourable to sending four each, whilst New Zealand, Tasmania and South Australia are disposed to limit the number in every case to two Fiji will be invited to join the convention Western Australia will send one dolomite An earlier date could not be com recently appointed for the meeting, in consequence of the Victorian, South Australia, and Tasmanian Parliaments being in the midst of their work The New Zealand Legislature has just been prorogued the New South Wales Parliament will meet in October or November, and the Queensland general election should be over about the same time To accommodate the Government of the former colony, Sydney was suggested by the Victorian Premier as the place of meeting, instead of Melbourne, which was ouj;i__iUv proposed and the change has been agreed to. The work of the session his proceeded during the fortnight it an accelerated rate of progress All the estimates, except the defence vote, which is reserved for discussion, have been passed The Ministerial scheme for it against me the local forces his been made public, but the 'Treasurer has deferred explaining it to the Assembly until the routine estimates should be of been voted, and the last of these were assented to on Thursday last In the Legislative Council, the Supreme Court Procedure Bill, introducing the English judicature system, has been read a second time, and passed through committee without utter tion This measure has already been approved by the Assembly It is to come into operation in February, at the close of of the summer vacation The It Elvy says Management Bill has undergone alter action in the Council, and it appears likely that the two Houses will arrive indifferent conclu BioiiB respecting the tenure of office to be conferred on the commissioners by whom the r new ays are for the future to be managed the Assembly's read them on the same footing as the audit commissioners, who are only removable on the joint vote of the two Houses, or on a resolution carried in two successive sessions by the Assembly It was pointed out in the Assembly as a reason for adopting this provision, that if the Council voted for the reinstatement of a commissioner suspended by the Governor in Council, and the Low 01 House thought that the suspension should be confirmed, the Council could be ov created by holding two sessions of Pal li imont within a week of each other For precisely the same reason members of the Council object to the bill as it stands, and desire that some limitation should be put on the overruling power of the Assembly The clause dealing with the question has been twice postponed in committee by the Council, and a vote will not be taken upon it until Wednesday All the remaining clauses of the bill except one have been passed The Public Service Bill, of which a synopsis was given in our last summary, has been read a second time in the Legislative Assembly Its principles have in the main met with approval The chief question on which a difference of opinion exists is whether the board to be entrusted with the administration of the measure the class fiction of work in each other, the inner working of the departments, and appointment, promotion, and dismissal of officers under regulations defined by Parliament and the Governor in Council shall consist of the audit commissioners, as the Ministry propose, or of a different set of men The powers of the board will be large, even though the machinery of the bill is intended to run, to a great extent, automatically Permission has been given by the Premier to the civil servants to submit their views in writing on the portions of the scheme directly affecting themselves, and the bill will not be proceeded with in committee for a week or two Precedence will this week be given in the Assembly to the mallee pastoral leases bill, which has been read a second time, and has now to be considered in committee Expedition is necessary, in order that the suppression of the rabbit and wild dog posts may be commenced by intending occupiers this summer The bill divides the mallee into A md B blocks, to be held in pans, a twenty years lease being given of the former and five years' lease of the latter Lessees will be required to clear both holders of vermin, and in return for their outlay will not only obtain a long tenure of block A, but be compensated for improvements effected on block B, which they will have to surrender Some critics of the measure consider iii of years too short a term for the B blocks It li is also been proposed that the fringe of the mallee bordering on the agricultural districts should be cut up into small ballot month for occupation by selectors A modification of the bill will be made in this direction by the Government. After the Mallee Bill has been passed, the Harbour Trust Bill, of which only two or three 1 buses ran in to be disposed of, will be pushed on in the Assembly, and sent to the Council Ministers propose increasing the number of the Harbour Trust Commissioners from 15 to 17, the extra number to be appointed by the Governor in Council, who at present his the nomination of three commissioners The Press disapproves of the proposed increase SOCIAL AND GUM HALL The Australasian Convention which is to beheld with the view of united for federal action being taken by these colonies to so cure the annexation of the Pacific Islands is to be held in Sydney The Victorian Premier has agreed to this, with the object of meeting the convenience of the New South Wales Government as in consequence of the meeting of 1 parliament they would be unable to send representatives to Melbourne The date li is not b mi definitely settled yet, but it will in all probability be in the first week of October Mr Service the Victorian Premier is in daily communication with the other colonies on the subject The Postmaster General of Victoria has received a communication from Dr Stephan, the State Secretary of the German 1 Postal department, with reference to the proposal of the Australian colonies to join the Universal Postal Union Dr Stephan indicates that it is his intention to oppose the proposed con- ditton that each of the colonies should be accorded a separate voice in the affairs of the union Mr Graham Perry has replied by a letter, in which he upholds the claims of the Australian colonies to recognition as independent states and sets forth the grounds on which they claim a separate vote the idea of organising a fourth Australian Eleven to visit England is being favourably entertained. The principal drawback is the difficulty of arranging satisfactory terms with the English cricketing authorities The proposition has created a discussion in which it has transpired that the last Australian Eleven netted little more than ordinary salaries Several leading cricketers without whom no Australian Eleven would be com- plete, have declined to again visit England under the old arrangements, but in the event of the English authorities making some further concessions it is probable that the fourth Australian Eleven will be the strongest that has yet upheld Australian cricket prestige in the old country I The draft report of the 'Tariff Commission, M drawn up by Mr James Minims M.L.A., the chairman, is a very bulky document, but it has been BSBtemntically compiled and well indeed With appendices textiles over 128 pages There are six divisions the second being the longest this division con terms a summary of the facts collected by the commissioners in reference to the 18 groups of articles about which they took evidence in the third division, the protectionist van was of the chairman are brought prominently forward Negotiations with the view of making a beginning in the direction of intercolonial free trade are recommended but the chairman thinks that the manufacturers who are asking for it have not arrived at a clear or definite idea as to what they mean by intercolonial free trade Great advantages it is suggested, might be gained for our manufacturers and producers in the neighbouring markets if sip irate treaties of com mi ree were made with them in dividends), upon terms that would be mutually advantageous and in relation to commodities in which they would be individually interested Remissions of duties to the amount of £200 300 are proposed reductions to the amount of £13 'IW and modifications which lessen the revenue b) 2400. the total loss being £215110 On the other hand it is estimated that £17 800 will be gained by modifications £11,300 by increases £11<100 by new duties and £122 500 by alterations in excise or a total of £210 TOO An excise duty of 2d per gallon on beer is the principal new duty the new customs duties include one of V\ per cent on reapers and binders A meeting for the consideration of the report will be held on Tuesday) September 2 At a recent meeting of the council of the Melbourne University a letter w as received from Mr E Langton stating that he had received two letters from the Cobden Club for presentation to the University, to be awarded to students for excellence in political economy It was decided to accept the medulla with thanks The claim of the Roman Catholic Church for a special educational grant from the state was explained on Tuesday last by Archdeacon Slattery before the Education Commission the Holy) See he said has issued a command that all i duration of the young unconnected with religion is to be condemned and repre b ited and the Catholics of this colony, the arch deacon sayS are therefore bound to stand aloof from our secular school a) stem Hiev consequently have a grievance which they press notasmembcrsotthe Roman Catholic Church, but as members of a tax paying community to whom the state hits caused in educational matters the position in toto pat units The witness also stated that Catholics who sent their children to the state schools w hereCntlioheschoolswereprovided, would be regarded by the priesthood les disobedient rebellious and guilt) of sin, and would be denied the sacraments of the church, including absolution and Christian burial He gave some statistical evidence as to the Catholic schools in the Geelong district, and said that he would be satisfied if the state gave £2 per head in aid of the education of Catholic children.

Strong with pro mulgntingnnd publishing heretical and no sound doctrine by his action in connexion with the recent lecture of Mr Justice begin botham, and otherwise, also with conduct tending to destroy the order, unit), and peace of the church , also with failure to assert, mine team, and defend the doctrine of the church and further with failure to comply with the instructions of the presbytery to give prominence in his teaching to the incarnation, the atoning life and death, and the resurrection and ascension of our Lord It was decided that the charge should be in vestigated at a meeting of presbytery to be held on the 18th inst, in Chalmers Church. The resignation of Mr Strong was then read and it was decided that it should be taken into consideration at the same meeting as that on which the charge is to be heard Since he has occupied the pulpit of the church, Mr Strong has greatly endeared himself to his congregation As an evidence of the esteem in which he is held and of the results of his labours a memorial was presented to the presbytery from members of the Scots Church District Social Society of which he is president, its prayer being Unit the presbytery would not deprive them of their beloved pastor through whom they had learned to read better in ea than formerly Outside his own church, his kind and gentle manner, combined with his open expression of opinions, rendered him very popular 'hills ANNUAL STUD SIILTPSAL1 S The annual Melbourne sale of stud merino and longwool sheep was commence 1 on Wednesday, the 5th mat A large number of sheep were catalogued for sale from all the leading Victorian stud flocks The best breeders in Tasmania and South Australia were also well represented Owing to various causes but principally to an over supply of moderate animals the hours dragged 1 a good deal Really high class merinoes, however, were in demand and realised good prices, there being always plenty of sheep breeders ready to give a very liberal price for really high class rams. (Jil the opening day Messrs 1 Fisken Gibson, and Co disposed of drafts of rams from in st of the leading stud flocks in Victoria. The prices realised showed a reduction on the price of previous sales though first class sires excited keen competition Somewhat of a sensation was created 1 in the sale of the merino rams sent in by Mr John Cumming of terrill claim The first of those sheep was a remarkably fine run well formed, of good sue with a piece of the highest quality even and well covered 1 About a dozen stud stock owners had a fancy for this fine specimen of the merino breed of sheep and when he was put up for sale the TO guinea bids came in faster than the auctioneer could take them After he had reached 1 000 gunn us the contest was left to Messrs. William Cumming an 1 Son of Mount Fyans and the Hon thomas 1 Cumming both brothers of the breeder of the Sheep The biddings call on rapidly, BO coming at a time till the price stood at J150guineas, when he was knocked down to the Hon J Thomas F Cumming The affair created the greatest excitement among the large number of stockowners assembled in Melbourne to attend the sale the average of the 24 Larra rams bred 1 by Messrs F L Curr and Co was 72 guineas per head The experiment of crossing the Australian with the Vermont (USA) merino has been successful so far with Messrs MI art and Brothers of Barooga. Riverina len of their rams realised good prices the highest sum paid for a single Australian Vermont rum was 210 game ia The sheep sent in by Sir Samuel W Wilson did not reach a high average the highest price realised bran 1 Ercildoune ram was 300 guineas The total amount realised at the days sale by Messrs 1 Fisken Gibson and Co was M 000 On the 6th inst Messrs Dal Campbell and Co disposed of some evil client Victorian bro 1 sheep the most fancied being a fine lot of ruins from the stud of Messrs Thomas Dowling and Son Jellalabad The bidding for these sheep was very spirited and the 19 rams realised a total of 1 825 guineas just live guineas short of an average of 100 guineas per head This truly bred stud has been slowly but steadily coming to the front, and it is creditable to the breeders that they should have gained their highest average In a dull market Moderate prices were obtained for the rams from the studs of Messrs. Dennis and Wettenhall Carr's Plains, Mr E G Greeves Borriyalloak, and Robert Jamieson Stony Point On the 7th inst some very fine 1 Tasmanian merinoes were disposed of by Messrs. Powers, Rutherford and Co ; and small but highly select lot of rams from the best South Australian stud flocks were sold by Messrs Ryan and Hammond The highest priced 1 Tasmanian mm was Royal Duke, three years old, bred by Messrs W Gibson and Son, of Scone This ram was bought by Mr Alexander Anderson, of Moor among, Victoria, for 650 guineas The principal averages were-Mr James Gibson, I Bellevue, 21 roma, at £51 11s 6d per head, and 20 ewes, at 1.21 per head, W Gibson and Son, 51 rams, at £08 per head, and 30 ewes, at £23 2s. 6d , J W Toosey, jun , Creasy House, 14 rams, at £37 2s 6d per head and 14 ewes at £22 7s. per head Mr W H Gibson, Fairfield 17 rams at £70 2s per head Mr H Gatenby, Rhodes, eight rams at £25 4s per is aid The South Australia rams sold very w ell The most fancied sheep were those sent in by the Hon G C Hawker, of Bungaree One of the RC rams was purchased by Messrs Palmer Bros, and Co, Bourke district, New South Wales, for 020 guineas. Eighteen rams from the Bungaree stud averaged £143 5s per head , 25 rams bred by Messrs Saunders, James, and Co, of Canowie, South Australia, realised £40 7s per head . 14 rams bred by Mr J H Angus, of Hill River, South Australia, realised £24 4s per head, and four ewes sold for 25 guineas each The longwool sheep were not in good request Some splendid Lincolns were penned from the finest stud flocks in the Western District of Victoria, but the prices were not encouraging to the breeders It is fully expected that us our farmers get into a better system of sheep husbandry, this breed of sheep will become more fashionable, as they are more suited to the London market than the merinoes AG1UCUHURE.
