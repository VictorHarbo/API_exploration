MELBOUKNE MARKET REPORTS. FLOUR, GRAIN,' &c.; (llevieto far Month cud inn '2bth Jithi. lfifjl.') ! The' duiness of the past mouth is iu no way improved in , the termination of the present; dull markets and teceding prices have been tho ordor of things., Closo an the depar ture of .the last English mail, the Government Agricultural' Statistics made their appearuncc, again showing a marked increase on our production, which has in some degree biassed' the markets. The quantity of horse-feeding grain and other stuffs grown; within the colony is found to be proportionately inorcaBcd, and the market is in like manner infiuonced. Green crops are rilso much in oxcess of former years. The weather has continued cold and wet throughout the colonies, yet not unseasonable, und the, crops have a healthy appearance, and bid fair.towurds an abundant yield, both in thiB colony and South Australia. - Professor Ncumaycr, of tho .Gorernmont Observatory, kindly furnishes the following report of rainfall and tem pciuiuic .— Inches. i Rainfall from 25th June to 22na July, 1861 ? 1,545 Average for the season ? ? ? 1,648 i - ..

Kniltti Australia has already supplied this, colony with at least 17,000- tons of flou-, and' after exporting to Now South AVules^.Mauritius, &o.;, 10,000 tons, she has still a stook of 23,000 tons, making her available export equal to 50,000 tons of last year's crop. Tho . weekly report of 4tb inst. contained vldemus of stueks, productions available, colonial imports, with asr-umed consumption of. breadstuff* for the current -year. Theso .flguTQs gave rise to eome discussion, and the result ip so far. favorable in enabling a inst estimate being arrived at. Theso calculations aito basctf with a due consideration tb tho altered Btate Of tho oolcay, and will bo found as nearly c:r-. rect as it Is possible to form them., , ' The aspect of matUrs political, as bearing upon tho agrl-. oultural as woll as the pastoral interests of the colony lire - approaching great ohangos. Tho : Executive, under the Land Bill which Cairo into operation in November last, has, by tho overstraining of an exceptional olauso in section 63, granted ' licenses for the occupation', of crown lands ton. very numerousbody of applicants; This -action 1b looked upon as questionable policy, whi li time alono will deter-, mine; ? A still greater development is in prospcct -by tho proposal of granting leases to bona fide agriculturists, by allowtng;them to choose 320 aoros of any land in the colony fit for agriculture, at a yearly rent of 2b to 2s 6d . per aero .with a right.of purohnso. If shch a'scheme' -is- carried 'out 'without regard to the present pastoral tenants of tho Crown, in tho abscnee of an adjustment and definition of : their leases, tho icsu'.t will bo to undermine oho of the most cer tain stays tho colony rests upon— wool growing.- The recent advices from California show that ' after cattlo had i boon raised in oxcess of requirements, and - ruined, the Ranch holders (or, squatters) there, tlioy aro now in a.similar plet . hon\ with grain and brcadstuifs ; arid .at tho present moment do not'know whero to find a m'arket ? for the orop now kolng reaped. They console themselves that wool crowing, and ' ah improvement in its quality, .is destined to be the leading, agricultural pursuit, and tho '* sheet anchor .that aloqe can skve thorn from drifting ori aleo shore, and going to pieces^' J Tho return of a general eleotlon again brings forward, tho; question of Protection to' Native' Industry.

Wool, Hides, and Tallow. — Messrs Goldsbrough's monthly report is as follows:— Wool : As usual at this season of the year, the amount of business transacted is very limited, almost the only lots coming forward being fell mongers' slipe and scoured; nearly the whole of which are shipped to the home market on owner's account, buyers being shy of purchasing theso descriptions, after the very Unfavorable account sales received of the lots shipped during the past season. From the mild winter wo have hitherto had, It is generally believed that the new clip will be un usually 'well grown nnd sound; and wo hear from somo of the northern districts, where lambing has already com menced, that it has been most favorable, the increase in some instances being over 100 per cent. From these indica tions we nugur a large clip, and also believe that, after , tho veiy unsatisfactory account* received of the lots sent home last year in inferior condition, moro caro wiU be taken hy the flockowners in washing* and getting up their wools. Our sales during the mon h have been -small lota of greasy, at from 9d to 1 2d ; slipe, Is 2d to Is 3d; and handwashed, at IsCd per lb, Prices current Superior fleece, nomi nally Is lOd to Is lid, none offering ; ordinary to good, Is 6d i to is 8(1 ; .mrcnor, i« au to is oa ; superior greasy, iu^a to lis; inferior to gocd do, 8dtol0d ; super scouted, 2s to 2s '2d, none selling {-ordinary do, la6d to ls8d; handwashed, 'is 3d to.

We have eold a few small lots of coun try wet falted at from 9i to lis each. Shipments during the month have been: Per Jamcn -Wilpoo, for London, 371$ calfakins. Tallow: During the month we have made several shipments on ownors* account, there being scarcely any de mand in thU market, cither for colonial use or for export.

I^Boa Mab.het.— Mr Eldcrion reports that the same ! duiness as 'was experienced last week in the male depart j ment of labor still exists, and there ia little or no demand .for forming or station men. A few ploughmen has been engaged at reduced wages ; married couples bavc not been inquired after to any extent ; male domestic servants have met with few engagements. Some lads to act as grooms and useful servants have met with places. Female servants, even of the upper class, and possessing undeniable references aa to capability and respectibilitjv arc -not much in demand just now, and a largo number of servants, suitable for tho country, farm, station, and hotels, orb oat of employment.
