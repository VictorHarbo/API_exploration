MISCELLANEOUS. The ERATO, from London, via Plymouth, mado a voyage unmarked by any impartant event. She left London on July 28, and beat down to Plymouth against a strong west-north-west gale. Tha weather became very heaving the day before reacting Plymouth, but she put in without damage, and^ embarked 421 people. After four days' detention the vessel proceeded oa her ▼o?«ge, and took daparture from tha Lizard Ponst oa the 9th. Subsequently she had 'a few «r.vs eslm, tho precursor of a continuanco of T*ry air weatnsr to tha Lice, - hich wns crossed n. faeptcmber 11 In iS£- lobule. The Bouth £.« fcacus prcrrad good, snd on Octo r 7 in 40* /I S- the vessel was off t'«n Cs^. The i- ivy weather of tha Whsrn Ocaaa the* Ugsc, sed during son;? of tha cilc3 it blew bo furiously that the vessel was hove to under close - reefed canvas. In long. 24° E., lat. 42°, a very severe bout was experienced, which obliged the ship to lay to for 18 hours. Indeed, the entire passage from the Cape was marked by the continuance of extemely heavy gales until well in with the land. The vessel's draught of water being easy the Glenelg was chartered to tow the vessel into harbour. The Rachel Cohen was towed out by tho Glenelg on Monday afternoon's tide. The Silver Stream was towed out by the Eleanor. The City of Paris is another of the cele brated 'City' line, so many of which have visited our port during the past few years. She was Bighted from Cape Borda on Sunday afternoon, passed that lighthouse, and made a fair run up the Straits till off Troubridge, when the wind fell light, and it took all the day before she reached the roadstead. There the anchor was let go till the following afternoon's tide, when she would be towed into harbour. She is as fine a vessel as could be desired, aa4 under her whole topsails presented a very pretty appearance as she headed up for the reads. The passage from London appears to have been of about the ordinary character, Bhe having left the docks on August 24. She had a beating wind down Channel, but cleared the Sturtf Point on the 28tb, and fine weather followed. T^aoty eight days were occupied in reaching the Line, which was crossed in 29° 50', and there she had an interval of light variables for three or four days. Soon after the south- east trades begun, and from the time of their setting in until reaching the meridian of the Cape in 41° 30' S. the vessel made an average of nine knots. Like other late arrivals Bhe had no sooner cleared the Cape than heavy breezes were experienced, and during one severe storm a sea broke on board and knocked away a lot of the port bulwark plankin?, but despite sea and wind the vessel kept right on and never hove to. During some of the days in crossing the Southern Ocean she ran off 295, 285, and several other equally pood days' work, and in making up the total it was found that she had averaged 216 knots per day from the Line to the time of reaching Kangaroo Island. The Ashbcrton was towed out by the Eleanor on Monday morning, and at once started down the Gulf, but the wind was so light that she made but little distance during the day. GLENELG SHIPPING. Nov.
