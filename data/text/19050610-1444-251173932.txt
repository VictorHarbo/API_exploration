Assisted Immigration. IMPORTING AGRICULTURAL LABORERS. Among the passengers for Fremantle in the R M.S. Ortona, which arrived at Fremantle on Thursday, were one Swedish and six Danish immigrants, who. were entered on the list as laborers, and were sent to Fremantle by the Agent- Genoral's Office. The men are all young, seemingly about 21 years of age, and are -agricultural laborers. They are under the leadership of a Swede named Knudsen, who is a skilled dairyman. On arrival they made known their position, and stated that they were informed in London that they would be met at Fremantle by a Government officer, but as nobody was there to receive them, they were recommended to call on the Premier. Shortly after, however, a Government, officer from the statistical office arrived, and, introducing himself to the men, took them to Perth. He said he was aware the men were coming out, and that work had been secured by the Government for them should they care to accept it. The men came to Western Australia on very favorable conditions... They paid only £6 10s, or half the fare, the other half being defrayed bj fcne West Australian Government. The leader, Knudsen, had a letter from the Agent- General's Office stating that arrangements had been made with the Orient- Pacific line for them to secure tickets at half fare. The tickets, however, showed that the full fare had been paid. The Federal immigration authorities appeared to be somewhat suspicious, but as the men stated they had no written contract, they could not take auy steps in regard to them. It is understood that more Danish and Swedish laborers of the same class are to be sent out to Fremantle shortlv.— Perth "Herald."
