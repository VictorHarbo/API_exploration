SELBY'S SELLING OFF.- For the last two years the public have been so thoroughly humbugged by Sydney drapers, that they quite despaired of anything genuine and really honest ever again being published under the heading "a' selling off," and were, therefore, quite unprepared to find that all SELBY stated in his advertisement was being fully carried out. of he public did not believe that it took three months to dispose of £300 of banking t stock, because they know that at the Prices quoted it would all be sold in seven days, The public did not believe that drapers imported fashionable goods to sell at under cost price, because they knew that drapers wore as fond of money as other people The public did not believe that any draper would spend a fabulous sums in alterations every three months, because nobody but a lunatic would make alterations in June for the purpose of destroying the same in September. And the public did not believe in a 10th bonnet, with a ticket on it, being stuck in the middle of a case at 3s 6d. each. Yet all these parte the public had been asked to take, and then to swallow the box in the shape of a semi- annual, SELBY states the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I SELBY recognises the fact that one customer's money is as good as another's, and no favour is given or abatement made to anybody. ' ? SELBY gives honest measure, and won't descend to the modern dodge of folding ten yards of calico into twelve lengths, and then selling it as a dozen for 4s 11d.
