Agricultural Laborers. IMPORTED BY THE GOVERN- MENT. SEVEN REACH FREMANTLE. Among the passengers for Fre- mantle in the R.M.S. Oronta, which arrived at Fremantle yesterday, (says the "Morning' Herald " of Friday,) were one- Swedish and six Danish immigrants, who were entered on tne list as laoorers, ana were sent to Fremantle by the Agent-General's Office. The men are all young, seemingly about 2i years of age, and are agricultural laborers. They are under the leariershin nf a £topHp named Knudsen, who is a skilled dairyman. On arrival they made known their position, and stated they were informed in London that they would be met at Fremantle by a Government officer, but as nobody was there to receive them, they were recommended to call on the Premier. Shortly after, however, a Govern ment officer from the statistical office arrived, and, introducing himself to the men, took them to Perth. He said he was aware that the men were coming out, and that work, had been secured by the Government for them if they should care to accept it. The men came to Western Australia on very favorable conditions. They paid only £6 io., or half the fare, the other half being defrayed by the West Australian Government. The leader, Knudsen, had a letter from the Agent-General's office, stating that arrangements had been made with the Orient-Pacific line for them to secure tickets at half fare. The tickets, however, showed that th:e full fare had'been paid. The Federal immigration author ities appeared to' be somewhat sus picious, but as the men stated they had no written contract, they could not take any steps in regard to them. It is understood that more Danish and Swedish1 laborers of the same class are to be- sent out to Fremantle shortly.
