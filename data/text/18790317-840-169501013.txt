Its uniform character1 and power to euro the various affoitions of the lungs and thro it, have mide it known as a* reliable protootor against them. While adapted ? fco^ milder forms of disease and to young ' ohildren, it is at tho same time tho most effec tual remedy that can be given for incipient ? oon-umptiin and tho dangerous affections of the throit and luLgs. As a pr..vis;:n ngainst : sudden attacks of oboup, it should be kept out hand in every family, and, indocd as all are sometimes subject to colds and' c:ughs, all should be provided with this antidote for them.

THIS compound of the vegetable alteratives Sarsaparilla, Dock, Stillingi', and Man drake, with tbe' Iodines of Potasnium and Iron, makes a most effectual cure of a serins of com plaints whioh' are very prevalent and afflicting. It purifies the blood, purges out the lurking humours in the system, that, undermine health and settle into troublesome disorders E-uptions of the (kin aro the appearance' an the surface of humours that should be expelled from the blood.

A dressing whioh is at once agreeable healthy, and effectual for preserving the hair. It soon restores faded or grey hair, to its anginal colour, with the gloss and freshness of youth. Thia hair is thickened, falling hair ehecked, «cd baldness often, though not always oured by its use. Nothing can restore the hair where the fellioles are destroyed, or the glands atrophied and decayed ; but such as remain oan be saved by this application, and stimulated into activity, so that a new growth of hair is produced, instead ef fouling the hair with a pasty sediment, it will keep it clean and vigorous- Its occasional use will prevent the hair from turning grey or falling off, and consequently prevent baldness. The restoration of vitality it gives to the scalp - arrests and prevents the formation of dandrnlT, which is often so unoleinly and offensive. Free from those deleterious sub stances which make some preparations dangerous and injurious to tbe hair, the Vigour can only benefit, but not harm it If wanted merely for a HAlR DRESSING, nothing' else can bo fonnd so desirable. Containing neither oil nor dye, it Hoes not soil white cambric, nnd yet lasts long on the bair, giving it a rich,.' glossy lubtre, and a grateful perfume. ,J PREPARED BY DR. J. O.
