THE STATE 8UDCET. The Premier of Victoria, Mr Bent, delivered his budget speech in the House of Assembly on Tuesday. Mr Beot said he had been prevented from making bis budget statement earlier owing to the delay in regard to the Commonwealth estimates, which did not reach him until a few days before Sir John Forrest delivered his budget speech on 22ud August. BEVEKCE ASP EXPENDITURE. 1904-5. The first statement to which he would draw attention showed thai, excluding the railways, the total revenue tor the year was £3.900.537 In his budget of the 11th October, 1901, he estimated that tbi- revenue would reach i"3,7G9,370, but h_ bad the good fortune to receive £131,167 more tbau he estimated. The expendi ture for tbe year was £3,415,1S2, which, taken from tbe receipts. I"3,9u0,537, leaves a surplus, irrespective of the railways, of £485,355. Turning to our great trading department — the railways — the gross revenue for the year paid into the Treasury totalled £3,621,051. The esti mate of the Commissioners, a= given i-y him ou llib October, 1904, was £3.450,000 so he received £171,'.!51 in excess of esti mate. The estimate given by the Com missioners on lltb October last for work ing expenses, including bc?ated repairs, but exclusive of recoups, was £1,937.605 Tbe actual expenditure under that bead, including belated repairs, was £1,933 70 > or a saving on tbe estimates of £3897. Tbe fact that an excess of revenue of £171,051 was earned with a savin? of expenditure of £3897 spoke forcibly. Alter providing for fnll interest and expenses ou the loan moneys invested in our railways, tbe Railway Commissioners closed their financial year in the Treasury books with a surplus of £41,629. This was the surplus in the Treasurv books. suep£cs of £526,984. Dealing with the whole finances of the State, the surplus for tbe year was therefore £526.984 It was unnecessary or bini to remind the committee that Parliament, by the Surplus Uerentie Aot Xo. 1969, appropriated £50,117 of this amount, leaving a earn of £18.fl67as the Act specifies, in a fund to be dealt with as Parliament may hereafter direct.' Tbe items included in tfae Surplus ££evenue Act of 1905 wer» well known, And he could only say how pleased and proud he . was - a .Qlto upprovai with irhicn the p-i sB and people or this .State bad confirmed the action of Parliament in the disposal «">£ that surpius. REVENrS AKD EXPEMHTCUE, 1905-6 Referring to the current financial yea» 1905-6, they expected -a so plus on th« nr. couutfl, excluding the railways, of £68.424. «nd a deficiency on the railways of £56,187, leaving a credit balance on the year of £12,237. The chairman of the Vjmmissioners assured him that in esti mating a gross revenue this year of ;.3,500)00, in face, of the atnM receipt' of last year of £3,821,051, or £121.051 h ss. ibey had in anticipation should th pr-«s pects of tbe i arrest, stii I continue to h favorable, concessions in freights and far' s during the latter half nf the year, lhat would, #o some extent, account for the reduced estimate in thQ recpints. T Commissioners had informed him, in regard to the currmt fiwif veo mated lb t tbe revenue of the first six months of the current year will sho ' appreciable decrease as compared with th« corresponding period of th-» preceding ; year. If, however, the present pmsp- ot are fully rea ised, some of the redutin may be regained in the latter half of th- year. Arrangements had been made to construct, and have ready by tbe end if this month fifty additional shep trunk at a cost of £10.000. A. consierab e in crease was also anticipated Jo th r-»-ria ' of butter for export, and fify additional refrigerator tracks were in crns?. of con struction, and would be reidv by the end of the month. These would cost fi'S.Oftn- and 100 louvre- trucks wt1 alo under construction, at a cos nf £19,030, chaise- able to the Rolling Stock Keplacero Fund for this aod other perishable traffic. There were 23 41 DT) n engines under con struction, cosfcine £71 ,000, aod 10 of these should be available for traffic during the ensuing grain season. In the event, of a good harvest during the coming season, and other conditions remaining favorably it was tbe intention of the Commissioners, as he had said, to recommend lor the approval of the Government snme red tic tions in . the goods rates in ibe bivher classes and also to make some modifica tions in the goods clarifications to take effect .about- the 1st January next, and a tbe same time tb entiretv ahvgate the conditions applicable to mixed six-ton lots of eoods, which were operative in the nr.froductrve pcm.ic debt. Out of Ibe Slate's total public debt , of £51,763.767, there was invested in repro ductive -works the sum of £47.856,062 leaving the small amount of £3,907,705 used for works and pur-ose not directly .interest earning, such as State schools defence, the University, public offices, the Law Courts, and Parliament Houses In reproductive works, railways absorl- £39.457,391, and waterworks £7,784,584, whilst £614,087 .was distributed in tram ways, closer settlement, graving dock and m icing. \- Hie total interest on moneys invested in reproductive works was £1 ,750.953, of which £1,455,613 was charged to mx' earned by our railways, leaving £295.340 io.be met br . our other interest earning Investments- Interest due .on non-pro- doctivejoan works was £132,583. CLOSER SETTLEMENT AND IRRIGATION. The Government hid powers up to £500.000 per annum in - connection with closer settlement, bntasxegards irrigation tbe Government had available loan moneys on "30tu Jnne Jast only to the extent ef £5500. and authority to raise £56,253 more. The Minister for . Water Supply would require to draw largely on the loan moneys io carry oat the schemes in connection,. with, the main channels from Hie WarangaBssin to tbe Loddon sad subsidiary channels sad other works The Minister for Water Snnplv on 7th September last foreshadowed toe irriga tion poliey of ttnsXJovernment, and indi cated: tost an expenditure of some £250iW E aoar for, Cay,"«ix years would be required.. To enable this to bp done, toe Government .'proposed to eeek the requisite authority ,to jaise jocally the : sinonnts as -reqiured.- In fTeferenoe to to tor toonld tow be any lack of applications locally for such land, the Government wn"M prob ably consider the advisability of placing some of it at toe disposal in London of future immigrants from the old country. TheLandsPurchaseBoardhad commended to the serious consideration of the Minis ter that some provision for a homestead and "necessary fencing he made , in " the Closer .Settlement Act. to meet cases of! families possessed of furnitn-e, working plant and stock going into possession with- out the necessary capital for their erection. While they wanted immigrants of the right sort, they would hive to carefully scrutinise all schemes. Victoria was not rich enough to give away land broadcast. Besides, they had their own people to pro- ride for order the Closer Settlement Act. They could not expect io accommodate 137.000 immigrants in one year as Canada had done They had also to remember that the Dominion bad spent large sums in advertising systematically, cleverly, and snccessfully- Thyy also afforded every information aud assistance to immigrants. Circulars were circulated I -road fast set i he right people from tbe old country if the work were gone about properly on both sides. The Government had "carefully considered 'General" Booth's scheme, and did not propose to commit the State to any haphazard or hazardous methods of immigration. Under any circumstances, Parliament would be fully consulted on any proposals. The Cabinet had under consideration a bill providing for the establishing and con trolling of small improved holdings of land. This bill was chiefly founded on ibe Danish system, and under it probationary tenants _ would Teceive assistance, under supervision, until tbe land was sufficiently improved to enable the tenants to become s el f-supporting and obtain a lease. In conclusion Mr Bent said tkui lie liad tried to truthfully giro tbe proper financial condition of the State, and also endeavor to show to ontoide countries that if -we ask tor any more money we usa ample security to offer. He than moved that £705,139 be granted for the services of the year 1905 8. The resolution was agreed to, Ou the motion of Mr Prendergast toe de bate on the budget was adjourned for a week.
