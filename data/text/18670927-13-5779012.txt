COMMERCIAL SUMMARY FOR ENGLAND. The R.M.S.S. Bombay, G. C. Burne, commander, with the mails for Europe and the East, left her anchorage in the bay on the 28th ultimo, at two p.m. punctually. Commander Goss, R.N., was in charge of the mails. The Bombay passed through the Heads about five p.m. The overdue steam- ship Kaikoura, of the Panama line, which should have reached Sydney on the 29th ult., with the English mail of the 2nd of July, and cable dates from London to the 11th of that month, arrived at Sydney at a late hour on the 4th inst. The Melbourne portion of the mail was forwarded by the You Yangs, which reached here on the 8th. Captain Machin, of the Kaikoura, was complained against on his arrival in New Zealand' for having endangered the ship by misconduct on approaching Wellington Heads. His certificate was suspended. The P. and O. Company's R.M.S.S. Avoca, A. B. Farquhar, commander, arrived in Hobson's Bay early on the 11th inst., after a rapid passage from Galle. The mails from Europe and the East have been delivered this month, as in several months past, before contract time. STATE OF TRADE. The trade of the past month, influenced by exceptional causes of a temporary nature, shows a considerable improvement on its predecessor, but anything likely to relieve the monotony [and dulness which have had to be submitted to for many previous months, cannot but be hailed with some little degree of satisfaction. The changes contemplated in the spirit duties shortly to come in force, have at least the merit of having imparted a considerable amount of activity to this market during the last fortnight, and led to the disposal of some 53,000 cases of geneva, while brandy, both case and bulk, and likewise whiskey, have also benefited thereby, though not to so great an extent. The first j arrival of new season's teas, per the Hans, > created some excitement in this market. The entire cargo was offered for sale immediately on its arrival, and the greater portion has since been disposed of. The arrival of this vessel was speedily followed by that of the Tek Li and Ino. Transactions in sugars embrace those portions of the cargoes of the Mayotte et Nossi Be, the Mary Miller, the Denis, Hannah- Nicholson, Jules Borden, Pride of the West, and Stage. Opera- tions in tobacco and timber have not been of much account. Speculative attention has been directed towards salt, of which about 800 tons have changed hands. In rice we note the sale of the Tumby Candassamy's cargo of Patna (COO tons), also the Carl's cargo of Java rice (4,500 bags). In oils, some 15,000 cases of kerosene have changed hands. Malt has been dealt in to the extent of 17,000 bushels, colonial and imported. In bread stuffs we note a firmer market, though the business transacted has not been of much importance. The market very early in the month was cleared of Californian barley to the extent of 28,000 bushels, for malting purposes. The sales of candles aggregate some 10,000 boxes. On the 8th inst., the arrival of the mail steamer was telegraphed from Adelaide, with dates from London to 26th July by post, and by telegraph to 10th August. The gross value of the exports for the month end- ing July 15 shows a decline of £182,822, as follows Victoria, decrease, £196,836 ; Sydney, do., £98,140 ; New Zealand, do., £12,573; Queensland, on increase of £17,088 ; Adelaide, £44,065 ; Tasmania, £32,974. Advices from China to 23rd July report the departure of nine vessels for the colonies, with 3,000 000lb. of tea, while five more were loading. By the mail letters, via Panama, we are advised of shipments of oil to the extent of 53,000 cases. The tobacco coming forward amounts to 5,000 cases. . INSOLVENCIES. The failures during the month have been confined to the millers. The liabilities in any instance have not been extensive. Messrs. Thomas and Rush, millers, Flemington, with liabilities amounting to £8,000, assigned their estate to Mr. F. W. Prell. At a meeting of the creditors of Mr. J. H. Walker, Hour miller, Collingwood, held lately, the statement submitted showed trade liabilities amounting to £7, 26, and assets estimated to realise £5,674. An offer of 12s. 6d. per pound, payable over three months, was accepted, contingent on the statements submitted being found correct, to examine into which two of the creditors present were appointed. These were afterwards confirmed. A meeting of the creditors of Mr. Geo. Bencraft, miller, was held on the 18th inst. The statement of accounts submitted showed liabilities amounting to £5,400. of which £1,500 is secured ; the assets amount to £3,200. At the adjourned meeting, a resolution was adopted to assign the estate to Messrs. Priestly and Griffiths. The trustees have since disposed of the entire estate, at the rate of 12s. 6d. per pound. EXCHANGE AND MONEY. The rate of exchange for the present mail is firmly maintained at last month's rate, one percent, per annum. Notwithstanding a considerable amount of remonstrance from the outside public against the rates of discount still continued to be charged by the banks, we have no change to note in this respect seven, eight, and nine per cent, for bills at two, three, and four mouths' currency respectively, being the late still enforced. The interest allowed on deposits lodged at seven days' notice of withdrawal, is at the rate of three per cent., and on deposits lodged at three and six months' notice of withdrawal, the rates allowed are four and six per cent. WOOL. The season has not yet commenced. Shear- ing, however, has become general in all the Riverina districts, and the clip will be expected shortly to reach the stores of the brokers in Melbourne. A small portion has already come to hand. It is stated that there is a vast improvement in the quality and condition of this year's wool, as compared with former years. In the beginning of the month some 228 bales were offered for sale, the half of which found buyers. On the 24th instant an auction sale was held, at which 215 bales, consisting chiefly of scoured wools, were offered. There was a good attendance, and, judging from the prices which the greater portion of the lots realised, we have every reason to expect that satisfactory sales will be effected in this market during the approaching season. We quote greasy at 9d. to 10d. ; slipe, 12d. ; Scoured, 14d. to 23d. ; washed, 10d. STOCK AND STATIONS. The following the latest report from the interior regarding stock, is taken from the Riverine Herald-The extension of pastoral settlement to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the rapid occupation of a vast area of land there for sheep and cattle purposes, are matters for congratulation. The question of the day in Australia would seem to be-the best mode of adapting our surplus beef and mutton for exportation. We referred in our last to the freezing process in course of being tested in Sydney, under the joint labours of Mr. Mott and Mr. A. Morris. We are happy to state that additional evidence in favour of this splendid discovery has reached us. A company will soon be formed of large capitalists, and half-a-million sterling is expected to be raised. It will be a great day for Australia when the first shipload of our frozen meat arrives in England fit for use, and improved by being kept, as the meat does, according to the experiments made in Sydney. It will be hard, indeed, if with the many practical experiments now going on we should be compelled to render down into tallow our surplus beef and mutton, while millions of our fellow- countrymen in England are existing so precariously, and so many of them taste good meat at long intervals only. The stock, news from the northern settlements is on the whole favourable. The successful discoveries of gold in Queensland, at various places far away one from the other, have tended to give a little more life to stock transactions, at Rockhampton in particular ; still tens of thousands of splendid fat sheep are weekly rendered down in that country. After being driven several hundreds of miles to the melting, we observe that a lot of sheep melted down at 151. of tallow, barely worth 5s. What must have been the condition of these sheep when they left their pasturage ?" We have only to notice the sale of the Uabba Station, on the Lachlan, with 1,300 head of cattle, to Mr. John Kerr, for £18,000, usual terms. FREE TRADE ON THE MURRAY. "It appears," says the Riverine Herald, " that the system of perfect free trade across the River Murray does not work altogether smoothly, owing to the difference between the duty imposed on cigars, and opium by the tariff of this colony and that of New South Wales. We have heard of boxes of opium being sent by coach from Melbourne to Sydney, by which 10s. a pound duty is saved, and the revenue of the sister colony injured to that extent ; while, on the other hand, cigars are constantly taken out of bond on the Sydney side of the Murray at the low rate of duty current there, and brought into Victoria, by which clever trick 2s. a pound is saved." t . OUR TANNERIES. The tannery of Messrs. Michaelis and Hallenstein, at Footscray, which is perhaps the most complete establishment of the kind in the colony, has recently been made interesting by the erection of some new machinery not before known in the tanning process, which is the invention of Mr. nul- Bernstein. The firm have taken out a patent for the invention in this and three of the neighbouring colonies, and purpose seeking the same protection from imitation in Europe. The invention consists of a set of " agitators" for the tan pits. Under the ordinary system, the hides have to be frequently removed from the pits and replaced by hand during the tanning process an operation which en- tails an immense amount of labour, which it is the object of the new invention to supersede. The agitator is a wooden framework, resembling a grating, made just large enough to move up and down in the pits easily. From forty to fifty hides are suspended in rows from each of these frameworks, which are made to rise and fall alternately in the pits with a regular motion, communicated by steam machinery. Subjected to this operation, the hides become thoroughly saturated, the liquor being evenly distributed over their surface and no damage arises from creasing, or imperfect or irregular saturation; as the skins hang separately without touching. It is found that under the new process the leather turned out is very superior to that made in the old way, and by this simple and inexpensive machinery, work which formerly fourteen men were required to accomplish, is now done more satisfactorily by four. Where this apparatus is used, it is no longer necessary to withdraw the hides from the targets until they have remained the required time, and the liquor r can also be changed without the skins being interfered with. Messrs. Michaelis and Hallenstein are now using between 600 and 600 hides a week, and they already export leather in large quantities. The work-rooms are very conveniently arranged, and the establishment is fitted with the best appliances used in such manufactories. Not the least valuable of the implements in use seems to be a machine for splitting hides. The thick hides, formerly considered the least valuable, are submitted to the operation of this machine, and the portion split off, which would otherwise be come waste, makes good upper leather. The proprietors have entered into the establishment of this industry with great spirit, and it is satisfactory to know that their enterprise is likely to meet with its proper reward. MEAT BISCUITS. Mr. M'Cubbin, bolter, King-street, who supplied meat biscuits for the Burke and Wills Expedition, has sent us samples (which are very good of such biscuits, both plain and sugared, made by a new process, which he has patented. The matter is important at present, seeing how very large a number of sheep are likely to be boiled down this season for their fat alone. Mr. M 'Cubbin informs us that as he only requires the substance of the meat without the fat, he finds that he can, with a boiling-down establishment or a slaughtering company, make bread containing equal proportions of animal and bread stuffs, at a small cost over that of common cabin and navy bread. He has made samples that contained no less than six parts of meat to one of flour, and has favoured them with vegetables and spice necessary to make any kind of soup. He can also make this biscuit with such a proportion of meat as to keep for years. He invites the presence of gentlemen anxious to witness the process of making this useful description of biscuit. THE CROWN LANDS. We observe from a return laid before Parliament, that in the half-year ending 30th June last, 119,901 acres of land were proclaimed open for selection under the 12th clause of the Land Act of 1865. In the same period, 81,031 acres were taken up by selectors, and 3,475 acres were withdrawn. The rent paid was £4,093 3s. Of forfeited lands are proclaimed open in the same period, there were 222,340, and 57,556 acres were taken up, and 47,340 acres were withdrawn from selection, the original lessees having paid up the rent due. The amount received as rent was £2,890 3s. PASSAGE WARRANTS. From returns laid before the Legislative Council it appears that in 1860 the number of passage-warrant holders who arrived in this colony was 3,610, and that 584 immigrants came out entirely at the expense of the Government. The amount paid for these passage-warrant holders was £44,773 14s. 8d. The expense of bringing in those persons ran from £13 9s. 4d. to £13 12s. 10d. per head and that of the immigrants brought in solely at the expense of the Government was £13 14s. 10d. per head or £7,812 2s. 9d. in all. The gratuities paid to immigration officers amounted to £2,012 5s. The commissioners incurred expenses amounting to £1,487 8s. 6d. in the selection and incidental expenses connected with those they sent out and the expenses of the department in Melbourne and the outports were £2,588 6s. Id. Thus in 1860 immigration cost the colony £58,673 15s. 11d. The receipts of the Lands department in 1865 are shown by another return to have been £049,060 4s. 8d., after deducting the sums voted for the Lands and Survey department. Of that sum at least one- fourth should have been used for the purposes of immigration, according to the Land Act of 1892\. The amount spent last year was less than in any preceding year since 1862. The aggregate sum spent in immigration during the last five years was as follows On free immigration, £98,288 on assisted immigra- tion, £289,440 ; expenses connected there- with, £23,504. The amount of deposits received was £114,303, and the balance paid by the state was £296,929. RAILWAY RETURNS. The returns of the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay United Railway Company for the week ending September 19, show the total received for the week to be £1,523 12s 5d,, the receipts for the corresponding week of the previous year being £2,099 6s. 9d. The aggregate receipts from the 1st of July amounted to £24,947 13s. 2d., or a weekly average of £2,155 19s. 5d. ; the receipts for the same period of the year 1860 being £27,598 15s. 10d., or a weekly average of £2,355 19s. 11d. The revenue of the Victorian Railways for the month of August, 1867, is as follows: - Passengers, Parcels, Horses, for riages, Dogs, Goods and Live Stock, Total Revenue. Murray River Una.. Williamstown Uno.. Ballarat Uno.. G B. d. 8550 0 10 1070 1 0 7088 11 S £ s. d. 10343 on 1005 7 2 2384 0 1 & b. d. 24902 7 9 2705 8 11 14470 0 0 Totals 16717 14 0 25420 3 2 42137 17 2 Williamstown line, 40,080; Ballarat Uno, 12,724; total, 68.98. From an official return it appears that the traffic of the Government railways is sharing the general decline of trade. The total revenue during the week ending on the 29th ult. was £9,16411s. 9d., as against £10,468 2s. 8d. in the corresponding week of last year. The aggregate for the year to date is £340,993 8s. 8d., as against £361,488 9s. 3d., and the weekly average is only £9,883 17s. 4d., as against £10,56417s. 7d. for the same period of 1860\. The number of miles open in the two periods was the same. The revenue of the Murray line for the week was £5,525 2s. 4d. of the Ballarat line, £2,866 83. lid. and of the Williamstown line, £773 0s. 6d. The items of the income of the last-named line are worth quoting Passengers, £196 12s. 10d. ; parcels, 27s. 9d. ; horses, carriages, and dogs, 4s. ; goods and minerals, £572 5s. 11d. and cattle, £1.

The Argus Office, Thursday Evening. in the trade of the month just closed, though signs have not been wanting indicative of an improvement, considerable dissatisfaction has been felt that the opening of the spring trade should be so far behind what it ought to be. The monotony of previous months has, however, been greatly relieved during the present by the impetus which the near approach of the period (1st October), when the alteration in the spirit duties is to take effect, has imparted to this trade. The arrival of the Bombay with the English mails for July has had no perceptible effect upon business generally, which, with the exception already referred to, has evinced no activity or animation. Bulk ales have been Moved off for trade purposes only. Bottled ales have not met with more inquiry. Bottled stout do not show any improvement. In Dundee goods, cornsacks have slightly advanced ; woolpacks, on the other hand, continue to disappoint the views of holders. Candles have been well supported. In cements, Portland has been very steady, but American plaster has receded from the extreme rates quoted last month. Coffee has steadily man tanned late quotations. The market for fish has been very unsettled. Fruits have not been much dealt in. In breadstuffs, flour has shown more firmness All feeding grains have declined in value. Malt has attracted little notice comparatively. Metals, with the exception of hoop-iron and American hardware, have been slow of sale, and difficult to quit. In oils, kerosene has met with a fair amount of attention ; other descriptions have not been quite so firm as might be wished. Provisions and quicksilver have been dull and listless. There has been a good deal of animation! in rice, though little business has transpired, owing to the stiffness of holders. Salt, at the close of of the month, attracted speculative notice. Sugar has commanded considerable attention. The market for tea has been enlivened by the arrival of the first cargoes of the new season's. Timber, as likewise tobacco, pre- sented an unsatisfactory aspect. There has been little done in wines, but spirits brandy and geneva- have been largely operated in. Ale and Stout The market has not been characterised by much activity, but though large parcels have not been got rid of, nor any speculative feeling been evinced in the market, a very steady trade inquiry has been experienced, and the stocks hold not being inconveniently large, last month's quotations have been maintained throughout the present month. Shipments to hand of Bass's No, 4 alo have been cleared off at £8 Ss. ; No. 3 ale has been neglected ; small lots, however, have been quitted at £8. Jones's she has gone steadily into the hands of the trade at £8 6s. to 58 7s. 6d. Marrlau's has been quitted in trade parcels at £0 5s., and larger quantities have been taken up at a slight concession on thin figure. The Carlisle Company's has met with favour to a fair extent at £8, the price at which most sales have been effected. The Trent Brewery Company's also has been disposed of at £7 10s. For Scotch brandy we quote £0 10s. ; the sales reported have however, been of very trifling 'extent. Extremely little business has been transacted in bulk stout, so little as to make it appear not worth the trouble and expense bestowed upon its importation and disposal. The Artillery Brewery Company's is held for forms. for small, and £6 10s. for large lots. Small parcels of the Lion Brewery Company's have been placed at £0 5s. Sales of the old brew of this brand have also been made at £4 By., £4 10s. Whitbread's old brow has likewise been quitted at £4 to £4 6s. The market has been rather barely supplied with good brands of bottled ales, and such as have come forward have met with a ready sale. Shipments of Tennant's, on arrival, have eagerly been purchased at 10s. for quarts and 9s. 6d. for pints. A parcel of COO casks was distributed amongst the trade about ten days ago, and one now landing is in course of being sold at our quotations. Foster's ale is rising into notice, and realises 9s. 9d. Bass's triangle is wanted, and sales can be effected at 9s. 11d. to 6s. 3d. Blood's also, in fine condition, is sale able at Os. 3d., and Arrol's has been quitted at 9s. to 0s. led. ; their's is quoted at 8s. 6d. to 0s. Sales of Aitken's have been made at 8s. 6d. to 8s. 6d. For any parcels of Jeffrey's offered of late 8s. 6d. to 0s. has been obtained. A considerable line of Thomas John's has been sold at 8s. 6d., and the market at this moment is entirely cleared of this brand. A ship- ment of an outside mark has changed hands at 8s. Bottled stories have not attracted much notice. The weather, however, has been sufficiently backward and changeable to check any speculative inquiry that might arise on the opening of a new season. Of the favourite brands supplies have not been ample, i Edmonds' pig brand has only been offering at the close for the first than during the month ; we note sales at 10s. Guinness's, Burke's bottling, has been disposed of at 10s. Hackle and Gladstone's has been held firmly at 0s. 6d. no sales have come under our notice. For Blood's we quote 6s. 6d., though we understand that considerable parcels have been quitted In bond for shipment, at least 3d. under this quotation. The Artillery Brewery Company's has been sold at 9s. 3d. Mochen's has been in fair request at 6s. 3d. Dunphy's has found purchasers at 5s. The Imperial stout has been disposed of at 8s. 6d., and considerable parcels have been placed also! on terms withheld. For Borthwick's stout we quote 8s. 6d., though for entire shipments 8s. 6d. has been accepted. Brass's has ruled at 8sec 8s. 3d. Bagging. We note a slight improvement in corn sacks, which, after reporting sales at 11s, 7d., have somewhat improved again ; a few small parcels have since been disposed of at 12s. ; the demand, however, is trifling. Woolpacks have also been neglected,; holders who could have disposed of their stock some months ago at 4s. 4d. to 4s. 6d. would now be only too glad to have the opportunity of clearing out at 4s. 11d., or even at 4s. Boots and Shoes have been disposed of to a large extent. Besides any parcels quitted privately, some 1,780 packages have been got rid of at the weekly public sales. On the 11th, 700 packages. Included in the above, were offered under the hammer, and this sale having attracted the attendance of buyers from town, country, and the adjacent colonies, the bidding was spirited throughout, and the prices realised satisfactory, being as follows Men's calf, elastic sides, brought 10s. to 13s. (6d. ; de-, kid, do., 18s. 6d. to 10s. ; do. wellingtons, 10s. 3d. to 16s.; do. bluchers, 6s. 2d. toOs. 6d.; do. carpet slippers. Is. Id.; do. sealskin do., 2s. 6d.; women's kid, elastic sides, military heels, 7s. 6d. to 6s. 3d.; do. cashmere, do., 6s. to 7s. 9d.; do. lastingly to 9s. 9d.;boys' . call, elastic sides, 8s. to 9s. i Gd.; youths'A. wellingtons, 9s. 6d. to 10s. 6d.; children's balmoral?, 2s. 10d. to 3s,; do. strap shoes, Is. 11d. to 2s. 7d. Leatherware kip, Candles. The market has been well sustained some holders effected sales of Brandon's at 10½d, on the arrival of the mail ; but after these lots were cleared off, no sellers could be found under lid which figure the dealers have been as yet content to pay for small lots. Goods and' secondary brands have been placed at 10d. to 10d. The quantity advised as on the -way 260 tons was the means of checking; business for a short time, until became known that of this quantity fully one-half was for the Nova Company, and that of the remainder the greater portion had already arrived. The market then became more steady, and some 10,000 boxes altogether In clusive of faulty lots quitted at 10d to load., have been disposed of. The Nova Company's price of 12s we believe, is still unaltered. * Cement. Prices of Portland have been supported with great steadiness. The stoppage of the public works, as may naturally be supposed, impedes our ness, and affects the market somewhat ; nevertheless the demand experienced is capable of absorbing all supplies coming- forward, and every shipment which has arrived has met with a ready sale at 18s. to 93 for best brands. About 1250 barrels on the spot have been disposed of, and some 1,200 barrels, to arrive likewise found buyers. The extreme rates ruling for American plaster have gradually (given way as supplies came to hand more freely in the beginning of the month 103 barrels red lead, of South American realised 30s. 6d. to 33s. and subsequently loo barrels same brand were quitted at 20s. to 32s.; the latter was realised for Bound, and prices have, for the present at least, settled down at 20s. 6d. s Chemicals.- No animation has been exhibited business has been confined to supply ing the more immediate wants of the trade, and supply and demand have kept pretty well on a par. No change in prices is perceptible; a slight tendency to lower rates, however, has been evinced. Soda crystals have been quitted at £10 10s. Carbonate of ROMa, has ruled at 27s. to 28s., but there has been very little inquiry. Caustic soda has been disposed of at £26, though there are many holders at £20 Flower of sulphur is nominally quoted at 18s' 6d. to 10s. ; there have been no sales worth referring to. Cream of tartar has realised 1s. 2d. to is. 2d. Tartaric acid has been dealt in at 1s. 10d. to 2s. Pre- served opium, after touching 23s., has firmed again and notwithstanding a rather considerable shipment by the mail steamer, sales continue to be effected at 24s. Chicory A very quiet market, with little doing. Our quotations of last month of 3d. to 3d, for best brands in bond have undergone no alteration. Coffee-Thora is no stock held outside the trade and the market is, in consequence, characterised by a total absence of or indication of any speculative feeling. Nevertheless, a fair trade demand continues to be ex'. perienced, In addition to occasional orders from the neighbouring colonies as those got bare of stock. Sales of Plantation No. 1 have been effected at tOld. from which figure there is no appearance of the market receding. A few parcels, out of condition have been quitted at Old. but this has had no influence on the value of sound. Java, good to fair samples, realises SJd. to 6d. The stock of this description is light, and the arrival of two vessels this week from the island named has not been followed by any addition thereto. For native of a quality similar to quote 8d. s" Cunfectloncry.-Assorted confections have been moved off In moderate parcels at 10d. for Kolller's duty paid and sales In bond have also been effected at Old. For Wotherspoon's, duty paid, we quote lOd. Jujubes are disposed of at 18. 2d. to 1s. 3d. Candied peel is quitted at 10d. to 10d. for orange and lemon. There -are sellers of citron at 12d. ; most holders, however, ask 12d. y Cordage The demand for even Victorian cordage has very much Blackened this month. We continue to quote 740. for half-inch size, 7d. for three quarter inch, and for assortments of one inch and over £68 is realised. For flat rope there is no inquiry. Bolt rope is held for £65, but we have not heard of sales for some time past. Europe tarred rope is held at £45, but to effect sales as low as £35 to £30 has been taken. Bengal lines are disposed of at £32. Seaming twine meet with a fair demand at 1s. to 1s. Iceland Is. land, at all of which prices sales have come under our notice. , Fire-The market is still in a most unsatisfactory condition. There are, however, some slight indications v of an improvement. We note sales of Ung at 4d. Half-barrels white herrings are quoted at 27s., though when pressed on the market through the auction mart, 22s. 6d. has been accepted for firkins we quote 0s. Red herrings in tins have been disposed of at 20s. lib. fresh herrings are quitted at 7s. 6d., 8s., and 8s. 3d. The prices realised for lib. salmon have ranged from 14s. to 16s. by auction, and he solos 6d. to 16s. privately; 2lb. salmon has been quitted at 20s. Sardines have been largely sold, and prices, which ruled at 7s. 6d. and 4s. 9d. for halves and quarters respectively, were run up by the close of the month to 8s. 6d. to 8s. 3d., and 5s. 11d. to 5s. 3d., though at auction sales are still effected at 7s. 6d. and 4s. 11d. Paddocks have been sold at 10s. No demand has yet sprung up for lobsters or oysters; we quote for the former 0s. 6d. to 6s. 6d., and for the latter 8s. Fruits. But a moderate trade has been done in currants, which have been disposed of for trade purposes at prices rising according to quality, from 334. to 4d. for best samples who at present quote 3}d.to4d. Raisins have not attracted much notice, holders having for- some time past made a stand against the very low figures offered by buyers, and the market has in consequence been be noted thereby. A shipment of 3,600 boxes muscatels was quitted early in the month at 8d. to Old., since which prices have remained, steady. Eleme raisins, which at one time touched 5d., were at same time placed at 5d. ; of late, however, there have been no sellers under 6d. Cape raising have risen from 5d. to 6d., at which latter figure some rather large parcels have been taken up for shipment. Sultana raisins have been firm at 7d. to 7d. French plums have been sold at Is. Sad. Valencia almonds have been quitted at Is. it. Period apples have readily realised Od. Figs are saleable according to packages at 7d. to 8d. Furniture invoices of American chairs, ex South America, Julie Ann, and KolJIo Chapin, were placed at the following prices Ladles' anning oak realised 90s. per dozen ; spindle Grecian, 00s. do. ; Astor do., 00s. do. ; Bal do., 72s. do. ; Davis do., OOs. do. ; Bay State office Is. do. ; bar-room, 30s. do. ; come-back rockers, 240a, do. ; nurse do., 160. do. ; spindle back do., 2585. do. ; do. nurse, 102s. do. ; brace orm, 105s. do. ; Franklin, 218s. do. ; Douglas arm, 8s. do. ; floral wood, 32s. do ; wood-seat olUce, 72s. do. ; children's, 8-6. to 67s. do. ; washstands, OSs. do. ; dining tables, 3ft. and 4ft., 28s. to 34s. do. ; oak union 848, do. ; Washington cane rockers, 205s. do. ; Washington cane, 48s. do.; extra -wood, 33s. do. Also, ox Wimmera, Invoice of Brown's patent furniture, at fair rates. Flour and Grain The market has shown a decided tendency towards an improvement ; the chief demand, however, has been for export, though even in this respect great caution has been exhibited, notwithstanding the very satisfactory accounts to hand of shipments which have already gone forward, but, with an increasing desire to operate. the chief difficulty encountered by exporters has been the paucity of suitable and bandy ships-if such had readily been met with a great deal more would doubtless have gone, forward. The Sarah O rice takes over 600 tons of wheat and flour, and after the arrival of the Bombay, the Runnymede was taken up at 57s. per ton to load in Adelaide. Exports from that colony have gone up very steadily, the aggregate for the last four weeks being 2,800 tons flour, and 03,000 bushels wheat. The value of Victorian flour, after the price dropped to £10 12s. 6d. when pressed on the market, recovered, and sales for the last ten days have not been made under £11 to £11 5s. for parcels, and £11 10s. for small lots, at which, however, not more than a few hundred tons have changed hands. Ade- lade flour in bond has been placed at £12 to £12 10s. nndTahuianlan athlete £101 0s., also in bond. Wheat has ruled at 4s. 8d. to 4s. 9d. for Victorian, but only a tuning business has been done for Adelaide wheat we quote 5s. Early in the month all the Californian barley in the market, to the extent of 28,000 bushels, for- malting purposes was cleared off the market at about 3s, 3d and this description, were any offering, would still And buyers at quotations, though feeding sorts have during the interval declined to -u. 6d. to 2s. 7d. for Victorian. A considerable reduction has also had to be submitted to in oats, prices having fallen to 2s. 9d. to 2s. 6d. for colonial. Of late, somewhat better prices have been realised for Tasmanian-say 2s. 8d. to 2s. 6d., at about which rates offers for large quantities have been made. Californian oats have been sold as low as 2s. Maize, after dropping to 2s. 3d. for faulty and 2s. 6d. to 2s. 10d. for sound, has evinced a greater degree of firmness, and quotations are now steady at 3s. to 3s. 2d. Bran has been operated in to some extent at 102\. Colonial Oatmeal has declined to £20 for best . town make ; country made has been sold by auction at £18 to £10. Colonial peel 1 barley realises £20, and imported has been quitted at £25. ' Split peas have been placed at £17 10s. Gunpowder Blasting powder remains in the same listless condition as noted last month, the continued favourable advices not having in the slightest affected the market, owing to the heavy stocks held. There, have been almost no transactions worth referring to Hall's, however, is rather scarce, and we understand, holders have succeeded in making sales of this brand, at 6d. For Names we quote 6d. for ordinary brands 4d. is asked, but to effect sales 4d. would unhesitatingly be accepted. We know of sales at this, figure. Hops. Advices by the mail have tended to stiffen the market considerably, and, notwithstanding that the trade demand is trifling, a large advance in prices is sought to be established. Sales of Tasmanian have been made at 2s. 6d., and, as the month closes, the only holder of this description refuses to name a price. Sales of Kent 1800 have been made at 2s. 6d. and up to 2s. 8d. for best samples; ordinary qualities have been placed at 2s. 3d. ; 1805 have been quitted at.. 9d. to 2s. Mail-The changeable loss of the weather has offec- - tually checked any operations, and as importa- tions . now held cost fully 10s. 6d. to 11s., no inducement could possibly be given to speculators,,, and the market has, in consequence, maintained an unsatisfactory aspect. Holders of tank malt have throughout the month refused to soil under Os. Bag. malt, however, has been offer big nt 8s. 6d. ; wherefore one bin of 2,000 bushels, sold this week, 8s. 6d. was realised, exhibiting thus a slight improvement, at, the low price at which colonial can be supplied, 6s. per bushel, this description effectually checks any speculative mo-, orient. Colonial-made, from Chevalier barley, commands 7s. 6d. to 8s. Sales of imported and colonial for the month aggregate about 17,000 bushels. * " "? - Metals. Trade in this market has been far from lively, nor can we report any improvement in its. general tone, Pig iron has been without any sales to report beyond the ten and twenty ton parcels taken up by the foundries, and prices have remained steady at 45s. to £4 17s. 6d. Galvanised iron has been very dull of sale. Scotch, 26 and 28 gauges, has been disposed of at £20 and £23 10s. to £29 respectively. English, ordinary brands, have of late met with more inquiry, such as it is, though to affect sales very low figures have had to be taken. One shipment of thirty tons of Tupper's, 24 and 26 gauges, half and half, was quitted at £27 10s., duty paid. A shipment of 26 and 28 gauges was placed at £27 10s. in bond. A small parcel of 24 gauge was sold at £25 in bond. Of the finer brands of English, Morewood's realises 82 to £84 for 20guage. The demand for- bar and rod iron is well maintained, and sales continue to be effected at £0 to £10 10s., according to brand. Plate iron is dull of sale for sizes of 3-10in. to half-inch we quote £12 to £13. Sheet iron is in short supply, and sales can be effected of parcels that in ordinary times would not be looked at for assort- ments of 0 to 18 we quote £12, while for assortments of 18 to 20 £18 can be obtained. Hoop iron has been more wanted, and sales have been made at £14. There is a better inquiry for fencing wire, drawn, at £16,, 8617, £18, and £19 for Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9. A line of forty tons Ryland's No. 8 realised £20. Boiled wires quite. neglected, and prices remain nominal at £11, £12, and £13 for Nos. 4, 5, and 0 lead has been disposed of at £20 16s. for shoot, but as there are no sellers now under £27 10s., no sales can be effected. Shot Is placed at £20. Tin plates have met with a good demand at declining rates ; from 38s. to 40s. for t.O. coke 42s. to 44s. for 1.0. char- coal and 44s. to 48s. for IX. Prices have dropped several shillings per box, the latest sales effected being at thirty-five to forty percent, advance for spot parcels, while shipments to arrive have been sold at thirty per cent, advance on invoice Ewbank's nails have been disposed of at seven and a half to ton per cent, off list. American nails, good assort- ments, command 28s. For American hardware very full figures are obtained. Collins' and Sharpe's heavy axes have been sold at 34s. An Invoice of Sharpe's, sold as damaged, brought 72s. Collins's heavy picks are quoted 60s. Ames's shovels are somewhat easier, latest sales being at 08s. to 03s. Day's D. R. shovels and other makers, 24in. to 36in., find buyers at 40s. to 50s. Holloware Good assortments have been moved off freely at twenty-five per cent., to thirty per cent off, and the market is now barely supplied. Oilskin kerosene oil a large business has been done ; latterly, however, the principal sales effected have been of damaged parcels disposed of under the hammer. In the beginning of the month Downer's was quitted at 2s. 2d., Cozzens's at 2s. 11d., and pbotellto at 2s. ; towards the close Downer's dropped to 2s. 1d., Coizcns's to 2s., and the police to 1s. 11d. to 2s. Besides the ordinary demand, sales In parcels to the extent of about 15,000 cases have come under our notice. Late advices from New York,, reporting 52,000 cases as on the way to the colonies for the half month ending 14th July, have had a depressing effect on the market. Linseed is a trifle lower; we quote for drum 4s. 6d., and for cask oil 4s. 4d. Sales of colza in drums have been made at 6s. 3d. ; holders of bulk ask 4s. 10d. Olive is in slow sale at 6s. 6d. and 6s., for drum and bulk respectively. Chinese has advanced to 5s., at which it is firm. Polar oil has been sold at the improved rate of £50. Oilmen's Stores have been in good request, but though the market is far from Doing abundantly supplied, many of the items coming under the heading of stores can barely be brought out without loss. Common brands of pickles have been quitted at prices rising from 6s. to 6s. 3d. and 6s. 6d. ; medium brands realise 8s. 6d. ; while up to 6s. 6d. to 10s. is obtained for Crosse and Blackwell's. Bottled fruits have been disposed of at 8s. 3d. to 0s. for assorted, and up to 10s. 6d. to 11s. for black currants, lib. English Jams have been sold, according to brands, at 8s. to 9s., best and favourite brands realising 9s. 9d. Salad oils, In quarts, have been placed at prices ranging from 21s. to 24s. 6d. ports have brought 10s. 6d. to 11s. 6d. ; half-pints have been quitted at from 6s. 3d. to 7s. 6d. Forcing < oils, quarts, pints, and half-pints, have found a market at 5s. 4d. to 10s. Castor oil, in pints, has brought 8n. 434., while half-pints have been moved steadily off at 5s. 6d. to 3s. 10d. Hair oil, assorted sizes, has been sold at 4s. to 5s. 6d. Cocoa has been placed at 18. 23d. Gelatine has been purchased at 4s. 6d. to 11s. 6d. per dozen. Sauces are dis poscdofnl5s.to8s. Capers realise 7s. to 7s. 6d. Colman's mustard, in 7lb. tins, brings 8d a lb. tins command 11s. 3d., and half-pounds are saleable at 7s. 3d. White starch is quitted at 8d. to finer. ; blue starch is more wanted at 4d. to 4d. For thumb blue 10d. Is required. Sago is now readily disposed of at 3d, Vermicelli and Macaroni are valued at 8d. White pepper, ck the St. Aubin, brought 11d., but for the shipment ex- Carl, sold this week, Old had to be accepted. Black pepper has been sold at 3d. to 4d. Provisions The market has been noted for extreme dulnesS. For hams and bacon there is no local demand whatever, and holders being dependent for a market on the slight demand which has been experienced from New Zealand, there has naturally been no appearance of activity. We quote for best brands of hams, duty paid, 14d. to 15d., and 18d. to 14d for bacon ; entire shipments, however, could not be quitted at within 3d. to rid. of these figures. Cheese, in like manner, . does not attract much notice. Trade sales are effected at 14d. to 16d. Quicksilver There has been nothing doing In this metal with the exception of a few trifling parcels for trade purposes, quitted at 2s. 2d. No sales have been recorded. Green-On the departure of the mail speculative attention was directed towards this market, which resulted in the sale of the entire cargo of Patna per ' Tamby Candassamy, about 600 tons, changing hands almost in one line; and the stock becoming once more centered with one firm, Inquiry was stimulated, and some 200 tons, In fifty ton parcels, were afterwards resold ; willie some eighty tons, In small lots, were also quitted at prices rising to £25 10s. and £20. Since then, however, Calcutta advices induced holders to raise their demands still higher, £27 being required, and this has been the means of checking business altogether for the present, but as the trade are known to be without stack of any kind, holders are not apprehensive on this score. The shipment of Java rice per Carl, amounting to 4,660 bags, was offered by public sale on the 24th, along with the small parcel per Vyf Vriendcn ; the former, a very superior sample was disposed of at £25 6s., the latter was withdrawn at £2210. Salt The market has been quiet but steady, and, owing to the want of supplies, speculative action ? could not take effect. In the earlier part of the month, about 200 tons ex Lightning and other ships . changed hands, at £4 for coarse and £4 10s. for fine, and one or two small parcels to arrive were also disposed of about the same time. Yesterday, however, more boldness was shown in operating, purchases being made of all the coarse and fine, Including recent arrivals per Tornado and Bavolaw, and holders now refuse to sell under £4 10s. for coarse and £5 for fine. Soft Goods Business In this branch has been tolerably good during the month, although probably not equal in amount to previous years In September much more satisfactory than it has been for some time past, the diminished imports having given a more healthy tone to the market, and tended to keep prices firm, besides removing the necessity for taking great risks in regard to credit. During the early part of the month many of the retail dealers operated freely in Bunimor goods, when it became apparent that the supply in some descriptions would not be in excess of the demand. Dress materials, fancy prints, and white ground printed flannels are In good demand, also plain piecegoods, grey calicoes, whitcshirtings, and flannels. ltCDily-inado clothing Is rather in excess of the demand, and does not sell so readily as was expected, more clothing being made up by the retail dealers. The advices by the mail had little effect on the market, notwithstanding the slight fall in prices at home, as it is thought the shipments will merely be bullicicntfor the requirements of the trade. Sugar A considerable amount of business has been transacted in this market. This week the Stag and the Frances Milly, with the first cargo of the new season's sugars, made their appearance The following are the sales of the month On the 20th. alt., some 0,200 bags were placed with the trade, at an advance of 20s. on counters and yellow crystals at 25s. to 25s. (k1, was obtained for rations, 30. to 31s. 6d. for good to medium counters, 33s. to 34s. for middling yellow crystals, and 31s. 6d. to 36s. 3d. for middling white crystals. The following week an extensive trade was done, and though a reduction of 30s. was submitted to at the sale of Mauritius, yet, considering the quantity offered at one time, so small a decline was in favour of the market rather than otherwise, and it is not surprising that, as was found to be the case, greater firmness was afterwards evinced. On Wednesday, the 4th inst., the Bourbon sugars ex Mayotte or possess, 6,700 bags, offered at auction, met with a brisk demand, at an improvement of 26s. over previous sales of a like character. Rations realised £20 6s. to £20 10s. ; medium rations sold at £21 to £24 10s. a good rations brought £20 5s. ; browns sold at £29 10s. ; yellow counters were quitted at £32; and yellow crystals found buyers at £34 10s. to £35 15s. On the succeeding day, the sale of Mauritius sugars ex Mary Miller and Denis attracted a large attendance, and notwithstanding the extent of the sale 10,000 bags the whole was disposed of. The reduction submitted to did not exceed 30s. per ton. Medium counters to food and Ann realised 34s. to 34s. 6d. to 32s. 3d. to 3s. ; middling yellow crystals brought 32s. 6d. to 33s. ; low middling white crystals were quitted at 32s. 6d. to 38s. ; middling white crystals sold at 34s. 6d. to 35s and good to fine white crystals at 30s. to 38s. Sales of crushed loaf, sugar are mentioned at £44. In the week ending the 10th the market was again rather extensively operated in. On Monday the 11th, the entire cargo of Mauritius sugars ex Hannah Nicholson, 4,747 bags, was offered by public sale, and some 3,802 bags found buyers at prices which established an advance of 20s. on last sales rates. Rations brought 25s. to 20s. ; browns, 20s. 6d. ; medium . counters, 30s.; and grey and middling crystals, 33s. 6d. On the 15th, about 0,700 bags of Bourbon sorts, comprising the cargo of the Jules Bowden, were offered under the hammer, and some 3,679 bags were placed, low rations brought 20s. 3d., 21s. 6d., and good rations, 21s. to 62s. ; brown realised 27s. 6d. ; yellow counters sold at 32s. 3d. ; yellow crystals at 34s. 36s. to 37s. 6d, ; grey crystals brought 35s. 6d. The Mary Miller's damaged portion of Mauritius sugars, to the extent of 1,200 bags, was likewise quitted at satisfactory prices, condition considered, last week, the cargo of the Pride of the West, comprising 0,040 bags, found buyers to the extent of 5,700 bogs ; the holders, however, had to submit to a slight decline to meet the views of the trade, Browns realised 30s. to 34s. ; yellow crystals, 33s. and white crystals, 37s. 3d. Privately, fine white crystals were placed at £30. This week, on the 24th, some 2,700 hogs Jay a sugars, ex Garland Vyf Vriondon, realised £82 10s. to £34 5s. for j chow and grey crystals, and £10 6s. to £21 for rations. Yesterday, the Stag's cargo of new Mauritius sugars was offered by public sale ; but out of the 5,050 bags offered only 2,800 found buyers at prices the turn easier. Rations sold at 25s. ; low counters brought 28s. 3d., and medium to good counters realised 30s. to 31s., yellow crystals were placed at 33s. to 33s. 6d.; and white crystals at 35s. 3d. to 37s. Tea. Messrs. J. Curie Robertson and Co. report on this staple as follows :-" The month which ushers in the first of the new season's crop must of necessity be interesting. Every importer whose vessel had left China in anything like the first week's sailings felt confident his vessel would be the first arrival tho v ish being father to the thought. The Hans, however, although least expected, came in first, and no time was lists placing her cargo on the market, the principal portion of which was disposed of prior to any other arrival being telegraphed. About five days afterwards the Tickets come to hand, and the impetuosity of the market subsided, more particularly when the Fromm arrived at Sydney three days later, and the Ino arrived at this port four days later. The principal feature of the month has been the clearing out of old stock to provide for the new, and in most cases lower rates have been submitted to. The new teas, however, have come to a very good market, as prices have been on the whole well maintained, and stocks not by any means large. Foo-chow dust and sittings The market is bare of, but for leafy kinds of ordinary congou 1s. to 1s. 6d. Is yet obtainable. Mixed leaf kinds have been selling In tradeparcolsatfrom Is. 10d. to 2s. 3d., but same with little flavour has met with buyers at is. 4d. to 1s. 6d. ; blackish and brownish leaf kinds, Is. Old. to 1s. 8d., andante with strength and flavour as high as 4s. 8d. to 1s. Od. ; second-class Kalsows have been in good request, and being not over plentiful have fetched full prices, Is. 6d. to 2s. having been obtained. First-class Kalsows have been in good favour, and full prices realised the taste of the con- sumer being gradually improved, as high as 3s. per pound, in bond, having been given for some of the new season's congous. Souchong. We have nothing in stock, as Importers have found to their cost that general trade do not appreciate this description. Scented orange pekoe has been going quietly into consumption at rather easier rates and caper is now almost forgotten, so little demand exists for' it Green, teas - of, all - kinds. - with the exception of gunpowder and imperial to a very limited extent, are now out of date, and belong to the history of the post. Small sales have, however, been made at our quotations; Auction Sales On the 4th September, 1,100 chests and half-chests were offered, and upwards of OOO packages disposed of, at from 4s, 3d. to 1s. 5d. per lb., in bond; this was a slight concession on market prices. On the 12th September, the cargo of the Hans was offered, and the auctioneers succeeded in placing by tender 050 chests, 2,291 half chests, and 1,850 boxes, at prices not publicly exposed, but which we know to be very irregular some of the chops being sold at a difference of at least 3d. per lb. on equal quality ; but taking the cargo as a whole, very good prices were obtained, in justice we are bound to say that this was in a great measure attributable to the masterly manner in which the cargo was handled. The arrivals during the month have been On the 11th September, the Hans, from Foo-chow-foo, with 303,7001b. tea; passage, seventy days. On the 10th, the Tekapo, from Foo-chow-foo, with 382,6001b. tea ; passage, seventy-three days. On the 23rd, the Ino, from Foo-chow-foo, with 373 500. tea ; passage, eighty days. And at Sydney On the 18th, the Fromm, from Foo-chow-foo, with 212,0001b. ten; passage, seventy-one days. The deliveries for the past month have been 605, 100lb., against 29,56 21b. at same time last year. The stock in bond in Melbourne is 1,001,2701b., against 2,020,07Olb. at same time last year.

Trade in the yards is also exceedingly quiet. Deals are held for 4d. for 0 x 3 ; little, however, can be done at this quotation. The month's sales have chiefly consisted of lumber, and are as follows :-On Monday, the 26th ult., there was sold, ex Moira, S0, 73ft., Ox, T. and G. white Scotch flooring-, at 11s. 6d. per 100ft. lineal a short lengths of do. brought 10s. 6d. do. ; 46,060ft., 66 x 3, do., 0s. 6d. to 7s. do. ; 109 384ft., 0 x lar, do., 12s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. do. ; 180 000ft. 4-out white weatherboards sold at 7s. 3d. to 7s. 6d. do. and yesterday the lumber ex South American, being offered, all faults-218,630ft. white pine shelving realised £6 10s. to £10 2s. 6d. per thousand ; 115,8b9jt. white pine, T. and G., £9 7s. 6d. do. ; 2000ft. lin. to 4in. clear pine, £14 7s. 6d. to £15 5s. do. ; 274 pieces, 11 x 3 and 993 spruce deals, 3 16-10d. to 6 7-10d. per foot; 190,000 4ft. 6in. spruce laths, 34s. 6d. and 35s. per thousand ; 2,820 6ft. do. pickets, £7 16s. per thousand at the same sale, the cedar ex Swordfish, consisting of 100 logs was disposed of at 12s. to 21s. 6d. per hundred feet ; cedar boards and scantling brought 21s. 3d. do.

The cedar ox book-out, realised 10s. 6d. to 16s. and the cargo of cedar ex Eliza Blanche was sold at 14s. 8d. to 20s. 6d. per 100ft. Toi across the beginning of the month the market showed some considerable degree of liveliness, numerous inquiries were experienced, and a good many parcels of the new shipments then landing ex South America and Far Away found their way into the hands of the trade. Bucknor's and Starlight teas have been placed privately at 1s. 3d. ; dark half pounds were sold at 1s. 3d. and dark aromatic half pounds were quitted at 4s. 6d. The sales publicly during the same week, ending; 2nd instant, were of little account, and comprises only a small parcel of half-pounds, which realised 5s, 4d. A large line of black Hambro' twist changed hands privately at a very low figure, say about 3d. per lb. Throughout the following week trade continued dull.' The sales effected privately of tons and half Goundsworoof little account, and included a line of ucknor's, sold at 1s. 3d. The auction sales consisted mostly of damaged parcels, which realised only sheepwash prices. On the 2nd inst. about a hundred packages, sold on account of whom it may concern, realised, for tens Old, to 1s. 1d., and for half-pounds 9d. (Aromatic pounds brought Is. 6d. to 1s. 10d. net. On the 5th, about a hundred packages were quitted at 3d. to 6d. per lb. for one lot of half pounds, 1s. 4d. to Is. 6d. for another, and Is. 6d. for a third. " Tens were sold at 7d. In the week ending on the 10th the business done consisted of the sale of a few dark half-pounds, and aromatic half-pounds and pounds. A line of fifty quarter-tierces IXL was also placed at an improvement, but any attempt to effect sales by auction failed. By the Panama mail, which arrived here on the 6th, some 5,800 packages are advised as on the way, a quantity far in excess of our requirements. There was more business doing- last week, though at very unsatisfactory prices; In fact, the market has completely broken down as far as regards inferior descriptions of tobacco ; this, however, is no new feature, as whenever shipments are made on a largely Increased scale, nothing- but the finest classes can be got rid of the others being neglected, except at ruinous prices, and from the reports to hand we learn that most of the shipments still on the way consist of common descriptions, so that the evil complained of. Instead of soon being remedied, may yet have to be combated in a more aggravated form; for the offer sorts, however, prices are expected to remain steady, though an advance can hardly be expected. On the 10th, aromatic half- pounds realised Is. 6d., and pounds were quitted at Is. CJd. Twist was sold at Island. to 4s. 7d. Fancy tobacco was quitted at 2s. 2d. to 2s. 6d" and tens were sold at 1s. Id. On the 19th, a large quantity, chiefly Virginian tens, good and fine looking tobacco, but soft, and unsuit- able for smoking, was offered for sale, and 504 packages altogether were disposed of, at 7d. to Is. for tens, half-pounds sold at 6d. to, for aromatics, Is. 4d.; faulty tens -were at same time quitted at 7d. not. On the 20th, an attempt was also made to quit, by public Sale, 277 packages, but this proved a failure, as only two small parcels of aromatic pounds were placed at Is, 6d. Our trade quotations are Common tons, 7d. to 9d. ; middling, 10d. to 1s. ; good, Is. 1d. to 1s. 4d. and fine, Is. 6d. ; aromatic half-pounds, 1s. 4d. to 1s. 9d. ; pounds, 1s. 6d. to 2s.; twist, Western, nominal, according to condition, from 4d. to 10d. ; Southern, 1s. 2d. to 2s. Cigars Manilla havannah, 05s. ; cheroots, 56s. Ormond Swiss cigars are being disposed of at 40s. " Wines and Spirits The demand for sherries has been but trifling. Common has been placed at £20, and good to medium has been quitted at £16 to £65, while fine has been placed as high as £120. A mixed parcel of one, two, and three diamond, equal to forty butts, was quitted at £40 all round. Ports have met with more general Inquiry. Common red wine has been placed to a fair extent of £14, and for finer descriptions £18 10s. has been realised. A shipment of Houghton's double and treble diamond was sold at £32 and £43 respectively. A small parcel of London bottled Itoughton's five-diamond changed hands at 28s. For a great part of the month spirits were neglected, but as the time approached when the change in duty was to take place, inquiry began to be stirred up, and during the past, fortnight a large business has been done. Of Martell's dark- brandy about a hundred and fifty hhds. old have been quitted at 11s. 3d. tods. 4d., and small lots at up to 6s. 6d. Hennessy's pale, after touching 6s. 6d., rallied, and afterwards 35 hilda, and about 180 quarters were quitted at prices rising from 5-. 10d. to 4s. 3d. Sales of C.V.P. brandy have been effected freely at 6s. 6d. Otard's has been disposed of at 6s. 6d. C.S.V.P. has been placed at 4s. 6d., and amongst other sales a fine of 50 quarters and 10 hhds. changed hands. mine's brandy has been sold at 5s. 6d. Case brandies have also attracted considerable attention. Hennessy's, after declining to 24s. 6d.. rose rapidly to 27s. About 5,000 cases changed hands at intervening; rates during the last day or two. However, prices again receded, and some 2,000 have been quitted at 20s. About 2,000 cases Otard's changed hands at 21s. 6d., but holders now ask 23s. at auction this week 22s. 3d. was bid for this brand. A line of 1,000 cases Martell's was purchased at 23s. U.P. has been sold at 22s. C.V.P. and Vinegrowers' have met with buyers to a fair extent at 18s. For a shipment of Clozcau 15s. was accepted. In Genova a very extensive trade has been done. The month's sales amount, at least, to 54,000 cases, and embrace 80,000 cases JDKZ, at prices ranging from 0s. 6d. to 10s. ; 1,600 cases Key brand at Os. 6d, ; 3,000 cases yellow metal at 13s. 6d', and resides at up to 16s. ; 0,600 cases V.

Bulk whiskey has been quitted at 4s. 6d. to 5s. 9d. Old tom has been sold at 14s. for Sir R. Burnett's. REVIEW OF THE STOCK AND SHARE MARKET. September has been a dull month in this department of business. Very little has been done of a speculative character, Investments are of course being constantly made in securities of all kinds, but this implies only a very moderate outlay of capital. At this period last year the mining share market was in a highly excited condition, and we are even up to this time paying the penalty of mistakes. Induced by the infectious genuineness of September and October, 1860\. The inclination of those who buy mining shares Is decidedly towards those stocks which, although of comparatively large amount, are In dividend-paying condition. Progressive ventures are neglected. There has been a large business in Victoria Government six per cent debentures. Bank shares constantly taken at remarkably even prices. Gas shares scarce, and on that account less dealt in than they would otherwise be. Insurance shares have been changing hands to some extent. The disputes arising out of reserved lands at Ballarat are not yet finally disposed of and one case especially, which was deemed settled but is now re- opened, has created great distrust and uncertainty in the market. In quartz mines very little business has been done ; alluvial have the call decidedly. The dividends due or declared for the four weeks ending Saturday, 21st September, amount to £80,020 ; of this amount £2,100 was paid by the Ballarat Gas Company, and £78,820 by mining companies; of the latter sum £26,630 was derived- from quartz, and £63,290 from alluvial mines. Debentures. Victoria Government sixes have been extensively sold, at prices ranging from 100 to 100 ; some have been quoted at higher rates inclusive of incidental charges, which were quite irrelevant to the price. A considerable number have been taken for the Sydney market, and some of our local banks have been purchasing rather freely. If these debentures were remediable, a much higher price would be easily obtained, The authorised local issue is almost exhausted, and there are very few in second hands for sale. Collingwood Gas seven per cent, debentures have been cleared off the market at par, and more of them would be taken If obtainable. Melbourne Corpora- tion Sixes have been pretty freely sold at par. Banks. Ballarat Bank stand at about par. Colonial Bank sold at prices ranging from £7 4s. to £7 Os. On., closing at £7 5s. buyers, and £7 9s. sellers. National Bank sold at £5 15s. for London, and at £5 14s. for Melbourne register ; this price is about the same as that of the month preceding. The financial half- years of the two last- named banks and of the Bank of New South Wales close on the 30th Inst. Commercial Bank receded to £4 and, as we last month anticipated, have since steadily improved to £4 fiasco which the latest sales have been effected. Bank of New South Wales have been saleable at £10 to £47, but have not been much dealt in. Bank of Victoria sold at £88, £38 5s. for Melbourne register, the latter, with £1 added per share, given for London register. Land Mortgage Bank sold at £2, and in demand at that; sellers at £2 2s. Gas Companies. Ben- digo Gas saleable at £2 7s. 6d. Collingwood sold at £0 2s., £0 2s. 6d. ; held for £0 6s., and 36 bid. Melbourne Gas sold at £4 10s., and £4 7s. 6d. asked. No mention of other gas stocks. Insurance Companies.-Australasian Fire and Marine have been largely dealt in at 12s. to 12s. 6d. before the call was due, and have since been placed at 22s. 6d. ; there is a good demand now, and there are no declared sellers. Australasian Life have ranged from 12s. 3d. to 12s. 9d. Australian Alliance have been sold at 11s a large parcel, Southern Insurance have been scarce; sales at 20s. 6d., 27s.; sellers at 27s. 6d. Victoria Life and General Insurance saleable at 27s. 6d. Victoria Fire and Marine in demand ; £23 offered, but more would be given. Miscellaneous Companies: - Gipps Land Copper Tribute) sold at 30s. to 35s. The Gipps Land Steam Navigation Company has made a call of £1, and the shares fell to £1 ox call, and are now offered at 17s. 6d. Third Union Building Society in the market at £10 10s. premium, buyers at £0 10s. premium. Fourth Union in demand. St, Arnaud silver have been changing hands. Warrenheip Distillery have been sold at £7. The Bendigo Waterworks Company's dam is now full, and the company is in a position to fully supply the domestic requirements of Sandhurst under any circumstances from the stock of water secured. Melbourne and Hobson's Bay United Railway have changed hands to a limited extent at £50 ; the market for them is dull. For detailed quotations of mines we refer to the share-list.

Mr. S. de Beer writes as follows ; "Since my last circular of 27th ult., a considerable change in favour of shipowners has occurred in freights to England and the prognostications I then ventured upon have to a very great extent been ordered. immediately on arrival of the mail, via Suez, a renewed demand evinced itself for tonnage to load breadstuffs here and at Adelaide (South Australia) for Great Britain, which, together with advices of enhanced rates of freight ruling in India and China, backed by orders to load at various ports there, the various con- signees of shipping intended to load this season's clip of wool, were prompted to fix the rates of freight at f d. for greasy and d. for scoured. These rates, however, did not satisfy the shipmasters, who apparently were not consulted in the matter, and consequently they met, and pledged themselves, in the interests of their owners, not to accept less than 9d. for greasy and d. for scoured wool, to which publicity was given in the public prints. The independent position assumed by the shipmasters was evidently not relished by their consignees and as several ships have since arrived after quick passages, and the present rainy weather retarding the delivery of wool in town, several considerable engagements have been made at the lower rates adopted by the consignees, but it must be admitted that these reasons were scarcely sufficient for doing so. In support of this view it is only necessary to state that the tonnage now on the berth here and at Geelong- aggre- gates 18,000 tons register, comprising fifteen Miles, viz., the George Thompson, wimmera, Lightning, Australian, J. M. Joshua, Jerusalem, Kosciusko, Kent, Lincolnshire, Lanarkshire, Proteus, Star of Peace, Sarah Grice, Vi'lilto Star, and 'tVinofred, against about a similar amount at the same period last year; Moreover, at that time there was node mand for India or China, and besides, a fair proportion of the ships above enumerated will be partially laden with wheat and flour; also tallow; while it is generally acknowledged that this season's clip of wool will In quantity surpass all its predecessors. Should tonnage continue as scarce as for some time past, there is no question but rates of height to England will still advance. The only ship now in the bay whose destination is undecided is the John Temperley. Ships of the highest class afloat, built at great cost, load at this port, the owners of which are placed at a great disadvantage, seeing that with respect to rates of freight they are, by our shippers, placed on the same footing as the soft' ships of the North American colonies. It would only be just that discriminating- rates were established, as Is the rule elsewhere. Engagements have been completed for several of the ships abovenamed, at 45s to 60s. per (on for wheat, and 50s. for tallow, to London. The Iron ship Runnymede proceeds to Adelaide to load wheat, etc., for Liverpool, at a shade under £3 per ton, and several handy vessels of 400 to 500 tons are wanted for similar employment. The clearances during the month embrace the Essex and Anglesey, for London, both with full cargoes, but with only a limited number of passengers. The- ship Joshua Bates has just left for Hong Kong, with general cargo and a full complement of (Chinese passengers. Only a very limited business has been done during the month in charters to return to the colonies, the only noteworthy engagements being those of the Hannah Nicholson and Britain, both colonial owned the former to load coffee, etc, at Colombo, for a lump sum of £860; and the latter guano, from Malden Island, at 45s. per ton, coupled with coals from Newcastle to Port Chalmers, New Zealand, at 20s. The demand for tonnage to load coals for India and China still continues, and high heights are freely offered, but the scarcity of ships has curtailed the number of transactions, which embrace the British ships Julia Ann and Lousdow no, at 43s., for Shanghai ; with the Dutch ship Vooruit, for Batavia, at 22s. 6d., nil to load at Sydney; and the Mogul, of Newcastle, at 47s. 6d., also for Shanghai. There is no change to note In rates of freight, those current being still Newcastle to Shanghai, 47s 6d.; Hong Hong, 33sec Galle, 25s.; Calcutta, 26s. ; Rangoon, 25s.; Java, 27s. 6d.; Bombay, 835.; Singapore, 20s. A ship is now wanted to load coals and sundries for Yokohama (Japan The recent arrivals from China and Java were almost all engaged there, to return with coals, but at rates 6s. to 10s. per ton less than could have been procured hero. To load at the race ports for Europe, £3 Is being offered, but the scarcity of tonnage has prevented any engagements being. effected. Several ships are urgently wanted for the conveyance of horses to Calcutta, and for which extreme rates would be paid. Coal freights from Newcastle to this port are firm at 14s. The trade to the various New Zealand ports continues depressed, and is only available for small craft, which, however, secure remunerative rates of freight. Very few ships have changed hands during the month, but there are inquiries for vessels of good class and of a carrying capacity of from 300 to 400 tons. The screw steamer Souchays is to be offered by auction on the 17th prox. The barque Dundas Castle, from Calcutta to this port, which put into Mauritius for repairs, left that Island on the 5th of July last, and not having since been heard of, great fears are felt for her safety." WOOL, TALLOW, HIDES, c. Messrs. B. GOLUsimouaii and Co. report: "Wool. -The sales made during the past month have been few and unimportant, and we do not expect any large transactions until the resumption of the usual weekly auctions. Several parcels of the new clip are in store, and the less we have seen are in very good condition in fact, there is every reason to expect a considerable improvement on last year, both in length and staple, feed having been abundant, and sheep in excellent condition. Shearing is now almost general, but the present heavy rains will we fear retard and in tenuous, besides rendering the roads were impassable for drays. The next mail from England will, we trust, bring news of firm prices ruling in the home market, as the quotations here will be established to a certain extent by the advices expected. The first sale will be held on or about the 16th October. The following ships have cleared for England during the month with wool on board: August 20, Essex, for London, 1,110 bales; September 17, Anglesey, for London, 1,054 bales. Total, 2,173 holes, Previous shipments, 100,205 bales. Total, October 25, 1869, to date, 108,433 bales. Prices current nominally as follows, until fully established by the auction sales ¡-Greasy-Inferior to ordinary, 6d, to 8d. ; ordinary to average, 8d. (to 9d. ; good to superior, 10d. to 1s. Id. Fleece-Interior to ordinary, 1s. 3d. to Is. 56. ; ordinary to average, Is. 6d. to 1s. 8d. a good to superior, Is. 6d. to 2s. 4d. ; Scoured-Ordinary, 1s. 4d. to 4s. 7d. ; good, 4s. 8d. to 1s. 10d. ; superior, 2s. to 2s. 2d. Hides. There is not much business doing; the bulk that reaches town being either shipped to the home market on curers' account or purchased direct by the connors. We quote fair conditioned country wet salted from 8s. to 11s, and town slaughtered, 12s. to 16s. each. There have been no clearances since our lost month's report, but the Star of Peace and Lannrkshiro are now load- ing for London, taking about 3,000 hides each. Tallow. There is a better supply, but inquiry is not brisk. Prices for parcels, in shipping order, are about as follows, say-Beef, £30 to £33 ; mixed, £33 to £35 and mutton, £36 to £37 per ton. The only clearance is a parcel of 171 casks, per Anglesey, for London." Messrs. Cuningham and Mackkdib. report: "Wool. -Two small sales, chiefly of scoured wools, have been held since our lost month's report, about 600 bales being offered, and the greater portion of the lots sold at satisfactory rates. Judging from the prices realised at our sale on the 24th inst., we have every reason to expect that there will be some spirited competition in this market during the approaching season. Shearing operations have commenced in earnest, and already we have several lots of the new clip in store. Before the October mail leaves we expect to have held our first sale of the new season's wool. Greasy may be quoted 6d. to 10d. per lb.; slips, 12d. ; scoured, 14d. to 23d.; washed, tOld. The shipments to London during the past month have been as follows From Hobson's Bay Essex. 1,110 holes, cleared August 20; Anglesey: 1,064 bales, cleared September 7 ; total 2,173 bales. Previous shipments-From August 1, 1800 to August 21,1S07,170,200 bales. Total shipments to September 7,1807,172,382 bales. The Lincolnshire, Australian, Sarah Grice, and Kosciusko are on the berth, the agents of each expecting fair cargoes of wool. Sheepskins have brought 3d to 6d. per lb. Tallow realised £30 To £33 for mixed. Hides sold at 8s to 14s. each, few offering for sale, but there have been some direct shipments on owner's account. Kangaroo skins found buyers at 6s, 6d. to 9s. per dozen, in bad condition." the London and Australian Aokxcy CoronATiON (Limited), Melbourne, furnish the following monthly report for transmission per royal mail steamer Geelong Wool The only public sales held during the month have been two small sales of last season's wools when the total offered only amounted to 435 bales. These sales may be regarded as closing the season of 1860-7. Shearing operations are now being vigorously carried on, although slightly interrupted by the recent heavy rains. Several parcels of the new clip have already reached store, and we are advised of other parcels being on the way. From the samples of new wool we have examined, we apprehend that the anticipation respecting the new clip will be fully borne out and as far as we can at present judge, the wool is very well grown being both sound and strong. We expect that the sales of the now wool will begin in the course of two or three weeks, as, should the weather continue favourable, a large quantity of wool will be in town by that time. The high rates of freight for wool this season, in consequence of a combination among the captains of ships in port to raise them, will have considerable influence on the quantity of wool shipped in the grease, on it must be apparent that a considerable saving will he effected by having the . wool thoroughly cleansed from dirt and grease before shipment. The heavy rains that have fallen through out the season have not only nourished the grasses, but have rendered our rivers navigable, so that Increased facilities are afforded for the carriage of wool from many of the most distant stations to the ports of shipment. The following have been the shipments of the month : -Aug. 29, Essex. 1,119 bales; Sept. 17. Anglesey, 1,034 bales to which add previous shipments horn Oct. 10,1800,172,521 bales; total. 174,004 bales, The weekly shipments have been as below, viz.

Tolo), 37,873,541 lbs., value £2,704,3«. follows-We have to report the sale of a considerable quantity of tallow during the month. A slight concession in rates has been made by sellers, to equalise the rise in freight to London. The quantity reaching town is on the increase, and it is expected that it will be considerably supplemented when boiling-down operations become general. We give the following as the price at which we have effected sales during the month, viz. Beef, £31 10s. to £34 per ton ; mixed and mutton, £34 to £37 per ton. Hides. We have effected sales during the month of several lots of country salted, and we quote sales at 9s to 11s. for average, and 12s to 15s. for superior market." MELBOURNE MARKETS.

Powers, Rutiikiu'oud, and Co. report : " Fat Cattle. 912 head were drawn for yesterday, of which number 600 were penned and disposed of to-day. Nearly the whole of these were from good to prime in quality, and on the consumption of beef is falling off every week, the demand to-day proved rather slack, and the market opened with very low prices. As sales proceeded, however, competition became more brisk, and the market closed tolerably firm, although on the whole prices were considerably lower than has been the case for some time past, We sold 181, from Hayfield, Gipps Land, good to prime, heavy weights, the bullocks at £7 19s. 11d., and cows £0 19s. 4d.; and 100 for Mr. Andrew Murray, of Colac, light- weight bullocks, averaging £0 16s., and cows £5 la. 10d. Quotations Prime bullocks, 23 to £9 12s. (6d. a good do., £7 10s. to £8 10'. ; middling and inferior do., £4 to £0 ; prime cows, £7 to £8 6s, ; good do., £5 10s. to £0 10s. ; middling and inferior do., £3 10s. to 5. Fat Sheep Number in, £2,022, The bulk of this number were good useful mutton, without any prime or heavy weights. The very wet weather did not tend to improve the np apearance of those forward, and from the same cause buyers were slow in coming to market, so that the demand, at the opening was very slack indeed ; towards the close, however, sales were more readily effected, and the whole supply was eventually cleared out at prices similar to those ruling last week. We sold 2000 wethers from Illilliwa, good quality, light weights, to 10s.; 1,010 do., from Jerilderie, medium quality and weights, at 9s. Total, 3,000. Quotations Best wethers, 9s. 6d. to 10s. 6d. ; middling and inferior do., 7s. to 8s. 6d. Fat Lambs. Number In, 1,052. The whole of this supply was readily cleared out at about last week's rates. We sold 204 for Mr. Robert Chirnside, to 5s. 6d. and 52 for Mrs. James, at 7s. Total, 250. Quotations Best quality, 6s. 6d. to 7s. ; middling and inferior do., 4s. to 5s. Store Sheep But very few are changing hands, the attention of squatters generally being given just now to preparations for shearing, and until that is over very little business of any sort is likely to be transacted. With reference to our remarks last week on the subject of boiling down and other meat-utilising establishments about to be started, it will be observed that a company has now been formed in Melbourne for the purpose principally of boiling down, and will doubtless be in operation with the least possible delay, when we may hope to find an outlet for our surplus sheep, and greater firmness in prices prevailing than of late for ouryoungstock. Quotations Wethers, six and eight tooth, 7s. (6d. to us ; do., two and four tooth, 6s. to 7s. ; ewes, two and four tooth, 8s?. to 10s. ; do., six and eight tooth, 6s. to 8s. ; weaners, mixed sexes, 6s. 6d. to (6s. 6d. Store Cattle There is a very considerable inquiry for good stores adapted for early fattening, and where breeding has been attended to sales can readily be effected at current rates. This being the season when fat cattle have generally reached their highest, and prices not having advanced to the extent that was anticipated, present rates for stores are not likely to be more than maintained, unless the curing establishments about to be formed should absorb a large quantity of beef, as well as mutton, and thereby create a demand more than ordinary. Quotations Bullocks, superior, £3" lost. to £4 ; do., good, £3 to £3 10s. ; do., inferior, £2 to 26s. ; mixed sexes, superior, £3 to £3 10s. ; do., good, £2 Cs. to £2 15s. Stations. There is a disposition to invest in good properties, at moderate prices, and we have several buyers for large freeholds, if puroliuscablo within our limits." Messrs. Dalmahoy CAJti'iiELi, and Co. report: " Fat Cattle A moderate supply came to hand, viz. 500 head. The quality of the cattle on the whole was better than the usual average, but the opening sales yesterday were effected at a considerable reduction on late rates, say from 16s. to 20s. per head ; but to- day the biddings were more spirited, and prices rallied considerably, and the market closed fully 10s. higher than last week. We quote: Best bullocks, at from £8 10s. to £0 12s. 6d. ; second do., at from £6 to £7 6s. ; inferior do., from 30s. to £5 ; best pens cows, at from £7 10s. to £8 6s. ; second do., from £5 to £0 ; inferior do., from £3 to £4. We have sold 106 head for Mr. William Robertson, from Colac, of the well known FF brand, the bullocks at an average of £8 12s. 7d., and the cows £5 18s. 3d. and 203 head for Mr. Walter Douglass, from Barwon River, New South Wales, the bullocks at an "average of 36 17s., and the cows £6 So. 2d, Fat Calves A small supply forward, mostly good quality, and sold from 20s. toGOs. Fat Sheep. 1,972 were penned, the greater portion being from good to prime quality ; but owing to the inclemency of the weather, the sheep did not look so well as last week. There was a fair attendance of buyers and nearly all of the above number were cleared out to the butchers, but without any improvement on late sales. The supply consisted mostly of northern sheep, which were almost all trucked from Echuca, at a very heavy expense to the owner. We quote good to prime wethers at from 10s. to 10s. 6d. (a few ¿xlra-weightsfroml3s. to 19s.); second do-, from 5s.. 6d. to 9s. 6d. Inferior do., from 55. upwards ; prime quality ewes, at from 8s. 6d. to 9d. We have sold 1,000 wethers for Messrs. M'Gaw, McKinnon, and Co., from Burrabogie Station, Murrumbidgee River, at 10s. 6d. (being the the price obtained for any of the northern lots In the market); 1,400 wethers for Messrs. Severne Brothers, from Ben- duck station. Murrumbidgee river, at from 10s. to 10s. 6d.; 200 for Messrs. Staughton Brothers, from Tintinallogy station, Darling River, at 10s. 6d.; 34 for the Hon. W. J. T. Clarke, from Rock Bank, at 13s.; 60 for Mr. Loman, from Deep Creek, at from 14s. to 10s. 200 ewes fortresses. Staughton Brothers, from Tintinallogy station, Darling River, at 5s.; 00 do. for the Hon. W. J. T. Clarke, from Rock Bank, at 8s. 6d.; 30 do. for Mr. S. F. Staughton, from Brisbane Ranges, at 8s. Fat Lambs large supply came to hand, viz., 1,052, which were very dull of sale, most of them being only second quality ; best brought from 6s. 6d. to 7s. 6d.; second do., from 5s. to 6s.; inferior do., from 3s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. A few extra prime cross-breds brought as high as 12s. 6d. We sold 30 for Mr. Loman, from the Deep Creek, at 12s. 6d.; 00 for the Hon. W. J. T. Clarke, from Rook Bank, at (is. 9d.; 102 for Mr S. F.

Store Cattle Sales are still effected at satisfactory prices, in comparison with those now ruling for store sheep, and as the greater portion of the lots at hand have been taken up leaving several buyers unsupplied, we may look for previous rates to be maintained for some time. We have this day sold 102 bullocks, and 73 cows by public auction, in the Melbourne yards, the bullocks at £5, and the cows at £3 12s., terms four months. These were a very superior lot of cattle, and for size, colour, and breeding are not often surpassed, which accounts for the high prices obtained. Store Sheep. Some sales of large lots of Queensland wethers have taken place throughout the week at 0s. 6d. on lengthened credit, DUt as these sheep are shorter woolled than the average of the Riverina and Victorian flocks, they cannot be taken as a fair criterion for the price of good full- fleeced wethers. We have no improvement to notice, and cannot expect any alteration so long as the present rates for fat sheep rule so low in Sydney as well as here, and we observe from the agents' reports of the former market that fat wethers have been sold. at 2s. a head under the value of their tallow and skins alone," BALLARAT LIVE STOCK MARKET. Wednesday, Sept. 25. Messrs. Etthkhiiank, Eaolbstokh, and Co. report " that 143 cattle comprised the supply for the week, which was the smallest number that has been offered this year; the quality was mostly rough and in different, but there being so few in, good prices were realised. inferior to middling quality beef brought from 22s. 6d. to 30s. per 100lbs. We anticipate similar results next week, as nearly the whole of the trade will be out of cattle by that time. Fat Sheep 3,272 were penned, the quality ranged from good to inferior. There were but few buyers present, the very severe weather having the effect of keeping everyone away except those that were quite out of stock. Prices were about 1s. per head lower than last week on some lots, but in others the decline was not so perceptible. We sold a flock of wethers at from 10s. 6d. to 11s. 6d. Fat Lambs 1,373 were penned, which exceeded the demand ; consequently prices ruled lower, although sales in general were up to expectation ; the best in brought from 6s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. ; others from 4s. to 6s, We sold 160 for Messrs. R. Russell and Co., at from 7s. to 7s. 6d." s GEELONG LIVE STOCK MARKET. Wedkrsdat, Sept. 25. Mr. Or.onGK Sykkot reports :-" Fat Cattle. The market, was rather bare this week, only 83 head of cattle' being yarded, which brought good prices. There was a large attendance of both town and country buyers, and biddings were very spirited : 33 head good quality and weights were sold, bullocks bringing 11 our £7 to £11 his., average, £8 19s. 2d. ; cows from £6 5s. to £10 5s. ; average, £7 7s. 6d. I fully anticipate a good market for cattle for some weeks to come, as the trade is not very fully supplied. Quota- tions:- Prime bullocks, from £10 to £12; good do., from £7 10s. to £0 ; medium do., from 50s. to £7 ; prime cows, from 810, to £10 10s. ; good do., from words. to £7 10s. ; medium do., from £5 to £0. Fat . Sheep A further decline took place in the price of fat sheep this week, and sales were difficult to effect, although a small lot of prime sheep offered by auction realised high prices. 110 fair quality medium weight wethers were sold at 5s. for 10 heavy-weight medium quality wethers, at 14s., and 310 medium-weight fair quality wethers, at 10s. 6d. ; also 85 prime quality medium-weight ewes, at 12s. Total Bold, 501 head. Quotations Prime heavy-weight wethers, 12s. to 11s. ; prime heavy-weight ewes, 10s. to 14s. ; good wethers, 9s. to 10s. 6d. ; good owes, 7s. to 83. Fat calves are in demand, and would meet with ready sale at from 30s. to 60s. Fat Lambs. -The market was abundantly supplied with fat lambs this week, and prices ruled very low. 60 medium quality young lanibB went at 4s and 15 at 5\. Total, 82 head. Prime quality lambs would realise from 8s. to 10s., according to size. Store Sheep. The demand is very limited, Those wanting such stock preferring to wait until after shearing. I have placed 600 six and eight tooth wethers at 8s. Quotations: Wethers, six and eight tooth, 7s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. ; do., two and four tooth, 6s. to 7s. ; ewes, do., 8s. to 10s. : do., six and eight tooth, 6s. 6d. to 8s. ; weaners, mixed sexes, 6s. to 7s. Wool, Sheep skins, and Rides. Three bales of skin wool have been sold at Old. toward. ; also, three-quarter to full woolled skins at 6d. to 7d. per lb., or 3s, 6d. to 4s. 9d. per skin, and a few Inferior hides at 12s. Tallow is in very good demand." Messrs. M'KENZIE and Roadknight report :-" Fat Cattle The supply forward this week only amounted to 83 head. This being below the trade requirements,' and following the scanty supplies of the past few weeks, caused great animation in the biddings, more especially as all the cattle were of really good quality. Our sales consisted of 60 head, all bullocks, for Mr. John Calvert, and prices ranged from £0 17s. 6d. to £9 lCs., averaging £8 5s. 6d. Quotations Prime heavy bullocks, £10 to £11 a good do., £0 to £7 ; middling and inferior do., £4 to £5; host cows, £8 to £10, according to quality. Fat Calves There were none offered this week. Good quality ore in demand, and this market could do work with 40 to 60 head per week. Fat Sheep. Trade was again excessively dull, the butchers buying very sparingly, owing to so much trade being taken out of their hands, by their customers buying in the carcase market. We do not, however, anticipate a long continuance of this system of selling, as it is generally the most inferior stock which is brought to the dead meat market ; a class of sheep, In fact, which it is almost impossible to induce butchers to buy in our yards. We yarded in all 071 head of medium to good quality, and sold as follows 427 wethers at 11s. 6d. ; 106 do., at 9s. ; 33 do., at 12s. ; 100 do., at 8s. 9d. ; 5 coast 12s. ; 19do., atOs. 3d. ; Cowes, as., and 44 No., of 8s. ; total, 629 head. Quotations Good heavy wethers, 12s. to 14s. ; middling do., 8s. to 9s. 6d. ; inferior do., 6s. to 7s. ; best owes, 8s. to 10s. and others in proportion. Fat Lambs. We had an unusually large supply forward this week, and chiefly of good quality. The trade bought largely, and we were therefore enabled to clear out at satisfactory prices. We sold as follows 4-51 lambs at Ca., 52 do. at 3s. 3d., 50 do. at 3s. 10d. to 5s. 6d.. 12 do. at 7s. 6d., and 13 do. at 5s. 6d. Total sold by us 175 head. Store Stock Business in both sheep and cattle is utterly stagnant just now, and we have not heard of any lots changing hands for more than a month past. After shearing we anticipate that a large business will be done In store sheep, If the prices are not fixed too high. Wool, Sheepskins, Hides, and Tallow Very few Kilcslmve been held lately, and business continues very dull." SHIPPING OF THE MONTH!. PORT OF MELBOURNE. Arrivals suit Or Brances bisch our last Summary.
