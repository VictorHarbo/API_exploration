Thursday. Deoejtreh 4. {Before Mr. S. Beddome, P.M.] Alfred StvteUy, laborer,- was charged, on the information of Matilda, his wife, with assaulting her. Mr. J. W. Downer for complainant. The parties had been married bat three months, and were .both young. They quarrelled several times, and the wife returned to her mother, and was at her house on December 3, when defendant went after her and abused and hit her, and struck a fork into' her. She was very frightened, and asked that defendant might be bound over to keep the peace. Defendant promised he would not abuse his wife again if His Worship were- lenient with him. He had received a severe cut on his -head, and when excited he hardly knew what he did, and sometimes had fits! Defendant was bound ever to keep the peace fpr three months in his own recognizance of £10, and pay the costs, 20s. ' Wm. O'Connor and Deminic O'Brien were, charged with disturbing P.O. M. Murphy whilst in the -execution of his duty. O'Connor was' fined 10s.

Ford, laborer, were fined 10s. each for drun kenness. John Mill, a coaching proprietor, was charged by Inspector Shakespeare with permitting an unregistered driver to drive a licensed vehicle. Mr. Armstrong, from Messrs. Stow & Ayers's office, appeared, by permission, for defendant. His Worship dismissed the information, not be cause he thought defendant was innocent, but because he had some doubt' as to whether a licence had been issued. John Nicholson, driver, was charged by Charles Sowerby, driver, with using abusive language towards him. A squabble between the drivers was proved, but the charge of abusive language was not tubstantiatetL Dis missed. .' James Beddaway, sen., cab proprietor, was charged by Inspector Shakespeare with permit ting a person to drive his* licensed vehicle at . the time not being a registered driver. His Worship said the information was defective, inasmuch .as it charged defendant with an offence which was not named in the Act. It said nothing about registering drivers, but it .provided against othei than licensed drivers taking charge of licensed vehicles. Information withdrawn. Thos. Bouse, driver, for neglecting to have a lighted lamp on hiB vehicle on the evening of 22nd November, was fined 5i. with 10s. costs. — Bultler, carpenter, was fined 20e. with 10s. costs, for having an unregistered dog.
