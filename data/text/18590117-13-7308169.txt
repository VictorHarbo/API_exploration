It Is the pure tincture of junlper, distilled from the best barley that can be selected in Europe at any cost. It is flavored and medicated, not by the common harsh berry, but by the choice botanical variety of tho aro- matic Italian juniper berry, whose more vinous ex- tract is distilled and rectified with its spirituous sol- vent. and thus it becomes a concentrated tincture of exquisite flavor and aroma, altogether tran- scendant in Its cordial and medicinal properties to any alcoholic stilmulant now in use In the world. It has been submitted to all the first chemists and physicians in the United States, who endorce it over their own signatures as one of tho great essentials of the materia medica. It is now proscribed with great success In gravel, grout, rheumatism, obstructiont of the bladder and kidneys, dyspepsia, whether acute or chronic, in general debility, sluggish circulation of the blood, inadequate assimilation of food, and exhausted energy, are acknowledged by the whole medical facultey and attested in their highest written authorities.
