Statistical. Vital Statistics of Queensland. The twenty-ninth annual report on the vital statistics of the colony has been presented to both Houses of Parliament by Mr. W.T. Blakeney. the Registrar- General. It states that tbe population of Queensland as estimated to the 31st of December, 1888, was 387,463 persons, consisting of 225,516 males and 161,047 females, showing an increase during the year of 20,523 persons, composed of 10,985 males and 9538 females, the ratio of total in crease in the estimated population as compared with the estimate at the close of the previous year having been 5*59 per cent, and the ratio of increase as regards the sexes calculated on the same basis being 2-99 per cent males, and 2*60 per cont females. The ratio of in crease is not equal to that shown by the records of the previous year comparing 1887 with 1886, but is better than that shown between the records of 1835 and 1886\. The increase last year was derived from the excess of arrivals over departures by sea, from the natural increase by excess of births over deaths, and from the excess of interco lonial traffio by railway over the border, which latter has now for the first time been taken into consideration. The inorease to the population by the excess of arrivals over departures by sea and railway amounted to 11,805 persons—7267 males and 4538 females, and the increase of births over deaths was 8718—3718 males and 5000 females. The greatest immigration was in the second quarter of the year, and the smallest in tbe fourth. The greatest increase from natural causes was in the third quarter. The ratio of immigration inorease over the estimated population was 322 per cent, and the ratio of natural increase was 2-37. The im migration inorease during 1888 was not equal to that in 1886 or 1887, and very slightly in excess of that during 1885, but on the other hand the natural increase was ft little larger than that of 1887 and considerably in excess of any of the previous ten years. Eight hundred and thirty-five persons left the colony for China in excess of the arrivals from that country, and 944 Polynesians arrived from the islands in • eio«aa of the number which returned., The dfepar'tura of females, however, exceeded the arrivals by nineteen. Thero arrived from the other colonies of Australasia 22,G53 persoijk but only 18,998 left Queensland for those places, ana there was consequently an increase from this source of 3685 persons, 2832 of .wham were males, and 853 females. With regard td the aliens at present in the colony, tho report states their numbers as follows:—Chinese, 8226 males, 18 females, total 8244 ; Polynesians, 80G7 males, GOO females, total 8607; other alien races, 1007 males, seven females, total 1014\. Tho Chinese and other alions have decreased during 18S8, the former by 925, and the latter by 433, while the Polynesians have increased to the extent of 467 persons. The proportion of the sexes calculated on the whole estimated population to 31st December La 71*31 females to every 100 males. The marriages registered during tho year numbered 3254, being an increase on the num ber registered in 1887 of 340. The marriage rate per 1000 of the mean population was 8*63 which is better than that of 1887, which was 8-21. Calculated on the estimated mean population, exclusive of aliens, the mar riage rate was 9*07 per 1000. The Victorian marriage rate, which was 8-03, is the only one of the other colonies which approximates to that of Queensland. The rate in New Zealand, 5*97, was the lowest of any of the colonies, and this was also the ease in 1887. Calculated on the number of persons married to every 1000 of the mean population, the Queensland rate for last year was 17*26 per 1000, and excluding aliens it was 18*02. The greatest number of marriages registered was in the second quarter of 1888— namely, 843, and the smallest in the first quarter—namely, 789. The largest increase in any one registry district appears in Oxley, which includes within its boundaries some im portant suburbs of the metropolis. The number of marriages celebrated by the various religions denominations and in the registry offices is shown by the following figures:—Churoh of England 896, increase 129; Church of Roma 682, increase 94; Presbyterian and United Presbyterian 640, inorease 42; Primitive Methodist 2G6, increase 35; Wesleyan Metho dist 194, decrease 7; Lutheran 146, inorease 26; Congregational 107, inorease 13; Baptist 91, decrease 5 ; United Methodist Free Churoh 19, increase 1; Church of Christ 9, inorease 5; Bible Christian 7, decrease 3; Particular Baptist 1, decrease 8; New Jerusalem Church, 3; Hebrew Church 1, decrease 2; Salvation Army 7, inorease 6; Catholic Apostolic Church 2, increase 2; Registration and Justices Marry ing Acts 284, inorease 12. The percentage in crease of marriages in 1888 was much greater than in any year since 1885, and even oxoeeded that inorease by 0-42 per cent. The greatest number of marriages celebrated during the last ten years in the eoleny has been by the Church of England, the Church of Rome comes next on the list, and is followed by the Presbyterian Church. Of the number of men married 1091 were born in England or Wales, 565 wore natives of this colony, 520 were born in Ireland, and those born in Scotland numbered 354\. Of tho women who were married 991 wore born in the colony, 848 in England, 694 in Ireland, and 23d in Scotland. Four hun dred and seventy marriages took place between men and women born in England, and simi larly 316 Irish and 315 colonial couples were united in wedlock. The next number of inter marriages of any importance—namely, 290, took place between men natives of England to women born in Queensland. Marriages of men of alien races, suoh as Chinese, Polynesians, and East Indians, show the following results: —Four Chinamen were married to English women, 2 to Queensland-born women, 1 to a woman born in New South Waleß, 1 to a woman born in Ireland, 1 to a Danish woman, and 1 to a woman of the came race as himself. In the whole 10 Chinamen were married in 1888. There were 12 Polynesian males married in that year, of whom 7 were married to Polynesian women, 2 to women born in Queensland, 2 to English women, and Ito an Irish woman. 86*33 per cent of tho marriages took place in respect of persons who married for the first _ time. > Tho marriages in which men married widows formed 5*22 per cent, females married to widowers 5*69 per cent, and 2*Bo per cent of the marriageß were between widowers and widows. Two men who had been divorced were married to stiinsters. The number of persons who signed the marriage certificate with a mark was 260, and by a strange coin cidence this was exactly the same number as was recorded for the previous year. The report, however, shows that the number of persons married who are unable to write is gradually decreasing. In the year 1877 the mean proportion was 10*96 per cent, and last year it was but 4'oo. It is added that the proportion of persons who signed the marriage register with a mark in England was nearly double that of the proportion of such persons in any of the Australasian colonies in the year 1887 and 1886 respectively. The mean age of parties married in Queensland in 1883 was for men 27*76 years, and for women 23*34 years. The proportion of the greatest number of those who married at the same ago—namely, 63 men and 63 women at 21 years—to the total num bor married was 1*94 per cent; and the propor tion of minors married was in the case of mon 3*56 per cent and of women 28*37 per cent. The youngest person married amongst the men was one at 16 yean, and amongst the women three at 14 years. The most noticeable disparity in age between the parties at time of marriage during the year under review was a man of 49 years to a woman of 27 years, so that there was no instance of any extreme dissimi larity in age amongst those married in 1888. The age at which the greatest number of mon —namely, 323, wore married was 26 years; and the greatest number of women—namely, 525, were married at 21 years. The oldest man married was 76 years, and the oldest woman married 67 years. The report states that it is evident, from the records of tf>e department that a considerable num- tier of females misrepresent their ages when about 21, bo as to escape the necessity of obtaining parents' or guardian's consent to their marriage. Something ehould be done to prevent such a state of things either by making the form of declaration more compre hensive or by legislating to do away with the necessity of a minor requiring consent to mar riage uuder tho Statute when say 16 years of age. The number of births registered during the year was 14,247, which was in the proportion of 3*78 to every 100 persons in the mean population. The proportion the previous year was 3-81 per cent. Of the 14,247 births registered 7299 were males, and G948 females. The number of births registered since ISS4 are as follow:—1884, 10,679; 1885, 11,072; ISBG, 12,-352; 18S7, 13,513; ISSB, 14,247. The birth rate for tho various Australasian colonies for the year 1888 was as follows :— Queensland, 3777 ; Western Australia, 36-09; New South Wales, 36-18; South Australia, 33-81; Tasmania, 33-11; Victoria, 32-45; New Zealand, 31-22. The birth rate in Queensland was also higher in 18S7 than any of the other colonieß. The number of illegitimate children born during tho year was 588—males 306, females 252 ; this is a decrease of 19 on the number recorded in the previous year. The proportion of illegitimate births to the total number is 4-13 percent as against 4*49 per cent in 1887. It does not, however, appear that illegitimacy is any less prevalent here than it was ten years ago. The proportion of illegitimate births in the various parts of the colony was as follows : —Brisbane, 181; Ken nedy, 34 ; Maryborough, 31; Rookhampton, 31; Mackay, 29; Oxley, 28; Townsville, 20; Weatwood, 14; Ipswich, 11 ; Caboolture, 10; Bundaberg, 8; Cairns, 7; Maranoa, 3. There was one ease of triplets, and the children were all males. The births of 263 twin children were registered, of which 135 were males and 125 females. Only 210 twin children were registered in 1887. The mortality in 1888 was greater than in the previous year, making due allowance for the increase of population, but numerically less than in 18SG. The total numbor of deaths was 5529, inoluding 3581 males and 1948 females. In 1886, 0238 persons died, and in 1887, 5529. The proportion of deaths registered in 1888 to the mean population was 14*66 per 1000, which slightly exceeds that of 1887, which was the lowest recorded since 1881. The death-rate in England in 1887 was 18*8 per 1000 persons living, and the average for the seven years ending 1887 was 19*2 per 1000, with which the present death-rate in Queens land compares very favourably. The following is the death-rate in the Australasian colonies for the year 1888 per 1000:—New Zealand, 9*43; South Australia, 12*09; New South Wales, 13*54; Queensland, 14*66; Tasmania, 14*12; Victoria, 1530; Western Australia, 16*00. The death- rate has decreased in 1888 in all the colonies except in New South Wales and Queensland, but the increase in both these places is very Blight. The actual number of Chinese, Polynesians, and persons of other alien races who died in Queensland during 1888 was: Chinese, 100; Polynesians, 524 ; persons of other alien races, 20\. The greatest mortality has been in the fourth quarter of the year, the first quarter being that in which the next greatest number of deaths was registered. In the second and third quarters the number of deaths registered were nearly the same, the deaths in the third quarter exceeding the second by 70 persons. The followit g extract shows the exact number of deaths registered each quarter:—First quarter, 1349; second quarter, 1234; third quarter, 1304; fourth quarter, 1642. The month of October was the most fatal, in which 550 deaths were recorded. November was the next with 547 deaths, and December the next with 545. It seems an extraordinary coincidence that the number of deaths in these three months should be so nearly equal, only five deaths more in October in -which the greatest number was recorded in any month of 1888, than in December the smallest number registered in any month of the fourth quarter, which quarter contained the greatest reoord of mortality during the year. The month of May was that in which the least number of deaths was registered. The following is the reoord of deaths in each month of ISSB: — Comparing these returns with similar records for the last ten yearß in the colony, the greatest mortality over that period occurred in the fourth quarter of the year, the next greatest in the firot, and the next in the third. The same remarks applied to the Brisbane district. In thia district deaths were most numerous during October and November, 121 deaths having been registered in the former month, and 122 in the latter. The months of March, May, and Juno were those in which the least number of deaths took place, the number recordod having been nearly equal—in March and May C 5 and in June 67. The deaths registered in tho urban district was 700, and in tho suburban 700, a total of 1020. Deaths occurred in institutions situated within the registry district of Brisbane as follows :— General Hospital 211, Lady Bowen Hospital 2, Children's Hospital 29, Lock Hospital 1, Dia mantina Orphanage, Infants' Asylum 9, Luna tio Reception House 2, Brisbane Gaol 4, and Immigration Depot 4, total 263, as compared ■with 247 in the year preceding. The per centage of deaths in these institutions to the total deaths in the Brisbane distriot was 25-78, or 2-63 per cent higher than in 1887. Daring the year 2309 children died before they reached 5 years of age, and of these 20-57 were ander 2 years old. The rate per cent to the total deaths was4l-7G, an increase of 041 on the previous twelve months. The rate per cent in England and Wales in 1887 was 38-47, while the rates pet cent in the other Austral asian colonies in the same year were as follow: — "Western Australia, 43-02 ; New South "Wales, 41-79; South Australia, 39-99; New Zealand, 39-18; Victoria, 3G-90; Tasmania, 30-27. The rate per cent in Queensland had besn steadily increasing since the year 1884, when it was only 33-95 per cent. Of the 14/247 births recorded in the colony in ISBB 1719 of the children born died while under the age of 1 year. The infantile mortality was therefore 12-07 per cent, which was somewhat higher than in the previous twelve months, but was under the average rate for the last five years. It was also leas than the iufantilo mortality in Victoria and "Western Australia, and compared favourably with the English rate—l 42 per 1000\. Excluding deaths under 5 years, the greatest proportion which took placo in any quinqnennial period was between the ages of 20 and 25. The greatest proportionate increase in deaths in any quinqnennial period was in persons between those ages also. Further, during the previous year tho greatest, proportion was between those ages. The following are the total number of deaths recorded in 1888 in each class into which the system of arranging fatal diseases is divided, with the increase or docreaso on the previous year: — Zymotic diseases 1109, increase 103; parasitic 9, decrease 8 ; dietic 156, increase 21; constitutional 848, increase 35; developmental 340, increase 36; looal 2387, increase 210; violence 593, deorea°e 6; ill-defined and not specified causes 87, decrease 28. As was usual in Queensland for ■onto years past, the greatest number of deaths recorded in the oolony were caused by phthisis, which proved fatal to 492 persons—36B males and 124 females. The proportion of deaths from phthisis was 1304 to every 10,000 of the mean population, which was a little over the rate in the previous twelve months, but with that ex ception was much less than the rate in any year during the last quinquennial period. The records showed that the greatest number of deaths from phthisis took place between the ages of 20 and 45, and the proportion of males was rauoh greater than that of females. The death rate in Queensland from phthisis was lower than that in England or Victoria, and there could be little doubt it was considerably increased in this colony by persons coming to it hoping to obtain benefit from the warmer climate. The rate was further augmented bj the numerous deaths of Polynesians—a race peculiarly susceptible to the disease. If out of the total number of deaths those of Chinamen and Polynesians and those who had not resided in the oolony for more than twelve months were excluded, the death rate from this disease would be only 8-08, a rate lower than all the other colonies. Diarrhoea caused the next greatest number of deaths. This was a disease more particularly fatal to the children of tho colony. Convulsions oame next, followed by pneumonia, teething, dysen tery, bronchitis, aud typhoid fever in the order named. The proportion of deaths by violence in Queensland, 15*77 to every 10,000 of the mean population, was larger than in any of the other colonies except Western Australia, and was very muoh greater than in England and Wales. The revenue received by the office from fees in connection with the registering of births, marriages, and deaths during the year was £490 odd, a few shillings over the receipts of the previous year.
