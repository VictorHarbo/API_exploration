Tai The descriptions which we published towards» the latter end of last year, .and! ïhe begiunixg-'of the present, of the Waterview Dry Dock, the Fitz Roy Dry Dock, and5 the Australasian Steam Navigation Company's- Patent Slip, haver '#. commanded especial attention in the maritim»" ports and commercial cities of Europe more especially in London, Liverpool/ Glasgow, Paris, Havre, and Bordeaux. In these ' cities, the leading journals have given copious extracts from the papers %ve are referring to ; in* London, the two principal periodicals devoted to mechanical science, The Añtiian, and Builder* ? have republished them in extènoo, accompanied by comments, pointing out, for the guidance of/ the maritime and mercantile interests of every port in Europe, the inestimable value of theso noble establishments in the finest harbour of the Southern hemisphere. The cadden cessation of ' ocean steam' communication between the United IHngdom and the Australian- Colonies, has-' ( thrown, of necessity, a damp upon the energies of the enterprising proprietors- of Waterview Dbck and the Patent Slip ; butt.with I'3 resump- tion, we may safely predict, that neither of these establishments will lie idle fon any length of time. Even at this season, which in always a dull one in Sydney, both the Dock, and the slip are busily engaged. At present the fine clipper ship Phoebe Dunbar, the property of Messrs. Dunbar and Sons, is undergoing a complete overhauling and thorough repair at Waterview This ship is of 1000 tons bu*then ; and it will be remembered that upwards of two months ago, by mistaking the right channel she went on shore at Moreton Bay, whither she was bound from London with immigrants. She lay stranded, there for six weeks, but after her cargo was discharged she with great difficulty was got off. It was ascertained that she had sprung a leak aft ; and a temporary water-tight compartment was constructed, by which means, and by the aid of the pumps, she was brought on to Sydney, and on the 1st instant taken into Waterview graving dock. The repairs which she is now undergoing include a new keel and dead wood, new stem-post and rudder, and new foremast,, which is a fine sample of Kauri pine. She will be entirely refastened newly caulked and coppered and will receive every other necessary repair contingent on so serious a misfortune. Captain Rountree promises that she will be ready within the next fortnight to be placed on the berth for London or elsewhere. The works at the Fitz Roy Dock continue- to progress favourably, and the opera- tions for destroying the rock, at the entrance are nearly completed. We may. add that we have been permitted the perusal ofl a private letter received by the last mail, andidated Paris, April 14th. The writer, who is a member of an eminent. Parisian« firm, that is contemplating the imme- diate-opening of an extensive direct import and--* export trade between Havra- and Port Jackson., and Port Phillip, states that the two models« (exhiMted in the late IParis Exhibition) of tlie Waterview and Fita ßoy Dry Dock»*-, attracted considerable attention amongst those in France who are engagfidtia maritime advorv tures in the South Pacific ;. and the writer ex-i presses his belief that the certain knowledge now possessed by owners^ofi French bottoms, of heavy burthen, that theiri ?wessels, whatever .be . the amount of tháir tonnage-, can be overhauled», and'thoroughly repaired,.bo6,A with despatch and economy in Port Jackson« must have a direct tendency to advance- thaô which is JOW a. rapidly increasing trad« between France and the Australian colonies.
