In the import market thi3 week there has not been that improvement that might have been ex pected, business, generally, having been rather in active than otherwise ; thore has been no specula tive inclination evinced throughout, ana the great activity displayed last week in provisions has com pletely quieted down. Com sacks have again been brisk, and a further advance in prico has been estab lished. Candles have not improved. Chicory is firm, and higher rates are obtained for coffee. Soda crystals aro better. Chest opium has gone up some what. Raisins, as the season advances, improve. Herrings are lower. Tho flour market is steadier, but all feeding grains aro dull and doclining. Blast ing powder looks upwards. Hops and malt realise better prices. Provisions aro not so brisk. Sugar is tho turn in favor of sellers. Salt is drooping. Teas aro brisk. Tobacco is lively.

Ale and Stout,— Bulk alo remains exceedingly dull, and shows as yet no signs of improvement. Since the largo sales reported last weok, business lias been confined to supplying trado wants. Bass's No. 3 is almost nominal at £0 15s ; lioldors are now moro anxious to quit, and a reduction on this figure would bo accepted for parcels. Allsopp's sells at £6 5s. Marrian's meets with trade purchasers at £7 12s 6d to £7 15s, the lattor figure having been realised for two small lots to-day. Tho Carlislo Company's brings £7 12s Od.

In Scotch ales thore is little doing, and prices are nominal at £5 10s to £6. Tho de mand for stout is vory small, nnd quite insufficient to curry off supplios, lower rates have in consequence been submitted to. Allsopp's is now offered at £6, Whithroad's at £6 10s, and Taylor, Walker and Co.'s at £6 15s, aud buyers of parcels would lie mot by a concession on oven those rates. Bottled alo hns received moro attention, and fine sound conditioned lotB liavo been readily picked up. Arrol's, on the spot and to arrive, lias been placed at 103.
