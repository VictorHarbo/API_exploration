TO BE AT YOUR BEST You must get rid of any touch of dyspepsia, liver trouble, or constipation that may be troubling you. Fitness depends largely upon the healthy activity of the digestive processes. If the function of digestion is considerably disturbed, from whatever cause, general debility and depression will ensue. If, on the other hand, your diges- tive organs are kept in good working order you will experience all the good effects of sound, robust health. Your aim should be to bring the organs of digestion as nearly to a pitch of perfect efficiency as posible. When they ara at their best you will be at your best. Excellence of digestion is the usual reward of those who TAKE BEECHAM'S PILLS. TAKE BEECHAM'S PILLS. TAKE BEECHAM'S PILLS.

One of Dickens's famous characters astonished and horrified the guardians of the public institution in which he was lodged by asking for "more." Oliver Twist's hungry little body could not content itself with the meagre ration of thin porridge that formed the breakfast allowance of his fellow-inmates. The public of Queens- land—not to mention other places—continue, with almost monotonous though not unwelcome reiteration, to ask for more copies of the CHRISTMAS "QUEENSLANDER'' each year. But the publishers are not disturbed by the repeated request; they con- tinue to respond to the call by annually adding to the number. Last year the usual extra demand was anticipated and provision made for an extra supply of Christmas numbers; but again the unsatisfied public clamoured for "More ! " This year the issue will be larger than ever—and, of course, better than ever—that goes without; saying. The "Queenslander" presses have been hard at work for some weeks turn- ing out the thousands upon thousands of printed sheets that go to make up the mammoth Christmas issue, and they will be busy right up to the day of publication. The issue is limited, therefore, by the time available to print it, and after December 2 no more can be turned out. So the man or woman who leaves things to the last moment may not be able to secure a copy at the end. It is good policy to make assurance doubly sure by Ordering in advance, and newsagents are already booking orders for copies on behalf of the wise ones. They will not be disappointed. DECEMBER 2 is the date of the 1911 Christmas "Queenslander," and by that time residents of Brisbane and places within easy reach will he in a position to pronounce judgment on the issue. It is safe to forecast what that judgment will be. Past experience has shown that the public of Queensland appreciate a local production when it is of good quality, and quality is the first consideration where the Christmas "Queenslander" is concerned. When quality is combined with the recommendation that the whole issue is a product of local industry success should be assured. For everything about the Christmas "Queenslander" is racy of the soil. The pictures are from local photographs, the stories are, with very few exceptions, by local writers, the engrav- ings are prepared on the premises, and the whole of the printing is carried on in the "Queenslander" office by its own plant and its own men. Could any critic desirous of seeing local industry flourish find fault with that ? THE COLOURED SUPPLEMENT this year represents A TIMBER-GETTERS' CAMP at "knock-off" time in the evening—a rural scene that is redolent of honest in- dustry and the peacefulness of the simple life of the men who wage war with the forest giants and provide material for building homes for the thousands of new colo- nists who are arriving every year to do their part in the development of a great country. In addition to the three-colour plate there is an ILLUSTRATED SUPPLEMENT of sixteen pages, representative of varions phases of Queensland life and Queensland scenery. Among the subjects treated are: EVENING ON THE NORTH QUEENSLAND COAST, PIONEERING ON THE BLACKALL RANGE, CATTLE DRAFTING, BLACK SWANS NESTING, FRESHWATER CREEK, NEAR CAIRNS, and various other items illustrative of country life. Two Blackall Range views form a fine double-page picture showing how the primeval scrub is hewn away and transformed into rich sugar or fruit farms. All the pictures are artistically em- bellislied and printed in colours. THE SHORT STORIES are, as usual, mainly by Queensland and Australian authors. A few of them are:— GORDON'S RISE, by I. I. J. BEFORE THE WHITE DAWN, by Patrick Vaux. A DOMESTIC DIFFICULTY, by "Chloe," A COUSIN FROM THE BACK BLOCKS, by Isabel Grant. A ROPE OF SNOW, by Fred M. White, A BELL AND A BULLOCK, by E. A. Daly, THE SIGN OF THE SILVER KEY, by G. R. Sims, THE END OF THE FEUD, by Harold Bindloss, and a number of others by local authors. "THE YOUNG QUEENSLANDER" for; 1911 will show just as much advance on its predecessors as its parent publication. Printed in colours, with an attractive cover design, and filled with stories, pictures, and puzzles, it is just the thing for the younger generation. This little sixteen-page magazine is given away with the Christmas "Queenslander," and helps to make it one of the most desirable of Australian Christmas publications. With all these supplementary attractions, the price of THE CHRISTMAS "QUEENSLANDER" remains at the usual figure— SIXPENCE. Newsagents are now receiving orders. To avoid disappointment, intending pur- chasers should book their copies without delay, and agents are requested to advise the publishing office of their requirements as early as possible. Orders are filled in rotation as received. POSTAGE. NOTE.—The rates of postage on the Christmas "Queenslander" will "be as follows:— Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji.........1d.
