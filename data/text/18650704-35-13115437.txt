HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. The first number of the Haieaiian Gazette, dated 21st January last, was received by the Salsette having travelled to this colony by way of San Francisco, New York, and London. It is a very neatly printed sheet of demy, chiefly filled with official notices, returns, c, but with a few items of news. The Gazelle is to be issued weekly from the Government press at Honolulu as the official organ of the Hawaiian Govenment. Among the new laws of last session which are included in this number of the Gazette, there are four of which it is important that all persons trading with the archipelago in question should take cognisance. The first of these admits coal free of duty. It was assented to on the 31st of December last, and takes effect from that date. ( lite second taking effect from the same date-re- gives the law which formerly existed against prohibit- ing the removal from the kingdom of any native-born Hawaiians (as sailors, c). The third assented to on the 30th of December last, and taking effect six months thereafter (just at the present time repeals the old duty of five percent, ad valorem on rice, and imposes, instead, a duty of one cent (one halfpenny) per pound upon rice in the husk and one cent and a half per pound upon cleaned rice. 'The fourth Act, which relates to foreign imports in general, was also assented to on the 30th of December last, and was ordered to come in force at various periods, according to the countries from which such imports might be shipped. From ports on the Pacific coast of North America it was to come in force in three months from the date of its publication ; from ports in Europe and on the Atlantic coast of North America in six months, and from the other ports in one year from the same date. It will not, therefore, apply to shipments from Australian ports until the 21st of January, 1866, being twelve months after its publication in the Gazette before us. Under this law all goods sent from ports within the consular jurisdic- tion of any Hawaiian Consul or Commercial Agent I must be accompanied. by an invoice containing an account of the market value of such goods, and of all charges, exclusive of any " discounts, bounties or drawbacks, but such has have been actually allowed." 2. An affidavit (made before the Consul or Commercial Agent of the correctness of this invoice. 3 A certificate from the consul or commercial agent authenticating these documents, and declaring his belief that the statements in question are true. On all goods which may be imported without such certificate coming from any port where it could have been obtained duties are to be levied on an increased valuation (by way of penalty) of twenty-five per cent. A law has also been passed " To provide for the importation of labourers and for the encouragement of immigration." It creates a bureau in those fnrtmeiitof the Interior, to be styled the Bureau of immigration," which, among other duties, is to devise means for the importation of foreign labourers to supply the wants of planters and others. The labour required, however, we apprehend, is for mere field work, for which, in such a climate, coolies or China- men would be best suited. We add a few statistics, taken from the only documents of a statistical character published in the Gazette before estate Appropriation Act, and the returns for the year 1864 of the Collostor-Gencral of Customs.
