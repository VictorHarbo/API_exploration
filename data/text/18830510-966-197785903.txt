A. aud JL Society's Show, he was met with a truly loyal ereeting, not only at the Town Hall, where His Worship presented an address, but also on the grounds of the Society, where be was most enthusiastically received. His utterances were listened to. with profound attention, and his after-dinner speech, most happily delivered, was received with rounds of applause, more especially when he alluded to Mr. CROSS'S trophy of INDIGESTION DROPS, and paid a well-merited tribute to their value. The guests gathered around, most of whom at some time or another bad received benefit from them, cheered his remarks to the echo. The popularity which this notice shows the Drops have attained should stimulate our suffering readers to give them a trial, and we are sure the result will be beneficial. —Press Notice.
