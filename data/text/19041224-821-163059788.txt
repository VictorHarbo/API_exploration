The Danish shipping agents are giving the poorest of the refugees free passages to New York. A number of the deserters are "suffering from trachomaâ€”a, specie" of granular ophthalmia. As these poor fellows are prevented by the Unde sirable Immigrants Exclusion Law from entering the United States, they will prob ably seek an asylum in England.
