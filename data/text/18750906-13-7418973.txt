S U M M A R Y . Continued from page 2 of Summary, INTERCOLONIAL. NEW SOUTH WALES. A resolution moved in the Assembly against the removal of strangers was negatived. The Standing Orders Committee reported that the Assembly has no power to punish for breach of privilege or to summon witnesses. It recommends the introduction of a bill to confer these powers. Parliament has been prorogued. In the vice-regal speech, the new Land Law was referred to as being a satisfactory settlement of this most im- portant question. The financial state of the colony was represented as being very flourishing, the increase of revenue for the half-year over that of the corresponding period of last year being over £350,000, an increase, however, which is admitted to have been entirely due to land sales. Other sources of revenue, though they do not materially increase, do not diminish. White has been convicted of the attempt to bribe a member of the Assembly, and sen- tenced to three years' imprisonment. A point has been reserved for the full Court as to the privileges of members in the colony, and the defendant haa been released on bail. The missionary achooner Dayapring, from the New Hebridea, reporta that her boat'a crew waa fired upon by natives at one of the islands, and several of the crew wounded. Madame Ristori, during her visit to Sydney, was extensively feted. A torchlight pro- cession took place, and the Governor gave a picnic in her honour. The annual dinner of merchants and bankers and shipowners waa held on the 17th ult. ; Mr. Alex. Stuart, M.L.A., in the chair, and the guests included the members of the Ministry. The gathering was in every respect a most successful one, and the free trade speeches delivered on the occasion were generally applauded. Mr. Robertson, on behalf of the Government, declared that in the present Cabinet there was no other Bentiment than that of free trade, and gave his assurance that the present Government would go on in the direction towards free- dom of trade in every practical way. Mr. Forster, the Treasurer, added that, whatever Government might be in power, he thought the next seBsion must be characterised by an improvement of the tariff and of the customs laws, and by the removal of all restrictions that prevented tho trade of the port having its fullest development. SOUTH AUSTRALIA. In the Legislative Assembly the third read- ing of tho Education Bill has been passed. The Btamp duties havo been adopted with modifications. A resolution haa been paaaed for the ap- pointment of a commission to inquire into the sanitary state of the city. A motion in favour of the proposed annexa- tion of Now Guinea baa been passed. The aecond reading of the Real Property iBill Ima been carried in the Council. The importa for the loat quarter amounted to £937,000, and the exports to £728,000. The Btaple exporta for the year to dato amount to over two millions sterling. The Government intend to send a fort- nightly telegram home for publication in 27ie Times and English papers about the colony. Twenty-two inches of rain haa fallen to the end of August, which ia the largeat rainfall Bin ce 1S5L The Rev. C. B. Symes haa resigned the pastorate of the Stow Memorial Congrega- tional Church.

The Assembly haa votod an additional £25,000 towarda the conatruction of a graving dock, a quarter of a million for immigration, which it ¡B intended to extend over two years, £27,000 lor railway extenaion, and out of the propoaed loan £40,000 for public buildings. The Council has read the Education Bill a second time, and the Land Bill has been passed through committee. The immigrant Bhip Ophelia has been placed in quarantine. Typhoid favor was prévoient during the voyage, and 14 deaths occurred from varioua cauae8. TASMANIA. Mr. Innes, the Treasurer, baa made bia financial statement. The expenditure for the current year being burdened with £14,000 of arreara, it waa expected that at the close of the year there would bo a Bmall deficit of £4,000. With the current year the apecial Launceaton and Weatern Railway rate of £10,000 expireB, and the whole interest will then bo chargeable to tho conaolidated re- venue, and the main line becomea a liability nextyear for £1G,250. The Government propose extending the main roads, and throwing the burden of repairs on the revenue by abolish- ing tolls. Thua, £31,000 extra will bo re- quired for 1870. At present the completion of the main line of railway by fulfilling the terms of the contract ia conaidered doubtful, Ministers, therefoio, decline proposing any considerable fiscal changes. They propoae, as a temporary measure, a rate of one shilling in the pound on the annual value of pro- perty until the railway liability ia agcer tained. The public worka acheme rejected by the Council lasteeasion will bare-intro- duced in an amended and extended shape. The Opposition on a subsequent occasion attempted to shelve this scheme by referring it to a select committee, but signally failed, and it will be apparently passed in ita en- tirety. Mr. Green, engineer, who has been ap- pointed Government inspector of the main line of railway, reporta very unfavourably on tho contract. NEW ZEALAND. The Treasurer delivered the financial atate ment in the House of Repreaentatives, Wel- lington, on July 30. The expenditure out of loane during four years, 1870 to 1874, WOB £4,289,877, and it was laßt year eatimated that during 1874-5 £3,300,000 would be re- quired in addition to the above. There was ot least the expenditure for current finan- cial year to provide for, say £2,250,000. Out of thia total expenditure of £9,839,877 to be provided for, only £5,795,200 had been raised, and it became necessary to pro- vide the balance of £1,044,077. The Go vernment decided to sell the whole four millions if possible, and though there was some difference of opinion between Sir Julius Vogel and the other Crown agents, it was ultimately agreed to adopt Sir Julius Vogel'a plan. The loan was to be raiaed by Rothschilds at 94, out of which Rothschilds receive a commission of 2 per cent., they taking up three millions immediately, and the remaining one million within a year. The net price received by the colony was £90 19s. 1d. The Government was decidedly of opinion that the courso pursued was the right one, that the operation was marvellously good, and that to Sir J. Vogel waa due the success- ful termination of the negotiations. Roths- childs placed the whole loan, and £3,107,571 had been paid to the credit of the public account at the date of last advice (31st May). The summary of the loan tables waa as follows :-Authorised, £11,750,000 ; expended to 30th June, 1875, £7,739,413 ; liabilities, £2,531,923 ; available balance, £1,478,664. The balance yet to be raised waa £1,954.800. The public debt on June 30 waa £17,671,100; lesa accrued sinking fund, £1,074,010. The annual amount for interest, £835,150 ; and the sinking fund, £110,035. Of the debt, tho colony had a balance in hand of £2,167,890, being cash raised, but not yet expended, although sub- ject to outstanding liabilities. Besides thia, the accumulated ainking fund, £1,074,610, really represented the extinction of BO much indebtedness. When the amount still to be raised ia obtained, the total indebted- ness will be £19,380.906, and the total annual charge thereon £1,035,775 ; hut before this prospective debt ia reached, the whole oflthe balanco now available, plus the pro- ceeds of the portions of loans to be raised, £3j877,696, will bave to be expended. Assuming this to be two years, the accumu- lated sinking fund will by that time have practically reduced the debt to £17,080,000. The estimate of revenue formed had been exceeded by £108,402, the revenue received being 1,605,003, or £184,785 in excesB of the provioua year. The total " consolidated re veri ae" for the last year, including £90,357 assets yet to be realised, and £205,500 sur- plus from the previous year, amounted to £1,900,800, and che expenditure to £1,786,414, leaving a surplUB of £120,440. The ordinary Land Fund amounted to £773,265, showing a coriaiderable falling off.- The eatimated re- venue for the current year, inolnding surplus fromlastyear, was £2,476,103, and the expen- diture-baeodon the assumption that tho,pro vincialformofgovernmentwouldbeaboliBned throughout the .colony during the present aeBBion of Parliament-£2.406,400, leaving an ' estimated surplus of £70,793. The gold duty it y/a» not intended to abolish, bat it waa proposed to'apply the whole of the receipts from that source to the making of roads and public works on gold-fields. , : At a caucus meeting of Government sup- porters held ' on July 31, a resolution moved by Mr. Stafford, approving of tho Govern- ment bills and pledging all present to support them through the session, was carried, but it waa evident that great diversity of opinion existed. At a meeting of the Opposition held on AuguBt 2, Sir George Grey waa unanimously nominated leader, and authorised to be the exponent of their viewa. Tho Oppoaition have determined to use all Parliamentary forms to stop the pasaago of the Abolition Bill this session, and will speak against time if necessary. In the House of Repre- sentatives on August 4, on moving the House into committee of supply, Sir George Grey announced the formation of an or- ganised Opposition. The main objects they would have in view would be to strictly in- quire into the finances of the colony, and to take every opportunity of criticising and opposing the carrying out of the proposed revolutionary change in the constitution of the colony. In the course of his remarks he proceeded to refer to His Excellency in terms of censure, and as if he had allied himself with the party in power by having his name associated with such an unconsti- tutional measure as the Abolition Bill. The Speaker called the hon. gentleman to order, and explained that His Excellency was the impersonation of Her Majesty, and must not be referred to in terms of praise or cen- sure. Tbe debate on the Abolition of Pro- vinces Bill was expected to be concluded on August 30. The return of gold exported from the colony during last quarter is as followa : Auckland, lO.OGGoz.; Nelson, 3,G55oz.; West port, 5,43002.; Greymouth (Nelson). 12.303o¿ ; Greymouth (Westland), 5,545oz.: Hokitika, 10,72Goz.; Dunedin, 2t),G03oz ; Invercargill, 724oz. The total value was £313,210. Several destructive fires have occurred at Dunedin. The Princess Theatre waa burnt down on tlie morning of August 3, and the City Council Hall, next to tho building, had a narrow escape. Most of the actora lost their wardrobes and theatrical eilects. A fire took place in the House of Representatives at Wellington on August 5, but waa speedily cxtinguißbed. The opening of the Dunedin and Clutha Railway was definitely fixed for Septeinbor 1. FIJX There is no news of importance from the Fiji Islands. According to the latest advices H.M.S. Barracouta, with Governor Gordon on board, had been visiting Savu and Nandi witha viewtochoose abetter Bite than Levuka for the capital of Fiji, and arrangements had been made for the swenring in of the now Government on the 22nd September. COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. TUE MAILS. ThoR.M.S.S. Pera, Captain Robert Meth- ven, took her departure from Hobson's Bay on her outward voyage on the afternoon of the 10th nit, after taking on board hermoils, passengers, and specie. The K.M.S.S. Golconda, Captain W. B. Hall, with the mails imvard from Europe, India, and China, reached Hobson's Bay on the 22nd ult. The Torres Straits mail steamer Bowen arrived at Sydney on the lGth ult. The Californian mail Bteamer Macgregor reached Sidney on the 21st ult., with the San Francisco and North American mails on board. STATE OP TRADE. Business throughout the paBt month has been unusually dull ; but, though that can he accounted for aa the result of temporary causes over which there could be no control, it is not the less vexatious on that account, coming, ÜB it baB done, on the back of BO long a period of depression. Generally, the month of August ia one of activity in busi- ness, na the Bpring trade commences to open out then, just after tho heaviness of tho winter season is being got rid of, and with all the more animation on that account. This year, however, inBtead of the fine weather »vith which \»e are generally favoured, incessant rains have prevailed, and the roads in the interior have in consequence been in such a state aa to put a complete stop on all country business. Fortunately, however, notwith- standing all this, nothing has occurred to affect mercantile confidence in any way. Mr. Henry Sims, timber dealer and contr'ictor, Footscray, with liabilities on one account amounting to £10, G00 nnd on another to £3,877, has been forced into the Insolvent Court, but with that exception wo havo not had occasion to report a single failure during the month. A great deal of thia steadiness is, there is no doubt, to be traced to the care- ful and judicious conduct of the banks, which have the power ii they choose to try either to create a panic or avert it, and we think we can truthfully aver that during tho last six months the policy of these institu- tions has been in the right direction, and to a mucb greater extent than could even be Bupposed, sufficient evidence of which is to be found in the quarterly statistical returns of tho banks jUBt published, where we leam that increased accommodation, to the extent of half a million, was afforded to the public in that quarter over the preceeling, the figures being £408,979. For somo time previous to the departure of the last mail steamer negotiations were pending amongst the Associated Banks- including the Bank of New Zealand, which was instrumental in creating the disruption-with the view of bringing about an arrangement of a satis- factory character in regard to the interest and discount rates ; and on the 14th ult. it was announced that an agreement had been made to reduce the rates of interest on de- posits of 12 months to 5 per cent., six months' deposits to 4 per cent., and that 3 per cent. should be allowed on deposits of three months. Exchange on London was at the same time raised J percent, viz., to J percent premium, ,but the rates of discount wore allowed to remain unaltered. The effect of this move- ment will only become known when the banks' returns for the quarter ending De- cember next are published. In the mean- time, we cannot refrain from pointing out that the public havo not alono benefited by tho high rates of intereat thus paid by the banks, although at the time it was thought to be a wrong move, for wo find that the re- sources of these institutions have been greatly strengthened by the inducement afforded to outside capitalists to invest their money in the colony, as well as by the large sums transferred from the deposit at call to fixed deposit ; and though it was at one time thought that the result would bo loss, a further examination of these returns showa the contrary to have been the case. We find in the returns referred to, that the dividende! paid by these establishments in 1875, up to the quarter ending 30th June, exceed by £92,000 the dividends paid up to the corre- sponding quarter in 1874, thus affording a very strong argument in favour of a reduction of the discount rateB from such an exorbitant charge aa 7, 8, and 9 per cent, for billa having two, three, and four months to run, and 10 per cent on overdrafts, which hitherto merchantB have been compelled to pay, and more especially so now when the rate in England has dropped to 2 per cent. ; the boon cannot be conceded too soon. A considerable amount of relief was afforded to business people in the beginning of the month through the Customs discon- tinuing the collection of duties under Mr. Service's proposed tariff, and reverting to the collection of duties under the old tariff, the difference obtained in excess through the new tariff being, consequent on ita rejec- tion returned. Since out last tho new Ministry have all met their constituents, and been duly elected. Whatever policy Mr. Berry intends to place before Parliament,ït ia notyet clear that he intends to make any alteration in the existing tariff, and thus merchants cannot avoid having to go through another period of uncertainty, which must have a most prejudicial effect on business, such frequent changea not being calculated to im- prove traded Parliament, however, meet to- morrow, and.tho uncertainty now exne rienced will it ia hoped be soon onded. Transactions during the month now closed have'been very circumscribed. Business in bulk and bottled alca has, owing to the un- settled weather, been very slow. In Dun dee goods nothing whatever has been done. Operations in candles have been almost entirely confined to the disposal of faulty parcels, and of such descriptions a line of 6,600 boxes was cleared off. Oi sound, sales to the extent of 2,500 boxes havo been reported. A firmer feeling in coffee ia the only feature of that market. Advices to to band are very favourable, and advance In price is the result Breadstuffa have risen in value ; very little business has been done, however, in consequence of the great pauoity of Buppliee. Within the week a decline in England has' been announced by telegraph. This bas not, however, caused any fall in Adelaide as < yet, > and it is not likely /'that our own market will suffer until at least thOBO more immediately dependent on the maintenance of prices ia England feel ?tho'effect' Frnita bave' beeta dull, but are now Improving in value. Koroseno oil has been very heavy; and all the business reported ,naa'gone through the auction room. In this manner nearly ,7,000 cases have been dis- pose», of) cut at a reduction of a halfpenny { ¡ on last month's quotations. A good trade has been done in oilmen's stores, thought I still far short of last month's aalea. Sug«ra have been very dull. The Victorian Coru. pany'a refined sorte monopolise the market, 1 and the business done otherwise ia now of very little account An ordinary quantity of; i Mauritius, Java, and Queensland aorta I baa alao found ita way into the hands of the trade. Teas have not excited much atten. tion, the novelty attendant on the new season ia now over, and business of late has i been very quiet. So much ia thia tho casa 1 that even the danger of any complication arising between England and the Chinese i government has failed to impart an impetus. IThe only new feature is the arrival of tho ; Somerset The timber market is very do. 'pressed. Tobaccoes have been very activo, and over 3,500 package» of Cameron's alone I havo changed hands Willes have been slow. Brandies have been completely neglected, I and values have declined considerably, I The Golconda, with the English, Indi.f, [and China mails, reached Adeluide early o'V the morning of the 20th, Her datea from?V London are to July 9, and tho ahipmenta advised to Melbourne show an increase, as compared with the previous month, amounting to £107,100. The anxiety felt in regard to the Ceylon, in consequence of her delay in reaching Galle, caused the arrival of the Golconda to be looked forward to with much eagerness, and iwhen it waa found that the Ceylon had not only arrived at King George'a Sound, but after a two doyB' detention had proceeded again on her voyage on the 24th ult, much speculation waa indulged in as to her pro- bable fate- she being then 13 days behind her time of arrival at Galle. Fortunately, before even the Golconda reached the bay here, on Sunday, the 22nd inst., any further anxiety was relieved by a telegram which WOB received on tho 21at announcing the Ceylon's arrival at her destination. Tlio Bowen, with the Torres Straits and China mailB, arrived at Sjdney on the 10th ult. The arrival at Sjdney of tho a a. Macgregor, on the morning of thp 21at, with the Cali- fornian and American nu>ils, was telegraphed here on that day. lier datea from San Franciaco are to 19th July, and from Now York to 10th July. By these maila wo have advices from Foo-chow to July 10 (only threo doya later than by the Pardo), from Java to July 17, from Singoporo to July 24, from Saigon to July 7, from Manila to July 5, from Calcutta to July 4, from Colombo to July 25, from Hong Kong io July 15. EXCHANGE AND SIONET. The rate of exchange on London for GO das a' Bight bank drafts has been raised to £ per cent, premium ; the buying rate remains unaltered at par. Interest ia paid jy the banks at the rate of 5 per cent, on 12 months' deposits, 4 per cent, on BIX months', and 3 per cent, on three montliB' deposits. Tho banka continuo to chorge 7, 8, and 9 per cent, on two, three, and four montha' bills, re- quiring 10 por cent, for ovordraft. STATIONS. There has not been much in this class of property, it being now almoat too near shearing for much to bo done. On the 28th ult MeEBra. R.
