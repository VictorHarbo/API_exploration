Resolutions were adopted setting out "That the action taken by sugar mill workers supported by officials of the A.AV.U. is apparently an effort to de prive Italians of the rights of citizen ship, at the snme time damaging their property and depriving them of a llve- lihood." The resolution also stated that as the sugar milt -workers were crushing cane supplied by Germans, Spaniards, Russians, French, Swiss, Japanese, j Chinese, and incn of other nationalities they were of the opinion that the Ital ian nationality had been subjected to humiliation and inhuman insults which were both unjust and unfair, as in the Great AVar Italians fought and died for the cause of Britain and her Allies.
