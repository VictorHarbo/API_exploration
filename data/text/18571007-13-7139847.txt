COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. Argus Office, Tuesday Evening. ' Notwithstanding that many of the second houses are sending away large parcels of goods to the interior, there appears to be no improvement whatever in the import market. Flour is dull at £24 per ton for first brands of Adelaide ; bran has been sold at 2s. 7d. and 2s. 8d. per bushel. Messrs. W.Boeey and Co. sold by auction to-day 2,000 bushels of Danish oats, ex Monarch, at 7s. per bushel. The cargo of Mauritius sugars ex Fair Barbadian was sold by the same firm. The qualities consisted chiefly of good to fair yellow, and the quantity was not over 800 bags. Fine white crystals brought £60 15s. per ton good yellows £61 10s. to £53, and fine yellows £54 to £56 per ton. The wool season may now be said to have commenced, as large parcels of the new clip are on their way towards the port. Messrs. J H. Clough and Co. report having sold 9 bales of greasy fleece at 12d. per lb, ; 150 bales of ships at 16d. ; 8 bales of mixed at 8d. ; 112 bales of scoured at from 2s. Old. to 2s. 4d. and 16 bales of handwashed at Is. 10d: per lb. Beef tallow has changed hands at £48 per ton. Our dates from Sydney are to the 3rd inst. The import markets of that city appear to be equally dull to our own. At the monthly meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, the question of commercial tribunals was brought prominently forward. The president, in his opening address, remarked : One of the great features of this institution was that of their arbitrations. Nothing was fairer and more straightforward, but he believed It was very little known to the public the principles on which the Chamber of Commerce was conducted. He would now state them, so that they might be more generally known. He would take, for example, the case of two litigants. They each choose three members of the committee wheatley were willing to have as arbitra- tors of their dispute. They then had nothing more to do with it. The rest is left to the committee, who have no interest in the matter, who say A and B were the two best men to judge on this question, and A and B have then the power of electing an umpire before they commenced. On what principle of common reason could they adjudicate, except for justice ? because they would have the op-. portunity of examining carefully into the matter, which they would not have in a court of justice, where they would be bound by the etiquette of law to decide according to law, and equity would be entirely shut out. The fees of an arbitration were only from If. Is. to 102. 10s. He had gone a little out of his way to point out the great advantage and usefulness of the Chamber, and if it were more generally known, as he hoped it would be, he was confident it would be more thought of by the public Without further comment, he had only to say that it afforded him very great pleasure that they really had a Chamber of Commerce : hitherto they had had none. He said not dismiss this subject without acknowledging- the I oft-told obligations they had been under to the committee of the Sydney Exchange, who had afforded them an asylum, - Now he thought they had a chamber worthy of the name of the Chamber of Commerce j, and which he trusted would keep pace with the pri- , gross of this rising colony. (Hear, hear.) of THE quarterly revenue returns of the colony j had been published in the Gazette. The' Sydney Morning Herald gives the following digest of the official statement :- I u the amount of Customs revenue collected during the quarter ended 30th September, 1860, was a 123,0701. 10s. 6d.; for the same period of 1857, 120,6082 178.21.

The same journal reports of the markets : Flour. - The market is very inactive, but prices continue without alteration. Fine flour 26 per ton, seconds, £23 per ton. Liquids Brandy is still very dull of sale, and there is no disposition to purchase on speculation at present prices, namely, 16s. 6d. to 10s. Bum continues In fair demand, and 80 op. Is saleable at from 6s. 6d. to 6s. Genova is firm at 18s 6d. to 18s. 6d. In wines there have been no transactions of importance this week, and prices are the same as last week. Ale and porter in bulk are firm, and are likely to improve in price. Bottled ales and porters command 10s. to 10s. 6d. per dozen. Grocorios.-Notwithstanding a continuation of fine weather, and the improved condition of the roads, carriage is still scarce, and continues at such enormous rates as to preclude storekeepers purchasing beyond actual requirements. Consequently there has not been that activity in the market which might otherwise have been anticipated. Teas. Operations this week have been of a more limited character, some of the trade having stocked themselves, and others decline buying in the present condition of the markets in expectation of a decline. As, however, teas cannot be imported to pay under present rates, and stocks here are known to be extremely low, with no prospects of any large arrivals, holders are not anxious to press sales. The two leading houses have withdrawn their best teas until after the arrival of the mail, convinced that the next advices will be of such a character as to warrant even much higher rates. A few parcels of congous have changed hands at £8 16s. to £0 ; boxes are in demand at 22s 6d. to 35s. per box. Coffee The last advices from Melbourne show a decided improvement in plantation, but in other descriptions there is no altera- tion ; a portion of Manilla, ex Grey Feather, has been placed at Sid. ; native Ceylon Is offering at 7d. to 8d. ; good samples of Java are hold for 6d. Candles are without much inquiry : several large parcels of damaged have been thrown upon the market lately, which has kept the dealers supplied and not Improved prices. Shipments continue heavy, without a corresponding demand. Price's No. 1 may be quoted at is. 2d., but the quality of those recently to hand are very inferior to his usual manufacture. Dried Fruits. Shipments of currants are large In consequence of which, and the low rates In England, prices have given way. A few parcels from the ship's side have been taken at 7d. to 7d. ; raisins are firm at 8d. to 8d. Muscatels, really prime, are very scarce and wanted. Sago. Market supplied and rates easier. Elco. Import ors are firm for boat samples of Patna at 30s. ; Java wanted, none in the market. a sugar. Raw sugars have again advanced, owing to the advices received from Manilla by the Grey Feather. All sugars were very scarce, so much so that for the St. George, a vessel loading for Melbourne, 18 dollars had been paid for clayed rats that would make this sugar cost, landed here, fully 6d. per ton and Pampagna. 001. The Company having announced their intention of raising their price for Pampagna to 502., very heavy purchases have been made by the trade at about 192. Refined sugars are in good demand, at the Company's quotations, which are as follows Loaf, 702. ; snowdrops, 102\. ; crystals, 062. to 072. ; pieces, 002. ; treacle, 302. ; colonial rum, 3s. 6d., for 28 o.n., duty paid. Cigars. Some 200 cases (or two millions) No. 2 Manilla have changed hands during the week, the bulk of which we understand are intended to close export orders, which have been accumulating for some time past. The market is, therefore, if we ? exclude the lost arrival, almost entirely in the hands of one party, who, it is said, intends to hold for an Improved figure. The now cigars por Grey Feather are offering by the brokers at 52s. 6d., but a preference is given to the more mature artiolo-old stocks. We have nothing now to report in the tobacco market. Messrs. Mort and Co. hold to-day their weekly produce sale. The quantity of wool offered was exceedingly small twenty bales. The demand, however, for airdoseriptlons of wool continues active, and prices are fully maintained. New Zealand and washed, Is. 8d.; mixed, 10d. to Is. 6d.; grease, lOfd. ; lainbB', Is, lOld.; damaged, Is. 23d. ; locks, Is. 3rd. Sheepskins continue in request, and, although there has been a large quantity to hand, they were readily taken at from 9d. to 4s, per lb. Tallow. There have been no arrivals this week, and prices consequently are nominally the same namely, hoof. 172. 10s. to 102. 10s. ; mutton, 102. to 612. and station, 162. to 622 10s. per ton. Hides A large quantity (about 700) were sold to-day, but they were not of first-rate quality. The prices obtained averaged from 16s. 6d. to 25s. Skins, 3s. 6d. to 11s. 6d. ; small do. 1s. to 2s. 5d. A lot of shank bones brought 102. per ton ; horns, 12s. to 15s. per 100; hoofs, 22s. 6d. per ton; and hair, 6d. per lb. The Sydney branch banks have lowered the I Belling rate of exchange to 2 per cent, premium s for sixty days'' bills. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. At the usual weekly meeting of the Committee of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, 6th October, 1867 ; present E. L. Montefiore, Esq., in the chair. ; Messrs. L. Josephs, W. P. Muir, T. A. Drysdale, Thos. Bao, and A. H. Newell, The minute's of the previous meeting were read and confirmed. A letter worded from Mr. W. DoiBb, requesting the Chamber to " signify its willingness or otherwise to recognise the surveys and awards made by the members of the Victorian Association of Marine Surveyors I and Arbitrators." I The Secretary was requested to state, In reply, that three gentlemen have already been recognised as marine surveyors, by a special general meeting of this Chamber, convened for the purpose, December 3rd, 1860. On the recommondation of the subcommittee appointed to report upon the application of the Melbourne J Brokers' Association, It was resolved "That the Committee of the Chamber of Commerce approves of the establishment of the Melbourne Brokers' Association, and recognises its desirability in this community ; but the committee does not feel itself justified in affording thcIAssoclation its recognition or recommendation until it has submitted to the Chamber a code of practice, and made some satisfactory progress with the public." I It was also resolved, That the Secretary be instructed to communicate with the various Chambers of Commerce throughout the colony with the view to obtain- ing an interchange of copies of minutes of proceedings, and establishing a more intimate correspondence with them." The following letter was received from the office of the Chief Secretary :- I " Chief Secretary Office, Melbourne, i '. 30th September, 1857. i "Sir By desire of the Chief Secretary, I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., forwarding copies of reports of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce relating to the formation of a River and Harbor Trust, and I am to inform you that they will receive the early consideration of the Government. " I have the honor to be, Sir, - - « Your very obedient servant, (Signed) J. MOORE, : "J.O.Francis, Esq., President of the Chamber of : Commerce." i JOHN BUSSELL, Secretary. i 59 gallon; butter, Is. 6d.; bacon and hams, Is. 4d. : candles, 1s. 4d. to is. 6d. ; oilmen's, stores fruits, 20a. ; jams, 21s. ; pickles 10s. to 16s. ; ale and ' porter, 21s. per dozen. I PORT ALBERT, 2nd October But little agricultural produce is now offering. Hay is very scarce. AS not | 200 ozs. of gold have been brought down during the week. Messrs. Schiller and Thiel have purchased I to boat at 8s. 6d. per bushel ; oats, 10s. (6d, to Its. 01. I do. ; potatoes, 72 to 122. portion; eggs, Is. (43, per j dozen. ?- ' BALLAARAT, 6th October We have to report back scratching in almost every department of business 11. I Stocks on hand at present are extremely light, and conscquontlyourhlghostquotatlons may be considered as the ruling prices. It is, however, to be recollected ! that large orders have been forwarded echometer polls, and considerable purchases have there been made. The weather continues so changeable wine merchants await the definite setting in of the summer e, in order that they may be enabled to take advantage of the reduction which must take place in cartage. With the present amount of competition this coast deration becomes of much importance. The upward tendency of the market cannot, therefore, be called I lated upon as likely to continue for any lengthened ' period, as the present inclement season must so DU I terminate. Large arrivals will follow, as a natural > consequence. Wheat is very scarce in this day 1 trict and the surrounding neighborhood. A a quantity not yet thrashed out is held by farmer i, I in hopes of advanced prices. For wheat di I livered here from 11s. 6d. to 12s. is obtainable ; i for choice samples the latter quotation is readily realised. Flour There has been a good demand for flour during the past week, the ruling I price for first-class brands being 342. per ton. Van. J Diemen's Land, 382. The stock on hand of all sorts 1 being limited. Potatoes. A very scant supply and J demand above the average Spirits, Beers, Yes-No material alteration can be reported. There is at increased demand for Byass's (bottled) and stocks being low, prices are Arm. Button-Some inquiry has been made for butter, but without any advance being realised. Oilmen's Stores are exceedingly scarce Bottled fruits of good brands fully worth 21s. and pickles (pint), 14s. There has been a slightly increased demand for salad oils. The general aspect of trade during the week has been cheering, notwithstanding the difficulty experienced in collecting J accounts. A busy and prosperous summer is con f fluently anticipated Times.
