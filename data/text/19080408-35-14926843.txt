MR. KIDSTON ACTIVE. BRISBANE, Tuesday. An important statement was made by the Premier to a deputation representing the primary industries of the State which waited upon him to day for the purpose of pointing out to him the prospect of the unprecedented deficiency in the supply of suitable labour and urging the adoption of such steps as would secure the introduction to Queensland of sufficient labour to meet the demands of the agricultural and dairying industries Mr Kidston in the course of a lengthy reply said it was eminently desirable that we should fill up this great empty territory They had considered the desirableness of fill ing up the State but they had also to con- sider the matter from the position of both employers and employees He had not tried to find out what the position was in regard to the sugar industry If the farmers and sugar mills had any difficulty in finding men this season it was entirely their own fault Men who could get employees landed here for Â£5 had no reason to cry out. One of his chief purposes in going to the old country at the present time was to advertise Queensland primarily and to set about it in a systematic way and to spend money on it and have it done as it ought to be done Mr Kidston said he also wanted to organise not only the Agency General in London but to get better and more central premises and work it more on business lines by adopting more suitable and modern requirements He wanted to break it up into a number of agencies in different centres and to advertise Queensland all over England Scotland and Ireland they would go to Ger- many later and also try to get Danish and Swedish Immigrants First there was the system of advertising Queensland which will cost a great deal of money which will in augurate a steady stream of immigrants to Queensland If Queensland were in a proper condition and relation to the old country we should have 20 000 families a year instead of the practical stoppage that has taken place but we are down in the estimation of the old country and have been down for years and it needs a very great effort to lift us back into such prominence as Canada "U o are primarily wanting farming industries not only Inborners He was going to take the question of advertising Queensland in hand and he was quite sure that his rearrangement would enormously increase the number of immigrants from the Old Country Concluding Mr Kidston said When I say these things I mean them
