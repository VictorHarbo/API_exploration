I have tho honour to uimouuce that I shall bo the OPPOSITION CANDIDATE for your Electorate at the forthcoming General Elections. As soon as Parliament is dis solved, I shall take the earliest opportunity of placing my views before you.— I am, gentle men, your obedient servant, James Congrove. rjO THE ELECTORS OF BULIMBA. Gbntlkjibw, When I accepted your requisition to con test the scut for Bulimbu. I hoped that tho Hon. James R. Diokson, M.L.A., would ho my only opponent. It now appears definitely that this is not to bo so, but that my can didature is likely to be interfered with by one who-e policy will cause uu alienation from mo of some votes at least. It will be palpable to you all tlwt a con test with the Prime Minister of the colony, when votes are to bo thus split in his favour, oau only result in a fruitless expondirura of time aud money. Under these circumstances I am compelled to retiro from the cobtest. I do so with vory great roluctuuce and with extreme regret, aud I trust that un oppor tunity will shortly arrive when I may serve the colony of Queensland as a member of its Parliament. Iu conclusion, I desire to thank you all for the courteous aud kindly reception which litis been extended to me wherovev I have ap peared iu your electorate. arthur lilley. TO THE ELEGT0RS OF MORETON The dissolution of Parliament will afford me another opportunity for offering my ser vices us your representative. Before tho Election I hope to visit many centres of population iu tho district, and to state as fully us possible iny views upon the present position of affairs ; but I respect your judgment, do not canvass for support either personally or by agents, and am content to let the ballot-box declare your choice. The progressive policy" advocated by some, involving largo additions to our in debtedness and interest bill, betrays an imprudent indifference to the warnings of 1860 and 18U3, when "boom" was quickly followed by "burst." The policy I advocate consists mainly of the studdy pursuit of British Immigration ; the ucttlemeut of thriving families of our own kith and kin upon our vast territories ; tho development of our export trade ; tho en couragement of individual and co-oporative enterprises, especially those by which our raw products may bo brought to good markets. I attach great iinportauoo to the train ing of our youth, and would seo our excellent education system improved by being rendered less bookish, more conducive to tho fostering amongst youngsters of a liking for useful arts ami handicrafts, aud a bettor foundation for tho mauy sided State of which wo huvo tho making. 'Continuation classes, experimental farms, und technical colleges would furnish our young men and women with much needed means of self-im provement. As regards Federation, I am of opinion thnt wo should advance with caution. Tho "open door" is to bo approved, yet we should not forget that it is not loug since we freed ourselves from southern domination. Fede ration will bo a costly experiment. "Im perialism means militarism." I prefer in dustrialism. The fullest disoussiou of tho question is eminonlly denivablo. Since ull pay taxes, are subjeot to the laws, and uro alike interested iu their just administration, all should possess tho franchise. I look forward with hopo to the timo when evory man and womuu amongst us (of course excoptiug criminals und lunntics) shall bo enabled and induced to contribute directly to tho common stook of political wisdom. Our beat safe guard against the foreign aggression, which some deem possible, and our best euro for npatlietio unconcern ul>out tho public good, , arc to bo found in the admission of all to a privilege und responsibility at present ex clusively confined to one-half the community. Seeing deficiencies us woll us merits in both tho coalitions which constitute the present Assembly, I am unable to profess entire agree ment with cither. I propose to support the Government iu so far us its future policy, not yet disclosed, is found to coincide with tfie views I have indicated. But tho best Government needs watchful critioism. To advance measures calculated to promote tho public interest, whatever their origin, is the obvious duty of an offieiont representative. My aim will bo to rccoguiso tlio merits of both tho contending parties. If returned, 1 intend to make my abode principally in your dietriot, in order to bo- come more fully acquainted with its local wants. A. M. FRANCIS.
