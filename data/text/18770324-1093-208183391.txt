In tie present juncture it is of the higher, importance that you should choose the best men to represent you in the Legislative Council I have determined to support Mr. Inglehy and shall give him ONE VOTE, for the following REASONS. 1\. He is a gentleman of matured experience who on points of law is equal to any of the Bar.—Vide Bur yip, March 9. 2\. He is an "Honest Lawyer."—Vide Methodist Journal, March 16. 3\. His views on the alterations desirable in the Constitution Act are in advance «f those of any other candidate. 4\. He is in favor of a Property Tax, not for the mere purpose of raising additional Revenue, but with the object of readjusting the burden of taxation, which is now mainly paid by persons whose income is under £200 a year, and compelling jthe holders of property to contribute towards the payment of the interest on Loans, the expenditure of which on Roads, Bridges, .and Jetties directly benefits landed pro prietors, and because it is the only Tax which Absentees can he c ompellod to pay 5.' He does not belong to any political party but is a truly representative man. 6\. He is in favor of amending the Real Property Act, and applying it to all Real Property. It will be seen that Sir. Inglehy's views are eminently progressive, and are not limited to the passing questions of the day. 82-3zx£3 AN ELECTOR. TO THE ELECTORS OE THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen—Not being able to visit the numerous districts in the colony, it is desirable that I should state to you what I am in favor of supporting in case of being returned. I am in favor of opening up the Murray Mouth, and making Victor Harbor suitable for large ship ping ; improvements of Port Adelaide, survey of wider roads for stock travelling, a liberal Land Bill, a larger area of acres for the farmers, im migration when necessary, properly selected ; railways where necessary, a liberal amended Mineral Act and royalty, water supply for townships where needed; will give facilities to a private Company for construction of Outer Harbor, and would like to see private enter prise carry out the work; if, however, the country should at any future time declare in favor of the work being done by the Govern ment, I would support it; amend the Constitu tion Act, utilise the Murray Bridge by railway ■ if thought necessary, jetties and lights on our coast, support a force for th^defence of the colony, and the erection of batteries; also a Militarv-road near the Semaphore. The federation of the colonies should not tamper with the Real Property Act; support the sinking of wells in the Par North, to open up the country for pastoral purposes; should support the colonization of the Northern Terri tory with either European or foreign labor; liberal leases to the squatters where land is not suitable for farmers; support an expenditure for all necessary public works; simplify and lessen the costs in the Supreme Court; support to give the power to the ratepayers of any dis trict to decide by their votes the number of houses that may be licensed for the sale of strong drink. In asking for your support, you have s^en my votes in print during 12 years in Parliament, if you approve of them support me, and if returned shall legislate for the best in terests of this colony that I have resided in for 39g years. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant,' PATRICK BOYCE COGLIN. Brompton Park. 69wa92zx69-90 TO THE ELECTOES OE EAST TORRENS. Gentlemen—At the request of many electors, and in compliance with the cordial reception you gave me at each of our public meetings, I am now a Candidate for the "representation of your district in the House of Assembly. In consequence of the large number of candi dates the newspapers could not report the several meetings beyond a brief summary of their results, supplied by the several candidates, I therefore met you in your several townships and districts, that you might hear my views and form your own opinion of me. So far as my candidature is concerned, the result of the election will depend on the electors who were present at those meetings. I have net published the names of electors who requested me to come forward, nor of those who signed my nomination papers, because to do so would be a violation of the secrecy of the ballot; but I can assure you that they do not include any of the wealthy lower orders or of those who would use the influence of our dis trict in support of such enterprises as a monopoly of our public mineral lands for their own personal profit. I have not asked any man to vote for me, nor employed any person to do it for me; nor have I in any other way evaded the electoral law, nor will I allow any other person to do it on my behalf. I cannot see that it would be more discreditable for a member of the House of Assembly to evade the Contractors in Parlia ment Act than for a candidate to evade the Electoral Act. 83-6x83z JNO. B. HUGHES. TO THE ELECTOES OE EAST TORRENS. Gentlemen—In response to the call of your large and influential deputation, I beg to offer myself as a Candidate to represent you in the House of Assembly. I shall avail myself of an early opportunity to meet you at the different centres of the dis trict, to enable you to ascertain my opinions re garding the various matters likely to engage the attention of Parliament during the approaching session. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, 62zcx62e DAVID MURRAY.

ST. BARBE-MILLER, Hon. Sec. BAKER, THE LIBERAL CANDIDATE. VOTE FOB BAKER. 83x83c O THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen—I wish specially to direct your attention to my opinions on the following six points:— Legislative Council Refobm.—I think that whenever any penal dissolutien of the House of Assembly takes place, one-third of the members of the Legislative Council should retire in order that you may give your opinion on the ques tion which'has caused such dissolution. This would render the Legislative Council more re sponsible to you, and prevent any deadlock between the two Houses. Land Laws.—Having been a consistent land reformer ever since the question first arose, I congratulate the farmers of this colony on their success in breaking up the monopoly which formerly existed in land. I shall Be happy to advocate any amendment of the law, shown to be required, especially the reduction of the price of scrub land to a nominal sum to those willing to clear and cultivate. Mining Laws.—I advocate a peppercorn rent for unproductive mineral lands, with conditions 1 enforcing the employment of labor, in order to prevent monopolies, and a Royalty or percentage on dividends. Taxation and Feee Tbade.—If it can be shown, as asserted by some, that no further taxation is required I shall be most happy to be convinced, as nothing but absolute necessity justifies the imposition of taxes; but if further taxation is required it should fall on the wealthy classes, who have hitherto never paid their fair share of the expenses of the Govern ment of this colony. Everyone should con tribute according to his means, whether such 1 means are derived from shares, lands, mines, , sheep, or any other description of property. | That " large and important class, the men of no property," who have hitherto through the Custom-House paid more than their fair share of taxation, should be relieved by the introduc tion of Free Trade, has been done in England. Immigba noN should be carefully conducted, and stopped by telegraph as soon as the first symptoms of bad times or scarcity of employ ment manifest themselves. Law Refobm.—I am and always have been an ardent admirer of the Real Property Act and 1 all other endeavors to simplify and cheapen the law of the land ard the procedure of the Courts. I advocate the adaptation of the Local Court procedure to the Supreme Court. I remain, Your obedient servant. 83xS3c R. C BAKER. The farmers *of south AUSTRALIA.

This Phosphatlo comtmiiiiqn. m pronounced by the most eminent members of the Sleaical Profi jsion to be unequalled for its power in replenish Jig the vitality of the body,-by its supplying all the essential constituents of the blood and nerve substai ie, and for developing all the powers and function of the system to the highest degree. It is agreeable to the palate, and innoceiin its action, while retaining all its extraordinary iroper ties; and as a specific, surpassing all the known therapeutic agents of the present day, . r the speedy and permanent cure of— Nervous Prostration Shortness of Breatl Liver Complaints Trembling of th% lands Palpitation of the Heart and limbs Dizziness Impaired Nutrition Noises in the Head and Mental and Physic d De Ears pression Loss of Energy and Ap- Consumption (in ik first petite , stages only) Hypochondria Timidity Female Complaints Eruptions of the Skin General Debility Impaired Sight and Mo Indigestion mory Flatulence Nervous Fancies Incapacity for Study or Impoverished Blood Business Nervous Debility in al Kl Sick Headache Stages Lassitude Premature Decline and all morbid conditions of the system arising firm whatever cause. The action of the Phosphodyne Is twofold—on the one hand increasing the principle which constitutes nervous energy, and on the oth<-rf the most powerful blood and flesh generating ageM known; therefore, a marvellous medicine for rens vating impaired and broken-down constitutions. I quickly improves the functions of assimilation ti such a degree that where for years an emaciated anxious, cadaverous, and semi-vital condition ha, existed, the flesh will rapidly increase in quantity and firmness, and the whole system return to a state of robust health. The Phosphodyne acts electrically upon the organization; for instance.it assists nature to generate that human electricity which renews and rebuilds the osseous, muscular, nervous, membranous, and organic systems. It operates on the system without exciting care or thought upon the individual as to the process. It moves' the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, stomach, and intestines with a harmony, vigor, yet mildness unparalleled in medicine. The Phosphodyne gives back to the human struo ture, in a suitable form, the phosphoric or animating element of life which has been wasted, and exerts an important influence directly on the spinal marrow ana nervous system, of a nutritive, tonic, and in vigorating character, maintaining that buoyant energy of the brain and muscular system which renders the mind cheerful, brilliant, and energetic, entirely overcoming that dull, inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience in all their actions. The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are fre quently Bhown from the first day of its administra tion by a remarkable increase of nervous power, with a feeling of vigor and comfort, to which the patient has long been unaccustomed. Digestion ir. jnproved; the appetite increases wonderfully; the bowels becoms regular; the eyes brighter; the skin clearsad healthy; and the hair acquires strength, showing the impor tance of the action of the Phosphodyne on the organs of nutrition. Finally, the Phosphodyne maintains a certain de gree of activity in the previously debilitated nervous system; its use enables all debilitated organs to return to their sound state and perfonn their natural func tions. Persons suffering from Nervous Debility, or any of the hundred symptoms which this distressing disease assumes, may rest assured of an effectual ang even speedy cure by the judicious use of this Host tan valuable remedy.
