FOREIGN IMMIGRATION. Position in Australia. Federal Explanation. 'The impression is wide' spread,' writes the Publicity Branch of the Prime Minister's Department, 'that persons of foreign birth are entering Australia in numbers so large as to menace the pre servation of the preponderant British ele ment of our population.' Discussing the present position, the Publicity Branch stated that for the three years and six months ended Sep tember 1924, the average annual excess of arrivals over departures of British peoples was 29.120. During the same period, the average annual excess of arrivals over departures of persons of foreign birth was 4.610. The average an nual increase in the population, by excess of births over deaths during the same period was 82.000. Assuming that only 20,000 Britishers (a decrease of 9.120 on the above figure) came to the Com monwealth each year during the next de cade and that 20,000 aliens ( an increase of 15,390 on the figure above given) were admitted annually during the same period. Also assuming that the natural increase in the population remained stationary. the British population of Australia at the end of 10 years would represent 96 per cent, of the total, a dilution of the present British preponderance to the extent of only 2 per cent. In all probability when the new agree ment about to be entered into by the British and Commonwealth Governments and the Governments of -the six States was in operation, the number of British assisted immigrants would show an in crease over the number who arrived dur ing the period above stated, and the, num ber of unassisted British migrants was unlikely to decrease. It was safe to as sume that the gain by natural increase, which was generally cumulative, would also be greater in the future. In view of the agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and certain foreign Governments to restrict the issue of pass ports or the granting of visas, it was likely to be some years before the num ber 'of foreign arrivals would reach 20,000 per annum. The Italian Gov ernment had agreed to limit the granting of passports to persons who had been nominated by persons in Australia and also were in possession of £40 each. In the case of Greeks. Jugo-Slavs. and Al banians, the British authorities, at the request of the Commonwealth Govern ment, was limiting the granting of visas and passports to 100 per month in each case, and visas would not be granted to persons unless they were individually in possession of £40. The census of April, 1921,' showed that the number of per sons in Australia not born here or in the British Isles or New Zealand, was 139,073. or slightly over 2 1/2 per cent. The number owing allegiance to foreign Governments was 48,520. or .08 per cent. During the past few years and particularly since July. 1924 (when the latest Immigration Restriction Act passed by the United States Congress came into operation) there had been a quicker movement of peoples from South ern Europe to Australia. During the 31 years ended September 30. 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign-born immigrants numbered 16,148, a figure representing about 11.6 per cent, of the total foreign born per sons who were in Australia when the 1921 census was taken. From April. 1921 to Seprember. 1924 the excess of arri vals over departures was as follows: — II. F. Persons.

European countries to Australia. The excess ot arrivals over departures of per sons of various European nationalities from July to November was as follows: — July. Au;. S.ep. Oct. Xov.

The average number of arrivals from the countries mentioned during the five months indicated was therefore, about 842\. at the rate of 10.104 per annum. During the 3 1/2 years ended September. 1924\. the excess of arrivals over de partures of foreign persons was 16.148 —at the rate of 4.614 per annum. The above table -showed that they were arriv ing at the rate of over 10.000 per annum ~a large percentage increase, but not a .very large actual increase. The following figures showed the posi tion in regard to the movement of Italian and Greek people to Australia: — Italians. — 1891 census. 3.890, 1901 census, 5.67S; 1911 census. 6,718; 1921 census, 8.135. The net increase from April, 1921. lo September. 1924. was 6,909. at the rate of 1.974 per annum: a.nd the net increase in the five monthx to Xovember. 1924. was 1.974, at the rate of 4.637 per annum. Greeks.— 1891 census. 482, 1901 cen sus. 879: 1911 census. 1.798: 19121 cen sus. 3.654; net increase from April. 1921 to September. 1924. 2.287. at the rate of 653 per annum: net increase for the five months to November. 1924. 2,217 per annum. These figures showed that during the 31 years ended September. 1921. and par ticularly during the five months ended November last, the migration of Italians and Greeks had been greater than at any period during the past 40 years. If the rate of their incoming during Ihe five months period mentioned were main tained. 6,584 would have arrived here dur ing the year ending April next. The num ber of Italian and Greek migrants to Australia averaged under 150 per annum during the 30 years prior to 1901. The rate at which migrants from these two countries were now arriving, viz.. 6,854 per annum represented only .083 of the natural increase in our population. Accordingly to the 1921 census the dis tribution of Italians and Greeks in Aus tralia was as follows: — ? Metro. Pror. Rnral. Migra. Italians . .. 54.5 10.8 46.1 8.6 Greeks . . . 57.3 21.7 18.7 2.3 The majority of the people of both these nationalities, it was stated, were married and could read and write the English- language. In the United States, the statement continued, the 1924 Immigration Restric tion Act limited the quota of immigrants to 2 per cent, of the number of nationals of each country who were domiciled in U.S.A. according to tbe census of 1890. The reason for this was that the great stream of so- called Nordic immigration flowed to the United States before 1890, and the Southern European immigration came later. This Act effected great re ductions in the quotas of such countries as Czechoslovakia. Hungary. Italy. Poland. Greece. Russia. Rumania, and Jugo-Slavia. compared with the quota under the 1921 Act which had allowed 3 per cent, of the number of nationals in the country according to the census of 1910\. The number of Czechoslovakians was reduced by 12.284. Italians by 37. 968\. Poles by 21.905. Russians by 22.413. Germans 17.278. British 14.684. Swedes 10.281. The reduction from all countries was from 357.803 to 169.083. After reviewing America's position it was stated that it seemed to be imprac ticable for Australia, which had no foreign service. to enforce a quota law. The United States Congressional Com mittee, in recommending the reduction of the quota to 2 per cent., is reported to have stared that the new type of im migrant had grown to be a great un digested mass of alien thought, alien sympathy and alien purpose, which was a menace to the social, political and economical life of the -country.
