Olscn,— I am notified by the above lodge to tender to you their heartfelt and sincere thanks for the marvellous cure which you have effected in our Brother Jhonson. When, after receiving the best medical attention, and all hope of his cure had gone, and when in almost a state of collapse, you took his case in hand, and by some marvellous powers you have now restored him to full health and strength. Bro. Jhonson is to-day a striking example of your abilities as a Tuberculosis Expert. Not only the brothers of our order, but hundreds of other citizens of .Adelaide, can testify to hia almost incredible return to health. We little expected to have him in our midst again, but thanks to your wonderful skill, he is as healthy and strong as the most of us. May you be long spared to continue In your great and glorious work. Wish ing you the good fortune you deserve. I am. Brother, yours faithfully and fraternally, Alfred Give, SJ.: W. 0. Wedd.
