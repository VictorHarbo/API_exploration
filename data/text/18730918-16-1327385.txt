CONTINENTAL ÍMMIGZATION. THE following is a copy of a letter forwarded to the Government by tho committee elected at a pubho meeting of German and Scandinavian reBidonts in and around Brisbane, held on th» 20 th of May last - ' Brisbane, Septembor 15,1873. Sir,-At a public meeting of German and Scandinavian colonists, convened by advertise- ment, and hold in Brisbane on 11th July, 1873, tho committco pieviously olectcd in tbo matter of the Alardus waa authorised to Bubmit to tho / Government suggestions for the .amelioration of \ tho Gorman and ScandinavianSmmigration For this purpose, and in order to elicit the soundest views, we placed ourselves in commu- nication with German colonists of position and exporience both here and in the southern colo- nies, and now have the honor to render, what we have a right to call, well sifted suggestions. We beg to premise that the motive actuating us is a sincore desire to n«si3t the Government in procuung for the colony a desirable and lurga immigration from tbo Continent of Europe, and it is only with this object we tako the liberty of the piesont step Our enquiry has resulted in evidence of a high order that a lurgojiud spontaneous immi- gration from Germany co ild bo induced, wore steps taken to promulgate amongst the botter classes fair and unvarnished accounts of the colony, and, above nil, wero Government guáran- teos offered that miseries like thoso on board the Alardus shall, in future bo guarded against by every precaution possible The present emigration from Germany con- sists to a very large extent of people with somo means, and from districts where agriculturo has reached a very high development There aro at present two groat fioldB to which Gorman emigration ii directed-viz, the countries of the Lower Danube and North Amonoo The first, favored by the loadors of the Gorm m nation, and supported by all the woight of the German element of Austria, und German commerce, is and will remain a field of colonisation, against which tho inducements wo can offeroare sure to bo mndcquato All wo can hope to do is to attract a portion of that vast living flood now going over to North Amenea Tho bettor classes of German colonists OB a rule do not look with unalloyed admiration on American institutions, and oortainly do not fancy American rowdyism It is arno igst theso classes princi- pally where va can hope to induce to us a spontaneous and a comparatively large emigra tion, and at less expense, rnd probably of greater benefit, to the colony than the present The committee beg therefore to suggest Firstly, tho advisability of circulating gratis among theso classe?, in pamphlet form, a fair account of the colony Wo have inado ètt* quiri6s and are informed that up to the present nothing of the kind has been done, excepting advertisements, the very nature of which is sure to deter emigrants of a superior class People n i th a little moans and whohave somemcety arto the company in which they will have to face tho di«comforts of a long sea voyage are not likely to bo attracted by advertisements like tho fol- lowing -"Malo and female servants can obtain freo passage to Queensland, Australia, by paying 10 thalers " (30s) A valuable suggestion has been mado to us by Dr 0 M»cko, the oditor of tho " Australische Deutsebo Zeitung," to the effect that thoso pam- phlets should be authenticated by a German society This gentleman forcibly points out into what bad odor emigration pamphlets hays b como in Germany through the instru- mentality of similar productions issued by tho Brazilian and other South American Governments In the absence here of a German society of a pubho character, those pamphlets might bo submitted to several colo- nists, to bo elected for that purpose by a public meeting of Gormans and Scandinavians of Bris- bane, and bo authenticated by them Supple- mentary reports should follow from time to time to keep the nomo and the resources,^ the colony prominently before the public Similar reports m Danish and Swedish should be circu- lated in Scandinavia We would further draw attention to the high physical, moral, and intellectual qualities of tbo inhabitants of North Italy, especially of the Lombardian plains A large emigration of most valuab'o colonists is now leovmg there for Southe America Tho esteem in which a considerable number of North Italians aro held in Victono shows they would prove equally desirablo colonists here Another object might be served by inducing these emi- grants to come hero-they would introduce among us sericulture, the cultivation of the olive, and other industries favored by our elimata, and in which they have experience. Pamphlets in Italian, distributed m Lombardy, would, wo believe, be of great service to the colony The«e people, m our opinion, are much moro desirable than the Bimi barbarous Polish peasants and Polish Jews brought here by the Alardus and other German vessels Immigration being now the great question m all the Australian colonies, combined action for Continental immigration would probably result in a regular steamboat connection between Aus- tralia and the German ports Arrangement as to the distribution of the immigrants among the colonies would appear easily attainable It stands to reason how little the best efforts will avail if occurrences like those on board the Alardus counteract Wo have taken all the steps in our power, ana have received the most cordial as'istaneo from the German Press in the southern colonies, and assurances entitling us to the hope that our efforts will have some effect in Ge-many towards precautionary measures Were it not for this hope, rother than again see ships sailing uuder the German flag to this colony, be-oming the scene of whole- sale sacrifice of human life to criminal neglect and rapaeiouB disregard of decency and sanitary necessities, we would oppose and hinder by every means in our power, a continuance ot immigration from the Continent of Europe In the case of the Alardus, the insufficiency of our colonial passenger laws WBS severely felt» showing the necessity for supplementing to» Imperial Act- the only one in force here-by » local enactment Bimilar to the Victorian Pas»«» (¡ers, Harbors, and Navigation Statute, 1865. We therefore beg to suggest Secondly, the adoption of sections 19 to 38 and parts VI. and VII. of the Victorian Act re- ferred to. In our opinion it appears a most necessary concomitant to a foreign immigration on foreign ships, that tbo Government should have somo control over tho shipper in tbo way of Becunty. We beg therefore to suggest this Thirdly ; but tho mode in winch this can be effeoted we do not feel competent to spoak upon, merely expressing tho desire that tho security should, if possible, be Bubjcct to local jurisdic- tion, at leust to somo extent, for the enforcement of penalties. We wero informed by tho Immigration Agent that under existing contruotB the shippers aro not responsible for overcrowding and bad venti- lation, the whole blame for such occurrences resting on the Queensland Agent. This ui rangement wo beg to suggest Foui^hly, should bo radically ohangod, and the shipper directly responsible-in fact if the Vic- torian Act bo adopted, he would bo indirootly through the maslei The functions of the Immigration Board aro at present by low confined to mere enquiry into complaints. Evidenco is taken not by oath, as before a judicial tribunal, but as voluntary us sortions, the truth of which must bo gathered from circumstances We would therefore beg to suggest Fifthly. That tho Board should bo invostod with some judicial authority in cases of this kind, and be competent by summary jurisdiction to inflict fines where the Queensland Immigra- tion Rogulutions have beon sinned against. Sixthly As a guarantco to the German and Scandinavian population of this colony that immigrants of their nationalities shall not bo neglected, wo would beg to suggest that a Ger- man colonist beeomo a member of the Imim gration Board. ijb'onthly. It was found, notablv on board tho Alardus, that the blankets and othoi ship utensils sold to tho emigrants m Hamburg wero of a wretched quality. Wo bog to suggest en- quiry into this inattci, and an arrangement by the Government with a rospectablo firm nt tho shipping port to proveut similar occurroncoa in future. On no account should a sub agent bo entrusted with a commission of this kind. Eighthly. Wo ha\o come across Bovoral very I hard eases where immigrants, having been in- formed in Hamburg that Gtrmun coin readily circulated hore, had taken considerable sums in German specie to this colony, and hero suffered severe loss in exchange. Wo would suggest that the Government mako some arrangement w ith a local bunk for tho purchase of such com from immigrants at tho lowest po=siblo rato Placards in largo typo should bo hung up in tho Immi gration office, indicating whoro exchange can bo effected As a preventivo moneare, similar placards m tho Shipping offito in Hamburg should inform emigrants that British coin only IB ourrent hero. In conclusion, wo beg to stato that wo have received the hoartiost co- operation from the German and Scandinavian population of Queensland, and ondoso a report in tho German and Danish languages, circulated by us through out the colony Whilo expressing our hope foi a speedy nmondment of the gnovancos now accompanying tho Continental lmmigiution, wo must draw attention to the proportion of passengers (348) to the tonnogo (810) of the Alardus, and regret to find this proportion not improved in the ships now on tho woy fiom Hamburg Tho Eugeno, 697 tons, carries 323, and the Humboldt, 762 tons, 382 passengers These ships loft in Jin e last, about two months after the overcrowding and bad stato of the AlarduB was known hore -Wo havo tho honor to be, Sir, your most humblo and obedient sonants, For tho Committee, H. EüTnKING. Tho Honorablo tho Colonial Secretary, Bris- bane.
