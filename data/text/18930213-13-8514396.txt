SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. The re-election of the Premier for Castle in June was the most important political event last week Mr Patterson renamed the sett by 1,441 votes as against 810 polled by Mr Longmore, who ran in the interests of the T railes hall labour league and who was strongly supported by the princip of agitators of that body the triumphant return of Mr. Patterson was command proof that the colony is determined to resist the efforts of the labour leaders to snatch port her and it is almost unnecessary to say that the result has given widespread satisfaction At the May or s quarterly luncheon on Thursday the Treasurer, Mr Downes Carter, delivered a speech which has attracted at tention in which he strongly urged that the colony should in future be self-reliant in re Sard to loans, his recent success in floating a Aperient local loan of £750,000at£9%s 3d gross prompting him to make the remarks in this connection Parliament will resume business to morrow, when the new Ministers will meet the Houses It is intended to bring the session to a close at a very early date, so that the Cabinet may have full time to consider its financial proposals before next session Mr Dow, member of the Legislative Assembly for Kara Kara, has lost his seat by reason of the compulsory sequestration of his estate and an election Mill hate to be held in due course On last Monday evening the Patterson Ministry entertained the members of the Federal Council, which met at Hobart at the end of last month at a banquet at Menzies' Hotel Among the guests was Chief Justice Madden, the Administrator of of the government Mr Service; MLC, proposed, the toast of the evening, "The early I federation of the Colonies of Australasia He said that the Commonwealth Bill could not be looked upon as adequate for the purpose in view, more particularly in regard to the disposal of the finances of each colony Speaking as to the prospects of a complete federation in the future, he adopted a hopeful strain, and argued that the (general movement espoused by New South Wales might proceed without the federal Council being set aside There was no reason why the two methods of procedure should not ultimately end in the one goal in responding fair Samuel Griffith the Premier of Queensland hoped that the toast would be regarded as one of the loy ii toasts of this continent until Australia was one and undivided All intelligent men in Australia he stated, had made up their minds that there was to be a complete federation, but the question was what form it would take The people would compel the public men to take action to bring about the union of the colonies, as it was absolutely necessary for the welfare and progress of Australia that it should come at an early date He was prepared to sink almost all his predilection for the purpose of securing the assistance of New South Wales. The Federal Council had done good work, and it was essential that such a body should exist to do that work until a Federal Parliament was elected Thursday last was the hottest day of this summer, the thermometer in Melbourne registering 103deg in the shade license in the temperature was unfortunately marked by a serious outbreak of bush fires in various parts of the colony Many struggling selectors had their crops, haystacks, houses, and fences burned, and in the Diamond Creek district, near the Plenty Ranges many orchardists had their houses and fruit trees destroyed by the flames On the YVernbee Plums a number of sheep were burnt. The fires were particularly severe in the Gippsland, Upper Yarra, and Mansfield districts At the eighteenth half yearly meeting of the Bank of Victoria a dividend of 10 per cent was declared, and £15,000 carried to the reserve fund making it £250,000, while a balance of £0,380 was carried forward to the credit of the next half year Attention has been called to the threatened immigration of 400 refugee Russian Jews to Australia, and the matter is now engaging the attention of the Governments of the colonies, with the view of preventing their landing here There has been a revulsion in feeling among many persons in this colony on the fiscal question, and it has, therefore, been thought opportune by the Free trade Democratic Association to canvass the country to secure the return of free trade candidates at the next general election FLOODS IN QUEENSLAND When the mail left last week reference was made to the occurrence of floods in Queensland, but owing to the telegraph wires having been washed away in the Brisbane district the magnitude of the floods was not then known The intelligence received since shows that the floods caused such destruction of property and loss of life is to assume the proportions of a national calamity During the first week of this month exceptionally heavy rains fell in the south east portion of Queensland, particularly along the coast In some places the rainfall was more like a waterspout, as much as 30s falling in a week The total rainfall at Brisbane in eight days was 28th Uns bane, Maryborough, Gympie, Ipswich, Bundaberg, and Rockhampton were in undated by the floods, and the destruc- tion of property at those places is estimated to be enormous At Brisbane alone the merchants and importers are stated to have lost £2,000,000 by the floods destroying their merchandise The Brisbane River rose 14ft above the ordinary level and 40ft. higher than during the flood of 1890 The city was completely isolated, and there was no communication with it for some days The Victoria bridge a splendid iron structure 1500ft in length, which crossed the Bush one River and connected North and South Brisbane was swept away Another very costly structure, the Indooroopilly Railway Bridge, which spanned the river a few miles from Brisbane, met with a similar fate It was 70ft in length, and was aft above high tv water mark When the safety of the bridge was threatened by the rising at after a loaded train was placed upon it, but this was without avail, as the bridge disappeared when the water rose to its deck The force of the stream was so great that all communication between North and South Brisbane was cut off for some days, and for some months to come it will have to be conducted by means of ferry boats, owing to the destruction of the Victoria bridge The intercolonial steamers which were berthed at Brisbane wharves were need to let go their moorings in consequence of the violence of the stream, and those that arrived in the bay could not proceed up the river until the force of the current became lessened after the lapse of two or three days, when the flood began to abate the gunboat Paluma, the s s 1 Elamang and the hulk Mary Evans broke away from their moorings and were washed on to the Banyan walk of the Botanical gardens and were left there high and dry by the receding waters The sight of the flood when it was at its highest is described as being one that will live in the memories of those who witnessed it 'lite flood reached a height of 30ft in Stanley street, which is an important business thoroughfare in South Bnsl line, running parallel with the river and it left that street in ruins The office of the iSnilane Courier at the corner of Queen and Edward streets, in the heart of the city, had 10ft. of water in it Many of the pim civil warehouses and shops were submerged, and their contents rendered almost valueless Hundreds of houses, in some instances whole terraces, were either overturned or swept completely away the streets were blocked with debris, portions of houses, broken pieces of furniture, and telegraph poles lying together in the thoroughfares The West-End Brewery was destroyed, a large gasometer was capsized, a church was overturned, and houses were carried hundreds of yards from their original sites and landed on roads or in peoples backyards Several walls were destroyed The loss of life through drowning is not exactly known, but in quests have been held on live bodies that was recovered after the Hood Miss Hood has now subsided but the people are almost heart broken, and their stories of misery and despair are heartrending At the Municipal chambers, women, dirt besmeared and almost naked, trooped into the rooms set apart as supply stores, while their husbands carried on cleansing operations The mayor, aldermen town clerk, and other officers of the council have worked with a will to cope with the distress relief funds have been opened at various centres of population throughout Australia.
