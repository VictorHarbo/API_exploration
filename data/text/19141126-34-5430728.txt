' VERY FASCINATING. Every person who has taken lessons in Motor Driving and Motor Mechanics at the A. E. Terry School has found it most fascinating work. Many things which appear at the start to be what is termed "hard" are found to be quite easy to the student when coached by the Principal (Mr. A. E. Terry and a capable staff. He becomes so wrapped up" in his work that he never wants to leave off. The A. E. Terry establishment is equipped with everything of interest to the motor driver and motor mechanic No expense is spared to keep well abreast of the times. So soon as some new model or new part is announced Mr. A. E. Terry immediately secures a sample for the use of his students. BEGIN NOW. The terms are extremely moderate. There are always good jobs for good men, and the A. E. Terry School is the place where good men are made. Motor traction is becoming more and more general every day. Before many years go by the "knowing all" about the mechanical vehicle" will be a necessity-the use of the horse for transit purposes will be past. LESSONS BY POST. .. The A. E. Terry School has a complete system of teaching, by post, primarily for the benefit of persons residing in the country, with the invalu- able advantage of practical demonstration at the A. E. Terry Garage, at any time, day or night, when the student visits the city. No extra charge. THE A. E. TERRY School of Motor Driving and Motor Mechanics, FLINDERS-STREET. ADELAIDE.
