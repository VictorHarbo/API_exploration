This company Is being formed for the purposo of pur chasing the lense and working the leads aft proved by the Government diamond drill, one to bo over 600 foot wide, and heavy coarse wash over 8 feet in depth on ! pipeciny bottom. The Government havo pub down 21 bores from Cog- hill's Creek to Ascot, at a cost of nearly £4000, the last four (4) bores going down at a depth of oVer 4000 feut la heavy coarse wash on pipeclay bottom. / i" A condensed report of Reginald A, F, Murray, Esq., F.G.S., Government Geologist, is ns follows I— "The result of these bores prove the existence of a great main lend, running northerly through the parish of Ascot, aud bringing with it all known and unknown leads, both cast and west along its course, inoludlng all the Midas and Bald Hills leads. "I feel justified in expressing the opinion that the ex ploration of thedeen ground would be a legitimate minlug enterprise, attended with good prospects of success." The official report for 1892, issued by the Mining depart ment, contains the following remark uy Mr. Murray:— The exletenco of a Great Trunk lead, with wash there In, and also on ita eastern bank, has thus been conclu sively proved: and ns thu load heads from auriferous country, andis herein the vicinity of tbe strike of tho Chines Belt, it is likely that important mining develop ments will be the result at no distant dato. , The foreman of the diamond drill, Mr. Drttmmond, stated that he had been employed boring for the Govern ment for upwards of 14 years in different parte of the country, and never got anything equal to the prospects obtained in the above bores. The promoters or vendors will hand over to the pro posed company a lease of the before-mentioned 784 acres with the right to mine for a period of 16 years free of all cost, subject to;5 per cent, royalty, in consideration of the promoters or vendors receiving 6000 paid up shares, that being the balance of the above Issue. The promoters havo already paid £3000 for tbe above lease for the right to mine. 8o soon as sufficient shares are taken up, a meeting will be railed to elect directors, auditors, 4c. A large number of shares are already applied for, and early application is necessary. PYJAMA Suits, grand variety. 4s. 6d., 6s. 6d., 7s 6d.« best in the city. J. Fred, llewaril, 60 EUzabeth-st.
