The most deadly insult one ; can offer a French policeman Is to say to him, 'Death to the cows!' ''.?:::':+ A few days ago In the Rennea Appeal Court M. de Savlghon ?Lar.om-b.lere, the judge, explained to a policeman thtft a cow was 'a nable and beautiful animal,' and therefore Its name could not bo considered a term of oppro ?bi'lum. Recently «a vagabond who came'' up. on appeal before M. -de Savlg non Laromblere had his original term Of Imprisonment doubted, On hearing tho sentence tho prisoner ea'led the Judge an 'old cow.' '.lmniedlate.ly'°th-? -judge, forgetting;. tils 'philosophic defence of a few days before, Ordered the vasrabond'p tprni of teprleonment to be further increased bi'- flve'ycars for Insulting him. -C' ,.;?:???
