Aust. Can Get Danish Migrants Australia could get between 1000 and 2000 Danish migrants a year, Immigration Depart- ment Chief T. H. E. Heyes said in Sydney on his return after a six weeks' migrant survey in Europe. Although the Danish Gov- ernment did not financially as- sist migrants, it looked upon Australia as the place it would like its people to go if they did migrate, he said. "The Danes have a high birthrate, and anticipate this will eventually pose a popula- tion problem," Mr Heyes said. Of particular interest to Aus- tralia was the fact that Danish dairy farmers were probably the best in the world. Mr Heyes also found: United Kingdom: Applicants for migration to Australia had doubled since the Royal tour. Holland and Germany: Royal tour films had boosted interest in Australia. Greece: Immense goodwill for Australia and good rural workers available. Austria: Has a pool of metal workers who would be useful here.
