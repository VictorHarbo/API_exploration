All favorable to said petition arc requested to sign. ' (Petition.) To the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Conn cillors of the Citv of Melbourne. The Petition of the undersigned Citizens and Ratepayers of said City Humbly fclieweth — That your Petitioners are informed that a plan for the ercction of a Market upon the Eastern Market reserve has been prepared and submitted for the approval of your ' or ihipful Council, in which it is proposed that the frontages to tlie adjoining streets shall be used for the erection of shops, extraneous to and independent of the public market. That your petitioners beg very respectl'ullj; to submit the following questions as worthy of some consideration from your honorable Council before deciding on the adoption of 'my such plan as the one referred to. 1\. The market reserves of this city having been granted to tlie Municipality ill trust, for a specific purpose, expressly for a public Market ; will the Corporation bo exceeding the lowers of that trust; or violating the prescribed object of tho original grant, by appropriating any portion of s:ud reserve to the purpose of building private offices, shops, dwellings, or stores, or to anv other purpose whatever save that of a public market in the true and proper sense of the term! 2\. Does the Act ol' Incorporation, or any other law appli cable to tlio case, authorise and empower your Worshipful Council to make use of the market reserve, or any portion of it, for Fuch a purpose ; or, to appropriate any portion of the financial resources of the City for the speculative purpose of shop-building i , , , , 3\. Has your Worshipful Council any legal right or autho rity to derive a revenue from building, and letting private offices and shops in connection with the public murkets of the ^ -k' If the Corporation has no legal authority to do any of the aforesaid tilings, and if its powers of taxation and sources of revenue arc prescribed and limited by law, may not any number of rate-payers, who disapprove of tho shop-building scheme, protest against such illegal appropriations, and obtain an injunction from the Supreme Court to restrain the Cor poration from carrying out tho same ? 5\. But even supposing it to be within tho legal or implied powers of tho Corporation to do all tho aforesaid things, the question still arises— Will it be legitimate and just in tho Cor poration towards tho bulk of its rate-payers— both tenants and proprietors of shops throughout the city - to use the heavy taxes wrung from the depressed profits of their trades and properties, in erecting unnecessary shops to compete with their own under peculiar advantages, created too at public expense, and involving a curtailment of the proper accom modation and space pertaining tn the public markets. 0\. Will not tliis scliemo, therefore, not only abridge and pervert a public privilege, hut unfairly in'erfere with the rights of private property, wliilo it will materially afreet tho results of existing tenures, contracts, and already vested All these nre questions of very grave importance, and your petitioners trust that your Worshipful Conncil will take them into your impartial and serious consideration, and he well advised of the legality and wisdom of the course yon adopt in reference to the public markets to he erected in this city. In the mean time, your petitioners would pray your Wor shipful Council not to sanction any plan by which any portion of the market reserves shall be diverted from their legitimate purpose ; and would suggest with reference to the Eastern Market, that tho frontage to Bourkc street should bo con verted into a covered market for the sale of assorted fruits and vegetables, butchers' meat, fish, poultry, eggs, butter, bacon, &c.;, and that the full area or remaining space of tho market be permanently reserved to afford ample accommodation to tlie growers of produce and tlio public at large, for whose several benefit and special convenience all markets are esta blisheil, and should he exclusively maintained. ? 23 G9 DEPOSITORS are at liberty to have Letters addressed to the ' Care of the PROVIDENT INSTITUTE, Melbourne,' where llioy will be received, registered, and placed in the Strong Room till called for.
