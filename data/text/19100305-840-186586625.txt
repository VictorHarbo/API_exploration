It has been decided by tho board of officials representing the Postal and Defence Departments and the Admiralty, .to rccorr.lnend the acceptance of tenders for installing tho wireless telegraphy system at Sydney and Fremairtle. The recommendation first has to be con sidered by Sir John Quick (Postmaster- General. WIRELESS TELEGRAPH AT SEA. The postal authorities have ' re ceived an interesting communication from the Union Steamship Company, giving the idea that in the wireless wcrk performed on Vancouver steamer Makura, communication can he maintained during the day over 800 miles, and at night to 2,000 miles and more, according to the weather conditions. When the new sta tions are inaugurated, all the Australian mail steamers will be fitted with f:t, and it is expected that their arrival will be signalled some days before they reach tho coast. Arrangements also will be made for news of important events to be flashed across to boats. " AUTOMATIC F.IFLES. The Minister for Defence (Hon. Joseph Cook) has been advised that the Im perial War Office has appointed a com mittee to inquire into the question of automatic rifles. They will be prepared to examine nny models which may bo submitted by inventors or others, who can obtain information from the Defence Department. LIMBEREN' WAGGON. The Defence Department has received from England, a sample of a Limberen waggon, which is supposed to combine tlic features of a forage cart, a small arms ammunition' cart, and so on. The waggon is intended for carrying small arms ammunition. Its weight is 11 4 cwt., and the maximum load it caD carry is a ton. 'AVSTR ALT A-N SAILORS. A communication reached the Minis ter for Customs (Sir Robert Best) from the Portuguese authorities at Lorenzo Marques, pointing out that -many Aus tralian ' sailors arc in the habit of shipping by vessels, under the Norwegian Hag, going to the colony,, in ignorance of the local immigration restriction law. Tho law prohibits '.the disembarkation of any person not possessing £20, as a guarantee that lie will not become a charge on t.he public funds. Sailors landing without a guarantee may have to be. shipped off, or have to continue the voyage at merely nominal rates of pay, in order to get away from the coun try. Sir Robert Best has asked Nor wegian consuls to allow men shipping front Australia to Portuguese South Africa, to be made acquainted with the nature of the law through the cap tains of their ships.

A large number of people of both sexes osowded into the Criminal Court on 23rd February (says the Adelaide "Register") to hear tho trial of Hanrv Bachmann on n charge of having murdered Edmund Day Davis, by shooting him with a re volver, at Glenelg, on 24th January. The accused, a young man of respectable <fl«j|)ca>:!ance, pleaded not guiltv. and wis u>Cended by. Messrs. J. It. Anderson and J. L. Gordon. From the evidence lor the prosecution, the accused and a young lady were sitting under a bush n.ear tho Patawalonga Creek, when they were alarmed by the appearance of the de ceased. wjio came near them scvenal liiqes. Eventually Bachmann fired a re volver at him twice, the second shot taking eflcct in the man's abdomen, from the cfiects of w.hich he- died two davs later. Mr. Anderson elicited somo in formation aboufe the nractice ot foxing indulged in by some people, and at tempted to sliow that this was the ob ject- of Davis's tactics, but obtained no convincing evidence. Detective Mitchell staled that the business ripr foxing was common in Adelaide andsSthor places, and that evil minded men watched voung couples for the purpose of blackmailing them, under threats of exposure. The accused made a statement from tho dock, in which he .asserted that the de ceased was rushing about hiin, armed with a big stick, with whioli he threat ened to hash his head in.. He fired tho revolver, which was aimed1 between Davis and his companion. Noy, hut lie had no intention .- of injuring cither of the men. Mr. Anderson made an effective and eloquent speech In defence of the perfect right to defend himself , from accused, and, urged -that , the latter, lmd a perfect right to defend ' himself from attack ' bv frightening his assailants. When counsel concluded, he was loudly -applauded liy the spectators in court but the noise was officially suppressed, not, however, before it had shown nlainl.- that' Buehmann had many sympathisers present. Mr. - Justice Homburg having summed up; the iiiry. niter half an hour's retirement, found a verdict of euiltv under "revocation, of the reckless use or firearms, which practically amounted to manslaughter, and on account of the youth of the nnsonet", . strongly . recom- -nicridcd bin;- to mcrcv. Mr. Anderson' said.hc would -call, evidence as to his client's nrevinus onod character, and sen tence- was deferred. GIGANTIC. MONEY TRUST., Widespread Powers.; The American money trust, headoil bv Mr. J. P. Morgan, which was developed when that eminent financier bought the majority of tho stock of the Equitable Life. Insurance Company, still enthrals tho American imagination. It is important, however, to emphasise the fact, which almost every newspaper here ignores and obscures, that in a legal sense this money combination is not- lv money trust at all, because there is no definite organisation, no elected directors, nud no list.t.f stock holders. It 'is a community of financial interests, a chain of financial control, which now is centralised in the hands of a very few men, acting in concert with Mr. Morgan as commander-in-chief. It would be impossible to g.ive the total of the direot and indirect capital now cen tralised in the money trust. Pome cclcssal figures have already been published, and there arc others. To begin with, the banking firm of Morgan and Co. has deposits of many millions, which its directors can utilise to ad van lame in financial operations, Tlie assets of the three insurance companies arc invested largely in the bonds of railroad and industrial companies, and aggregate considerably more than £200,000,000. The directly controlled banks have de posits and surplus accounts running into hundreds of millions. They influence the operation of a great number of smaller institutions. Tho .vast accumulations or wealth in the Standard Oil coders are chiefly directed by Mr. William Rocke feller, one of the representative members of the money trust in the great game o' finance. The Vast sum of money thus accumu lated "is actually in the possession of the money trust, and the tremendous power ol the few men in control lies in the fact that thev are able to sway, to influence, and to direct the use of it at opportuni ties or critical times. With its command over such an enor mous amount of ready money, and with directing influence over a largo number oi its" allies' money, the trust is able to wield a financial power suffloicnt to make or break the national prosperity or the national credit, and even vitally to affect ,l)he national Government. One of our best authorities thus sums up the powers of the trust. It could, he says "Call £40,000,000 of loans overnight, and ruin any adversary. Reduce credits to such a degree as to cause extreme money stringency, and great commercial distress. "Tic up the cash holding of the New York banks by demanding the certificating of cheques for enormous amounts. "Deplete the bank reserves m-New York bv causing shipments of cash to any part of tlie country. "Make the money rate of interest almost what it chose, from 2 per" cent to 100 per cent, on call loans. "Cripple the financial operations of the Government by refusing to purchaso any bond issue. "Dictate the financial operations of the great railway systems and expanding in dustrial. corporations. "Dictate— and does actually dictate— the terms and exactions of every company promotion that is important enough to -be financed bv Wall street." And withal it is p-enerally admitted that Ihc new trust has had a good, steadying influence on the financial world. and that, with its tremendous powers prudentiv ex- ' ercised, the, work would probably" bo beneficent. FORCIBLE FEEDING. » Mr. Gladstone Tries It on Himself. IIow Mr. Herbert Gladstone experi mented on bimsnif in order to test the sensations of a suffragette being fed by. .force was revealed- by Mr. Winston Churchill in a speech . at . Dundee. Mr. Churchill was asked whether, it he ' be-, namo Home Secretary, "he would put a stop to tho inhuman method of '. Steading suffragettes." Mr. Churchill said ho had;1 felt great regret that these methods' had had to be adopted. (Cries of "Shame.") No. he did not think it was a ' shame. If the v .were going to take up the Posi tion that anv prisoner in -any prison, no matter what 'his crime, might obtain re- lraso or commit suicide, they reduced the whole punitive system of the coun try to an absurdity. "I an» informed,"- Mr. Churchill added, "that the system of" feeding through the nostrils is not a brutal one. Mr. Gladstone . took the best poe- 'blo means of ascertaining this. He had it tried on himself. I-Ic had adminis tered in this way ah entire meal of egg and milk, and so little inconvenience did he feel that, ho could " talk perfectly well during the whole lime of the oper ation." ROOT PRUNING FRUIT TREES. It not infrequently happens that cer tain varieties of fruit trees arc found to be very slow iu coming into bear ing. This is particularly noticeable with certain kinds of apples when grown on the free stock (seedling apple), and tho same remark applies to most pears on the free stock, also to stone fruits. When growing for market this is a seri ous matter, as all the expenses of cul tivation liavc to be met, if the future well being of the trees is. a considera tion, whether any returns arc forth coming or not, and as there is a de mand for these varieties, it is useless to suggest that growers should avoid planting them. In a largo number of districts the pro duction of fruit can be hastened by planting trees on dwarfing stocks, hut in some cases this procedure cannot be considered a commercial success ; on really rich soils these stocks are to be recommended, but even then vigor ous growing varieties do not always come quickly into bearing when left to themselves. When the roots arc coarse, and strike deeply into the soil and subsoil, the shoots produced are also coarse and-, gross, and fail to mature sufficiently to develop blossom buds, with a conse quent failure to produce fruit. Fruit trees to bear freely ' must have a good fibrous root system, and "these roots must bo near the surface. Trees growing in this way will eventu al! bear fruit, and that heavily, pro vided that they are sufficiently far apart to allow of free extension, and that the growths made by them . are not too severely cut back. Thinning the branches to about 18 inches apart, and removing tho unripened points, is nil tho pruning that should bo given to trees growing with excessive vigour. This will hasten the production ol fruit considerably, hut shoots grown tinder such condition's arc vcrv susceptible to attacks of canker in apples and poars, and gum in stone fruits; they are also likely to be pulled out of place, perhaps broken, when ! laden with fruit, being too thin and weak to carry the crop properly. Grow ers should aim at the production of sturdy, well matured shoots only if quick returns are required, and when trees of even tho most vigorous varieties make more than 20 inches to 24 inches of ' growth in a season, it is n sure" indi cation that they aro. developing some, deep growing coarse roots. Fruit trees, therefore, which aro producing wood at the expense' of fruit, should ho pruned some time in autumn. Trees root pruned 1 at that time quickly become re-established, . and frequently make sovcral inches . of new growth before the ground becomes too cold. If left much later, new growth does not commence till spring, while, if operations are begun much earlier tho shoots shrivel. Lifting and replanting should he tho method adopted with trees three or four years old ; it longer established, root pruning will bo most advisable. In the case of pears and plums grown , as bushes, nyramids, or trained trees, it- almost always pays to lift about the second or third year after planting. This usually causes them to develop fruit j hudg freely tho following summer, with out giving, an undue check. At this tlnve the roots, will J>" moderately plentiful; . and - fibrous, ami will therefore quickly j ;make nr fresh, start . in. tho soil. J MODERN JERUSALEM, Impression of an American Journalist. The distinguishing features of Jeru salem to-day. writes an American journa list, are dirt, disease, and poverty. It is perhaps the dirtiest city in the world, and if it docs not rank first In disease and povorty, it is because other cities take more effectual measures to hide these twin disgraces. The pavements of Jeru- ralcm which were trodden bv Jesus and His d'icinlcs lie buried beneath 30 feet of ac cumulated filth and debris of 19 centuries. Ono of the lew clean and swcot places within tho walled eitv of Jerusalem to day is the Roman Catholic Church built over the Eccc Homo arcb, which still stands over the judgment scat upon which sat Pontdus Pilate when ho said : "I find no fault in this man." After a day's journey through the dark and slimy streets of tho holy citv it is indeed a "relief to enter this church. Ono is received by a sister of the order of Zion, ono who used to teach in a convent in St. Joseph, in the State of. Missouri, and who is particularly cordial in greet ing Americans. Everything in the church and its neighbouring convent is immacu- I late, and for the first tijnc one gets a breath of air uncontaminated by Jeru salem's dirt. Tho good sister shows one down a (light of stairs into the chapel of the Ecce Homo arch. Just behind, the arch is a section of the paved street of the Via Dolorosa along which Christ carried tho burden of His cross towards Calvary. The stones of tho pavement are cut in corrugations to prevent siinning on the sharp incline, and on one side of the roadway, cut in the paving stones, Is a hopscotch diagram upon which the Roman soldiers amused .themselves with the same game which American children play on ' the ashnhait strco's of our modern cities. This is one of the few bits of the actual Jerusalem of the tlav of Jesus now to he seen in its original form. One cannot help but be glad that this particular portion of tho ancient citv of David was found and preserved by good Catholics who believe in keeping things clean. RELICS OF THE TEMPLE. At the same time depressing and fas cinating, one of the principal sights of Jerusalem is the wailing place of the Jews, Here remain a few of the found ation stones of the platform upon which stood the temple of Solomon. They are the only remaining relics of the temple, and as such are most holy to tho Jews Not being permitted to enter the temple area, now a sacred place of Mahometau- lsm, the Jews come to these stones to weep and mourn for the departed glorv of Israel. The majority of the inhabit ants of modern Jerusalem are Jews Some of them are descendants of that remnant which escaped destruction at the -hands of the Romans, who were noi- in cluded in the dispersion, and who havo lived always in Judea. Their number has been greatly aug- men ted at various times, and- is even now_ receiving manv accessions from the Jewish colonies in al) parts of the world. Many Jews come to Jerusalem' to die ?."« . tIlB ,ciiv is crowded with the old and infirm- of that- faith, who have come back to the city of their fathers to await the 'end. The. native Jew of Jerusalem fs dis tinguished by his long cloak or gabar dine and his fur-trimmed turban. The Jew from eastern Europe is distinguished by the absence of the turban, and bv the two -.curly locks of hair, one falling J11 from off cacli ear. A: few of the native Jews are well to do, and their gabardines - ate gorgeous garments ot purple sntin. but the vast , majority are c victims . of abject and hopeless poverty. The rich and poor, the orien tal and the occidental, all Jews of ortlip.rtox faith, come together at thi« wailing .place. There is rare!r a time whem there is not hal. a dozen men of Israel there fo mourn for their denarted nativity. _On Friday evening, the begin ning of the Sabbath day. the narrow .street is crowded to sufTocation. On? of the chief rabbis- intones the" nraver ." Because of the nalaoc which "is ' de- sprt-ed, we sit alone and ween. Because of the temple which is destroyed, we sit alone and weep. tVe beseech Thee to have 2 f'10Tn- and gather together the children of Jerusalem. Make speed make sneed. O Deliverer of Zion : sneak after the heart of Jerusalem. V Nr0 otl(, ,toJ>e Drnfo»nd!v affected bv the pathos of these prayers. HORRIBLE SIGHTS. But at the same time one's eyes and nose and ears are offended by the horrible sights, the noisome odours, and the r»fKiUi? voices, ail, ab«t him. Two Catholic priests from Buffalo N Y l1! . by .,thrt wailing wall with bared iV - A pra)?r for 0,0 miserable beings before them. A horribly misshapen disease- r i dd e n hag begged Ihom for alms. One of the good fathers felt in his pocket for a coin, and, unfortunately, brought up a silver piece worth 25 cents. Tins was such a great amount of wealth that the old hag screamed with delight When she felt it in her hand. But her joy was short lived, for a huge, strong man struck her in the face w'th his fist, tore the coin from licr hand, and, kicking her bleeding head, fled away. The horror- stricken priests wero besieged, and literally junuued against the wall by a horde of repulsive beggars. Fighting for breath, one of the Americans struck tno shoulder of a one-armed hoy, only to find that there was a perfectly good arm on the other side, concealod under the bov's jacket. The two priests were happy "to escape without bodily injury. It is very difficult to remember that 0110 is in a holy place under such circumstances. THE PREVALENCE OF LEPERS. One goes out of tho city along tho road to the Garden of Gcthscmanc. On both sides , lie serried ranks of loathsome lepers, who implore aid and morcy from the coming pilgrim, and who scream viie curses at the backs of those who pass tliem by. In the days When Jesus of- Nazareth walked .this way the strict .sanitary regulations of tho Mosaic law were in eflcct, and tlie lepers were segregated. But civilisation in Jerusa lem to-day is not nearly so advanced as it was 1000 years ago, and there Is not the slightest attempt to enforce even the simplest sanitary precautions. There is no more heartrending walk in the world than that from the gates of Jerusalem to the garden wherein our Lord made the supreme sacrifice. "Nevertheless not my I will, hut Thine be' done." Now the pil grim reaches the gates of Getlisemane with a feeling of infinite relief, for with- 1 in all is clean and beautiful, and the ancient ghosts of olive trees, which probably stood hero on the night of tho agony of" Jesus, nre carefully tended by the Franciscan friars. If tlie regeneration of the Turkish em pire. under tlie new constitution, moans anything at all, it should moan a re formed municipal administration in Jeru salem. Hero exists to-dav the ruins of the most- wonderful system of water works . ever devised by man, here is l-hc centre of the religious interest of tlie civilised world, and there is what could bo made a beautiful - city. iNcw water works. a sanitary sewer' system, anil an adequate police force would make a Jerusalem indeed. v ' CLEANEST SECTION OF CITY, Perhaps the cleanest section ol the city, within the walls, is the American quarter built- around the Church oi St. James, but -even this is pervaded by a stcncli so disgusting that, an Amcrioan can hardly 'walk through its streets. Less than one-tenth of tho population of Jerusalem is Mahometan, and it stands as the shame of Christendom and Juda ism that the Moslems of Jerusalem aro the cleanest class of people in the city, It is also true that the Moslems arc tho most peaceful and lawabiding. Tho only violence connected with tho . Young . Turk revolution in Jerusalem was tho series i f assassinations resulting from a quarrel between two factions of tlie Greek Ortho dox church. Jeru-salom, outside of the wails, Is modern and comparatively clean. It is made up of convents and liosnlccs hous ing the holy- orders of several cmu-clies. of Protestant . colonics and schools, of business houses and hotels. It has no- 1 thing 'In common with the Jerusalem within tho walls. Outside, tho streets aro broad and well paved, and carriages are much used. Inside, the streets are' so narrow, so steep, and so often cut up bv steps that the use of any sort of wheeled vehicle is impossible. There is outside the wall, an American colony populated- principally hy the devotees of a religious sect founded in Illinois, which offers hospitality to American pilgrims, of any faith. The colony 'is cngaeed in the manufacture of souvenirs, which are ' sold in great quantities, and at good ' profits to tourists from the United , States. i Bui it is not ir. bits ot Roman pavc- ment. nor yet in modern souvenir shops that Jerusalem has its greatest hold upon the interest, the imagination,, and the reverence of the pilgrim. The very centre, of holiness in the Holy City is ia tho sepulchre of Jesus. WEALTH IN MANCHURIA,- Enormous Natural Resources. To describe fully the natural resources of Manchuria would bo a task of con siderable Imagnitudc, for the area is big and the resources varied. The mountains and hills of tjio east and south-east are rich with minerals. Coal abounds in many places, and 43 mines aro now in operation in Fcng- tien province. What tlie output of coal might lie under proper management no one can say. declares tho American " Review ol Reviews," for native mining is most crude, and rich veins are merely scratched. Silver, lead, gold, platinum, asbestos, antimony, and iron mines have i.een located in great number, and are await ing the touch of development to s» ell tho business of the country. In al| probability gold supplies for a new monetary scheme in China could ho taken from the mines of Manchuria, thus making practical the possibility ol China's release from the present- evils of a fluctuating silver currency. About the headwaters of the Sungari and Yalu Rivers are magnificent virgin forests of pine, walnut, and ash. Some lumbering is carried on by the Chinese, but the methods arc so crude anc'i waste ful, and the cost of getting lumber out so high, tliat timbers and c'drae. sion stuff cannot compete with Oregon pine 111 . the. large markets. The mineral anil forest wealth of Man- jchuria, however, is insignificant compared to the almost boundless wealth of tlie J soil. Thousands of square, miles of deep, . brown, loamy soil exist, the fietus .str. tch- ing away to the- horizon, or to the oack- | gr0und of a rugged mountain, dotted , here and there with the mud houses of tho farmer, and creating in the mind as nothing else can the impression of vast wealth. From this wonderful fettile ' soil the native farmer takes bountiful crops. I-Ie sows his. seeds, and the fertile, foamy soils give up their products almost unaided by the skill or mcchanioal genius of man. About the centres ot life' the . fields are small, and the farmer grows I garden truck and potatoes, but in the interior the universal crops are kaoliang (sorghum), soy beans, and millet. The kaoliang and millet are tlie staple foods of the people, just as rice is the staple food of Japan and south ChiJH, and the soy beans are the money crop of the country— cooking and lighting oil being expressed from the seeds, and the residue being shipped to Japan to fer tilise the rice fields. Tlie bean cake ship ments from Newehwang, Dalny, and An lung in 1903 amounted to 515,198 tons ; beans, 239,298 tons; .bean oil, 1,930 tons ; having a total value of la,0"s6,649 dollars (United States gold;. Hi the hilly region ol South-eastern Manchuria Indian corn is the staple crop and staple food of the people. Peaches, apricots, pears, and crab apples grow wild in the hills, and only a few Chinese are engaged 'in fruit culture, although lbs demand for fruit is great, and carloartis of oranges and pears are shipped in from Japan and- south China. In Kirin province, in the north, con siderable tobacco is grown, and, con sidering the native methods of growing and curing, the quality is excellent. The growing of silk cocoons on the native oaks, ! that cover the hills of south-eastern Manchuria, is an agricul tural industry of considerable size, the trees being cut back every few vears in order to furnish new growth for the silkworms. The cocoons are shipped to Chefoo, in China, ant', Japan, where the spinning and weaving of pongee silks arc done.
