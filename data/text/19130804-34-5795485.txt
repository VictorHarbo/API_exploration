THE COMPANY was incorporated in August, 1910, with a Nominal Capital of £20,000 ia 20,000 shares Of £1 each, of which 5,000 shares, fully paid up, were offered to the International Fertilizers Company of Australasia, Limited in liquidation) in payment for the whole of its business as a going concern, and 5,000 shares were offered to the public and were taken up and have now been fully paid for. The 10,000 shares now offered to the public were reserved for future issue, and are now issued by the Directors, pursuant to Article 99 paragraph 8, of the Articles of Association of the Company. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE for three years, and during that time has firmly established on the market its International A.A.B. Wheat Manure, and International A.B. (which is equal to the best Bone Super). Those Manures are well and favorably known through- . out South Australia, and there is a steady demand for them. THE COMPANY hold the Patent Rights for the Commonwealth of two most valuable patents for an improved process of manufacturing high-class Nitrogenous Fertilisers from waste animal products. The principal base from which these Manures are manufactured is waste leather, of which there is a plentiful supply at a reasonable figure. The processes protected by these patents have hitherto been exploited in South Australia only, but the Directors are hopeful of extending the operations of the Company into the other States. THE RESERVED CAPITAL is being called up to cope with the ever-increasing demand made on the Company for its special brand of fertilisers. These demands have lately become so insistent that it has become imperative for the Company to erect further plant and machinery to enable it to supply them. THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY at Dry Creek, formerly" known "the Dry- C^^Stoeltins Works, occupies 11 Acres of Valuable Land, with a railway frontage to the property, and siding connecting"- the property with the railway. The property is so large that there is ample room for extension. ' THE Central Board of Health and the Yatala South District Council have granted Licenses to the Company for the manufacture of superphosphate and other chemical manures on the Company's property. THE ATTENTION OF INTENDING SHAREHOLDERS IS SPECIALLY DIRECTED TO THE FACT THAT THIS COMPANY IS ALREADY IN THOROUGH WORKING ORDER, WITH AN ESTABLISHED MARKET AND A STEADY D) DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS, AND ONLY RE- QUIRED THE RESERVED SHARES TO BE TAKEN UP IN ORDER TO EXTEND ITS BUSINESS AND TO COPE WITH A GROWING INFLUX OF ORDERS. , \- ANY further information required by Intending shareholders will be folly and promptly given on application to any of the Directors, the Secretary or the Broker.
