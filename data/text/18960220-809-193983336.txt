Then I told him hotr much good your Liver and Kidney Pills had done inc. £ then tnld him that I had two (21 boxe nf Rright's Disease Pills that 1 did not require, ami if he would take theni I would not charge him if they dirt him no good, but if he found them do good I would charge him 10». per box.
