tho subjoct of " Tho Liability of Common Cainois in Caso of Tatal Accident " This papoi derives its significauco from tho loss of tho largo sum of £39,455 paid by tho Iïailway Commis sionors to claimants for dnmagos incurred through tho Kodfeiu îailway accident m Ortobei, 1891 Moro than oighteen months have passod sinco tho occurrence of that calamity Vítor the legal decisions had boon arrived at in Soptemboi last w o urged tho necessity of some limitation of tho public liability by special Act of Pat hament buch as had beon rjassod in Vic lona, whoro nothing in excess of £2000 can bo claimed for domagos by or on bohalf of any ono person, but so fai nothing has boon done Mi TFFCB dealt with, onlj a blanch of tho subject-an impoitant ono, no doubt, but still a branch It was hold by tho Courts that tho sum of each aw ard must be roducod on account of tho amount duo on a policy of insurance on the life of the person accidentally killed Mr TEECE does not challenge tho right to rodueo an aw aid where nu insuranco has boon offectod That, wo may suppose, ho íegards as a mattei for independent consideration His criticism goes to the question of tho amount of tho roduction And on this point ho regards tho law as deficient in clearness, which he attributes to tho want of acquaintance on tho part of Judges with the punciplos of life insurance In endeavouring to ascertain from conflicting deliverances what is tho real meaning of tho law on tho subject, Mr ThEan nirives at the conclusion that any award by a Court for loss ought to be reduced by a sum which is tho measuro of the pooumaiy advantage ncciuing from the accélération of the death by accident Practically thflt would bo about or rathor less than tho difference between tho sur rondoi valuo and the face value of tho polioy of insuranco, the Government claim ing that as in no w ay duo to tho îopro sontativos of the person killed Such a tieatmont of the insuranco provision in the event of a claim for award would leave to the os-ocutor of the claimant his right- ful share of the amount paid by the insur- ance company, depriving him only of tho amount of tho pohey which accrues from tho acceleration of tho death by accident. Obviously, no greater doduction from an award would bo justifiod. And it is opon to fair consideration whotkor tho sum of tho deduction might not bo lessened by an amount corresponding -with that which tho law permits to bo exempted from un insurance provision against tho claims of creditors. If tho oxocutois of a lifo in- surant are pormitlod to hold £500 against such olaims, then it would not bo incon- sistent to allow a liko sum, if no moro, in addition to tho surrender valuo of a life policy, cloar of any ayvnrd made to thorn through tho wrongful net of common carriers. If tko surrender valuo of tito policy at tho timo it bocamo a claim, plus £500 or any lessor amount, woro allowed to tho claimant, then ho would bo on fairly equivalent terms with tho insurer whoso policy is similarly protoctod against creditors. But, nftor nil, this insuranco feature of tho question is not tho most important. No doubt it is dosirnblo to dotormino how far individuals aro to bo affoctod by a lifo insuranco provision in cnso of accident. But it is imporativo that tho public should know how far it is liablo for damago through tho nogligonco o£ its sorvnnts. At present tho liability is an unknovrn quantity. "What is tho pecuniary valuo of tho most valuablo lifo it is impossiblo to say, but it would bo a large amount. And a number of such lives may bo lost under circumstancos similar to tltoso killed nt Redfern, and vvould result in claims of far groator amount than £39,455 and involve a sorious.drain on tho publio revonuo. At prosont a claimant is ontitled to full com- pensation for pecuniary loss incurred through casualty tho result of carolossnoss or nogloct of tho Railway Dopnvtmout. "Why, howovor, for an equal faro tho Commissioners should carry ono man witli a liability of £20,000 in case of accidont for tho samo payment as another with a liability of £500 or £50 is not apparent. And yet that is what has boon dono for a long timo, and is now dono ovory hour of every day iu tho year. "Whether tho man has paid 3d from Nowtown to Sydney or £3 from a moro distant station the occur ronco of an accident the result of nogloct justifies tho frionds of tho assured in making a claim, it may be for £50 or £50,000, if thero bo a lifo so valuable. In tho circumstancos the Govorntuont may bo fairly called upon to protect the public purse, oithor by requiring railway pns songors to pay differential fares or limit- ing tho amount which can bo demanded in the yvay of award in caso of accident. In practice it would bo difficult if not impos- siblo to fix ratos on " differential basis, | tho amount of tho risk being so trilling and so various in long or short journeys. If Government fixed the rates for carriago exclusivo of the amounts for risk, loaviug passongors to mako thoir own insuranco provision, tho case might bo met. But unless made compulsory there is too much reason to fear tho provision would bo often neglected. And, perhaps, it is good policy not to allow to go uupunishod tho sorvic6 yvhioh commits the default. The mothod which has boon adopted in Vic- toria of limiting to £2000 tho sum that can bo awarded in tho caso of any single claimant will probably commond itself as a reasonable ono. It might not bo quito equal, but it would givo all as much as they ought to havo from a common ser- vice. Even if tho claim of any ouo indivi- dual woro limited to £2000, the aggregnlo sum to bo paid as tho result of such an accident as that which occurred at Red- fern would bo considerable. AVhoro railway passongors valuo their lives at moro than £2000, tlio accident assuranco offices aro open to thom at v,ery moderato promiums, which thoy and not tho general public ought to pay. Tho heavy claim on tho railway revonuo suggosts tho propriety of the Railway Commissioners making an annual insur- anco provision for such calamities, so that tho consequeucos shall not press unevenly ngninst tho rovonuo of any particular year. "Whethor this is done by reserving a lund soparato from tho ordinary accounts or through an insuranco com- pany doos not matter much. Completo statists aro now oxtonsivoly kept, and wo knoyv that insurances havo boen effected olsewhere by railway authorities with offices for tho cover of risks of this kind. And doubtless our Railway Com- missioners could readily insuro against loss by arrangement with somo accident or lifo office. The necossity for insuranco I is greater, though it would perhaps bo moro difficult to offecc it while tho | liability remains unlimited than if tho maximum risk yvero fixed. But whotkor the liability bo unlimitod or £2000 the possiblo consequences of accident aro so sorious that the Commissioners would do well to considor tho question of an arrangement to cover tho loss by somo provision yvhioh yvould froo tho annual balance-shoot and consequently the con- solidated rovonuo of tho colony from fluctuating deficiencies. But, as wo havo said, tho really important foaturo of this railway accidont liability is tho reduction of tho amount of it. And it is to ho hoped the Government will soon bring in a measuro to deal with tho subject. The importance of the recent Budget speech of Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH lies in the ovidouco it supplies of tho wondor ful prosperity of tho United Kingdom, but thnt doos not exhaust the interost of tho statement. It throyvB such a number of sidelights upon tho indulgences and the habits of tho people. "It is calcu- lated," said tho Chancellor of tho Ex- chequer, " by the Customs authorities that no less valuo than £1,000,000 a year is literally thrown into tho guttor in tho .shape of ends of oigarottos and cigars," Tho not increase of ono-third of a million sterling in receipts from tho tobacco duty is ascribed to tho consumption of cigarettes. Thero aro persons who dis- tinguish between smoking tobacco and smoking cigarettes, but wo now have tho oxcellont authority of tho British Customs and tho Chancellor of tho Exchequer against such distinction. Tho voguo of tho cigarette is indisputable. In vain do American state legislatures attempt to banish this seductive luxury ; in vain have doctors discovered a now malady, tho " oigarotto heart." Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH mentioned one manufacturer yvho a few years ago hardly made any " coffin-nails," as tho Americans have named thom, now his output is tyvo millions a day. During tho controversy in Melbourne lately about tho tobaeco tax it was stated that a big trust controlled tho manufacturo of cigarettos in Australia, whero tho output is enormous, and the import is also very largo. How tho wasto of that million sterling comos about was explained by the English Chancellor. Peordo do not smoko oithor oigars or cigarettos to tho bitter end ; so much tobacco thou is thrown into tho gutter. But is that all loss ? _ Among tho curious industries of groat oitios is the collection and the working up of those stumps ; employees of clubs and hotels yvho mako a good thinç out of corks of recognised brands aro said to traffic oven in the yvaste tobacco of thoir establishments. Tho Chancellor confessed to being a non smoker, and declared that ho regarded smoking as waste ; perhaps ho did not know that there is " lio " tobacco, justas tho Chinese have "lie" toa. Tko revenue in Great Britain from tobacoois 10J millions, to whioli tho workod-up stuff makes no conti íbution Thoioforo it may from a Troasury point of viow bo logaided as absolute wasto Porhaps this trait is part of tho lack of thrift in tho nntionnl clmractoi Tho English smoke 23 ounces per inhabitant 3'earlj, to 81 ounces in Bel- gium and Tlollnnd, 70 in Tuikoy, l8 m G01 many, and 20 in Pi anco, and it may bo ventured that in Continental countries, though tho pipo is not tho only medium, there is not so much as a 10 por cont wnsto In the mnttoi of intoxicants thoiû are somo noteworthy results. Tho consump- tion of champagne had mcronsod in tho financial j oar by 1,200,000 bottles. That is not by itsolf oxtiaordinary In a timo of business activity and prosperity tho increase in tho use of this, the wino of luiuiy, of ostentation, of hospitality, naturally follows But tho Chancellor had a Bpocial explanation. During last }onr, that is tho Tioapuiy yoai, South Afnca and Wcslorn Austialia had boomod, and thoso hundred thousand do/ona liad gone, ho thought, 111 " rlmstoning " (ho now companies If so, Clio Chancolloi will liavo a different tnlo next jeal, for at all ovonts South Afnca will not just now fumsh much canso for lojoiciug 111 Loudon 01 at Rhoims Ono sentenco in tho speech has a benimg upon oin Australian wine in- dustry Sir MICHAEL IIIOKS B> von ro mniked that tho consumption of stiong wines was distinctly decreasing m tho United Kingdom , but tho consumption of light w mes, nmong w Inch our products aio to bo icckoned, goos on mci easing As to boors, " I boliovo the bioweis have no\oi had a bettor j oar," tho Chancellor said Towards this lcsult tho mild w nitoi had stimulated consumption, nhilo tho cheapness of bailey, malt, and hops had holppd production. That was not tho only indication that the countiy was doing a gioat doal to supply the local demand for stimulants Toi instanco, blandy had becomo scaico mid deni What used to cost 5s Gd a gallon now costs 9s 2d, and imports had fallon off by 19 per cent.
