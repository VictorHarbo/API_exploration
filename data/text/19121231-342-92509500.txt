Commenting upon the results of i the year's work, the Minister in y charge of immigration (Mr. Hagel t-horn) stated that, unfortunately, the grounds for complaint about tiw inexperienced men who had coma forward as farm workers were too frequent, and it was seen that a considerable proportion of them had ' had no previous knowledge of farm ing operations. The few Danish, and Scandinavian farm labourers whem the State 'had succeeded in obtain ing stood out in striking contrast to those secured .from Great Britain, ? The Minister said that his efforts would be- specially directed during 1913 to securing a good sprinkling of '* Danes and Scandinavians.
