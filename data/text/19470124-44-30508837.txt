SELECTION OF, MIGRANTS Tightening Of Permit System CANBERRA. January 23 The Federal Government in-<*> tended to be more selective in future in granting permits for refugees to enter Australia, the Minister for Immigration <Mr. Calwell. said today. The Government now felt that it had gone as far ns could bn reasonably expected in ihe grant ing ol applications on humani tarian grounds. That avenue was now closed. In future, selection would be based on the age and ability of applicants to fill skilled occupa- j tions where a marked labor j shortage existed. j Mr. Calwell said that refugees | who entered Australia last year represented only 2 p.c. of the total admissions. Admissions comprised 34,500 persons, made up of 28.000, Australians and other British sub jects. 5.800 of other nationalities, and 700 refugees. Refugee Categories Some of the major groups in the second category were:â€”Americans (l._ool. Dutch H. 4301. French <600>. Greek (_9o>. Russians <170>, Yugoslavs (100). Danish <70). Nor wegians (60?. Swedes i3O), Swiss 140). and Belgians (30). As a contiibution to the solution of the general world problem of placing refugees, the Government had issued a few thousand permits to refugees who had close rela tives in Australia able to maintam and accommodate them. Not all of those were Jews. No permits had been issued to: refugees without relatives here.; because of the acute housing; shortage in Australia. Many or the refugees who had ! obtained permits were not likely to j reach Australia because of the j extreme difficulty of obtaining passages, or because they had de- I cided to go elsewhere. Others had j died since the permits were issued. ! \- I
