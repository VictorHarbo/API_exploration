I have'seen in Manchester, in a dub, two Danish pirates, .a Belgian, nnii an Ancient Briton playing a game of bil liards. They all bore English names; they' were all Englishmen. But they did aot belong to one race. One. of my friends, who is a rab idly laslrfotte Scolsman, was cracking up Scoftssd. if> roe- one day. When I toid him he wag not Scotch he nearly cholved. But he rwas a spfrolar and liad brains. I turned him reiinfl to a plale-^ass Awndow and asked hlnj "to look at the reOectjops of fiinseif . ..-ana inc. \ver<" men <jf {lie same ■-! tj-pc, fefcort, square; wife aquiline noses and black brows. I «sai<t; "Aid ©qi Csesar's legions come here and PBttle ' here?" And he looked at our figures in ihe window and i "Man, ye're right. I see two Bonwh soldiers." You see my point? He was a Scot, I was an. Englishman ; but we were both descendants of the Roman race and breed and type. Now then, here was ihe pair of us. One of us was extolling the Scotch st the expense of the English. Both of us were ot Roman type. He was not a real Scot and 1 knew I was not a real Englishman. How do I know that my correspondent with the Irish name, who hates the imaginary Sax ens, is any more an Irishman than my ultra-Scottish friend was a Scots man ? Imagine an Ibernlan Spaniard from Kerry cursing an Anglo-Saxon born if an Italian mother and a Dutch father. $a*$ae t p«s« (nm Soft retting at s Dane from Lowestoft. Imagine, any Ignorant, bigo ted radial ^brank hold ing forth 'about the morals and man ners of the "English." Which -:Eng lish? ^There is ias much difference be ; tween the: people of "Wlutechapel and' the people of Wigan 4>r between the: people of Sussex and the people of . Cumberland as there is between the pepple jof Belfast andthe people"' of Cork. The morals and manners of Tooting Bee are. not the morals and .--manners ofSloarie Square, and the manners of Camberwell differ : from both. a . Manyso-ealled Englishmen are of Jhe same race as many so-called Irish men. The di£ferehce*i}*etween the peo ple jcaUing themselves Irish 'and the people- calUng themselves English - is a difference of -tradition. There is a traditionof sentiment, of conduct, and . of religion In the one country differ ing imaterially from the tradition in the other country. Climate also counts Jov much, jfjswas on the ^Biver Crouch onfce-on, A inend's yacht. The owner, - whose, name was Du Maurier, - pointed , to a distant hill. "There was a battle therewith the Danes," he said; "and we got licked;1' I asked him .who got licked,-and he said, "We—ihe Saxons." He seemed quite annoyed because the ' Danes beat the'Saxons twelve hundred ^years, ago- And -his name was Du Maurier! There are thousands of JBaxons =*like Du Maurier. But our Irish critic makes speciBc charges against .his imaginary Anglo- - »Saxoh race, it seems that the Anglo rSaxons-ill^nsed: the Irishsand always r sought to dominate Ihe world. .Tins as talking - through the hat. • I think our critic will find-that the oppressors of Jbhe Irish were mostly ^.Normans or pScots, or 43ntch, or Jews Of -course, 5the Jrish poorliave been fflirealed; so ■ Jhave Ihe poor of England, Scotland, Wales, Russia, Germany, t Turkey, * Greece.

I did not notice that they were .less strict or less overbearing than men of English or Scottish blood. It is silly to generalise and to breathe fire and steel and insult and hatred over imaginary crimes committed. by imaginary races., Some of the best men I! have known were Irish—and some of the worst. — I might say ihe; ^feariie of the English! or of any other • nation of which I have had any experi ence.- - Virtue is a human and not a racial attribute. —The Glarion.
