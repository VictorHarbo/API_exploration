, T --I " I Danish Migration Australia Not Attractive Lieutenant Colonel V. Larsen, V.D. R.D., Vice-Consul for Denmark in Queensland, has returned to Brisbane after an absence abroad of about seven months. He left Australia in a Danish motor ship in January last and travelled leisurely to Copenhagen. In Denmark he had a crowded three months. It was 40 years since he had left the country and there were innumerable old friends and places of interest to be visited. In addition he had audi- ence with the King, a feature of the trip of which Colonel Larson is par- tlcularly proud, in view of the fact that just prior to his leaving Aus- tralia the King had sent him a special decoration. As the result of his trip Colonel Larson does not see much prospect of Danish immigration to Australia. The Dane, he says, likes his little bit of freehold, and the conditions required of the immigrant coming to Australia and the difficulties of obtaining free- hold do not attract him. There are numbers of fine men in Denmark anxious to go abroad, but the bulk of them are going to Canada, where better opportunities are available. The Vice-Consul said that his in- quiries showed him that Danish produce was as firmly established as ever on the London market, and he considered that it would be difficult for Australia, as a competitor, to replace it. Apart from the natural advantages that Denmark possessed, he said that the co-operative movement was so strong that only the first quality was placed in a regulated manner upon the market. While he was absent from Brisbane Colonel Larsen visited also Germany, France, Belgium, and Italy. He said that everywhere he found people com- plaining of the hard times, but he did not see much reason for the com- plaints. Fields and forests looked at- tractive and farms were clean and in good repair. The people seemed happy and contented enough, but they had to work hard.
