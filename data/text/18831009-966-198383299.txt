The Management regret their being onablo to obtain tbe Theatre Royal, which they have tried (or the past two years, bat &a; arrangements hare been made lor the appearance* of Misa Montague and Mr. Turner in England, and their time being so limited, they hate been prevailed upon to giro a Season in the above Ball, as the best suited place after the Theatre, where every possible attention will be given to the convenience and comfort of the Public. Miss Montagne desires It to he strictly understood that all that la advertised will be carried out, and that she will be supported by Artists that posaesa voices that she is confident have never been ezcellod them. The Melbourne Arpu* s&fB;" Miss Mont⪈ possesses a voice of rare beauty—soft, round, and mellifluous. It has been highly cultivated, and nhe manages it witb accurate taste and s&LII.; Ear trills are clear and distinct an tbe ringing of silver tall*, and the prolonged swelling notes ' lengthened aweet- \--s long drawn out'—they seem Indeed the soul of ordinary kind to listen to Miss Montague's vocalization. It is not alone as a perfect vocalist that we have to spoak of this lady, but as a lyrico-dramatic artist of great intelligence and such sympathetic manner as reach the hearts of all hearers. It is to her honour to be said that as an artist she becomes greatest wherein most in expected of her." Of Mr. Charles Turner the Argue says lie U certainly the finest English tenor we have ever heard in MeHwurne, with a tine commamilftR presence.

Miss Montague's natural taste ami love of music rendors her sinjfiiic thorounhly gymnathetic. It is no vain display of ability, or the exhibition of a superb natural organ; it is vocal) sin appealing to tbofeelingB, that brings tears welling to the eyoH, or makes the heart joyous and glad." Of Mr, Charles Turner the Herald says lie ii an operatic artist of the highest order, with a magniticont tonor voice." Sydney Express, June 4. says " We have oevoiwitoeased a more genuine triunyih tliaa was achieved by the Montague-Turner Opera Company lastnight^ Miss Montaijue's singing was sublimity itself, entrancing one and all.

We have never witnessed a greater and more gunuine Buccesa. Mr. Charles I'uraer's flno tenor voice fairly excelled ail we hare heard of him."
