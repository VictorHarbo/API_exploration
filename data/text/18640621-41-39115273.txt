The Eastern Empire arrived last evening, and as she is of lieht draught of water, and has had no serious case of sickness on the passage, it is pro bable she will proceed into harbour without delay. She has made a very good passage, though it has not been characterized by the most exemplary good feeling between the people on board. The disturbances, however, hate originated m matters of a most trivial nature, and on enquiry wilrdoubt less prove of easy adjustment. Dr. Duncan will visit the vessel early this morning, so that no delay will ensue in friends taking away those who are under assiated-passage certificates. The Omagh having discharged her lading from here in Sydney, proceeded to Newcastle, where Bhe filled up with coal and made sail on the 9th June on the return voyage. During the first day or two light variable weather predominated, but subse quently she experienced fearfully heavy gales, in which it was positively necessary for the safety of the vessel to carry on a press of canvas in order to weather the Promontory-a feat which was only accomplished by a severe straining to her hull In five days from the time of leaving she was within 60 miles of Kangaroo Island, but strong north-west winds prevented her making headway into the Gulf till Sunday, when it vee'red to the southward, enabling Captain Davison to conclude a quick though stormy passage. The Thomas Campbell, from London, arrived at a late hour yesterday evening. She brings a full cargo of general merchandise, the particulars of which wilfappear in our next. VESSELS IN HARBOUR.
