SUMMARY EUROPE. POLITICAL. The Cabinet is sitting nearly every day preparing its mmeasures for the session winch is to commences on the 10th June. Apart from this fact there is an entire absence of political intelligence. Even when the Premier spoke at the mayor's quarterly dinner on the 9th inst he eschewed politics, and spoke only on local topics. The calm is unusual in view of the early assembling of Parliament, and there is a good prospect of a quiet and fairly fruitful session.

The chair was taken by Mrs. H. A Dugdale. The purpose of the meeting having been declared it was determined on the motion of Mrs. McKay seconded by Miss Simmons that the association should be called "The Victorian Women's Suffrage Society." Mrs. Lowe proposed, Mrs. Ricketts seconded, and it was resolved that all the ladies and gentlemen present should be included in a general committee with power to add to their number. The executive committee was appointed, on the motion of Mrs. Stevenson, seconded by Mrs. Webster as follows:— Mrs. Lowe Mrs. Dugdale, Mrs. McKay, Mrs. Elliott, Mrs. Ricketts, Miss Simmons, Mr Johnson, and Mr Brunton. It was resolved unani- mously that Mrs Rennick be requested to act as secretary and tresurer. A committee was then appointed to draw up a constitution and bye-laws for the society consisting of Mrs. Rennick, Mrs. Dugdale, and Mr. Jones. The membership subscription for ladies or gentlemen was fixed at 5s. per year, it being understood that donations would also be in- vited. Nearly all those who were present became members and paid their subscrip- tions besides which several donations were handed in and many letters which were read to the meeting expressed sympathy with the movement while regretting the inability of the writers to attend. Public meetings are to be called shortly to invite general co-opera- tion for the objects of the society.
