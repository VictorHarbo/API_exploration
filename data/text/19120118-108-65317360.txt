OF RURAL INTEREST, (Special for this Paper). (fsy "Rustio ) ADDING NEW 1'ROVI?NCES TOXIC \- TORIA. l'lhe' departure of the Victoriatn Land Settlers' delegation for Amterica may be taken as the chief event of, the week fromt the point of view that is taken in this colulmn-that. of rural interests. .Mlessrs. W. Uatanach and D. L'owrick, who have been entrusted with the important mission to bring to this State expert irrigationlse., fromn those parts of the United States where the wilderness has been convert edl into a land flowing with milk and honey by the judicious use of water, are entitled to the standing of am bassadors. Upon the success of their efforts depenus the realisation to the full of the potentialities that lie in our irrigable lands. Aipd the elfects of the influx of a botly of tile keen Amsericatn irrigationists who know the business anti hase the etergy aind detertnina tion requiredl to make the most of their oplportunities, would lot be con fined to s'istoria. lite anjoiniag States lnare the essentials for audmg ithe new provinces and imllmense inlcre.e of pro .uction whieh ena be brought into ex. tsteace by irrigation properly applieti.

It is said tant the Government or the neighbouring State is so impres sed with Iis ability that they are offer nlg tempting inlldllCeie:.ts to hitll to go over to their service. The objeet lesson which till be providedl by the American irrigatiotists, if Messrs. tillatlll atndll JolWetK are abtitle to so curo them, will therefore have a far re.aching infllcence, and will be a po tent factor iin the develop.ment of ,the producing indulstries of Australia. Antother phase of the mllatter is the itlllttence these Imeni woulld have utpotn the native-born, who ilare disposed Ito rega:rd irrigation with scanlt respeect. T'le l'remlier, speakinig a few dslays ago, said that in ;laddition to senlding tule delegation to Allerica tanother soutld be sentt through l ictoria for the pur-r. pIs of b'ringlllllg abollullt Ill ltlCer standing of what there is in irrigation. lie is right. 'Ihe openling uti of the? Nortlerni Territorv, whlich is being ini tiated by the PFeteral tGovernmentll in II puny sort o?trway, will doubtless take frolit us a lot of tile yotung Imen whomi we can ill afford to lose. lThe fascitia tioli of the wide areas of coullllntry will Shave a greater chlarm fllor these melt than the iIICh more retisInterative til ling of the lalld uIlpon the liines of ntte succesful irragatiolist, who is a mucllll more valuable memllber of the colll munllity and, withal, a more collfort-i able antl a happtier one than, those who join those "dusty foreloupers" of the "'Legion that ilever t'was listed." T'le lpssibilities that are in irriga tion are illdicated in the recently s suted relport of the State lRivers a:nd Water bupply Cotmminssion. It points out that lor the past three years the contlllission Ilas beer at work oil the construlctionl of manisy tlliles of nlle chlannlels sand erecting nlew and larger itpumps on the lMurray.

As a result ntew activity is re ported as being tntmifested, land is be tug graded, lucerne and other fodder crops seeded, orchards and vineyards planted. Over 700 acres of nalow or chards have been planted in Rlodney this season, a larger .area has beenl planted to trees illad vines in Wlhite Cliffs, and substantial additions have been made to the intensely cultivated areas in Sttwan Hill antd Cohulina: it order to enable settlers who ar rived late last yeair to have a sutnllllle suipply of folder, the commnlissioln, by arrtlangemelnt with the Closer Settle Illlent lloatd, ploughed, graded and seeded to lucerlle about 3000 acres tof land in tracts of froml 53 to 20 acres olt inldividual blocks. It also prepared and seeded several hundred additional. acres to annlual fodder crops. This is probably the greatest increase in the area seeded to lucerne madle in one year since the irrigation districts were started. It is regarded by the coni missioners as being yet too early to forecast the contribution of the State's wealth which these new settlers will make. Much work is at piesent pre paratory. 'lhere are, however, stmany who have been in the State less than a year who are miakhig large returns eaclt mouth. lThe increase.l use of iit ter ailnd the coimpulsory charge for the volumie allotted for irrigatiotl is also ithproviig the finiainlcial condition of the various districts supplied. Developmentt, it is stated, would have been itmpossoble lhad there not been "ta marked increase ini population and labor in the irrigation districts. There were not enough Victori:ut set tlers to use the surplus water, :oad in 31 years prior to July, 1010 only 1551 immtigrants of all classes lhad come from oversea. The mission of the dele gation abroad' was to fild settlers and workers for the irrigation- areas. In the single year fromt July, 1910, to .Jlune, 1911, I008 people arrived and were dealt with by the office handling this class of immigrants; it created nler and better conditions; antid awoke atewi collfideince and enecgy'.

The arrival of these settlers has, 'it is re portesl, stimulated local it:terest and laireased settlement by V'ictoria s, and.as at result irrigation has miade greater progress in thle last trel'o imonthls tthan for.manay years preCious v ; ratlnit blocks at Whito Cliffs, ?yah, Coliluni, atnd Sltepparton have beei takei, anls practically the lwhole of tlio iler closer settlemients at KIo yuga, Nanteella, and ]amawnir is oc cupied.
