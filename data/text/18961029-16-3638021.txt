Dear Sirs-I am just in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and note contents. I am not, living at Booval now. I left about April, 1895. But for the sixteen months intervened between December, 1893, and April, 1895, I was not troubled in the least with the White Ants. They seemed utterly to disappear. Your remedy was most efficacious. If I am ever troubled with the pests again, a contingency which I trust is remote, I shall certainly apply for your assistance. I am pleased to learn that business is increasing. I wish you every success. Yours faithfully, P. A. O'SULLIVAN.
