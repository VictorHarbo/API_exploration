She Master and WardonB of the Trinity House, Port Adelaide, hereby glvo notlco that tho "MaoDonnoll Light," on Capo Northumberland, In lat. 88' 3' 0" S., long. 146" 87 ' 46" E, will bo oxlilbitod nightly on and altor the lat) January, I860, from sunset to sun- rise. The lighthouse towor, which Is 28 feet in height, «tanda on a rocky headland, elevated 103 foot above high water-mark. The light, which 1B catoptric and rovolving, consists Of three faces, and exhibits alternately every minute a White, rod, and green light on au arc visible from sea- ward from N. 74* E, to N. 60° W. round by south (by compass). The white light may bo soon from the dook of a modorate sized vessel about l8 miles, and from aloft at a distance proportionate to tho elovation attainoJ. The red light will not be teen, under the mo J. farorablo circumstances, at a groator dlstanoo than 26 miles. The green light will not generally bo distinguished beyond a rango of eight miles. During hot weather and N.E. winds, when thero ii Ölten much refraction, the white light will frequently bo obaervod at a great distance. Voséele approaching from tho outward should not bring the white or rod light to bear to tho westward of W.N. W., and whon tho green light becomes visible «n that bearing Bhould steer moro southerly, in order to give the reef, willoh stretches to tho outward of Cape Northumberland, a wido berth. , Vessels from tho northward should never sight tho : «bite or red light on a hearing more southerly than K, l8., and on distinguishing the green light should Immediately alter the course so as to glvo the outlying reefs, to the westward of the Capo running parallel to the ooast a mile from the shore, an offing. In bad weather, with the wind hanging from the southward, it will bo advisable to give the Cape snoh an offing as will enable a ship to pass tho llghtheuso Without sighting tho greon light ; and should the wo» thor, which Is- occasionally tho case, be thick, or it be . blowing hard, it will bo prudent not to sight the red light, which, under such circurmtances, would not bo seen at the distanoe first given. Tho ooast to the north-westward of tho Capo soon becomes loi-', and, owing to tho heavy ooean s woll, wbloh sets directly on the shore, should be very caro tully avoided. To the eastward cf tho Capo Is a deep bight, which offers no shelter from the prevailing winds and swell, Or Inducement to ontor.

A SHARK AND SWORDFISH CAUGHT TRANSFIXED.-The schooner Daphne, from Port Curtis, daring her pas— sage to this port, having occasion to slaughter some sheep for the ship's use, on Sunday morning the attention of several passongors was attracted to the appearance of several largo sharks alongside the ship's side, the smell of the blood no doubt having caused them to pay this visit. Ono of tho seamen harpooned a very fine fellow, who, not exactly feeling disposed to the rough handling he now experienced, lashed away with his tail to such an extent as, to use the words of Captain Hay, "to stop the ship's progress through the water." The Daphne was going five knots. A running bowline knot was eventually passed round the shark's tail; and my gentleman hauled on deck, where he was quickly despatched. He was found to measure 12 foot 6 inches in length. He had firmly embeddeed in his side eight inches of a swordfish. The backbone of the shark had become much onlarged in consequence. Captain Hay intends forwarding the curiosity to a society.—S A. Advertiser.
