R. Towns Ac Co. undertook the task of having her temporarily repaired and brought on to Sydney. Mr. Wren, the-diver, proceeded to Two fold Bay. and, after four days of arduous work, succeeded in stopping the leak that hail been made iu the woodenils forward, and rendering her fit to be towed to sea. The s.s. Star of the Evening was sent down to tow her to Sydney, and performed her work most satisfactorily. The vessels left Two fold Bay on Sunday last at noon, had fine weather with the wind off the land throughout, and arrived safely in this port at 4 a.m. on the 1st instant. Ihe Schah Jehan made but little water, so well had Mr. Wren effected the necessary repairs. She is now alongside Towns' Wharf.— Sydney Morning Herald, June 2. VESSELS DUIARBOUR.
