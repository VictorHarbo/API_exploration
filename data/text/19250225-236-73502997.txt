Foreign Migration SOME FACTS AND FIGURES. (Issued by Publicity Branch, Prime Minister's Department). The impression is widespread that persons of foreign birth are entering Australia in numbers so large as to menace the preservation of the pre- ponderant British element of our population. The Present Position. For the three years and six months ended September, 1924, the average annual excess of arrivals in, over de- partures from Australia, of British peoples, was 29,120. During the same period, the average annual excess of arrivals over departures of persons of foreign birth was 4610. The average annual increase in the population by excess of births over deaths during the same period was 82,000. Assuming that only 20,000 British- ers (a decrease of 9120 on the above figure) came here each year during the next decade—and that 20,000 aliens (an increase of 15,390 on the figure above given) were admitted annually during the same period—also assuming that the natural increase in the population remained stationary —the British population of Australia at the end of ten years would repre- sent 96 per cent. of the total—a dilu- tion of the present British prepon- derance to the extent of only 2 per cent. In all probability, however, the number of British assisted migrants will—when the new agreement about to be entered into by the British and Commonwealth Governments and the Governments of the six States is in operation—show an increase over the number who arrived during the period above stated. The number of un- assisted British migrants is unlikely to decrease. It is safe to assume that the gain by natural increase, which is generally cumulative, will also be greater in the future. From present indications in view of the agree- ments entered into between the Com- monwealth and certain foreign governments to restrict the issue of passports or the granting of visas, it is likely to be some years before the number of foreign arrivals reach 20,000 per annum. The Italian Government has agreed to limit the granting of passports to persons who have been nominated by persons in Australia and who are in possession of £40 each. In the case of Greeks, Jugo-Slavs and Albanians, the British authorities, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, are limiting the granting of visas to passports to 100 per month in each case, and visas will not be granted to persons unless they are individu- ally in possession of £40. The Foreign Element. The census of April 1921 showed that the number of persons in Aus- tralia not born here, or in the British Isles or New Zealand, was 139,073 or slightly over 21 per cent. The number owing allegiance to foreign governments was 48,529, or .08 per cent. During the past few years, and particularly since July, 1924 (when the latest Immigration Restriction Act passed by the United States Con- gress came into operation) there has been a quicker movement of people from southern Europe to Australia. During the 31 years ended 30th September, 1924, the excess of ar- rivals over departures of foreign-born immigrants numbered 16,148 — a figure representing about 11.6 per cent. of the total foreign-born per- sons who were in Australia when the 1921 census was taken.

The action of the United States of America in adopting the quota sys- tem to restrict the flow of immigra- tion to that country, has had the effect of diverting immigrants from certain European countries to Aus- tralia. The United States law came the light of this fact, the following table, which is self-explanatory, is in- teresting:— Excess of arrivals over departures of persons of various European nationalities, 1st July, 1924, to 30th November, 1924 (5 months):—Finns: July, 74; Aug., 68; Sept., 43; Oct., 39; Nov., 6; total, 230. Greeks: July, 137; Aug., 257; Sept., 143; Oct., 182; Nov., 205; total, 924. Italians: July, 194; Aug., 259; Sept., 599; Oct., 418; Nov., 462; total, 1932. Jugo-Slavs, July, 46; Aug., 122; Sept., 205; Oct., 81; Nov., 239; total, 693. Maltese: July, 5; Aug., 83; Sept., 16; Oct., 71; Nov., 46; total, 221. Serbs.: July, n?i; Aug., 27; Sept., 3; Oct., 143; Nov., 34; total, 107. Albanians (not sep- arately recorded): Oct., 28; Nov., 78; total, 106. The average number arrivals from the countries mentioned during the five months' period indicated was, therefore, about 842—at the rate of 10,104 per annum. It has been pointed out that during the 33 years ended September, 1924, the excess of arrivals over departures of foreign persons was 16,148—at the rate of 4,614 per annum. The above table shows they are arriving at the rate of over 10,000 per annum—a large percentage increase, but not a very large actual increase. The following table shows the posi- tion in regard to the movement of Italian and Greek people to Aus- tralia:— Italians:—No. at Census 1591, 3890; Census, 1901: 567S; Census, 1911: 6718; Census, 1921: 8135. Greeks:-No. at Census, 1891: 482; Census 1901, 878; Census, 1911, 1798; Census, 1921, 3654. The migration of Italians and Greeks during the 5 months ended November last, has been greater than at any period during the past 40 years. If the rate of their incoming during the five months mentioned is maintained, 6584 will have arrived here during the year ending April next. The number of Italian and Greek migrants to Australia averaged 150 per annum during the 30 years prior to 1901. The rate at which migrants from these two countries are now arriving, viz., 6854 per annum, repre- sents only .083 of the natural in- crease in our population. According to the 1921 census the dlstribution of Italians and Greeks in Autsralia was as follows: Italians:—Metropolitan, 34.5; Pro- vincial, 10.8; Rural, 46.1; Migratory, 8.6. Greeks:—Metropolitan, 57.3; Pro- vincial, 2.7; Rural, 15.7; Migratory, 2.3. The majority of the people of both these nationalities were married, and could read and write the English language. United States Act. In May, 1921, the first Immigration Restriction Act was passed by the United States Congress. This Act introduced the "quota" system. The quota was limited to 3 per cent, of the number of nationals of each country who were domiciled in the U.S. according to the census of 1910. This Act operated for a year, and was replaced by the Act which came into force on the 1st July, 1924. This later Act reduced the quota from 3 per cent. to 2 per cent. of the num- ber of nationals domiciled in the United States as determined by the census of 1890. The reason for this is significant. The great stream of so-called Nordic immigration flowed to the United States before 1890—the "new" or southern European immigration came later. The figures in the following table are striking, and show the great re- ductions effected by the new Act in the quotas of such countries as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Italy, Po- land, Greece, Russie, Roumania, and Yugoslavia. . . . . . . . . .Quota on . .Quota on Country . . .3% basis . 2% basis .

The Congress Committee, in re- porting on this matter, said:—"The most troublesome administrative dif- ficulty encountered since the enact- ment of the 3 per cent. law, has been the enforcement of the numerical limitation. The actual, physical counting of human beings arriving by ship and train has been a task of magnitude. Mistakes have been made. Steamships have raced to port to land passengers within time limits. De- lays and disappointments have brought hardship. Distressing ap- peals for relief in individual cases have assailed the officers charged with enforcement of the law. Senators and representatives have been sought to aid either in nullify ing the statute or in mitigating its force. . All these troublesome obstacles are confidently expected to be eliminated in the event of the enactment of the new Bill. The Bill contains provision for enforcement of the numerical limitation not by counting immi- grants upon their arrival, but by counting "immigration certificates" issuable at American consulates over seas. The plan, briefly, is to issue for each nationality a number of immi- gration certificates to be placed in the hands of intending immigrants as they obtain American visas upon their passports. Each certificate has a validlity of two months to the time .f taking ship. Therefore, the in- tending immigrant, having obtained his passport, his immnigration certi- ficate, and his visa, is at liberty to proceed to the United States in the full knowledge that he will not be de- barred solely by a quota limitation. He must, however, undergo further examination at the port of entry, and be able to pass munder the provisions of the 1917 Act. It is expected that the number of those who cannot pass will be greatly reduced by reason of the preliminary investigation. There should be no arrival of "excess quota" cases, and there need be no racing of steamships. If this Bill re- duces to the minimum the number of arriving aliens that must be turned back, it will have accomplished one of its important purposes. It seems to be impracticable for Australia, which has no foreign ser- vice, to enforce a quota law. Another significant passage in the report of the United States Congres- sional Committee is the following:— "Decision by the committee to limit admissions of "quota immigrants" to 2 per cent., based on census figures of 1890, instead of 3 per cent., based on the census of 1910, was reached after long and careful consideration of every element of the entire immi- gration problem. An impelling rea- son for the change is that it is de- sired to slow down the streams of the types of immigrants which are not easily assimilated. Naturalisation does not necessarily mean assimila- tion. The naturalisation process can- not work well with the continued arrival in large numbers of the so- called new immigration. The new type crowds in the larger cities. It is exploited. It gains but a slight knowledge of America and American institutions. It has grown to be a great undigested mass of alien thought, alien sympathy, and alien purpose. It is a menace to the social, polictical and economic life of the country. It creates alarm and ap- prehension. It breeds racial hatreds which should not exist in the United States, and which need not exist when the balance shall have been re- stored."
