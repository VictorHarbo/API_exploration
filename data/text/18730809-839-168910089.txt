LOCAL AND GENERAL NEWS. Wo aro strongly of opinion that Bacholdor's Paii tascope has not been favoured with eithor tho patronage or appreciation it, deserves. The entertainment being a high-class one, and afford ing a great doal of instruction as well as amuse ment, wo havo boon astonished at tho lifeless sluggish manner in which the audience have re ceived it Tho splendid pictures for tho most pait pass by without any demonstration of approval, though wo have not met -a single per son capable of judging w ho has not given them his unqnahhod .ippiobation Why is this thus? Tho 'high kick,' and similar highly-intellec; tnal feats havo been lonrllv iinnlfiiirifirl and en cored. Havo -\vo no souls for real, art— some- thmg that appeals to our-, perception of the : beautiful and tho skill which holds the mirror ao faithfully up to natiiio 1 Tho GympiS playgoers must loinemboi that they have a- character for just appiecnitton of good entertainments to . leise NVo tiust that w e shall notice a full house and a decent amount of spirit in:the audience) ? to-night — tho last night Tho Kennedy Famity, having t limited their stay heio to thiee nights, have scarcely treated Gympio fanly, if they would give its a week or twe?, 111 lino woather, we are positivo that they ;would have causo to congratulate themselves upon then ?v lsit How evoi, it is certain that they give their last ontortainment to-night, and we hope tho Apollonian Hall will bo crammed, for they lichly dcseivo this substantial' expression of public favour. Wo do not propose, in noticing this enteitamment, to doal with the particulars of tho piogrummo Wo can hardly make, our gonoial tonns of appi obation too laudatory, how ox 01 Mi Kennedy lea\os tho formal groove usually adhorod to by performers of tho same class, and makos tlio entertainment almost as much a ' family' afi'air as regards the audienoe as it is in connection witli Ins own company. Ho makes the audience quite at home, takes thorn, as it wore, into his confidence, and with great tact, exuberant humour, and irresistible geniality, poui trays, by diamutic sketches, anecdotes, and songs, Scottish life and character in its humbler and . bost- undorstood phases. That the pioturos drawn by Mr. Kennedy are faithful to naturo we think no Scotchman would fool inclined to deny; all who havo seen and hoard the ' Songs of Scot land' agroo in this. Mr. Kennedy is a host in himself , lie is also ably supported, and tho enter tainmont is divoisihed, by his clover sons ana . daughtois Tlio Scottish songs, &c.;, aro all capital and, with tho rest of tho performances must pio\o highly acceptable to appreciative , people of any nationality A butter ontortain niont has not yot boon presontod here ; .thelarge mivjonty havo boon infinitely bbiow it in foiling wenth and complotoiM$s. .
