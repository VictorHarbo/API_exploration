I have maoe an inspoctiim of the mining property known as Cummlng and Jones's property, situated at BpringGuliy. Alexandra. Tho gold hearing formation is a dlorite dyke 20 feet wide traversing tho cloy slate rock that forms the bare rock nf the district. The dyko formation has been opened by pit ntul trcnchcn 10 to 12 feet deep, and shows thu dyko in nlucrs over 20 feet wide, and contains fas (s usual) a number nf quartz volns of various sizes and all containing more or loss gold, soma of thorn being very rich (thu returns fron tho stone crushed are given in another report). Also a great deal of tho decomposed diorite that forms the dike contains lino gold, and It will most likely be found that for some 20 or 30 ftiob below tho BUri&ce; it will n»y to crush tlio whole body of the dyke, as ft will run ouicklv and cheaply through tho mill. Iu depth, where the dyke material will bo harder, it will bo fuuud better to select thn crushing stuff. The prospect ing done shown that tho dyke is continuous through tho wholo length of the property. Tho situation of the property is good for economic mimug, us it fan bo worked by tunnels, and a srlf-artine Incline tram line will run the stuff to tlm fiat below, nnd a level tram litis convey it to the milt site. Timber for mining and firewood is ptritirm in the locality, uml will bo supplied at a cheap rate. In tho Alexandra und Wood's I'oiot districts these dyke formations have been exceedingly rich and siren great profits to the shareholders, and 1 have great con- lidunmi tfaot this property will giro excollent returns mauaer equipped and worked in a systematic REPORT by Mr. A. F. BRADSIJAW. The find, which consists of a wide diorite dyke, of soft aud easily worked character, is situated on the nurihoru faco of a stcco hill, which rises nearly 300 ft. above the level of the country at its foot, towards which the dike underlies. Near the crown of the hill a wet) dtflnrd quartz reef 2 ft. 6 in. thick Intersect tho dyko, nud within tho walls of tho dyko carries gold, though llttlo is visible, but from a niece about 3 In. by 1 in. by 1 in. crushed In a mortar I obtained the prospect of gold here with shown. A stone broken from tho outcrop soiuo 50 ft. away below thu dyke gave a little fine gold, where a prospect wan also gat in the loam beside it. The dyke itsoif is Intersected by lenders running north and south across it, and carrying very rich gold in most instances, and varying from ttie thickness of a thread to 6 In- , going down almost vertically, the underlay being to the cast as far as the workings admit ot inspection. In many of tho leaders gold is visible to thu naked eye, but whero it is not bo crushing revonls its presence in very considerable quantities. IdolUcd threo small portions of pure dyke, hi each instnncu getting gold in payable quantities, I tried lenders from each place opened, by crushing sbonu from thum in a mortar, und in Home instances got very rich prospects and in every case highly payable results. From nil I can see the leaders Increase in quantity and thickness as the dyku is sunk on. REPORT by Mr. G. H. UARTRICK, Mining Engineer. Lode.— The lode, a dinrito dyke, runs nearly east ami west, and is approximately parallel with the axis of thu range, the underlay being to the north, as far as can be seen, about 70 degrees. Tho uyke Is traversed by o great nuinhcrof quartz veins, varying from mere threads to, in otm instance, 2 feet in thickness. The length exposed on the surface Is fully ISO yards, and about 300 yards to the cast of this another 40 yards of tho same dyko in exposed. The full width of the dyke has not been opened, but it Is exposed in (daces for over 12 feet in width. I think ft quite safo to tako tho width at 15 feer, and I should not be surprised if It. proved to overage fully 20 feet, Tlio work done on the mine is a aeries of open cuUincs from say 8 to 12 feet tn depth. ( Gold. — During my vlsltto the mine I tried various pros pects from different parts of the lode, and in every instance obtained gold in such quantities as to provo the Jod« to bo highly auriferous, i also brought five Ramifies to Melbourne, which were treated by Mr. A. E. Glover, assaycr, of Little Collins-street, by simply pounding the stone with a pestle and mortar, and waiblug in n dhh. Particulars are as under:— gr. oz. dwt. pr. No. 1. 74 lb. neb ..

This sample showed gold freely. No. 4 wits oiean diorite, and showed no quartz. No. 5 was front the west ond of lease, and was clean diorite, no quartz visible. In addition 7 tons 6 owt. 3 qr. were taken to the Balla rat School of Mines, ana gave an average of 2uz. 14 <Uvc. 7 gr. per ton. Particulars aro given In Professor A. Mica Hmith's report hereto attached of this lot: 1 tun 4 cwt. contained specimens nicked out, ami gold obtained from prospects washed w hile breaking out thu stnne. Nu 3 was u sample of clean diorite, und No. 3 was rubble sur face clay and diorite, from whlchjiuoat oi the gold lu No. 1 was pinked. Tho gold is of excellent quality, being worth fully £4 3s. per oz. Tho position of the lode enables ft to he worked by tun nels to a depth of say 3G0 fett from the outcrop, ami the first tunucl to give say 100 feet of barks will nut be more limn 250 feet in length. There is an excellent site for the erection of a battery and dam about u third of a mile from tho mine, and a tramway for the cunveyance of crush dirt can If laid without difficulty. There aro nniplo supplies of bo'h iniulug timber nnd firewood available within reasonable distance, ami with these advantages 1 estimate the cos', of working at not more than 3 dwt. per ton. P.B.— Since writing the abivu u tunnel alioiit 4C0 yards west of your boundary has bceii driven, and has struck tho lode at 70 feet below the outcrop. The excellent pros- Ceets obtained in thU tunnel prove thu !o<io to hu gifid earing in depth as the other work above rcferruJ to h&j; . proved it In length, and a test of 6 lb. weight crushed and wualicd by Mr. Glover gavo 2 dwt. of gold, or at the rate of 44 oz. 16 dwt. per ton.
