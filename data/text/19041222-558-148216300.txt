AVOIDING SERVICE AT THE FRONT. RUSSIAN RESERVISTS WHO DESERTED. STRANDED IN COPENHAGEN. J1AXY VICmnSED BY RUSSIAN SHIPPING AGENTS. LONDON, December 20th. Thousands of Russian army reservists who have deserted to avoid service in tlie Far East are stranded at Copen hagen, many of them having been vic timised by Russian shipping agents, who, while purporting to give them, oversea passages, supplied them with tickets good only as far as Copenhagen. The Danish shipping agents, with a view of rc-lieving the distress, are giving the poorest free passages to America. Owing, however, to the prevalence of trachoma among the deserters, it is re cognised that some of them would not be admitted under the immigration restric tion laws of the United States, and those suffering from the complaint- referred to are therefore proceeding to London. [Trachoma is a disease of the eye, characterised by hard pustules orgranular excrescences on the inner surface of the eyelids, with inflammation of the mem brane.]
