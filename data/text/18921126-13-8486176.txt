MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL The Argus Office, Friday Evening. Notwithstanding the hardening of the open market discount rate in London, the quota tion now being 23. per cent., the Bank of England return for the week shows increased strength, coin and bullion being greater by over £250,000, and the reserve by over £000,000. With one or two unimportant exceptions, all colonial Government stocks show improvement, mostly to the extent of i, and business would appear to be active. A noticeable rise has taken place in London in the principal South American stocks, for which several reasons are assignable. In the first place, the London Stock Exchange has shown greater vitality since the return of its members from their autumnal holidays, and the recovery has benefited, nearly every group of stocks. Then, as we have repeatedly urged, industrial development procceds despite financial disturbances, and gradually effaces their effects, so far at least as the corporate life of the country is concerned. Argentina had to face great financial disasters, and even to suspend payment of its interest (which it has. undertaken to capitalise for three years).- But the immigrants have not ceased to break up new ground, and to extend cultivation, with the result that Argentine trade is improving, and the premium on gold is declining. Other causes of the favourable turn are the gradual liquidation of the Baring Estate, and the more peaceful outlook throughout South America. The Stalislol October 15 states the amount of the recent advance in four groups at £13,500,000, as follows: Argentine securities, £7,550,000 : Brazilian, £4,700,000 ; Chilian, £500,000 ; and Peruvian, £750,000. In view of the improvement in South American affairs, the almost certaihmodiiicatibnofthc United States tariff, the better . industrial results shown by Canada, the rapid growth of wealth at the Cape, and the unmistakable signs of in creased production in the Australasian colonies, it would certainly appear as if the world, or, at least, that portion of it in timately connected with Great Britain, is about to enter into another era of steady prosperity. The letter written by Mr. Pinschoff upon the subject of the Credit Foncier of France is, of Interest as supplying reasons in detail for the tendency to a lessening of the earning power of the institution. But the report of the Economist Francais upon the views held in Paris with regard to the future is not affected by these explanations. And if the profit margin is affected in the case of the loans to municipalities, owing to the necessity which has arisen of accepting a lower rate of interest, it may also be affected in the case of loans on mortgage by the competition of other institutions of a quasi state character. That is, it may become necessary to reduce the statutory rate charged to mortgagors. But it may be conceded that if the average lending rate should fall, the Credit Foncier may find that it can also borrow on better terms than heretofore, and thus keep its profit margin unimpaired. To an institution which was about £100,000,000 due to it by mortgagors and municipalities, even a slight decline in the profit, margin must be of moment. We have called attention to the subject because while the study of financial methods deserves to be promoted in every possible way, the broad movements which are outside the mechanism of business have to be watched. In other words, while the most perfect financial methods should unquestionably be adopted, it is necessary to recognise that they are means to an end and not the end itself. Values of Gippsland freehold properties were gauged to-day by Messrs. Pearson, Rowe, Smith, and Co.'s auction sale, a report of which appears below. Three properties were sold, the Prospect Homestead (1,000 acres) realising £9 per acre ; the Erinvale and Kiddler's flat property (1,174 acres), £5 '2s. (6d. and a property at Upper Maffra (141 acres), £3 lbs. The total of the three sales is £2,1,625, more or less. It may be inferred that freehold property in the country is sale able at values which will give purchasers a fair return upon their investment. Offers per cable have been received in town of 329. 11d. per 480 lb. c.f.i. for new Victorian wheat, January shipment. The Melbourne f.o.b. equivalent (freight being taken at 25s. per ton) is 3s. 3d. per bushel. The London ex warehouse market in colonial wheat and flour has fallen seriously during the last week, South Australian and Victorian wheat having each declined by Is. per quarter, New Zealand wheat by 1s. 6d. per quarter, and Australian flour by 10s. per 2000). The quotations for colonial wheats are the lowest on record. locally, some business has been done at 3s. 9d., but there are free sellers at this price, and some also at 3s. Cold.

For Sydney and Newcastle, 402 sacks wheat, 550 sacks Hour, and 30 sacks oats for Queensland, 419 sacks wheat. The import markets have been moderately active, but upon the whole there is less vitality than is customary at this season of the year. The Christmas demand has not yet commenced, being later than usual. Country traders are working upon narrow stocks, owing partly to the restriction of banking accommodation of late. But if the good harvest prospects be realised, country trade cannot fail to be largely benefited in the new year. The market In sugar is firm in tone, but no transactions of importance are reported. On Tuesday next Greig and Murray Limited will offeracntalogucof 2,500 pnckagcsQucens land.

" A' very ' limited amount of business has been carried through, both privately and at auction. Prices generally show no improvement on our last quotations, and Norwegian and Scotch flooring, lining, and weatherboards are lower. - The deliveries from the store yards are so light as to make scarcely any impression on our heavy stocks of all kinds of timber in fact, the latter are steadily increasing. It is now a matter of certainty that no improvement in the demand will occur during the remainder of the present year,' but it is hoped that the first quarter of 1891 will show an improvement in the up- country trade. As regards the local demand, it is the expected that any improvement of importance will take place for much longer period, and the outlook for all parties engaged in the timber trade is a serious one. ~.Tbc...»¿%t'.iva1..resources.of this colony are., .Uo>\> ever, being gradually developed, and it is from this source only that we must look for prosperity in the future. In order to indicate the extent of the decline in the importation of timber, we take the following figures from Messrs.
