The many deplorable accidents, followed by loss of life, which have resulted from the explosion of so-called par allia oil, burnt in the household lamp or stored in the tradesman's warehouse, have indicated that a dangerous and explosive fluid has found it way into trade as an adulteration of a really useful and innocuous oil. The result of the Lancet Analytical Sanitary Commission reveals a most startling and perilous state of things. It discloses a danger little less than appalling and points to a fraud which has crept into trade, and of which the perils are greater than the most imaginative alarmist could have conjured up. That inquiry has shown that crude and impor * leotly-relincd rock oil is being imported into this country in immense quantities, and is being sold as a cheap kind of paraffin, to be burned in ordinary lamps, although it is in many respects a considerably more dangerous material than gunpowder itself. Therefore many hundred those Band gallons of this oil stored in the wharfs, of which the point of ignition ranges below 117der. Fair., and as low as 57deg. Fahr. If by any chance such as is highly possible, nay, mill t seem in the end inevitable-this most of fluids combustible at this exceedingly low temperature, should be ignited, the consequences might be productive of a calamity of which we cannot foreshadow the limits. The fiery and blazing? hydro-carbon stored near the crowded docks and wharfs of the Thames is capable of floating along with the tide, and it would be impossible to extinguish it, The destruction which was witnessed at Tooley-street gives but a feeble notion, of what might thus occur. There are no pro- s cautions of storing which seem to us equal to meet the dangers of the case. The importation of unrelated petroleum should be absolutely forbidden. There is nothing to prevent it being refined, and it is then robbed of its dangerous (harac ern. Lancet. J
