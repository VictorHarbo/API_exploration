The Sr. Duxstan.— This vessel sailed down the river as far as Pelican Point on Tuesday after noon. The Murray.— This steamer will sail this morn ing for Port Elliot, touching at (Jlenelg Jetty and all the intermediate ports. Although small, she will, no doubt, be found suitable for the purpose, it is intended to make the trip fortnightly. The Claramoxt is discharging her cargo at Prince's Wharf, and has already landed about tiOO tons in excellent condition, and from the appear ance of the vessel's hold it is expected the remain ing i-ortion of her cargo will be turned put in a similar manner. It is much to the credit of the crew of the vessel that without exception they have sustained their character a* British seamen, and worked away without any of the most un pleasant Police Court scenes so prevalent amongst liome arrivals. This may in some measure lie accounted for by the reputation of the master (Captain Mclntosh). He lias already visited Port Adelaide on prior occasions, in charge of the Oriental and Mary Harrison, and in each case he was exempt from those annoyances so common to shipmasters. In the Oriental he brought 240 Government immigrants, and on the Health Officer examining the people there was not a murmur of complaint. In the Mary Harrison he brought a full complement of passengers, who paiii him a high tribute for his uniform kindness and attention throughout the voyage. The Clara jnont is a remarkably tine vessel and eminently adapted for the transport of passengers, having spacious 'tween decks and good saloon accommo dation. She is not yet chartered, but it is hoped a. vessel so well suited to the trade will be induced to ioad for England, where she will, under com mand of her present master, find favourable recommendation for a re- engagement as an emi grant vessel. The JLunncH occupies a Iterth at Prince's 'Wharf, and has discharged about SOO tons of her outward cargo. She has still 150 tons on board, and as she is laid on for London portion of her homeward freight is laden, in the shape of alxnit 501) bales wool and over 100 tons copper ore. This will not be finally stowed until she has a clcan swept holt], when the stowage of the return cargo will he commenced with expedition, as she is intended to l« dispatched about the first week in March. Her passenger accommodation has lieen taken, with the exception of three cabin Iwrths, which are still vacant. The baniue Cokxelia, from Port Louis, has turned out her cargo in good condition. Six thousand tons of sugar arc lauded, and she has now about l.CUU on board. The Phillis completed her loading for New Zealand yesterday, having taken on ltoard 10,000 bushels wheat, 1-esides a small quantity of bran. She is Iwund for Wellington, New Zealand, from which port she is intended to proceed to Newcastle for a return cargo of amis. The French baniue Amanda, from Mauritius, lias discharged but portion of her sugar lading here. This consuls of (i,HH) hags, the space vacated by which has been filled un by cereals, with which she is expected to sail on Friday for Sydney, where the remainder of the original cargo will probably find a market. She is expected to proceed to New castle to load a return freight of coals. The Li'BRA has sent down her yards from for wards, and now presents the rig of a fore-and-after, which is calculated to lw of more service to her in her trip* than the top and topgallant sails aloft. Last time she was slipped at the Port her bottom was payed over with a patent composition, differ \- iug essentially from that in general use for iron vessels. In appearance it hears a close resem blance to copper sheathing, but a sufficient time lias not yet elapsed to teat its ellicaey. The American ship Alice Thoundike is loading for New Zealand, and will sail as soon as there is water over the bars. She has a full cargo of cereal produce, and several passengers, with six horses on deck. The Ashburtos. from London, is discharging cargo, and has hi-en dismantled preparatory to overhaul on account of grounding on the river bank. The City of Manchester has discharged, and is preparing for a vovuae to New Zealand, where she will discharge her cargo laden here and take in timl-er for Calcutta. In order to facilitate this she has had timl)er ports cut in her bows during her stav here. She is expected to sail about the 20th. The City of Bristol i* discharging cargo at LevTs Wharf, and is intended to proceed from this to Calcutta with horses. She has ample accommodation for about 50, which number is expected to be her complement. VESSELS IN HARBOUR. ABBEY, brigantine (British), !W tons, G.
