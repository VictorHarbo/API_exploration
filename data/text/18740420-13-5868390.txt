INTRODUCTION. Tho elections ire not yet over, and no a£efinito political intelligence l8 as ye*"Tforthcoming Tho reform of the LegSlatu o Council-tho niture of winch .wo indicated in our last summary is the only issue placed beforo the electors by the Ministry, and as a rule tho electors seom to caio very littlo about it, tho greatest apathy being et hibited As far as can bo ascertained, it appears to havo excrcisod no influonco upon the elections which havo already tiken placo, tho decisions of the con- stituencies haYing beon appaiontly sololy influenced by local and personal con- siderations iho two first batches of elec- tions havo been concluded Forty thiee members have boen returned, and in somo instances tho changes which havo taken placo have íesulted in an improvement of tho jietsonncl of tho now houso Tho poll- ing for tho thud series of cloetions takes placo on Wednesday noxt, whon 35 moro members havo to bo elected Amongst this batch aie comprised the most im- portant constituencies ui the colony, m cludnig all tho metropolitan and sub urban ones, and thoso of the two pnnci pal gold fields-Ballarat and Sandhurst Thero ia rather moro interest taken in theso elections than m thoso YYhich havo preceded them, but tho interest turns more upon tho question of free trade or protection than opon that of the leform of the Constitution It is somewhat singular that all those members and candidates-chiof among whom is Mr Higinbotham-who tho- roughly support tho Government pro- position of reform, do so upon the ground that it will lessen the influonco of the Council as a lcpresentative body, and so prepare the Yvay for its abolition The samo yioyv is taken by tho opponents of tho rneasuro, and con- stitutes tho chief reason for thoir opposi- tion, but tho Chief Secretary onteitauis entirely diflerent opinions Ho ropu diätes tho sentiments expressed by Mr Higinbotham, and declaros that ho is anxious to preserve tho mtegnty of the second Chamber. Under such circum- stances, it is almost superfluous to say that the course the Govornmont has adopted is beset Yvith difficulties, and YvhatcY er may bo the result of the elec tions Yvluch aio to tako place on Wodnes day noxt, it ib already oy idont that upon the question of Constitutional roform, as submitted to the country, tho Ministry, if not in an actual muiouty, yviII certainly possess no sufliciont majonty to enable them to bring forward thoir proposition m a legislative form, w ith the slightest prospect of success Iho revenue returns of the colony of Victona continue to bo of a satisfactory charactei Those foi the qiratcr and year ending tho dist of Match 1 ist have been recontly published Tho levenuo for the twelvemonth ending on tho above date was £4,021,155 7e , exclusivo of a recoup from the Public Woiks loan of £41,66G , and that for the quartor termi- nating at the same time v\as £1,097,251 10s 3d , showing an mci ease on tho year, as compared with tho preceding one, of £217,472 2s 4d , and on tho quartor, as compared Yvith tho coi responding ono of 1873, an increaso of £119,131 0s 8d Irrespective of recoups, e.c , the Trea surei in July last estimated the net actual revonuo for tho ycai at £3,883,050 For three fourths of that period ho has received £3,080,915, so that if tho mcorao for tho coming quarlei is as good as that of its predecossoi-and in all piobabibty it yviU be OYon better- the total revenue for the financial year ond wg on tho 30th of Juno noxt will be £1,115,920, oi an incioaso on tho Trea- surer's estimate of £232,270 SOCI VL The Easter holidays passed off very plea santi), the weathei, winch, had previously been unusually inclement, having cleared up h) Good 1 ndoy and hecome exceedingly fino On Easter Monday tho places of public resort were crow dod with pleasure seekers, and the amusements visually indulged m on such occasions wero exceedingly well patronisod. The only matter causing disappointment waa the absence of the customary volunteer dis- play, which had to be given up in conse- quence of tho unfavourable effect produced cn the camping ground by the previous wet weather A definite proposal has been submitted to the Governments of the Australian colonies for the reduction of tho telegraphic charges for messages by cable from London to Aus traha An offer has been submitted by Colonel Glover, as tho representative of the telegraph company, vi/ , that for a subsidy of ¿20 000 per annum, to bo reduced £100 for every 100 messagesovcr 30,000 a year, a mini- mum rato between London and Port Darwin should bo fixed at £3 Ga for 10 words and Cs fid. for every additional word, and bo tween India and Port Darwin at 38s for 10 words and 3s lOd for every additional word, with corresponding reductions to other countries, was considered and discussed The offer was sent in to tho South Australian Government, and Mr Todd, the superintendent of telegraphs in thit colony, is now m Melbourne for tuo purpose of lay mg the matter before tho Government of Victoria Tho contribution of Victoria to the subsidy, estimated according to tho pro portion of messages Bent, would be £13,200, or more than half tho entiro amount The question is now under consideration by this Government. Eoth li M S Challenger and tho German war frigate Arcona loft the port on the 1st April Tho Challenger went to Sydney, and from thenco she will proceed to Now Zealand, betvvoen which colony and Sydney ahe will take soundings for a submarino cable The Arcona also went to Sydney, en route for Fiji, Samoa, and Japan. It has been for somo time known to bo only a question of months when Mr Juatico Vi llliams would retire from tho Bench, and the learned judge has now lixed the dato at which he desires to bo relieved from his func tiona lim Ilonour sent m his resignation with a request that it might take oflect from the loth of April, but for the convenionco of the public service, it is not to talco effect till the 30th Judge Williams receivecl his appointment on tho 22nd ot July, 1852, so that ho has served 22 years Tho annual commencement and ceremony of conferring degrees of tho University of Melbourno took place on Saturday, 11th mst, m the quadrangle of tho medical school There was a very large attendance of visitors, and the nocesstty for a larger hall in vv Inch to hold such ceremonies was very urgently shown rita Lxcellency tho Go lernor, Sir Georgo I Bowen, visitor of tho University, was present, and took his au cunden degree as Mast« of Arts of tho University of Otford Amongst tlioso who also took the degree of M A. ad etiiKit-^tvero Mr C li Pearson lecturer on lm,ic.y to the University, lato Fellow of Uriel, s,,.nd Professor Strong, both being graduates of the University of Oxford At tho conclusion of tho ceromony of conferring tho degrees His Excellency tho Governor addressed tho audience, and took tho opportunity of calling tho attention of tho governing body of tho Um \orsity to the system existing in England, under winch for several years past local examinations havo boon hold in all tho chiof centres of population throughout longland, of tho principal collegiate institutions and grammar blIiooIs, by examiners appointed «y the Universities of Ojefoid and Cambridge i his system hud been found of tho highest practical value in Lnglund, and he recom. jiicritled its adoption here Ho was aware that limtli was dono already in tina direction by means of tho matriculation examinations, but still, "in the opinion of many who have given much thought to this question, _ome thing more was needed to removo altogether the reproach of isolation which had been sometimes levelled against this as against other universities-to link our University with the leading schools in our principal towns, and thus to give a powerful stimulus to the higher education throughout Victoria " The chancellor of the University, Sir Red- mond Barry, informed His Excellency that the subject had already engaged the atten- tion of the council, but he was of opinion that it might be postponed for a time The results of the Matriculation and Civil Service Examination for the Tebruary term 1874 have been mado known. Of the 212 candidates examined, not one was found to have passed " with credit," which means to have passed well m at fewest, foursubjects Of the 10 lady candidatos, two passed both examinations In order to pass the matricu tion examinations, it is necessary to pass m any six of the following nine sub- jects -Greek, Latin, English, Trench, euchd, algebra, arithmetic, geography, history ; and 48 succeeded in passing m six or moro of these subjects Tor the civil service examination only four subjects are required, but two of the four must bo Lnghsh and arithmetic, and pre- cisely 100 succeeded in that examination It was recently staten by Dr Thudicum that it was impossible, according to scientific theory, to produce a natural wine containing more than 2G per cent of proof spirit It seems certain, however, that the Australian Yvines contain a per centage of alcohol ex- ceeding the limit fi\ed by Dr Thudicum Messrs E Greer and Co, of William street, Welbourne, have obtained a report from the chief inspector of distilleneB, on samples of Albury wines submitted, winch were certified as being freo from any intermixture of ad- ventitious spirits The samples which, the chief inspector states, were carefully distilled over by an officer of the department, and the results ascertained both by specific gravities and a well adjusted Sykes s hydrometer, yielded proof spirit as follows -Reisling, 24 fi, Muscat, 27 8 , Slnraz, 27 8 , Verdeüuo, 29 0, Slnraz, 29 0, Malbec, 28 G, Carbinet, 27 5 Mr John Goodman, official assignee, died on the ICth inst, of typhoid fever, after a comparatively short illness Mr. Goodman was one of the earliest settlers in Victoria, having arrived here in the early part of 1818, and becoming associated with Mr Chcnory, they were among the first persons who settled on the De\ ii a River, in the Goulburn district, as the firm of Goodman and Ghencry Sub sequently this partnership was dissolved, and in 185G Mr. Goodman joined Mr C \V. Umphelby in a Melbourne business, os a w ine merchant in Collins street Mr Goodman had always taken great interest in the political progress of the colony, and upon the proclamation of the now Constitution he obtained a seat in the Legislative Assembly for ' the Murray," having for his colleague Mr Travers Adamson, who is now a Crown prosecutor He held office as Commissioner of Customs in the Haines Ministry from the 25th Tebruary to tho 11th March, 1857, having joined the Government just prior to itB defeat ¡since his retirement from public life, Mr Goodman has held the appointment of one of the ofiicial assignees of the Insol vent Court, which he retained until the time of his death Mr Robert Hamilton, who had been for many years connected with the Victoria Racing Club as clerk of the course, died at his residence, -lemington, a few days ago, from au overdose of laudanum The deceased, who was C8 years of age was exceedingly popular in turf circles, and waa a genuine sportsman of the old school In our last summary we mentioned that a verdict had been obtained against The Australasian newspaper in the action of Malka v George, for libel An appli cation was made to the Tüll Court for a new trial, which was granted on the ground that the verdict was against evidence. Costs to be coBts in tho cause lhe police authorities have for some time past been acquainted with the whereabouts of OI erroll, the defaulting Lands Office official, but tor obvious reasons it wa3 neces sary that secresy should bo observed respect- ing the measures taken to socuro his appre- hension It waB known that OTorrall, on absconding from this colony, proceeded to New Zealand, and his further movements Yvere afterwards traced ao far as to lead to tho discovery that he had gone to New Caledonia, the y easel by which ho left and the day of his departure being ascertained. Some time however, had previously been lost on a false Bcent, a detective having been dispatched to Fiji As soon, however, as more certain information had been ob- tained, steps w ero taken to procure O Farrall'a arrest by the Trench authorities at New Caledonia, m order that a demand for hiB extradition might be mado under tho extradition treaty between the United King- dom and Trance A detective has been de- spatched to New Caledonia armed with tho necessary documents, and authorised to demand hiB extradition. It is behoved that 01 errall is concealed by some of his friends there, and information has not yet been received of his arrest The Trench authori- ties hav. c exhibited every desire to assist m the capture of the criminal and it is consi- dered that he cannot long succeed m evading I HiPRPiirrh George Maurice Drummond the late ma nager of tho Richmond branch of the Provincial and Suburban Bank, who was recently arrested in New Zealand, to which colony he had abscondod with over £1000 belonging to the bank, has beon broufcht to trial Tho prisoner, who pleaded guilty to the chargo preferred against him, that of larceny, appears to naso oxer cised a considerable amount of ingenuity in his transactions The Provincial ana Suburban Bank had an account with the Oriental Bank, Melbourne, which could bo drawn upon by the joint signati re of Drum mond üb manager and Mr Hiddle, ac countant of the bank On the 19th of Januarj, a cheque for £500 was drawn by these two and Drummond went away ni order to get tho money for it When ho ro tunied, he told Hiddle that tho Onental Bank would not cash it, and saying that it was of no moro use, tore up a piece of paper which looked like the cheque Riddle acquiesced m the destruction of tho chèque and cancelled the "block ' m his possession On lnday, January 23, four days later, Drummond took £250 away from tho bank in order to lodge it in the Oriental Bank When tho pay slip was returned, it purported to be initialed by Mr Inwood, receiving teller at the Oriental Bank, but it afterwards tran spired that the initials wero forged, and tho money was never lodged That samo day Drummond opened an account at the Eng lish, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank, m the name of G Morrison and Co , w horn ho described as sharebrokers of Col lins street At this time he lodge d £260 to their credit Tho day following- Saturday, January 24-ho cashed the £500 choquo, which was drawn on tho 19th, and alleged to havo been destroyed by him Tor this no re- ceived 25 £20 notes which ho at onco took to the English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank, waking a total of £700 to the credit of G Morrison and Co He then drew a cheque for £060 against this account and received it all m gold-half sovereigns That samo afternoon no loft Melbourne for Now Zealand by tho Claud Hamilton Tho prisoner was sentenced to five years im- prisonment, with hard labour Mr George Bntchart, whoso extraordinary attempt at imposition by moans of forged chequeB was reported last month, has been pronounced insano, and, on tho certiüoato of two medical men, removed by his fnonds to the private lunatic asylum at Cremorne An examination by accountants has shown that Mr Butchart s trust accounts aro strictly cor- rect, and that if his desire had beon to bocomo possessed of money, ho could havo easily had it without resorting to forgery It appears that on the 25th March, tho day on which ho attempted to pass tho forged choques he had cash to his credit in difforont banks amounting to £339, besides shares in tho Colonial Bank standing m his own name of tho valuo of some £1,200, do ben tures on tho Bank of Victoria of tho valuo of £3 500 and debonturos and scrip m the Melbourne Bank- ing Company of the value of £700 or £800 All these woro at his disposal, and could havo been withdrawn by him at any momonfc and contorted into cash, neither of the banks having any hen or chargo upon them what ever After his arrest, Butchart was libo rated on heavy bail, and when the case was tailed on at the City Police Court, some days ago, he did not appear, being confined m the asylum Tho fact was stated to the Bench, who, however, held that they had no alternative but to estreat the bail, wnich was accordingly done Suicides have been unusually numerous during tho month One of the most meian choly was that of Mr John H A Hopkins, who was found lying dead on the floor of one of the dormitories of the Model Lodging house, about half past2 o'clock one morning with his throat cut from ear to ear Mr Hopkins was a gentleman by birth and breeding and a scholar of no mean acquire- ments He was an accountant by profession and published some time ago a series of tables on the values of debentures, which Yvero very favourably noticed by tho Mel bourne press His efforts to obtain congenial employment proving unavailing, he was re ducd to the necessity of breaking stones for a livelihood. It is not surprising undor cir- cumstances bko these, that health and spirits gave way, and be was frequently noticed to be depressed and moody .niongst his effects ivere found tho rough draft of a letter to his brother, in which he spoke of his life as a burden and himself as bowed down beneath a load of mental and physical suil enng In the clothes of tho deceased were found a purse containing 16s lOd , and a number of letters addressed "J. H. A Hopkins, "c, Post office, Melbourne," and bearing the Kentish Town post mark. An inquest having been held on the body, the jury returned a verdict that tho deceased committed suicide while m a condition of insanity A cricket match of a novel description has been played at Sandhurst, Yvith the object of swelling the funds of the local chanties The players were ladies, who went into regular practice for the match, and a local journal said, m noticing their proceedings, " the pro- gress which they made was astonishing, for they picked up the points of the game with wonderful aptitude " A description of the match says of the lady cricketers, "At first it was expected that they should play m the Bloomer costume, as being less likely to interfere with their freedom of movement than any other, but the innovation Yvas con- sidered too startling for a British community, and the idea was given up m favour of an attire of the ordinary shaped dress, mado of calico, with a. coloured jacket to distin- guish the respective Bides. These dresses the ladies purpose handing over as gifts to the chanties Everything being m readi- ness, the ladies-the one sido wearing red Garibaldi jackets and sailors' hats, and the other bluo jackets and similar hats marched in pairs- red and blue being linked together-from the tent into the field headed by the respective captains-Mrs Rae for the Reds, and Miss B Rae for the Blues Their appearance was very pretty and pic turesque, and they were loudly applauded by the on lookers The respective captains having tossed for innings, it was decided that the Reds should go to the bat: and they secured a total of 62 runs beforo the last wicket fell After the iapse of half an hour the Reds took the field, and they put their opponents out for 83 runs One innings each only was played, and vic tory, therefore, rested with the Blues Mr Coffin acted as scorer When the ladies had assembled in the booth, Mr Abbott chair- man of the Hospital Committee thanked the ladies for the successful effort which they had made on behalf of the chanties Mrs Rae, on behalf of the ladies replied, stating that the ladies had thoroughly en jojed the game and had the utmost gratifi- cation in knowing that their efforts had been productive of a substantial addition to the funds of the chanties THE POLITICAL SITUATION. When the last moil loft, the single issuo of constitutional reform which the Government had determined to Bubmit to the country had been fully explained by the Chief Secretary, and the nominations for the first batch of elections had been made. Since that date the first and second batches of elections have taken place, and the third and final batch of candidates will be disposed of by the country next Wednesday. As the lost batch of representatives ia by far the largest of the three, and includes the loading mem- bers of tho Ministry, the present is tho most exciting period of tho election. Tho Govern- ment scheme of constitutional reform baa been vory severely handled in tho coursa of tho discussions it has given riso to. Ministers have entirely failed in their efforts to arouse the people to enthusiasm on behalf of their one proposition, whilo thero aro so many measures of practical utility urgently needed for the good of the country. Though thoy have repeatedly shifted their ground and endeavoured to fit their proposals to the suc- cessive criticisms made upon them, thoro seems to bo no probability of their meeting Parliament with a majority pledged to aup port their plan-copied from tho Norwegian system-to secure the harmonious working of the two branches o£ the Legislature. The most noticeable deliverance in favour of the Government proposition has been that of Mr. Geo. Higinuotham, whoso support, however, is of an embarrassing kind that Ministers would gladly bo without. Mr. Higinbotham clearly and explicitly raised tho standard of class warfare. He declared thero could be but two clossea of politicians, those who support and those who opposo the wealthy classos. His ambition is evi- dently to captain tho opposing squad- ron, and the duty of all who fight under or with him, and who alone aro to bo considered the friends of national progress, is " to prevent the deadly effect of tho in- jurious influence of wealth upon the destinies of mankind, to counteract and check the power of wealth, to expose its pretensions, to strip it by force of all special political power which it now claims and possesses, to endeavour by all legislativo means to break up into fragments its over accumulating masses, and to cast upon it that which it has never yet borne, its duo share of the burdens of the state," which "duesharo" the hon. gentleman afterwards explained to bo all but "a nominal share." Mr. Francis promptly repudiated tho support of his ancient ally, and denied that tho Govern- ment had any intention of wiping out the Upper House. A very damaging opponent has entered the lists against the Government in the person of Sir James M'Culloch, whoso return for Warrnambool is certain, and who will natu. rally bo looked to as leader of tho Assembly in the probable event of the defeat of the Francis Ministry. Sir James has unequivo- cally denounced tho proposal of the Govern- ment for the reform of the Legislativo Coun- cil, and haB distinctly stated that ho will bo no party to doing away with tho second chamber. Neither did Sir James nogloct to show in o. very conclusive way, that tho proposed reform of the Constitution would prove destructivo of tho independence and integrity of both Chambers. The Ministry have found anothor redoubt ablo opponent in Sir John O'shanassy, who has resigned his seat in the Legislativo Council to contest Kilmore, with a view of re-entering the moro activo political sphere open to membors of tho Assembly. Dr. Ilenrn and Mr. Sichel are Booking election as opponents of the Ministerial scheme. Mr, Wrixon and Mr. Macpherson, politicians of mark, havo boen returned in opposition to it, and tho Government havo not boen successful in securing for it the bona fide support of a Bingle leading poli- tician. At St. Kilda the Attorney-General, who it was supposod would leavo tho Minis- try to occupy tho vacancy on the Supremo Court boncli causod by tho retirement of Mr. JuBtico Williams, ia opposed by Mr. Hartley Williams, a son of tho retiring judge. Tho next Assembly promises to contain au un- usually largo proportion of mon of mark and likelihood, in addition to tho more promi nent members of tho presont Administra- tion. It is tolerably certain that the ques- tions which will be presented to it for dis- cussion will bo debated in such a manner as to shed upon them all tho light derivable from a number of educatod minds surveying them from widely divergont points of view. As Sir John O'shanassy said in his address to the electors of Kilmoro The interests 800,000 'colonists had created for themselves, tho circumstances in which they wero placed, tho form of govern- ment under which thoy lived, and their pros- pects in future, wero all centred at tho pro sent timo in the prospective legislation of tho now Parliament ; and thoro was nothing which gavo him greater pleasure than to have observed that during the rocontelectiona roost of tho acerbities which used to oxist in former times on questions of public im- portance seemed to have been ohltterated The úl-feehng between nval parties had dis- appeared, and there was a strong reactionary feeling permeating society that there should not be hasty legislation in regard to the futuro policy of the country. Ho noticed a degree of respect on the part of the electors to the candidates who carno forward, and it seemed to him that a change had taken place in the character of the candidates." These are highly gratifying features of the piesent contest, and they aro likely to stamp a favourable impress on our futuro legisla- tion. The tone and temper of the public nund are propitious to the moderate discus sion and dispassionate Bettloment of the questions which will engage the attention of the Assembly. These include two subjects of paramount importance-the constitutional question so unnecessarily raised by the Go- vernment and the revision of tho tanff. Both will undergo a thorough sifting in a Houso constituted as it is to bo hoped the popular branch of the Legislature will bo when the returns are completed next Wednesday ; and the absence of any popular excitoraent will necessanly facihtato tho arrival at a reason- able and equitable decision with respect to each.

LDUCATION. The following ad interim report on the working of the new Education Act has been forwarded by the secretary of the department to the MmiBter of Public Instruction - " I have the honour to furnish, accordine to your instructions, an ad interim report on the progress of the schools under the depart- ment, and on the working of the act during 1873 " In your report dated June 3,1873, it was stated that the average attendance had risen from 66,439 in December, 1872, to 99,783 for the month of March, 1873, and that up to tho end of that month 144,049 children had beon enteied on tho rolls. " I havo now furthor to roport that the averago for tho entire year was 97,039, and that it reached tho highest point m Septem- ber when it was 101,960 The total number of children entered on the rolls during 1873 was 200,602, against 135,962 in 1872. "It has been stated that the majority of the new scholars havo beon drawn from tho pri- vate schools closed by tho competition of the freo state schools. In ordor to ascortam how far this was m accordance with the facts, the teachers wore requested by circular to furnish a return of all the children who carno into their schools from private schools during tho year. Replies havo as yet boon received from 533 only, but as these include most of tho schools from tho contres of popu- lation, where principally tho private schools wcro situated, tho number of private scnool children will cortamly not exceed twice tho number already returned. This number was 7,809 Twice this number would be 15,018 The numb« on the rolls for 1873 exceeded that for 1872 by 70 640 1 ho number derived from sources other than private schools will thcreforo bo about 55,000 " The erection of now schools and the en largement of existing ones is proceodmg with all possible speed, and contracts to tho ex. tent of £150,000 havo boon already entered into to próvido accommodation for about 30,000 children There are 742 school build mrs vested in the Minister About 91 now schools are either built or are in course of erection Five hundred and nine schools aro state schools held m leased buildings, and 127 remain under clauso 10, receiving a capi- tation allow ance " In the state and state leased schools there oro emplojed 1 577 teachers and assist ant teachers, 401 worknustiosscs, and about 850 pupil teachers "Hie teachers of the schools receiving capitation allow ancea aro not included in tho abovo figures, but as their schools be como closed they will bo made teachers m the state schools which replace them The total number of teachers, workmistresaes and pupil teachers employod will bo about 3 150, the number at the end of 1872 was 2,206 " The permanent effect of tho now regula tiona upon emoluments of toacheis will not be fully apparent till the necessary accommo dation has been provided to enable the department to closo unnecessary schools or amalgamate them with others When this is done, it is estimated that thero will bo of the larger class of schools-25 to contain 1 000 children each, six 800, throe, 750, Boven, 700,11 COO, two, D50, 21, 500 "To about 12 of tho schools for 1 000, and to about 8 of the others, the emoluments of an associateship of tho Training Institute, say £100, will be added Thero will therefore be availablo for día tribution amongst tho most cfhciont toachors 75 head teaohorships. worth from £360 to £600 per annum, exclusive of profits from teaching extra subjects, bonuses for passing pupil teachers (equal to £72 por annum in a school of 1,000). residences in some casos and retiring allowance, and m addition teachers are now exempted from tho collec- tion of fees "Thoro will also bo m these schools 110 ossistantships worth from £170 to £310. " In 1872 thero were only about 31 hoad teachers, with incomes returned as oxcood mg £360 per annum, and 44 assistants with incomes exceeding £170. " In the annual roport these facts will bo fully worked out, but the abovo will bo amply suilicient to show that the position of noithor teachers nor assistants is likely to bo per- manently injured by tho regulations now m forco " Thero woro somo half dozen incomes under the old arrangements which aro not likely to bo equalled unless by teachers un- usually successful m forming classes m the extra subjects, hut with thcso exceptions, I am confidently of opinion that tho position of tho teachers will bo in every way im- proved "Tho rovision of the school reading books now m uso, or the substitution of otnors for them, is a matter now tmdor your spociol consideration. Nono of tho sones published m Great Britain aio such as to bo ontiroly free from objection whore a purely socular system piovoils, and a sones of historical readings io much required. " I believe that, whon the very diflioult question of fixing the position and number of schools for each district has been Bottled, the principal causo of difference between tho department and tho boards of advice will bo removed, Till such time as this is done, and tho schools built, it will be impossible fully to bring into effect the compulsory clauses of the act. " I have the honour to be, sir, " Your obedient servant, " Henut Venables."

The postal returns havo increased to the extent of £5,504. tho year's income being £140 093, Most of tue minor items of revenue oxhibit a corresponding improvement. The territorial is the only important department of the reve- nue m which any falling-off is noticeable, and the diminution here is owing chiefly to the policy adopted by the Government of limiting the quantity of land to be disposed of by public auction. In nearly every other department there appears to have been a steady improvement in the returns.

GOLD AND THE GOLD-FIELDS. There is scarcely anything of importance to note respecting goldmining during the past month. The industry is now principally carried on by large companies, who hold claims of various sizes, and their operations have become quite as systematic as those of other companies or manufacturers are. In the early years of gold mining in this colony when alluvial digging was the only mode by which the precious metal was obtained, men generally worked in parties of twos, threes, or fours, in shallow ground, and individual instances of success were then frequently notified. Now, however, even alluvial mines are principally worked by companies who have extensive machinery and appliances for exploring deep ground, and almost all the quartz mines are in the hands of com panies-the outlay required for the pros pecting and development of such claims before they arrive at the paying stage being more thnn private parties can generally afford. The consequence of such a state of affairs is that the companies proceed steadily with their work, and, beyond the informa tion contained in the periodical reports which are published for the benefit of share holders, little is known of the actual position and prospects of the mines. It is only when a new rich reef or washdirt is discovered in a quartz mino or an alluvial claim, or when extra heavy returns are obtained from exist ing reefs or washes already bearing gold, that the special notice of the public is attracted, and the past month has been almost barren of such incidents. The yield of gold from the whole of the mines collectively appears, however, to be well up to the average, and the prospect of gold mining continuing to be one of the leading permanent occupations of the colony becomes more fully assured as time progresses and new gold fields aro found The market for mining shares has been very dull lately, tho chiof causo boing over speculation in the past, and it is re ported that companies holding prospecting claims on Sandhurst bax o beon obliged to suspend operations through the inability or unwillingness of shareholders to pay up tho calls necessary to defray working expenses It is well, perhaps, that this should bo tho case, as it will give breathing time for those who havo been paying calls steadily for months past, and enable othera to conBidei the advisability of amalgamating with adjoin- ing companies where tho amount of ground held is of a limited nature, and of working tho amalgamated ground from one shaft instead of having three or four nearly together, as ib often the caso now where companies do not hold much ground The end of last month closed an unprece dentcdly dull quarter, as far as tho mining markot at Sandhurst was concerned, the absoluto business dono not being half the amount got through in the first quarter of 1873 and probably not a tenth of vv hat was credited to the same period m 1872, and yet within the three months of this year ¿ho amount of gold rcpoited by tho banks was 79 227oz, and tho dividends declared by public companies amounted to £165 962 w hile the calls made during the same period repre Rented a sum of £68,125 leaving a surplus of dividends over calls amounting to the hand somo sum of £97 637 It was true the amounts paid in dividends were dispropor tionate, there being 28 companies in all in which dividends were declared Of those 28, the Garden Gully United and its Tributes 1 2, 3 and 4 paid withm the quarter £128 411 16s , leaving tho remaining 21 companies to divide the comparatively small sum of £37 5">1 4s , hut the persons receiving the largest amount of dividends were foi the most pait largo cmplojers, so that, everything crnsi dered and apart from market inactivity (which inactivity was principally due to e\ ceptional causes) the prospects of the dis trict cannot be looked upon na otherwise than satisfactory The Faster holitlnys have rather seriously interfered with mining on Sandhurst during the earlier portion of this month, but work has now been thorough!) resumed Alluvial mining is somewhat dull on Bal larat lint prospecting for new deep leads of wnshdirt is being energeticall) carried on b) Bome of the large companies there It is in the progress of these claims especially that interest centres, becauso if any of them can once get into the deep ground and provo pay able deposita of gold, a new alluvial era will at once dawn upon us, but all those com pames are more or less retarded by tho tro menciona obstacles prcsentmg thomsolves m penetrating through the country at their deep lévelo, particulaily the water, which is \ery heavy At Ballarat Fast, somo of tho quart? mines continuo to yield well, and that part of the Ballarat district is likely to keep up a good reputation What ia wanted thoro now ia the finding of some defined por monent lode of which thoso already oponed into are ramifications, and many of tho miners aro very Bangumo that such a lode will be discovered soon There seems at present more probability than ever that the country about Elaine and Mount Doran, in the Ballarat district, will before long provide labour for a very large number of miners beyond those now engaged upon the field at Elaine, the companies at work seem to be well pleased with their prospects, and there are sufficient fresh lodes being cut at various places to show that the district does not depend to any extent on one or two reefs only, though probably it would be better if all the small ones were run into one or two, as there would then be less difficulty in following them. The Magdala Company, at Pleasant Creole, havo now sunk their shaft to the great depth of 1,360ft m search of a quartr leef, and notwithstanding tho very heavy expense of such working, sinking is still continued, tho company being sanguine of bucccbs oventu ally The manager of tho Long Tunnel Milling Company, Walhalla GippB Land, which is one of tho richest mines in the world having given very heavy returns for aomo years has just published his report of operations for tho first quarter of this year. It appears from it that 4 75-1J tons of Btono waa crushed during the q'arter, )ieldmg 7 018O7 lldvvt 6gr In addition to that quantity, lfiOoi' lOdwt 18gr of gold wero obtained from p)ritea treated, molting a total for tho quarter of 7 7b8o/ Udwt of gold Tho expenso of crushing tho quartz was £9 182 Os 2d , and of treating tho p)rites £252 14s Tho amount of dividends or profits paid to tho shareholders m the quarter was 119,910 "Gold mining on a somewhat limited scales, writes tlio Mun ay and U"me Times "is being prosecuted m tho Upper Murray district and with so fairadogrco of buccosi as to lead to tho impression that the industry will m timo employ a considerable popula- tion Having regard to the oxtont of country which has been proved to bo aunfo rous ono feels surprise that moro attention has not been paid to the working of the beds of tho numerous streams that fall into the Murray, especially when so many aro ranging from Bass s Straits to Carpentaria in search of tho precious metal Fields at a distanco have, however, the greatest attraction, and while miles on milos of country known to bo gold bearing have never boon tested, mon aro found willing to risk thoir monoy thoir health, and even thoir lives, in travelling to the most remote parts of Austialia, in the vom hope that theio tho truo ' Dorado ' may bo found, where line gold may bo gathered for the looking, nnd nuggots aro as plentiful na the stones that pave tho Stony Desert " AGRICULTUltK. We wore enabled to roport last mail a satis- factory termination of tho drought from which this continent, in common with somo other portions of tho eastern homisphoro, suffered for sovcral months. Wo havo now to report a further abundant rainfall ovor the entiro continent, followed by wann, genial sunshino, togothor inducing a prodi- j gious growth of vegotation ; grass has bo como plentiful, and a good supply of winter feed has thus been insured. Tho offocts of tho long-continued drought, especially tho Yvant of water, aro still visible in tho low con- dition of largo numbers of cattle; shcop appear to havo suffered loss, but neithor mutton nor hoof of good quality is coming forward as fast as consumora would havo them. Tho prico of fat stock has risen so considerably as to loavo no prospect of a spoedy resumption of moat- prosorving. No Victorian company is at prcsont in opera- tion, nor is much work boing dono by tho companies in the othor colonies. Tho retail prico of meat has rison twico within tho lost six ivecks.

Tho Easter encampment was to havo boon hold at Sunbury this year, but the incessant rain which fell just before Easter prevented the ariangements being carried out. The preparations had been far advanced, and for about a week tho Garrison Artillery wero at work laying out tho camp and making tho necessary arrangements for the reception of the volunteer force.' As the time advanced, however, and no appeoranco of ii chango of weather pre- sented itself, the volunteer authorities woro reluctantly compelled to ordor tho encamp- ment to bo broken up. The ground was thoroughly saturated, and tho placing a number of mon pn the field under canvas would morely have resulted in endangering their health without any necessity. Tho " Wet Werribeo " encampment, and tho con- sequences which followed, aro still homo in mind. The breaking up of tho encampment was a great disappointment to many persons. It wob anticipated that over 2,000 men would havo been under arms, and tho prac- tical experience which a few days under canvas would have given them would havo boen of great service. The sutlers who had engaged to cater for the different corp3 Buffered some loss, and a board has boon appointed to investigate their claims. RACING.

The opera season is now in full swing, with the greatest assemblage of musical forces ever got together in that lino in Mel- bourne. During the Easter holidays the perfoi manees at the Opcra-houso wero at- tended with a great success that must havo beon vory satisfactory to the management. During the last month the following vrorltB havo been performed, namely, "Lucrezia Borgia," "Crispinoola Comare," 11 Faust," "Pipclö," "Norina," "Mosel in Kgitto," "11 Trovatoro," "II Barbiere di Siviglia," and " La Juivo." Signora Pal micri has mado au excoUout impression in " Norma"-a part to which her vocal powers aro well adapted. Signora Magi, a young lady, ono of the now arrivals, who possesses a 'good mozzo-Boprano voice, and does duty for contralto, has made a hit in the part of Azucena, and her next porformanco is looked forward to .with interest ; sho is to bo Arsaco to Signora Palmieri's Semiramide, in Rossini's opera shortly to be produced. All the warka above- named have ,',mot with effective ' treatment ' from those engaged in tficir representation, but the production of Halevy's "La Juivo" was'an effort on the part of the management entirely out of the common order. The principal parts were" distributed as follows, namely-Cardinal de Brogni, Signor Dondi ¡ Leopoldo, Signor Coy ; Princess Eudossia, Signora Tamburini Coy ; Radíele, Signora Zenoui-Gamboa ; and Lázaro, Signor Rosnati. The stage mount- ing of the piece has been undertaken in the most liberal spirit, and the result has been a gi eat Success. To see the titles of such works as "Most in Egitto," "Semiramide," and "La Juive" on the programme for the Mel- bourne season, and to know that the operas have been given with satisfactory complete- ness, will give the distant reader a better idea of the condition of our operatic stage than could be gained from longer and more minute descriptions. Signor Giorza has been engaged as coadjutor conductor with Signor Zelman, in order that the preparation of new operas shall go on simultaneously with the performance of the old stock. Miss Roaina Carandini gave a farewell concert at the Town-hall on Saturday, 28th March, previous to her retirement from professional life, but the weather waB very bael, and the attendance most meagre. On Good Friday night the Melbourne Philharmonic Society gavo their first concert .for this year at the Town-halL The place was densely crowded. Men del6solin's "Elijah" was very well per- formed. The following are the names of those who took part in it:-Miss Rosina Carandini, Miss Pitts, Miss Christian, Mr. Armes Beaumont, and Mr. S. Lambie. Mr. David Lee conducted, for the last time. That gentleman has now resigned his connexion with the society before going to Europe vid America. On the same night sacred con- certs were given at the Opera-house and at the Melbourne Athenioum ; the opera bouse was densely ciovvded, but at the placo last named there was a vory poor attend- ance. On the 11th instant, Signor Susini, the well-known and favourite basso singer gave a farewell concert at the Town- hall, previous to his departure for América. There was a great attendance. The following took part in the performance, namely, Madame Miranda HirBt, Madame Lucy Chambers, Miss Christian, Miss Frederica Mitchell, Mr. H. Bracy, Mr. E. Farley, Mr. Siede, Mr. Herz, Mr. Elsasser, Signor Giorza, and the members of the Metropolitan Liedertafel. Miss Frederica Mitchell is a debutante (mezzo, soprnno) of good promise. THE WEATHER.

"April 3,1871 " To tho Editor of tho Eiupu e. "Sir,-His not without a feeling of patn otic shame that I read the strange letter ad- dressed yesterday to the Herald by the con- sul of France. It is sad to seo my country represented, in a city like Sydney, by a man whom it ia necessary to accuse either of ignor- ance or a want of honour. " The French consul asserts that my com- panions and myself, in fact, are ordinary con- victs, and not political offenders. By such a base affirmation ho shows that he does not even know the essential difference between 'transportation,' applied in Franco to oidi iiRry criminals, and 'deportation,' loserved for vanquished in civil wars. Moreover, ho outrages directly the court-martial who judged us, and after examination declared us personally innocent of murder or arson, and convicted only of high treason against the Government of the day. "If the French consul knows these dis- tinctions, as it is the duty of every diplomatic agent, whoso least merit must be the know- ledge of usual laws, he shows, in presenting facts under a false light, a total want of re- spectability. "I did not want thia new proof lo know to what degree of ignorance and degradation had fallen, in our unfortunate couniry, the old classes who pretend to the exclusive management of public affairs, and of which the Flench consul in S)dney is so brilliant a specimen. But my intention not being in this letter to treat this queation, which is the cause of all our revolutions, I only wish to address to the French consul the following challenge : "'If ,we are oidinary criminals, let bim claim our extradition, and send us back to the Governor Of New Caledonia.'

Simon's letter ex- cited in Sjdney some little feeling of sym- pathy in favour of M. Rochefort and his companions, and a meeting was held, not largely attended, at which an " address of welcome" was adopted. This was afterwards presented by a deputation of eight citizens, and on the same occasion M._ Rochefort was presented with some specimens of cold quartz, and M. Grousset with a walking stick, as souvenirs of their visit to Sydney. On the 11th inst. Messis. Rochefort, Grousset, Jourde, and Pain left Sydney for America in the mail steamer Cyphrenes. M. Bastion Grantbillo proceeded to New castle on the 9th, to leavo theie by sailing vessel for San Francisco, vvhero he intends re mailling with some of his relatives. The other four purpose proceeding to Europe without delay. M. Rochefort intends going first to London, and from thenco will probably go to Switzerland, where one of his children lias been at school since the death of his wife, which occurred about three months after his trial. NEW SOUTH WALES. In the Colonial Parliament the Appropria- tion Act has been passed, and received the Royal assent, but the Government' intend to prolong the session until several other bills are passed. The Legislative Council has rejected the report of the committee to make the Upper House elective, by lu to 4. The principal difficulty which stood hi the way of its adop- tion was the absence of any available and certain method of finally deciding questions on which the two Houses differ. There is no doubt that public opinion is in favour of tho elective principle. The motion of censure brought by Mr. Robertson against the Treasurer for his sup- posed revelation of the intention of the Go- vernment to increase the tobacco duties re- ceived only one vote. Mr. Robertson's motion in favour of resuming negotiations for another Border treaty was shelved by a count-out. Mr. Robertson admitted that SÍr. Francis, the Chief Secretary of Victoria, was to blame, and that Mr. Parkes had been unhandsomely attacked, but he caught at an expression at tile close of Mr. Francis's last letter which he interpreted as a kind of re- cantation,' and as the expression of a wish that'better relations might be established. Mr. Parkes said he had done everything, even1 to giving up revenue, to conciliate Vic-' to'ria, and that the notice as to the cancel- lation of the treaty was given without any previous intimation. He refused absolutely to make any advances towards a fresh treaty, and said he would rother resign his post. Since this the Astcmbly refused to bind the Government to re-open Border duties nego- tiations. A motion for the payment of mem- bers wos negatived by twx> to one. The Assembly, after a warm debate, nullified the lesolution for a military inquiry, by deciding to proceed with the consideration of the Estimates. Towards the end of March, M. nenri liochefort ; M. GioiiBSet, ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs ; M. Jourde, ex-Minister of I- ¡nance ; M. Pain, ex-Secretary of Foreign Affoiis ; M. Balliere, aide-de-camp to General Rossel ; M. de Ilillc, ex-commandant of the National Guard, under the Communist Go- vernment, in Fiance, with other Communists, escaped from Ducos Peninsula, New Cale- donia, in the barque P.C.E., and arrived at Sydney. They declined to give any particu- lars of their escape, for fear of implicating their friends, maintained a very reserved manner, and did not court attention, though they have, of course, been objects of great cunosity. MM. Rochefort, Pain, and Balliere answered a letter from M. Simon, the French consul, through the Empire, denying that they were sentenced as ordinary convicts. They said they were sentenced as political offenders, and aro on the samo footing as Louis Blanc and Ledru Hollín. M. Paschal Giousset also published a stinging reply to the consul's attack, and challenged him to demand their extradition if, as ho as- serted, they were not political offenders only, 'lhere was no public demonstration beyond a meeting of Radicals to present Rochofort with a congratulatory address on his escape. 11 has transpired that money has been wait ing in Sydney for some timo post for lum, but it must all have been used up, and more was telegraphed for and received. It is said that the French Government professed itself incredulous as to the truth of the messago in which the escape of the prisoners was announced, and that the consul received as a reply-"Repeat telegram. Incredible!" Rochelort, Giousset, and Jourde loft for England on April 11, via California, Achille Giant having already embarked thither by sailing vessel. It is understood that Roche fort purposes to proceed to Switzerland. There is now every prospect of nn arrange- ment being finally concludod for tlio con- struction of the two new telegraph cables between New South Wales and New Zea- land, and Queensland and Singapore. The sanction of other two colonies who aro parties to the agreement was obtained many months ago. For some reason not yet ex plained, Mr. Parkes has kept the matter bock, but he has promised now to submit to Parliament resolutions for approving tho ogieement. Mr. Audley Coote, the repre- sentative of tho English contracting capi- talists, is in Sydney, and is anxious to bring the matter to au issue. The three colonies guaioiiteo an interest of 5 per cent, on £1,000,000 sterling ; £12,000 per annum is to be allowed to cover in full all expenses, all receipts beyond that to go inieduction of tho guarantee. When the profits exceed 10 per cent, the Government may demand a reduc- tion of the rotes. Tho guarantee is for 35 yeais, but it is only payable if the communi- cation is kept up ; four weeks in each year to be allowed for repairs. The line to New Zea- land will be a very great assistance in carry- ing out tho Pacific mail contract. A postal convention has been arranged with the Honolulu Government. The representativo of the Torres Straits mail line boa offored to moko Sydney the permanent terminus, if sub- sidised. The Government intend to commute the sentences of Gardiner and tho escort robbers to exile Yvhon 10 years of the sentonco has been served. Hawthorne, another bush langer, has been sentenced to death at Goul- burn. SOUTH AUSTRALIA. Tho exports lost year amounted, to £4,285,000 and the imports to £3,527,000, being an increase of nearly a million, Mr. Boothby's wheat statistics for last season, which have been issued, allowed that the total area sown was 784,784 aerea, being an increase of 24.973 acres. The total yield amounted to 6,178,810 bushels, showing a decrease of 2,557, 096 bushels. The average yield was 7 bushels 521b., being a decrease of 3 bushels 381b. The probable export stir plus will be 95,000 tons. The revenue for the quarter ending March amounted to £200,000, including £101,000 from Customs £58,000 from land sales, £40,000 from railways, £18,000 from postal and telegraphs. Fifteen thousand acres of land were se lected in March, of the value of £85,000. Fifty thousand pounds worth of Treasuiy bills have been taken at par. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company have forwarded a telegram olleiing to re*"^ce the rates between London hud Port Darwin to £3 5s. for 10 words minimum and (ia. 6d. for every additional word ; between India and Port Dai win, including the India and Java transit rates, 38s., and a corresponding re- duction to other countries. This in con sideration of receiving an annual subsidy of £25.000, reducible after 30,000 messages. The Postmaster-General has left for the other ' colonies, to negotiate in regard to a subsidy, on the basis of the company's ofl'cr. The balance-sheet of the Moonta mino shows that over 11,000 tons of ore were raised during the half-year. The gross proceeds amounted to £122,000, and the expenses to £90,000. Owing to a decrease in their wages, the Moonta miners, about three weeks back. decided to Btiike and resist the reduction for three months. They rejected a proposal for a compromiBc, and got the Wallaroo miners to join them, the two bodies together number, ing 2,500 men. At Moonta, women turned out with brooms and drove off all hands 1 found working, and the engines were stopped. ; The tradesmen expressed sympathy with the ¡miners, and'at first there was no prospect ¡of an immediate termination of the stnkc. 'A sum of £1,000 waa contributed towards the ¡relief fund, and the men in the smaller mines not on strike agreed to contribute £500 ; weekly to,the'Btipport of it. At meetings »b'eld'in Adelaide sympathy was expressed with'thé miifers.a'doputation of whom pro 'ceeded to the city and had au interview with the directors, y/ho declined to accede to their request, but in consequence of the increased ¡price ' of provisions, expressed themselves willing to consider any more moderate pro ¡position.' . The deputation ? then sent a wiitten statement to the directors, suggest- ing that thoy should make a modified propo- sition to_ tho ,men, including a definite pro ¡miae of* an advance if copper rises. The directors resolved to pay the miners the full woäes demanded for two months, and con iinue them if copper rises ; and the strike has now terminated. During its occurrence the price of Moonta shares fell to £1."). The Burra mine shows a loss during the past half-year, but the mine is considered in good condition, and there is £1,600 of a credit balance. A banquet has boen given to Colonel Warburton on his return from his unsuccess- ful western exploration expedition. The ' colonel make an excellent speech, ascribing the preseivation of the lives of himself and pal ty to Charley, his black boy. A vote of thanks was tendered to the WeBt Australian people for their kindness to the explorera. Mr. Reynolds writes from the Northern Territory in great confidence in the gold bearing nature of the country, and says that the non-success is owing to sending ex- pensive machinery, and the negligence of manageis. At the inquiry concerning the late railway catastrophe, by which two persons lost their lives, the jury found that it happened acci- dentally, but censured the engine-driver for driving too fast. A Mrs. Trett committed suicide by placing her head across tho railway, at Gawler, and the train severed her head in two. The District Chairmen's Association in tend shortly to petition Parliament to grant a further sum of £100,000 for the mainten- ance of main roads.

Ho waa re- ceived by the natives of Taupo district xvith Bongs and loyal speeches. The natives mus- tered from all parts of the island to attend a great friendly gathering at the King's head- quarters. Tho Governor of Western Aus- tralia, Mr. Weld, has been on a visit to New Zealand. Last month tho colony saw one of the most extraordinary Parliamentary entanglements which ever occurred in any country blessed with representative institutions. It is usual to prorogue the Parliament for about two months at a time, so that should a necessity arise for ita meeting at other than tho usual time, it could be called together. At the end of January, Parliament stood prorogued to tho 10th of February, and as it was not intended that it should then meet, a fresh proclama- tion of prorogation was prepared and sent after the Governor, who was on a visit to the South. It did not, however, reach him before his departure for a yachting tour on the West Coast, out of reach of all com- munication. The 10th accordingly arrived without any further prorogation having taken place, and the members of both Cham- bers who happened to bo in Welling- ton duly met, and, the Speakers being absent, put members in the respective chairs. Neither HouBe having a quorum, no busi- ness could be done, and the Houbcs stood adjourned from day to day. The Premier was in Nelson at the time, but returned in hot haste to Wellington. The awkward feature in the case was the clause in the Constitution Act by which# any member absent without. leave forfeited his seat. Leave could not be granted without a quorum being present, and if the meet- ing was to bo a session, then all the members except the Wellington ones would have lost their seats, or bo put to the great inconvenience of attending as a matter ¿f form. The _ Attorney-General, however, ?gave it as his opinion that there could be no session legally unless Parliament passed a bill, this decision beinggiven onsomeancient English precedent. Tho Governor did not return for more than a wcok after the meet- ing of tho Houses, but on the 18th ho issued a proclamation relieving members from attending on the 10th, and further proroguing Parliament. The Attorney- General's opinion, although accepted and acted on by the Go- vernment, is not at all accepted as asatisfactory -or authoritative one, and a very uneasy feel- ing exista as to whether thero ia really a House of Representatives or not now. Alto- gether the affair was an extraordinary one, and it is believed entirely unprecedented in Parliamentary hiBtory. FIJI. New Zealand papers received via Sydney contain! a brief statement of the circum- stances under which King Cakobau has con- sented to cede the Fiji Islands to the British .Crown. The private secretary to the Governor has supplied information to the editor of the New Zealand Herald, informing him that nis Excellency the Governor has received a despatch from the commodore, which states that, upon the 20th ultimo, the Fijian chiefs formally requested Her Majesty the Queen to undertake the government of the islands. His Excellency's private secretary adds : "Although it does not necessarily follow that Her Majesty's Government will accept the cession, it is impossible to remodel the government on the past baBia, and the com- modore baa requeated the foreign consuls to advise with the representatives of King Cakobau to arrange for a provisional form under which laws can be administered and order secured. " His Excellency has also boen informed by the commodore that, in the course of in- quiries instituted by himself and Her Ma- jesty's consul, he has ascertained that during the two years ending 31st December, 1873, the expenditure of the defacto Government of Fiji had amounted to £124,000, while the revenue land been only £42,000. "The present grand divisions of the debt may be thus stated, viz. :-Borrowed on debentures, £50,000: payablo on demand, £36,145. The interest due on tho debentures amounts to £424 3s. 4d. a month, of the pay- ment of which the commodoro can see no prospect. , "Government House, Auckland, 1st April, 1874." - -, . .

Nubia, after taking on board her maila, gold, and specie, and embarking her passengers, took" her departure from Hobson's Bay on the i afternoon of the 26th ult. The company's R.M.S.S.

Since the departure of the mail steamer a month ago, business has not been marked by much of an active or animated character. A very Bteady trade demand has been main- tained, and in this respect the business must aggregate a very considerable amount. Thero has been no excitement whatever, however, notwithstanding that attention has been directed to several specialties, which has re- sulted in speculative purchases to a con- siderable extent. Such movements, how- ever, are not now, as formerly, followed up by the trade, so that BpcculutoiB aro moro dependent for a successful issuo upon the mere chance of an improvement occurring during the interval which elapses between the purchase and the period of sale when the goods come into season ; but as too fre- quently happens, counteracting circum- stances ariso which no one can foresee, and a heavy loss is more frequently tho caso than otherwise ; hence tho reason that specula- tors aro so backward in operating now as compared with former years, and that the markets aro so rarely stimulated to any- thing like well-sustained activity. Since our Inst, moreover, the Easter holidays have been the means of causing a break of au entire week in the transactions of tho month, so that thoro aro many reasons for tho complaints of dulness which have pre- vailed. Bulk aloa have been quite neglected, and tho business done of very trilling ac- count. Bottled ales and stout havo com- manded very moderate notico. Dundoo goods havo been in conaiderablo favour, luoiei especially woolpacks, which havo boon bought largely on speculation, many hundred hales having changed hands, on tho spot and to arrive, but xvitbont causing an improve- ment in value, the price quoted at the pre- sent time being littlo over last month's rates. On cornsaclcs a decline has had to bo submitted to. Boots and shoes have not boen largely sold. Candles are still supported by the action of a speculative purchaser, who loses no oppor- tunity of sustaining values, but as to their making a further advance, that is not oven thought of at present. Cements, hitherto so much depressed, havo had at longth somo notice accorded to thom. Somo 5,000 barrels pressing on tho maikot havo boon talton up t'y the trado in self-defence, and a firmor lechiiLT, with an improved tone, has been im pai ted since ; it is feared, however, that this js merely temporary, as shipments from nomo aie still continued on so heavy a seale as to render it almost im possible to effect a permanent chango in tno markot. Importers aro very heavy fosera at tbo rates now ruling. On chicory *u advance of at least a penny por lb. has been successfully established. Coffee has Maintained a firm aspect, and the only Jioticeable feature is the arrival of the Lot \l^.on tho 30th ult., with an entire cargo of iW tons, lush, now that tho season of Lent is over, has receded from tho oxtremo rates jilling previously. A movement in dried fruits has led to tho quittance of at loast ¿"OU packages of «manta, but only an ?"Vftnc<) °f ono farthing por pound baa »eon secured. RoiBins havo also im proved in value. Breadstuff's havo on tho ¿ii? be<m vory steady. Flour has shown Bomo weakness, but the scarcity of wheat una caused much firmness in that grain to be Maintained. Oats havo been realising ox tremo prices, but in maizo a declino of lOd. £f b"8«ol at least has had to bo submitted w. un blasting powder thero íb still room to hope for an early change. Shipments are very light, and should they continue so, wo may soon look for more animation. Hops and malt are going out of notice for a season. Metals, notwithstanding very favourable ad- vices, havo not shown increased animation. Oils generally aro dull. Kerosene is in slow saleinconsequence of heavy stocksand equally heavy shipments advised, and the market looks as if the season was to be a bad one for importers. The prospects for rice are by no means satisfactory. During the month, of the James Service s cargo of Patna about 300 tonshavo been quitted, and of the Wimmera's 123 tons more, while, entire, the Parmenio's cargo of Japan rice was disposed of publicly. Of salt, which has been very depressed, only 150 ,tons havo been placed. Sugar, though presenting a firmer and healthier tone, does not appear to have been so extensively operated in ; about 38,000 bags may havo changed hands in all. Teas have gone off Bteadily, and at the public sales about 17,500 packngCB havo also found buyers. Timbcrhas had very modera te attention, tbedisposal of tho flooring by tho Oberon and Tythonus, and the quittance of the deals by the Odin being the principal events. In tobaccoes, with the ex- ception of a parcel of Two Seas, Bold early in the month, nothing special has transpired. Brandies, though firm, have not been charac- terised by any speculative feeling, and under the circumstances the market is wonderfully well Bustained. The sales reported amount to about 1,110 quarters and 5,700 cases. The arrival of the mail steamer was telegraphed from Adelaide on tho 5th April, and on the morning of the 7th, the Baroda reached Hobson. Bay. Our dates from London by this opportunity come up to February 20th, and the shipments to Melbourno advised for the four weeks ending the 7th of the same month amount to £514,100, showing a de- crease on the preceding four weeks of £210,500, the decrease on those to the other colonies being equolly large. By the same mail we have dates from New York to 4th of Fcbmary, and by the Californian route to 27th of February. Advices from Calcutta reach to 4th of March, from Colombo to 13th of March, from Foochow to 21st of February, from Batavia to 28th of February, from Sin- gapore to 20th of February, from Manilla to 7th of Febniary, from Rangoon to 21st of February, and from Saigon to 2nd of March. -XCIIANG- AND MOSEV. , For the present moil there is no alteration whatever to lepoit on the rate of exchange.

PUBLIC COMPANIES. Melbourne Meal-preserving Company. - The thirteenth half-) early meeting of this company waa held on tho 13th inst., and the following report of tho directors was pre- sented and adopted:-"Tho operations of the company during the past six months havo consisted of the slaughter of 85,300 sheep and 316 oxen. Although at tbo commencement of summer prospects wero very favonrablo for tho interests of this company, the intensely hot weather and absence of ram that ensued contributed to provont sheep travelling in Riverina, and in consequence the abundant supplies of fat Btock which your directors had been led to expect did not como forward. On tho 7th December a lire took placo at tho factory, which completely destroyed the kitchen, preserving-room, and cooling-room, togetbor with their contents. The directors of the Australian Meat-preserving Company at onco placed their works at tho disposal of this company (an act of courtesy which your directors take this opportunity of publicly acknowledging), and by this means opei aliona were continued on a limited scale down to 12th March, when your direc toro wero compelled to suBpond operations, owing to the continued dcarness and acarcity of stock. Tho repairs rendered nocossary by thofiro aro boing proceeded with, and tho factory is boing put into a thorough state of repair, inreodiness for a resumption of ope- rations as soon ns tho state of tho market will justify this step. Your directors view with much regret the larso amount that Btands to tho debit of profit and loss. Con- trary to general expectation, tho prices at homo have not advanced, notwithstanding tho Bupplioo of preserved meut from the colonies havo fallen off considerably ; indood tbo 21b. and 41b. tins, of which your stock mainly consisted, have receded in value fully Id. per lb. Tho valuó of tallow has also been unprecedentedly low in England during the post six months, and the result is that the Y'aluations put on the company's ship- ments afloat, so far as account sales are yet to hand, have not been realised." The balance to debit of profit and loss ac- count was £0,803 la. lid. The chairman stated that the fall in the price of meat at home, and the rise in the price of stock hero, bad greatly darkened tho prospects of the company. All work had consequently been stopped at tho factory, and it would not be resumed until operations could bo carried on at a profit.
