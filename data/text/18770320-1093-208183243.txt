Gentlemen—I wish specially to direct your attention to my opinions on the following six points:— Legislative Council Beform.—I think that whenever any penal dissolutien of the House of Assembly takes place, one-third of the members of the Legislative Council should retire in order that you may give your opinion on the ques tion which has caused such dissolution. This would render the Legislative Council more re sponsible to you, and prevent any deadlock between the two Houses. Land Laws.—Having been a consistent land reformer ever since the question first arose, I congratulate the farmers of this colony on their success in breaking up the monopoly which formerly existed in land. I shall be happy to advocate any amendment of the law, shown to be required,. especially the reduction of the price of scrub land to a nominal sum to those willing to clear and cultivate. Mining Laws.—I advocate a peppercorn rent for unproductive mineral lands, with conditions enforcing the employment of labor, in order to prevent monopolies, and a Boyalty or percentage on dividends. Taxation and Free Trade.—If it can be shown, as asserted by some, that no further taxation is required I shall be most happy to be convinced, as nothing but absolute necessity justifies the imposition of taxes; but if further taxation is required it should fall on the wealthy classes, who have hitherto never paid their fair share of the expenses of the Govern ment of this colony. Everyone should con tribute according to his means, whether such means are derived from shares, lauds, mines, sheep, or any other description of property. That " large and important class, the men of no property,", who have hitherto through the Gustom-House paid more than their fair share of taxation, should be relieved by the introduc tion of Free Trade, has been done in England. Immigration should be carefully conducted, and stopped by telegraph as soon as the first symptoms of bad times or scarcity of employ ment manifest themselves. Law Beform —I am and always have been an ardent admirer of the Beal Property Act and all other endeavors" to simplify and cheapen .the law of the land and the procedure of the Courts. I advocate'the adaptation of the Local Court procedure to the Supreme Court. I remain, Tour obedient servant. ' 78zcx83c B. C BAKEB. LECTORS OE EAST TORRENS.

All Electors are invited. 79a TO THE ELECTOKS OF THE COLONY. SIX PLAIN REASONS "WHY WE SHOULD EACH GIVE ONE VOTE TO MR. JOHN CROZIER FOR . THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. 1\. Because although a New [South Wales colonist, he has made South Australia' his home, and has thoroughly identified himself in every way yrith our colony. 2\. Because—no. Absentee, he has freely in vested his capital in South Australian trade. 3\. Because he has heen a spirited and liberal supporter of mining in South Australia. , 4. Because we are all anxious to secure the Riverina trade, and the pre- eminence of South Australia , as an Australian colony mainly , de pends: upon our getting it. In the River Murray Nature meant we should have it. Mr. Crozier has for many years brought the whole of his New South Wales-and Riverina produce to South Australian Ports, arid has taken his supplies from us, dealing with South Australia alone.' '• - ; - The example of one man like Mr. Crozier is worth the'advocacy of a hundred others. No one has done.so much as Mr. Crozier to secure to us the trade with Riverina, by showing that it can he best done here. We can only get it by' New South Wales arid Victorian tradesmen and squatters following his example. 5\. Because he is a: man with a thorough practical knowledge of what is required to develop the country, a hard-headed Scotchman, who has raised himself to. his present honorable : position, arid whose advice is worth having, for he really understands what he is talking about. : Unlike many, when he does not thoroughly understand, he holds his tongue and listens. 6; Because , he has served us well in the past. He was an independent hut consistent Jsup- , porter of the Morgan and Boucaut Government. He yielded his own opinion on subsidiary matters, so as not to endanger or, delay the execution of a great policy which the country approved. He is no obstructive. A severe domestic affliction and consequent illness have compelled Mr. Crozier at this time to seek a short change. No one. can blame o reserit his absence ; it was unavoidable, and I trust his canvas will not suffer from this cause. • Do not forget him therefore, but give ONE VOTE TO MR. JOHN" CROZIER. 72zcx76c Atst ELECTOR. "P^AST TORRENS ELECTION. Mr. J. A.

Tms Y&osphafle; m pfonounced by the most eminent members of the Mecncal Profession to te unequalled for its powjar In . replenishing the vitality of the body, by its supplying'atl the essential' constituents of the blood and nerve substance, and1 for developing all the powers- and functions of the system to the highest degree. It is agreeable to the palate, and innocent m its action, while retaining, all its extraordinary proper ties; and as a specific, surpassing all the known therapeutic agents of the present day, for the speedy and permanent cure of— Nervous PSrostRition Shortness, pt Breath Liver Complaints ... Trembling of the hands Palpitation of the Heatt and limbs . Dizziness ' 'Impaired Nutrition Noises in the Head and Mental and Physical De Ears ' " " "' ' pression Loss of Energy and Ap- Consumption (in its first petite" stages only) Hypochondria Timidity Female' Complaints Eruptions of the Skin General Debility Impaired Siyht and Me Indigestion mory Flatulence 1 Nervous Fancies Incapacity for Study or Impoverished Blood Business . Nervous Debility in all its Sick Headache ' Stages Lassitude Premature Decline and all morbid conditions of the system arising from .whatever cause. The action of the Phosphodyne is twofold—on the one hand increasing the principle which constitutes nervous energy, and on the other the most powerful blood and flesh generating agent known; therefore, a marvellous medicine for reno vating impaired and broken-down, constitutions. It quickly improves the functions of assimilation to such. a degree that where for' years an emaciated, anxious, cadaverous, _ ana semi-vital condition has existed, the flesh will' rapidly increase in quantity and firmness, and the whole system return to a state of robust health. The Phosphodyne acts electrically upon the organization; for instance, it assists nature to generate that human electricity which renews and rebuilds the osseous, muscular, nervous, membranous, and organic systems.. It operates on the system, without exciting care or thought upon the individual as to the process. It moves" the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, stomach, and intestines with a harmony, vigor, yet mildness unparalleled in medicine. The Phosphodyne gives hack to the human strno*. tnre, in a suitable form, the phosphoric or animating element of life which has been wasted, and exerts an important influence directly on ;the spinal marrow and nervous system, of a nutritive, tonic, and in vigorating character, maintaining that buoyant energy of .the brain and muscular system which renders the mind cheerful, brilliant, and energetic, entirely overcoming that' dull, inactive, and sluggish disposition, which .many persons experience in all their actions. The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are fre quently shown from the first day of its administra tion by a remarkable increase ofinervons power, with a feeling of vigor and comfort, to, which the patient has long been unaccustomed. Digestion k>improved; the appetite increases wonderfully; the bowels become regular; the eyes brighter; the skin olearMid healthy; and the hair, acquires strength, showing the impor tance of the action of the Phosphodyne on the organa of nutrition.
