Wlitn, after receiving tíio best medical attention and all hope of cure had gone, and when in almost a state of collapse, you took his case in hand, ard, by some miraculous process you have now restored bim to lull health and strength. Brother Johnson is to-day a striking example of your abilities as a Tuberculosis Expert. Not only the Brothers of our Order, but hundreds of other resi- dents of Adelaide can testify to his almost in- credible return to health. We little expected to have him in our midst again. But, thanks to your wonderful skill, he is as healthy and strong as any of tis. May you long be epaxed to con- tinue your great and glorious work. Wishing jou the good foriune you deserve.-I am, your» idithfully and fraternally, W.. C. WEDD, Hon.
