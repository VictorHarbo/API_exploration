I have to thank you for the confidence in me therein expressed. As I have a much greater interest in the District of the Start than the other candidate in the field I am willing to stand, and in the event of my bong elected I trust I shall be able to justify your expectations. As so little time remains before the day of election considerable exertion will be necessary to secure the day, and I trust my friends will not be behind the emergency soas to place me at the head of the polL As I have had no opportunity of attending any of the public -TgnHaga I would state that my views on the leading questions of the day are as follows : — I am a Freetrader, and favorable to any mea sures for encouraging native industry which do not involve an increase of our Customs duties ; at the same time, I think the present tariff should be aaended so as to admit, as far as possible, raw materials free of duty. I would support any properly-matured mea sure for opening the land to the bona fide agri culturist on more liberal terms. I am against having any Act whatever affect ing immigration, believing that the Parliament should be free to introduce immigrants or not according to the state of the market Railways and Tramways we want more than anything else. From the formation of the country they are our most suitable means of ywnTpiminfltfain, They would benefit our farmers in the carriage of produce ; they would benefit the squatters by ensuring the convey ance of supplies and stock ; they would tend largely to develop our mineral resources, and greatly conduce to the permanent prosperity of the province generally. A Branch Railway to Gbmelg I have long considered should be tp^A**. The most liberal terms «h«nfld be granted to parties giving some guarantee as to the proper working of mineral lands. Whether Government should subsidise edu cation is a difficult question, and all itrants given for this purpose should be carefully looked after. We ought to leave nothing undone to culti vate and improve our trade on the River Murray. I would advocate strict economy in the ex penditure of the various Government depart ments. Although objecting to pledges in general I can give one without hesitation, and .that is that if elected I will neither seek nor accept an office in the Government AT.nrx-. MURRAY.

JUDGE BOOTHBY.— The following «l ADDRESS will this day be offered to tiie colonists for their signature.

My having been a colonist for nearly twenty eight yean, during which I have ever taken a warm interest in the progress and prosperity of South Australia, and my bong unconnected with the Parliament or with the legal profession, are the excuses I offer, if any be needed, for thus presuming to ask my fellow-colonists to join me in 'gw*'g this address.
