The Rebecca, barque, from Newcastle, left that port on May 2(t, and five days after passed Cape Howe in company with the barque Guiton; on the 3rd of June was in company with the brigs Pet and Clarendon, bound to Melbourne; and on the 11th spoke the barque Sydney Griffiths, off Kent's Group, bound from Newcastle to Geelong. The Rebecca encountered severe gales from the 5th to the 9th June. She passed Cape Jervis on the 13th, and the concluding stage of the trip was marked by light baffling winds. The Kate Swanton was towed down on Thurs day, and immediately made sail. From advices received in the colony, we are in formed that the Gaspard sailed from Calcutta for this port on the 21st April. The Fbanklin will mo;t probably be tugged into harbour to-day. instruction op the barque jane e. Williams bv Fire, and Heavy. Loss op Life. —Mr. John Alexander Scott, the chief officer of the steamer Yeun Tze Fee, has handed to us for publication the following particulars of the loss of the barque Jane E. Williams by fire on the 6th of February last. It will be seen that Mr. Scott and three seamen were the only persons whose lives were saved :— ' Barque Jane E. Williams, 436 tons register, from Liverpool 19th December, 1863, David Young, commander, bound to Shanghai with a cargo of coals. Put into Holyhead on the 23rd, ship making a little water. Sailed again on the 3rd January, 1804. Had very fine weather until we got clear of the Channel, when we experienced a series of heavy gales for 10 days off Cape Finisterre, when we then got a fine northerly breeze. Passed Madeira on the 2nd February; and on the morning of the 5th, at (i a.in., Tencritfe bearing south-south- west 93 miles an alarm was given that the ship was on fire, smoke issuing out of the stern and hatches. Got the boats out, and got bread and water, and all our effects into the longboat. We then stopped up every vent where smoke was issuing from, and made all possible sail upon the ship; wind, south east. Ten a.m., longjwat stove in; obliged to cut her off, as she wa3 sinking with all our effects in her. Noon, increasing breezes and heavy squalls. Sunset, saw the peak rather indistinctly. 12 midnight, close to Port Orotova. Shortened sail, expecting the fire to keep down till daylight. Two a.m., 6tn. fire broke out from the decks and ship's side, when we got into the boats, it being impossible to remain on board any longer. Captain and myself anil six men in the lifeboat, second mate and six men in jollyboat. Lost sight of jollyboat immediately after leaving the ship. Pulled in shore. Daylight found the sea breaking very heavily on the shore. Pulled along the island for about 15 miles to try to find a land ing. Half- past !) a.m. saw a small inlet, where we thought the water was smooth. Pulled for* it. After getting close in found the sea breaking very heavy, and impossible to turn the boat round. Captain gave orders to pull our coats olf, which we all did with one exception, when a very heavy sea broke over the boat, capsizing her and throwing all hands into the water. Four reached the shore in safety and four were drowned. Boat and oars smashed into splinters on the beach. Drowned— Captain D. Young and three seamen. Bodies washed up since, and buried in the Protestant Cemetery, in Orotova. Captain ten days in water. —Cape Argus, April 5. VESSELS IN HARBOUR. ADIEU, brig (British), 343 tons, Jno.
