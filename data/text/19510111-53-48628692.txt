HALF-CASTE MIGRANTS Sydney.—Immigration officers temporarily banned from land- ing two Danish- Chinese children who arrived by ship from Genoa with their Danish father. The children were held in the liner Toscana for more than two hours until, on instructions from Canberra, they were granted a per- mit to stay for three months. The children—Ole Ejner Jarl- dane, 11, and Peter Aage Jarl- dane, 7—accompanied their father, Mr. Kristian K. Jarldane. They were born in Shanghai of a Chinese mother. Mr. Jarldane, a retired officer of the Chinese maritime customs ser- vice, said he had lived in the Far East for 40 years. The fear of another war in Europe had prompted him to leave Denmark for Australia. A spokesman for the Immigra- tion Department said later that consideration on merits would be given to any application made for the children to stay in Australia for more than three months.
