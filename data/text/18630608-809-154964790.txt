COMMERCIAL. Aoe Office, Saturday Evening. Thero wore no export entries passed for gold at ,tlie Customs to-day. Business in tho early part of the past weok opened out vory quietly, and did not show any increased animation as tho week advanced. On Thursday morning, however, the entire mercantile community was startled from its lethargy by telegrams from Adelaide, containing the result of the Intercolonial Tariff Conference, as laid before the Legislative As sembly in Adelaide. After tho first surpriso was over, it was evident that Victorian merchants placed no faith in tho conclusions arrived at being enter tained in Melbourne, and a singlo day more mado it equally certain that they would not bo accoptcd by the oolonies thciuselvos most desirous of bringing about an assimilation of tariffs. To say that no ad ditional businoss was dono undor tho intluouco of an anticipated change would ho wrong, for it will bo found in our report that caudles and salt, two articles notoriously known to be at present below their legiti mate valuo, wero so affected, nuinorous purchases of these having been mado, but in no case lias any exteusivo speculation been outorod upon. Considera ble sales of bulk Murtell's brandy, to arrive, have been effected, but tho spirit trailo lias been marked for little elso. Tho rising tendency existing in tlio market for brcadstufl's has at present been checked t y... ? ? _ ? -...1 ? i. .1.-1 by (Jaliiornmn advices, via bydncy, ana great am uess lias prevailed. Tho provision market is well sustained, tlie scarcity of liams and bacon, as well as cheese, being still felt. Teas arc ratlior inactive, and sugars dragging. Low descriptions of northern tobacco have been operated in. Tho British and foreign arrivals consist of only one vessel from Val paraiso, and ono from Mauritius. A meeting of the creditors of Mr Morton, of the Criterion Hotel, was hold on Thursday. The estate shows dobts to tho amount of £5700, £3700 of which is secured, littlo or nothing being left for the unse cured creditors. An assignment, wc understand, has been resolved upon. The creditors of Thomas Holme Davis and Co. have also finally decided that that estate should be assigned to trustees for the benefit of all interested. Ale and Stout. — Thero has been no improve ment in tho demand for hulk ale, the present con sumption being most insignificant. We have heard of no sales of English beers under £8, nnd as im porters of the various brands apparently have fixed upon this as the rate below which they will refuse to go without the certainty of effecting a sale, prices assimilnte more, but quotations in the meantime must be looked upon ns almost nominal. Holders of Bass's No. 3, to regain its position with tho trade, offer more freely at £8, at which rate some fow sales have been mado. Allsopp's lias not been quitted nnder £8 2s 6d ; sales of small lots have been made at £8 5s. For Marian's £8 is asked for 50 hlid. lots, and sales have been made at that figure, but more numerous parcels arc disposed of at £8 5s to £8 10s. Joule's is sold in small lots at £8 7s Od. The Colonial Company's and Ind, Coope and Co.'s quotation is £8, while the Carlisle Company's has not been disposed of undor £8 5s. Scotch ales are valued at £7 10s ; Youngcr's having been sold at auctiou at £6. Whitbread's stout realises £7 5s, and Taylor, Walker aud Co.'s £7 7s 6d to £7 10s. Inquiries for bottled alo are limited, the best brands, however, realise full rates, 9s 9d to 10s 3d, Joule's bringing 9s 6d, and the Coloninl Company's a similar figure. Ill-conditioued parcels bring 8s 6d to 9s 3d for ordinary brands. Buttled stout is ratlior inactive, undoubted brands realising previous rates. Henry White and Co.'s, 10s 3d ; Machen's, 10s ; Dunpliy's, 9s 9d to 10s ; Brass, 9s 3d to 9s 6d. At auction, DuDphy's has been sold at 9s to 9s 3d ; Guinness's, 9s 3d, aud Byass' at 9s, but though not stated, we are not disposed to think that the parcels could liavo I been faultless. Bagging. — Corn sacks are not in request ; a few small sales have been made lately at 18s to 19s. Veiy littlo doing in woolpacks, at 4s 6d to 4s 9d. Candles, in the beginning of the week, showed I no sign of improvement-; though at a later period, under the influence of tarifi' changes, several parcels changed hands nt about previous rates. Speculative purchases, however, liavo not been extensive ; about 400 Cramer's sold at 12}d, about 500 Belmonts nt a similur rate. A large parcel of Owens aud Merton, sliglily spotted, 11 }d ; about 1000 boxes Nova stea rine, lljjd, net cash ; at uuction, full weights rea lised Is, and light weight 9}d ; tho latter aro generally held for 9}d.

Portland in trade request at 25s, and American plaster selling at 30s. Coffee is in slow trade sale at 13d for plantation, lid for natives, 10Jd for Java, 10}d for Manilla. As no additional arrivals aro expected at present, importers are firm in their demands. Confectionery is without excitement, a nice snug business being done at unaltered rates ; as sorted at lid. iuiubes at Is. candied neel 12Ad to 13d. Cordaoe. — We have no improvement to report I upon Manilla, assorted realising with difficulty £47 I to £49 ; Europe Manilla, £50. There aro no Cal cutta linos in importers' hands, and dealers ask a considerable advance on rates brought at auction, say £48 ; best seaming twine saleable at 14Ad to 15d. ; Chemicals. — Crystals of soda aro very dull at £8 5s to- £8 10s ; caustic is difficult to quit at £20 to £21 ; soda ash neglected at £10 to £12 ; carbonate is in slow sale at 18s 6d; Hour of sulphur in trade lots realises £22 10s, but a parcel of about 20 tons was placed at £20 ; English sulphuric ncid sells at 6d, and colonial brings 4d to 44a ; tartaric acid, 2s 3d per lb. , Fish. — Littlo or no ling is offering ; herrings realised 27s to 28s for half barrels, and 10s for fir kins, but the demand is small.

There is no Tasinanian offering. Town-made is valued at £13 10s ; Victorian, silk dressed, £14 ; Adelaide, wire dressed, £14; do, silk dressed; £15 ; and Hart's and Magarey's, £15 ius. -ji wncat tnere is not un over abundant supply, we therefore do not alter our quotations of last week, under which wc have heard of no sales, however unwilling buyers may be to give the rates asked. We quote Adelnido 6s Gd to 6s 8d, and Victorian, 5s 7}d to 5s 9d— a parcel of fine feeding having- been disposed of nt 5s 3d. Cape and Californian barley is worth 4s 6d to 4s 9d. Tho Peter Simmons' cargo, which consists of as fine feeding and malting as nny ever imported, realised — for a (portion of the former, equal to 4s 8d ; tho whole of the latter having been sold at 5s lOJd. Maize is offered more freely, a slight reduction hav ing been conceded, 5s 5d to 5s Gd being its present value.

Metals. — But a moderate business has been done in this market. Pig iron is firm, at £3 15s. Cor rugated brings £34 to £35 for 24 and 26 gauge, English brand ; nnd £30 to £32 for Scotch. Sheet loud is scarce, and wanted, and has advanced to £27 10s. Zinc is worth £30 to £31. Picks und shovels are firm, with an upward tendency. Malt.— Many importers prefer storing to selling under 9s, hut we have not heard of bins having been plaoed over 8s fid ; thero have been buyers in the market at less, but holders have firmly refused to submit to any further reduction ; for small lots 9s 3d is asked. Oils.— Linseed is saleable at 5s 6d ; castor realises a like rate. 4s Gd lias been refused for Chinese in the anticipation of a duty being imposed : the articlo, however, is in short supply, and wo see no reason for any reduction from that. Sales of best brands of kerosene has been made at 3s 3d ; Oriental is vnluod at 3s, nnd other brands at 2s 8d, which shows a decline of fully 3d ; colza is offered at 5s Gd, and olive at 6s 2d.

Provisions. — Butter has been on the whole quiet ; during the latter part of the week an improved de mand was experienced, and sales mado at 16d to 16,-jil. Bacon and hams do not arrive at all freoly, they continue to be picked up as they come in at Is -Id to 1b od, while Id more is asked in many instuuees. Fiuo cheese, both, small and largo, readily brings Is 2 Id ; the market is very barely sup plied, even common descriptions being scarce. Quicksilveii reulisosjls lOd to 2s Id for Califor nian and Spanish. Rice has dropped a little, but oven at the redac tion to £22 10s no large soles con l-6 effected. The half of the Pudel's cargo was sold for Sydney ac count ; the remaining portion was offered yesterday, I but- withdrawn. Vory fino- dressed Java is offering at £25. Salt, being ono of the articles selected by tho tariff delegates as deserving the imposition of a duty of £2, attracted somo' attention, nnd more especially us nt tho price ruling it did not realise cost and charges. Several parcels of coarse in consequence changed hands — ono lot nt £3 5s, and a few hundred tons nt £3 10s. We know of £3 12s Gd baring been refused, while additional sales nt £3 15s have been reported. Yesterday and to day, however, an inclination to purchase was evinced, any idea of a duty being imposed baring been dispelled. Fine is not brisk at £5 to £5 5s. Suoah. — This market, which was beginning to give signs of recovering from its depression, wus in the beginning of the week again staggered by the arrival of two cargoes from Mauritius ; but though one of these goes on to Sydney, and the other is to be stored for better prices, dealers have shown no desire to operate. To-day, the nrrival of another cargo is reported. 900 bags, o tiered on Thursday, brought £24 15s for good rations ; £31 to £33 10s for medium to good counters ; low grey crystals, £34 to £35 : this forming the only sale of tlic week. Tea has been a quiet market, the excitement of previous weeks seeming to liavo died out. On Tuesday, tho cargoes ex Kalilauiba and C. F. Lessing were offered at auction.
