DANISH SETTLERS. Replying to a question raised by a "Courier" correspondent, Mr. V. Lar- sen, Honorary Vice-Consul for Denmark, wrote to that journal on the "th in- stant:-"What is thc reason there are so few Danish settlers in Australia (Queensland)?" I may state that among thc many reasons arc-the ter- rible handicap all Danish emigrants are subject to by way of thc expensive journey, the amount of £40, which they must be in possession of on landing, the language difficulties, thc union rules which makes it nearly impossible for a new arrival to obtain work, be he ever so good a tradesman, the strong opposition from the working class to any foreigners (though it must be ad- mitted that Danes aro less objected to than people from any other country), the fact that the Danish farmer likes his little bit of freehold, and that the conditions required of the immigrant coming to Queensland, and the difficul- ties of getting naturalised, and obtain- ing freehold, &c.;, do not attract him. During a trip all over beautiful little Denmark during April, May and June, last year, I was continually asked about the conditions in Queensland, aad thc gist of my reply was invariably: 'Queensland ia a fine country, the best of tho Australian States, with a good climate, unlimited natural resources, room for millions of population, with u great future, hut et present not pre- pared to absorb Danish emigrants, who especially if they have a little money over and above what is required for the long journey, &c;, in my honest opinion will bc better off by staying in Denmark, or by going to countries (like Canada), nearer Denmark, where con- ditions arc more favourable, end from where they can easier return if not found suitable. In my opinion it will take more years than my allotted »pan of life, before tho Government-with all their energy and ability, and with all the assistance they undoubtedly will get from every citizen who loves Queensland-has finished, the Herculean task of cleaning the Augean stable left them by their predecessors, so that Danes and other good men can be ad- vised to settle and make this Une coun- try their future home." \---^^-a--?
