It has long been a very general opinion that without Mr Vogel the Ministry could not survive the attack of an organised Opposition At present the tendency of opinion seems to be that Parliament should be called together about the usual time, and that six months SUDDIIW should be voted, relegating all important legislation to the new Parliament as the period for the general or quinquennial election is close at hand Mr Stafford and Sir GcorgeGreyarespoken of as probable leaders but it is well known that them are certain aspiring politicians of lesser note who will force their way into the van of the Open-air party with an eye to Ministerial honours It is stated that Sir Donald M Lean the Native Minister will be asked by his colleagues to lead the House of Representative during the next cession Sir Donald is now laid up at Hawkesbury but his illness want, of a serious character home question may perhaps be raised during the cession as to Sir J Vogel's actual position in the Ministry he has not been sworn in as a Minister be fore the present Governor Lord Normanby arrived after Sir J Vogel left for!

THE MAILS. The R.M.S.S. Golconda, Captain W. B. Hall, with the mails, passengers, gold, and specie on board, left Hobson's Bay on her outward voyage shortly after 2 o'clock on the afternoon of the 18th ult. The.M S.s. Nubia, Captain George Nelson Hector, with the mails from Europe, India, and China, anchored in Hobson's Bay at half-past 3 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 29th ult. The Torres Straits mail steamer Brisbane, with the mails from China, Manilla, Batavia, and the northern ports of Australia, arrived in the bay here on the morning of the <¡J"i "TIIO Mikado, with the San Francisco, American, and English mails, reached Sydney on Wednesday, the 2nd inst., and the Melbourne portion of the mails was received here on the 7th. STATE OF TRADE. , , Business throughout the month now closed, though steady, has been quiet. and unmarked by anything of much interest or importance. Transactions have generally been confined to supplying actual requirements and have seldom gone beyond Speculators in keep fine oil have again been compelled to strengthen and fortify the market by renewed operations, but, with that exception, "lea have been of very little account, and not likely to cause any excitement The month has passed without any failures of any consequence, and commercial credit IP exceedingly well supported In the grocery, ironmongery, and spirit trades business, Judging from what comes on the surface, appears sound and healthy enough, but the softgoods trade is stii'HuffciiT» very severely through a continuous run of small' insolvencies in town and country in two of 'case estates, in which the creditors or lived at a resolution to wind them up in the Insolvent Court the liabilities, though only in the retail drapery trade, amounted to 6500 and £4 000 respectively It is with much regret however, we notice that the position of affairs in Sydney is not so satisfactory A reference of a similar character was made last month, but after the departure of the mail steamer matters quieted down, and for several weeks afterwards nothing occurred calculated to create any uneasiness until this week, when the suspension of Messrs Church and Hill, in the wine and (grocery trade, was reported. Subsequently it was also officially announced that Messrs Beilby and Scott, extensively engaged in the flour trade, with English liabilities as well, had stopped payment, and likewise that Mr Gustav Unmack had called a meeting of creditors Mr. Benjamin Cocks, a boot and shoe dealer, with half' the amount mg to £9 000, also assigned his estate Humour has, moreover, been very busy With the names of many other firma, and as business relations are now closely maintained between the two colonies, very considerable uneasiness has been created here in consequence, as it is impossible in present circumstances to know how soon or from what quarter a blow may be dealt In our share report of the 9th inst, it was notified that a further rise in the rate of interest on deposits was expected We should much regret to hear of to foolish a step being even entertained, and feel satisfied it could not possibly be concurred in by our banking institutes It cannot benefit in the long run either individuals or the colony at large, and must very much affect the profit of the banks them selves On the former occasion, when a similar policy was adopted through the action of the Bank of New Zealand, a loss of at least Wa a share had to be submitted to by the shareholders of the colonial institutions, and the question arises how far this should be allowed to go as it is clear that whatever on vote reasons may exist, there can be none of a sound and legitimate character to urge the adoption of a policy so injurious to all concerned On analysing the quarterly statements of the banks made up to the close of March last and published in the Government Gazette, a noticeable feature is an increase on the interest paying deposits of £670 000 over the quarter immediately preceding. As compared with the corresponding quarter in the year before, however, the in crease on the same account as £1 352,002 , of this amount, however, £734 733 was drawn or transferred from the non interest paying deposit Bide a result which followed on the rate of interest being raised to 6 per cent Another very noticeable feature is that though the rate of interest paid had thus been advanced without a corresponding rise in the rates of discount, £205 000 had been added to the reserved funds, £43 OCD to landed property and the dividends declared amounted to £48 250 more than in the corresponding quarter of the year previous evidences of prosperity upon which the colony may be well congratulated In the transactions of the month neither bulk nor bottled beers figure to any extent Dundee goods, say cornsacks and woolpacks, have been quite devoid of interest.
