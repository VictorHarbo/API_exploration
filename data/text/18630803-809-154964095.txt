The dulness porvading tho import market now for so long a period during tho past week reached a point which can only be characterised by complete stagnation, country dealers being as loud in their complaints of no business doing as the import houses ; but such aro, however, it must be remem bered, never separate from this season of the year, and, though fortunately avoided last year, on account of tho impetus imparted by the opening of the New Zealand gold-fields, tho reaction is, in consequeneo, fult all tho more at the present time. Bulk alo during the week lias been quiet. Bottled stout not over active. Damaged candles continue to occupy the attention of dealers to tho exclusion of sound. Woolpacks havo been in moro request at full rates. Coffeo is without chauge. Fruits present no ap pearance of activity, but currants are firm. There have been no largo transactions in ilour. Wheat lias been moro dealt in. Damaged oats interfere with the sttlo of sound ones. Maize is better. Blasting powder commands full rates. Malt is un altered. Provisions of all descriptions, rice, sugar, tobacco, and timber are all in a most unsatisfactory position. Tea continues to recoivo some consider able attention. Wines and spirits are comparatively neglected. Tho British and foreign arrivals com prise seven vessels from England, two from New York, ono from Hamburgh, one from Calcutta, ono from Rotterdam, and ono from Frunce. A meeting of the creditors of Messrs Levoson and Smithers was held on Wednesday last, when it wa? decided that the estate, which showed uncovered liabilities to the extent of £7200, and estimated free assets at £1000, should bo placed in tho Insolvent Court. Ale and Stout. — There has beon no improve ment experienced in the demand for bulk ale, which still continues limited to merely supplying trade wants of u very moderate nature. Bass's No. 3 is offered freely at £7, and we have heard of salos at a shado less ; on the other hand, there are some firm holders at more money. Allsopp's can be bought at £7. Sales of 50 hhds, parcels, of Marian's have beon made at £7, 7s Od, aud of smaller lots at £7 10s to £7 12s Od. Joule's is not offered under £8, and .-? ? 11 ? ? a-TVwfA-1 nt fl.i'a lirrnrn sales OI small (juauuuea iuu tjicKiuu Hi, uuo Colonial Company's has been sold at £7 . Carlisle Company's has been disposed of at £7 12s 6d to £7 15s. Scotch ale, Younger's and Fulton's, aro valued at £G 10s. Taylor, Walker and Co.'s stout finds buyers at £7 2s Od to £7 5s ; and Whi thread s at £7 to £7 2s Od. Bottled alo is without alteration. Bass's and Allsopp's selling quietly in small quanti ties at 10s to 10s 3d ; Joule's commanding 9s 6d, and Colonial Company's 9s to 9s 3d ; Scotch having realised 9s Cd. Bottled stout attracts little or no attention. Henry White and Co.'s sells at 10s 3d ; Machen's, 9s Cd to 9s 9d ; Dunpliy's is being pushed off as low as 9s ; Byass's has been sold in ordinary quantities at 9s lid, one largo parcel having changed hands at 9s ; Hibljart's is held for 9s 3d; Edmond's pig brand in stone bottles being sold at lis. Bagging. — Cornsacks remain without tho slightest notice, occasional sales of a few bules taking place at Ids Od to 17s. Woolpacks have lately 1 eon moro brisk, considerable sales of recent arrivals having been made to save storage charges, at 5s J §d to 5s 3d, since which 5s Gd is generally asked. Candles. — This market continues to bo mono polised by sales of damaged, a slight advance on previous sales having been obtained this week. At auction faulty full weights realised lOJd to 10|d ; sound lights bronght to 9d; and faulty, 81,(1 per packet. We quote full weights, in sound condition, Belmonts and other English brands, lljd ; Bran don's, 11 Jd ; Neva Stearine Company, Is. Coals. — There is no improvement on this product sinco our report some time ago. The state of the market may bo inferred from the sale of the Mal colm's cargo of Stetton Company's at 30s. Coffee. — A fair trade demand is experienced in this article at lid per lb for Plantation, 9Jd for Native, and lOd for Java. Chicory. — Taylor's and Barry's command 4d, Wallis aud Drysdalo's offering at 3Jd, sales having been inado even at 3Jd, and at 5d, duty paid. ^u.meutionbry remains uncnangcu at lormer quotations, a satisfactory business being done at lid for assorted, Is for jujubes, and 13Adfor candied pool. Cement. — There havo been no fresh arrivals lately, and business is confined to trade sales at 25s for Portland, and a similar figuro for American plaster. Cordage. — Manilla rope is unaltered at £47 to £19, few sales transpiring ; Calcutta lines, £40; seaming tivino, Is 2d, showing a slight decline. Coir mats have been sold at 3s to 9s each ; coir matting, J, 18£d per yard ; 1 J, 3s per yard.

Chests have realised £175, in bond ; ;E'J !-(), duty paid, being generally asked ; 22s 0.1, iu bond, is quoted for Turkey. Fisii.— Herrings are not quite so firm, for though somo holders refuse to sell under 27a, wo understand sales have been mado nt 20s ; firkins realise 10s. Red herrings bring 34s to 35s per dozen tins. Ling : Wo hear cf none offering. Fruits. — Currants, sinco tho sale about a week ago by auction of 20 tons, at Od to 6£d, very little of any consequonco has transpired ; for small lots OAd is asked, whilo something less would bo taken for a largo parcel. Raisins are easier, Mus catels aro worth Od to 0 Jd, and layers 7Jd. Elcino have been sold at auction at 6,Jd ; Capes, at 7^-1 to 7Jd ; Sultanas aro in good request at 7Jd. Figs bring 6Jd. Flour and Grain.. — The speculative feeling evinced in llour has entirely subsided, sales being confined to supplying immediate wants. . An outside parcel of Hart's has boon sold at £14, and one of Magaroy's at less money. In liko manner any lots thrown on tho market. are cor tain not to bring current rates; holders generally, however, are finn at £14 for ordinary silk dressed. Adeloido town, and £13 10s for country brands ; Hart's and Magarey's are held for £14 10s ; but there tire no sales ut tliia figure. Victorian Moyrie and Moiri Mills sell at £13 to a shade loss. At auction, Adelaide in barrels brought £12 15s, whilo a Binall parcel .ef Hart's old flour sold for £12 17s Od. Sales of Adelaide wheat have been made at 6s ; a very fine parcel ef Victorian realised 5b 9d, and about 7000 bushels Californian changed hands at a price not disclosed. Feeding lots havo been quitted at 4s 9d. Feeding barley is a shade easier, with little demand, 4s 3d being its outside value ; malting is worth 5s 9d to 6s. Ordinary descriptions of oats are difficult to bo placed, tho numerous sales of da'aaged parcels interfering with their ready dis posal. At auction, on Tuesday, 1000 bushels Dutch, all faults, fetched 2s 4d to 3s 3d ; and at tamo time, 3000 bushels German sold for 3s Od. On Thursday, 16,000 bushels, tho cargo of tho Mathilde Deuker,. sold as per bulk, not guaranteed, Drought 3s 6d to 3s 7d, Scotch, in fair condition, are worth 4s Od to- 4s 9d ; Calcutta, 4s Od to 4s lOd ; damaged roalisod 3s. Danish, of fine quality, aro in request, several parcels having been disposed of at 5s 3d. Inferior colonial sell for 5s Od, and fine milling at Gs. Thero lias been a great run of lato upon maize ; prices are very firm, and indicate an udv anco ; wo cannot, however, y ot quoto more than 4s 4d to 4s Gd. Gram, in sound condition, is worth £13 to £13 10s ; damaged sold for £8. Bran realises Is 2d. Colonial oatmeal is selling at £31 ; Scotch, £27. At auction, tho latter hus beon sold at £19, damaged. Colonial pearl barley, £35 ; Scotch, £28. Gunpowder. — Sales of considerable parcels of blasting havo boon made at 7d to 7^d for Iiaimes', at which the market is firm, and likely to advance. Hops are in very slow sale at Is 8d to Is lOd for '62's. A parcol of damaged was quitted at Is Id. Malt. — Holders are more ready sollers now than formerly, at 8s Gd ; but as purchasers keep aloof for tho present, little business has in consequenco boon transacted. In trade lots, 8s 9d to 9s is realised. Metals. — No sales of pig iron have come under our notice. Tho cheap parcels offering lately being off the market, holders expect to realise their price of £3 10s. English corrugated is easier, being ob tainable at £34 for 26 and 28 gauge, Hamilton's and Gospel Oak. Scotch maintains its value ; a parcel of 30 tons sold yesterday realised rates equal to what were got a month, ago, namely, £26 to £32: for 24 to 28 gauge. Sheet lead is valued at £29. Zinc has boon sold at £31. Tin plates are hold at 20 per cent, auvauce. 1110 loiiowmg was soiu at auction : — Black fencing wire, all. faults, £9 15s per ton ; galvuuised corrugated iron, all faults, £30 10s per ton ; broom-heads, lid to 20d each ; banister brushes, 8s 6d to 12s Od per dozen; scrubbing do, 6s 9d to 7s 6d do ; shaker brooms, 5s 9d to Gs 0(1 do; broom handles, 3s 6d per dozen; wliito lead, all faults, £25 per ton ; Fairbanks platform, scales, COO lb, 95s ; and a largo variety of miscellaneous hardware at ruling prices. Oils.— Linseed is firm at Gs Cd, but there is little doing. A parcel of castor, just in, is offering at 5s 6d, small country dealers paying 6s. Kerosene has been without any movoment; Couzzen's and Downer's is offering at 2s lOd to 3s ; Oriental, 2s 8d. Wo hear of no sales of Chinese, which may be valued at 4s Gs. Colza, 5s Gd to 0s. Oilmen's Stores. — The business transacted this week has been small. Pickles have been, quitted at 8s 3d to 9s 3d, according to brand. Joyce's bottled fruits have been sold at 13s to 13s Od for assorted. Currants havo brought 14s. 1-lb jams, slightly spotted, sold for lis Od to 12s for sound. Black pepper was disposed of at 4Jd ; white do, Ggd per lb. Maizenn, 5 j,d. Taylor's cocoa. Is Id.

Provisions havo been in a very unsatisfactory position. During the week sales of butter have been made at 14d, for pacels iu fine condition ; but faulty lots have been quitted at all prices down to 8d per lb. The market evinces no signs of improvement. Arrivals of hams and hue in have of late been heavy, and somo parcels of Coey's have, in consequence, been sold at auction at a largo decline privately; also sales havo been made as low as Is for hams, and 114d for bacon. Sinclair's aro quoted nominally Is 2d, but sales could not be effected at that figure. Cheese is in fair request at Is 0^d for fine Dunlop's, to Is 2d 'for lino North Wilts. Quicksilver. — Californian is in limited demand at Is lOd, and Spanish Is lOd to Is lid. Rice. — At present it is almost impossible to name a price for Patna. Tho sales iu Sydney of tho Oxon bridge's cargo at £1G 15s for about COO tons, and £17 10s to £18 for 150 tons, have iu, a measnro paralysed this market, whilo in addition there are several cargoes just arrived, which must have an effect also. Wo must, therefore, refrain from giving a quotation, Damaged brought £15 10s. Saddlery; &c.;— The following prices wero realised at a clearing sale at tho stores of Messrs M'lienzio and Co., on Wednesday last : — Gents' saddles, £3 to £G 103 ; ladies' side do, £3 10s to £G 10s ; cab harness, £0 7s Gd to £7 7s Od ; light gig, £7 to £9 S.s ; single buggy, £7 5s ; double do, £19 10s to £20 ; double carriage, £10 10s to £15 ; tandem, £10 12s Gd to £20; pony do, singlo, £4 10s; double do, £9 ; doe seat saddles, £4 5s to £4 10s ; and a large assortment of saddlers' ironmongery.

Salt. — Coarse is in a manner nominal, no trans action of any consequence coming under our notice. At about £3 sales could bo made, but even-at that figure there are not many purchasers. Fiuo is valued at £4 15s. SuoAn is a very heavy market, and the two cargoes arrived to-day aro not likely to cause any improve ment. Privately, few transactions havo been re ported, while at auction the only quantity disposed of w'us the residue of tho cargo of tho St. Osborne, from Madras, consisting of 4557 bags vacuum pans, which realised £22 for brown syrup ; £20 15s to £28 10s for middling yollow j £31 5s to^ £31 10s for good yellow i and £30 10s for good The sugar was sold as it stood.

Todacco. — Iu the early part of the week this staple looked very sick, an eviclont desire being evinced by most holders to quit stock at any price. Advices of an improvement in Sydney towards tho end of tho week, however, assisted to make tho market more steady, and good halves have since been sold at 3s 3d to 3s 4Jd. On Monday a large assortment was offered at auction, but only a small portion was disposed of at 2s lOd for halves, and 2s Id for tens. Manilla cheroots brought 58s per 1000 ; Havannah-shaped manillas, 90s, duty paid ; and cheroots, 100s. Timiier is very quiet for deals, which we quote 4Jd to for 9x3. Lumber is coming to hand in extraordinary quantities, and as a consequence de clining in value. No salos havo taken place this week. There aro inst now no less than four cargoes discharging, or ready to unload. Tho North Ame rica and Jano Montgomery are going in to store, tho Fenelon and Game Cock being still in tho Bay. Tlio cargo of cedar ex Ann and Maria was sold on tho Australian Wharf, but the quality being inferior tlio price realised was only 22s. There wero also sold the cedar logs ex Callender, which brought 30s 9d. Wines and Spirits. — Port nnd sherry remain dull aud inanimate, little inclination being shown on the part of dealers to buy freely. Martell's brandy, till now, has been difficult to obtain landed, and lis Gd to lis 9d has been got for immediate de livery. This week, however, sales have been mado at lis 3d for dark. Renault's is worth 10s to 10s Gd for pale and dark ; U.V.P., 10s 3d to 10s Cd ; Otard's, 10s to 10s 3d ; C.V.P., 10s to 10s- Gd ; Clo zean, 10s to 10s 3d ; Leger Freres', 9s Od to 10s for dark and pale ; mediums are difficult ta quit ut 5s Gd to 7s Od. In case, Hennessy's connr.uwts 34s ; sales to arrive of several parcels liavo been made at full rates.

The Times of the 22nd says : — Tho Al(l'nga took back a return freight of lmms and bacon, (English), prices ruling higher in tho Melbourne market than in this.
