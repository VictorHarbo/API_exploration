At the last sitting evidence was taken concerning the boot trade. The Boot- makers Operative Union sent delegates, who complained of the sanitary conditions of many of the workshops and the employment of boys under the school age. It was stated that it is usual to teach boys only one branch of the trade, so that greater profits may be made by their expertness. This division of labour cheapens the cost of production, but is unfair to those who wish to thoroughly learn their craft. In the "sweating" houses or private work rooms, the hours worked are very long, and the health of the operatives also suffers from overcrowding. Of late some truant inspectors have visited the factories, but according to the witnesses, the youngest hands are "run out" of the shops while the inspector is detained in conversation in the front office. It also happened that the employers seemed to know when to expect a call from the health officer.

A statement by Mr M'Eachran that Mr. Strong hail got another mau to say plainly what he bad not the courage nor the lniuihtifss to suy plainly himself, provoked the first scene ; groana and hiasos came from all pints of the thurch, and the moderator threatened to tlear the court-a threat which was subsequently repeated several times, but was totally unheeded 'The* liev S Robin- son moved ti resolution, declaring that the charges were so grave and serious as to re- quire further investigation, and that Mr. Strong bo called upon to give full lind ex- plicit answers to a number of questions, which wore appended. Mr Str >ng a defence was opened by the liev. J Hay, who mot ed a dirert negative. He hold that theie was no harm in the leotuie, nor in the subject, and that nothing would hate been said about it had it been delivered m the Athenteum in- stead of the Scots Chutch But apart lrom that, Mr. Strong had aufhiicntly denied him- self from any responsibility by dis claiming symputhy with the views of the lecturer at tlio time the lecture waa deliteied. Mr. M'l'nclirnn's charges were luscd upon nothing but suppo- sitions '1 he Kev Dr. Macdonald expressed tlie opinion that the Confession of Faith was capable of several interprétations (an admia sion which was commented upon by sub- sequent speakers), and he thought it would be wmer to accept Mr strong's resignation, mid allow the matter of gitlng him a certi- ficate to go to the Gcncia) Assembly. It was pointed out, however, that there was good authority for saying that if the resignation were accepted, Mr. Strong could force the presbytery, in the civil courts, to give him a certificate.
