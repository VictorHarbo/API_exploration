IT TRAVELS FABT. . . GOOD NEWS IN MABYBOUGH TRAVELS NEABLY AS FAST. Have you heard the good news ? Heard neighbours talking' about it ? It means a new baok -br an old one. , _ Not neoessarily old in years, but old ip ' misery. By an old back we mean a bad baok. Bad backs are numerous. Some lame, some weak or aobing. Most back trouble!) come from the kidneys. Doan's Backache Kidney Pills oure them all. They reaoh the oause. They cure urinary troubles. Maryborough people testify to this. Mr. John Pedley, of March Street, this town, says ' I have been a sufferer from backaohe for 'many years (no doubt caused by the kidneys being weak), the pains being right aoross the small of my back right over the kidneys. Sottoetimes after stooping I could hardly get up Btraight the pain was bo bad. On several ;oooaiiops I had to knock off work for a time with it. Whenever I got a cold it seemed to affect my back, and this made the pain worse than ever. I beard of Doan's Backaohs Kidney Pills being good for complaints similar to mine so I obtained some at Smith's Pharmacy. They have done me a lot of good by relieving the pains in my baok.' Beware of imitations. You want the same pills which' cured Mr. Pedley, there fore see that you got Doan's Baokaohe Kidney Pills. Thete is nothing 'jast as good' as this remedy for baokaohe and kidney trouble. - Doan's Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all chemists and storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes for 15s. 8d.), or will be posted on receipt of price by the proprietors, Foster-M'Clellao, Co., care of Elliott Bros., Eagle Street, Brisbane.
