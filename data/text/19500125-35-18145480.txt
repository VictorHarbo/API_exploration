CHARGE BY DANE ? ? Â« 'Gross Slander,' Says Holt CANBERRA, Tuesday. The Minister for Immigration, Mr. H. E. Holt, to-day described os "gross slander" a statement by a Danish journal- ist, Mr. Poul Nielsen, that Australians as a whole disliked foreigners. Mr. Holt, who was comment- ing on a cabled report of a state- ment by Mr. Nielsen, was speak- ing to delegates at the Australian Citizenship Convention. "When Nazism was making itself felt in Germany, no country gave its victims more succour than Australia," he said. "I invite any country to show a record comparable in any de- gree to the numbers of Displaced Persons taken in gladly by Aus- tralia. "We hear of British migrants who go back to their homeland, but records show that of all the migrants who come to Australia only two and a half per cent, re- turn to Britain for permanent residence. "No country has done more in money and material assistance not even the United States-to help the children of Europe than Australia^"_ I
