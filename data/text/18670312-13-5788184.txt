THE barquo Planter No. 1 arrived yesterday of tcr noou from Newcastle, N.S.W., which port she left on, the 1st hist. Captain Lowrie roports having fallen in ?> with light variable winds, and fluo woathor, to Cape ,Llptrap, off which, on Thursday last, a heavy westerly galo was encountered. Tho galo lasted until Triday night, and was accompanied with fierco squalls and a high sea. The barque entered tho Heads on Sunday evening. Tim members of tho Immigration Board mot j-oster day, ou boord the now iron clipper ship Undcrloy, and inspected the Government immigrants, and tho accom- modation provided for them on tho voyage. Ino whole of tho passengers woro cleared, and tho authori- ties expressed themselves highly satisfied with tho caro and supervision exercised by Captain Browno, Dr. Newbold, and Mrs. Graham, and also with tho arrango nienU for the passengers. TUB S.S. Coorong left Adelaide at firop.rn.on the Oth inst., and arrived in Hobson's Bay at half-post six p.m. yesterday. Experienced" light varloblo winds, calms, and fine weather to Capo Otway, and from thence fresh N.E. winds. The s.s. Alexandra left Sydney at five p.m. on Saturday, and cleared the heads at six p.m. ; Cape St. George was passed at half-past two a.m. on Sunday, and Gabo Island passed at quarter-past six p.m. same day; rounded Wilson's Promontory at half-past twelve p.m. on Monday ; passed Cape Schanck at eight p.m. ; entered Port Phillip Heads at half-past nine p.m. ; and arrived at Sandridge soon after mid- night. Passed the s.s. Blackbird at half-past one a.m. on Monday, about seventy-five miles S.W. of Cape Howe. Passed tho s.s. Wonga Wonga at ten minutes past eight p.m., off Cape Schanck. Expe- rienced moderate head winds to Cape Howe, and light variable winds the remainder of the passage, with fine weather throughout. The missionary schooner Day Spring, after a week of excitement up the river, where she has been visited by almost all the Sunday'-school children in and around Melbourne, and where she has been an object of exceeding interest to swanns of eagerly inquisi- tive and intelligent young Australians, was towed down to tho bay yesterday, in order to be slipped, be- fore proceeding to her cruising-ground in the South Seas. Captain Frazer and his officers have been highly praised for their great courtesy and urbanity to visitors. The GippsLand S.N. Company's s.s. Charles Ed- ward was yesterday afternoon taken up on Wright's Patent Slip, to be thoroughly overhauled and re- paired. I POUT MACDONNELL.-Captain Douglas is now busy with the survey of MaoDoimolI Bay. Ho has been IjlostSiig large portions of rook at tho moorings, which will bo put down In such a manner as to obi iatc all cause of complaint in future. It is found that the moorings oro only soven-cighths of a nillo from the shore, instead of nearly two milos, as was generally supposed. A jetty might be run out all tho woy to the moorings, passing over the "Pinchgut," at o reasonable cost.-Border Watch. i PETitomuM AND COAL OIL AS STKAH FOEL.-Tho Shalclia, a steam j-acht, owned bj' Mr. Borff, of Glas- gow, has made two trips to Gravesend and book propelled by steam raised with liquid fuel, without tho uso of an atom of coal. Tho first trip suggested some minor improvements, and tho second hod tho strongest hopes of the most complete success. It is fully anticipated thot as soon as an unimportant mechanical difficulty is dispensed with, tho public will be startled bj- tho full realisation of their expect- ations. A joint-stock company is already In course of fonnation for " taking over " tho patent under which Messrs. Barfl have been experimenting. If tho Inven- tion proves such a complete success as wo have reason to hope, it will cheer the heart of many an oilman whoso tanks and barrels aro running over with dead stock.-Panama Star.
