The Franklin is a fine barque from London, which arrived early on Monday morning, after a fair passage of 112 days. She brings o full cargo: but as her draught is over 17 feet, the tides will not allow her to proceed into harbour till about Friday. Consequently she will probably remain at the Lightship anchorage, where she was brought up by Captain Schwartz, as there were no tirst-class pilots afloat on her arrival. The schooner Kangaroo, hence for Port MacDonnell, put back on Sunday. Inning sprung her foremast when oil' Kangaroo Island. Early on Monday morning a number of men were net to work, the injured mast was removed, and a smaller one, which, formerly belonged to the schooner, substituted. Such expedition was used that she was enabled to proceed on her voyage the same evening. The Gem.— During the evening of Saturday last the schooner Gem, belonging to Melbourne, got on shore at the northern entrance of Simmons's channel, where she was seen from QueenscliiTe on Sunday morning, apparently bumping very hard and the sea making a clean breach over her. She ulti mately bumped over the bank, which could not have had more than three feet of water on it on high tide, but had not proceeded far under canvas when she again grounded on the opposite side of the channel on a two and a half feet bank, and remained thereuntil she was successfully towed on' by the tug-steamer Resolute yesterday, and was brcuiL'litsafe to au anchoron' Queensclille, where she now lies waiting a survey, as she is making water, and the captain thinks some of the rivets must be started.' The agent for the Resolute tug here ob- Herving the dangerous position of the schooner on Sunday, would have immediately sent for the steamer, but the only mode of communication to private individuals in such cases of emergency was of course stopped, being Sunday; but early on Monday morning the Resolute was telegraphed for, and arrived at QucenscHu'c where she took on board Captain Nicholson, of the Government schooner Empire, Mr. Deane, and Mr. Paterson, and immediately proceeded up Simmons's Channel, and got to the stranded vessel just at the top of high water. A warp was soon made fast and the (Jem hauled off. The captain of the Gem attri butes his getting the vessel in this mess to thick weather, not being able to see the upper Light ship; and, being a stranger to an iron vessel, steered the usual course down the kw, and was not aware the compasses were out. He says on Sunday the vessel bumped over o two and a half feet bank, and he would nave then hoisted a signal for a steamer, but that he had no flags on board to hoist. This is another evil that ought to receive the attention of the proper authorities connected with shipping— allowing vessels to proceed to sea without the necessary flaps. Had it blown a gale during Sunday night from the north-east, as it had every appearance of so doing on that day, the vessel must have gone to pieces, and it would be a question whether the boat would have lived over the banks.— Age, June 8. The Burning op the Martaban.— We are glad to hear (says the Bombay Ouzettc), on undoubted authority, that Colonel Kavanagh, the British Governor of Singapore, though at first inclined to doubt whether Captain Semmes, of the Alabama, had not exceeded his commission, and violated the rules of international law, in burning the Mar taban, alias the Texan Star, became satisfied, after a perusal of all the papers in the cose, that the alleged sale of the Texan Star to Btitish owners was incomplete and irregular, and that Captain Seraraes was quite justified in making prize of the ship. It would have been a pity to see the Ala bama imitating the piratical example set by the Federal steamer Vanderbilt on the South African station in forcing a quarrel between his country .and Great Britain. Visitors of the Alabama at Singapore have assured us it is unlikely the Con federate cruiser will come to Bombay. She has done her work in the East by sweeping the Ame rican flag from the seas, and is probably on her way home. WRECK OP THE BRIGANTUfE MARCHIONESS near Taranaki.— We are sorry to have to report that the brigantine Marchioness, 175 tons, lately commanded by Captain Holford, but since he was appointed Harbour-Master here, in charge of the chief officer, Mr. R. Smith, has gone ashore about 25 miles down the coast, and is now a total wreck, the crew effecting a double escape— from the sea and from the Maorics. The Marchioness was at anchor in the roadstead on Monday morning, but about 7 o'clock parted her cable as she was pre paring to slip it. The wind blowing strong from the north at the time and a heavy sea setting in, she very nearly caught on the tail of the reef before she could be got in hand: however, she got safely out beyond the Sugar Loaves, and appeared to have a good offing. During the day the wind shifted, and blew heavily from north and north west, but in the night increased and shifted to the west, and the ship, being light, mode more leeway, we suppose, than was anticipated, and at about half-post 2 a.m.. on Tuesday struck, before any one on board knew they were near land. The anxiety of the crew may easily be imagined, with their snip on the rock? in such a night, the sea constantly breaking over them, and a blinding rain falling; odd to this the great probability, if they ever reached the shore, of being murdered by the natives. The coast thereabouts is very rocky and inhospitable, but, fortunately, where the vessel struck the rocks were not large, and it was fortu nate, too, that it was nearly high water at the time. When the day broke they found they were within a quarter of a mile of the short, and at low water they decided to make an attempt to land. The boat was lowered, and three men getting into it, and taking one end of a warp with them, made for the shore, which they most fortunately.succecded in reaching, and the other Jive then followed. And here, having, as it were, escaped one death, the second danger began. Hight in front of them, at the side of n little stream, there was a Maori pa, and if this had been inhabited their death would have been certain, for they had no arms with them; but it was not, and so they went on, taking all the care they could afterwards to keep out of sight by going along the beach and under the cliffs where practicable, and at lost, after twelve hours' heavy and anxious walking, with nothing to eat, they reached Oakuro, about 10 o'clock p.m., thoroughly worn out, where— after being mistaken for Macries and fired at aa they emerged from the darkness-they were hospitably entertained. On Wednesday they came into town. Mr. R. Cock, coxswain of the surf boats, was one of the number, having been acting as pilot while the vessel was in the roadstead. The 'Uarchioifess was owned prin cipally by Mr. Warwick Weston. of this place, and was insured for £2,000 in the New Zealand Insu rance Company's otHce. The cargo remaining on board consisted of 12} tons of tiour, 131 sacks of wheat, i\ tons pressed hay, and li bags barley. THe vessel when left was lying with a large hole In rts bottom, six feet of water in the hold, and a great part of the stern carried away. We are informed that Mr. Smith, in fording a deep river no doubt the Hangatahua- lost the ship's papers. aud I02, and it was well that none of them lost their lives in it.— Tanmaki Herald, May 21.
