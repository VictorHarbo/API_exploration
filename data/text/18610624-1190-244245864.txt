It would appear, however, that a similar large return was made at tho same time last year, from which it is easy to infer that the causo rests with the banks' forwarding all the accumulations of gold preparatory to tho half-yearly balance. Wo have to notice tho receipt by hand of a largo parcel of gold — GOO or 700 ounces — from Gaff- noy's Creek, which place is now attracting some attention. Judging from the charactor of tho gold, it may bo prosumod tliut some rich quarlz roofs may soon bo discovered, there. Tho prices given in town are ns follow : — Oineo, Shady Crook, Upper Yarra L3 93 to L3 lis. Some samples from, tho Yarra, worth L3 lis to L3 14s.

Sotno shareholders in tho Hob- son's Bay Railway Company aro of opinion that tho whole three companies, tho Suburban, St. Kilda and Brighton, and tho Hobson's Bay Railway Company should join. Tho plan seems feasible,1 and lm3 iniluontial supportors.

Stock and Shake Market. — The transac tions for the week' have been almost exclusively limited to dividend stocks. Of these, bank shares have been most in request, insurance and gas ranking about second. But although numerous parcels of Colonial and National Bank stock have changed hands, the gross amount has been far from heavy. Towards the close of the week, the former shares mani fested a decided tendency to recede, and to-dav the retrograde movement was more than ever perceptible, the market closing he ivy, with LG buyers, and LO -is Gi sellers. Particular reasons are assigned for this adverse feeling, but for the present rumour appears to be the only basis. National Bank have been done in the course of the week at L3 7s Gd, and although there were no operations in this Etock to-day, the market, was firm.and .holders confident that their terms ? ill be accepted. In railway shares the only transactions have been for Hobson's Buy, which have changed hands at L42 10s. There ha3 been some inquiry for Collingwood and 1-'itzroy Gas, but to no very great extent, sel lers being very cautious in doing business at present quotations. Melbourne Gas is tem porarily out of favour, and we have not heard of any sale for several days. In mining shares there is no movement of any importance to record, and the sales of the last two dnys of the week are represented by one transaction in El Dorado shares at Gd. The Stock Exchango lists exhibit the following transactions since the 15th: — Monday: Colonial Bank, LG 5s; National Bunk, L3 Gs Gd; A' ictoria, 3o3 ; Melbourne Guaranty Company, -Is ; Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway, L 12 10s.

It was hoped that holiday attractions would have infused some animation into trade operations, hut although a largo number of country store keepers have been in town wo cannot learn that their visit has redounded to the interest of holders of goods. At present the market for soft goods appears to the best condition, a somewhat Btoady inquiry for plain Manchester and Scotch fabrics having set in. The market for flour, grain, and horse feed, is only mode" rately firm ; for oats, however, there is a good demand, Scotch having been sold at 3b 9d and 3s lOd, and Danish at about the same figure. Adeluido flour may be quoted L18' for Hart's and Magarey's,- and from L1G to L17 10a for other marks. With the exception of Geneva there is no improvement to report in the spirit market. Brandy is extremely dull of Bale, best Marfell's dark still fetches from 10s' 3d to 10s Gd. Tho market for beers both in bulk and in gloss is unchanged. Candles have recently manifested a tendency to decline m consequence of several outside lots having been thrown upon tho market nt one time,- 17d muy, how ever, he cited for Belmont full weight. The Nova Company continue to quote their slcarine at 17id, and composite from lid to Is. There is no improvement in butter, which is still heavily hold at nearly former priceB, good quality say lOd, and best lOJ-d. Coffee is steady with oniy a moderate demand. Tho market for' sugar is very bare. The Sandridge Com pany liavo modified their rates. Yellow may ho quoted at L44 10s, and second counter at L42.
