On Wednesday, January 21, news reached Perth that a terrible murder had been committed at Roebourne, a few days before. The bodies of Mr. T. Anketell, the manager of the local branch of the Union Bank, and Mr. H. Um up, the clerk in the same bunk, were found murdered, evidently by tomahawks. Mr. Anketell's body was found in the verandah of the bank, and Mr. Hurrup's in bed in the same building. No robbery had been committed except that of the keys of the chest, which had been taken from the manager's pocket. The murder is believed to be the work of white men. The tracks of new" men live final, rliarnvorpfl at the scene of the murder.
