Messrs Green, the ownors of the Black wall Lino of Packets, having formed the intention of carrying out a more complete and effective passenger service between London and Hobson's Bay than any which has been hitherto attempted, have recently made several impor tant additions to their Australian fleet, amongst which may be enumerated the magnificent liners Monarch, Result, Prince of Wales, Newcastle, &c.;, &c.; The PRINCE OF WALES is acknowledged by competent judges to be one of the finest merchantmen ever launched, and for beauty of mould and strength of build, is unsurpassed even by the first-class frigates of the Royal Navy, to which she bears a close renem- I blanoe. I Like the Monarch, the PRINCE OF WALES is pierced for fifty guns, and having a flush deck, a de lightful promenad« is provided for all classes of pas sengers. The chief cabins are romarkablo for their unusual I height between decks, and are admirably adapted to I suit the convenience of families. In the second class the accommodations are so far superior to those afforded by ordinary vessels in the trade, that they are considered equal to the general 1 average of first class berths. Stewards' attendance is ' furnished in this department. I - The PRINCE OF WALES having been expressly ! built with large ports, fore and aft, there is a com- ! plete sy-tem of yeLtilution throughout tho ship. 1 Passengers in the Tiiiud Clads will be supplied with a liberal variety of the best provisions, and will I find, cn inspection, that the cabins set apart for their ; use are lofty, commodious and judiciously fi'.ted up.
