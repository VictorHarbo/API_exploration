Gentlemen, Yours, obediently, ? JOHN CROZD3R. To George Green, Esq., John Hbdg Iriss, Esq., and the other Gentle ', men signing the BequiBition. TO THE ELECTORS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. Gentlemen — Having been requested to come forward and offer myself as a Candidate for one of the -vacancies of the Legislative Council at : the forthcoming V3tv^Snn»^ {£ jg necessary, as I am not known to many of the Electors, for me to introduce myself, and to place before you my opinions, and the measures I would support which are likdy to come before the Legislative CounciL X have oeen in tike colonies for twenty- eight years. Alfhmgh residing in New South Wales and Victoria as a squatter, I have for the last seventeen years done business here, and have now come to reside in this colony for the purpose of rpwqiwig and educating my family ^ and *™ in no way connected with trade or business to infliwnw. me from giving my support to any measure Oat -would be for the benefit of afi fpltuufpsi and the advancement of tiie country. T/anA Systems. — Desirous of encouraging bona fide settlement, I would carefully consider any plan that could be devised to render agri culture more remunerative, aad to enable this colony to compete with the liberal land systems of New South Wales and Victoria. ' ^fjyiTtiy. — I consider that to encourage the de velopment of our mineral resources more liberal regulations are ' necessary. That measures : should be devised to protect Die actual dis coverer in the enjoyment of bis rights, and that a small royalty might be preferable to rent. Squatting.— I am in favor of adassincation of runs, and liberal terms in the dry coun try. In favor of die principle of an assessment at per head actually depastured, the rate vary ing according to the value of the run. Railways. — The great want of the country is improved means of intercommunication, and cheaper camageforitsproduoe. Whilst«upport ing liberal outlay on ordinary roads I would sup ?port railway extension on a cheap scale ; also a system of tamways for horse traction. Am in favor of guaranteeing private capitalistBin the 4XBcution of reproductive works. 1 The Tariff.-^ I believe that taxes should inter fere as little as possible with trade; I am opposed to the imposition of protective duties, as these increase the cost of growing, and enhance the charges upon raising produce, thereby disabling our miners, and fanners, and otihers from competing in tile markets of the world ; but I should not object to admit, free of duty, such raw material as can be worked lip mto manufactured axlisles in the colony, and would favor a bonus to any positively new industry beneficial to the colony. | Insolvent and other Laws.— I consider they jnaed amendment so as more effectually to pro tect the public 'ci™* reckless extravagance and fraud, and at the same time better to secure the honest but really unfortunate debtor. I also consider that a revision and sunpKnca Itionof many of Qie laws would be beneficial, as jfrom t&eir; intricate and complex forms they as often create a crime as prevent it Education. — I am in favor of Government aid to Education, if wholly unsectarian; would sup port the extension of Education to the out ying districts, and generally to assist the estab lishing of schools in thinly-peopled localities. ? Constitution Act. — I tan in favor of nmftnd'ng it in several particulars, such as making the office ttf Attorney- General not necessarily political ; ireventmg Government dmljiwtoffl getting into 'arliament^ giving the Government power, as n Victoria, to remove a Judge on the address of both Houses. Immigration.— At present none is needed, but I should favor intxoducing suitable labor when (wanted.' I Public Expenditure.— I am opposed tothe mul tiplication of offices, and would advocate strict ?economy in the Government departments ; sup kmtibg the appropriation of a larger share of the public revenue to opening up the country dis itricts, and for the convenience of country set tlers generally. - ? I Ttit^wnlftnin.1 Affajm, — lam in favor of fede istion, or mutual agreement for certain definite objects, such as the free interchange of colonial jroduce, co- operation 'in schemes of coast 'de fences/postal and telegraph arrangements. On all the -various questions that may from time to time arise, and which I have not touched kmon, my best endeavors will be put forth to advance the interests of my fellow-colonists, without respect to class or party, should X be returned.

Uentlemen— I have much pleasure in acced ing to your request that lahould allow myself to be nominated for . the Legislative OouneQ, and if returned wffl do ssy best to forward the interests of the colony at large. As my political views fnay not be widely mown, I feel it my duty to dance at the most important iwlitieal matters of tte day. ? I consider that immediate action snouU be taken in reference to the Immigration Act and Outage ampins fund mew lying almost idle. Election Notices. which I should endeavor to expend in public reproductive works, which would give employ ment and relief to hundreds of starring families now in the colony. I think the time has arrived for the revision of the Tariff, as the duties now fall heavily on the laboring and farming classes. I am in favor of. free distillation by erecting good public stills (under efficient nny»»g+Tm»nt in the centres of winegrowing localities, so that any gardener could take bis produce and have.it converted into a marketable article that would be saleable in any part of the world. This could be done at about one-fifth the ex pense ef working by the present Distillation Act, which seems to me «imil«i- to proposing that every farmer should have his own. mill, to waste bis time aad spoil his grain, as many winegrowers now do their tune and prodnce. I would advocate the development of the oouatry by a system of cheap tramways, where trade and she natural tesouroas of the oolony warrant such outlay. I would also support a MMnstrnction of the land regulations, so as to enable the 1-pHm*** farmer to secure tile land he requires for culti vation direct from the Government on reason able terms. I am of opinion that the Parliament oan, with advantage to the colony, adopt such measures as wffl alleviate the squatters, who have «o greatly suffered by the drought, and am in favor of an assessment on the stock depastured rather than a fixed rental. These seem to me the most prominent matters now before the public, but I should be prepared to give every matter due considera tion and earnest thought for the welfare of the oniony. I am, Gentleman, Yours faithfully, WILLIAM BOUNSEVELL. To Hon. Thos. English, M.L.O., Hon. C. G. Everard, M.L.C., W. Everard, Esq., M.P., J. B. Neales.

We, the undersigned electors of the province, beg to request that you will allow yourself to be nominated as a candidate for the Legislative Council, feeling assured that from your long experience and knowledge of what tends to onr best interests, you would ably represent the oolony in that important branch of the Legisla ture; and we pledge ouuerves to use our best exertions to secure your return : — [Here follow the signatures.] Adelaide, July 18, 1867. Gentlemen— I have much pleasure in acced ing to your request that I should allow myself to be nominated for one of the vacant seats in the Legislative Council. In accepting this invi tation I desire to express my sense of tile re sponsibility that devolves on members of the Upper House to conserve Us constitutional privileges. As members of the LeguJativB Council an elected for a lengthened period, more depends on their general character than on an expression of opinion en the leading topics of the day. especially considering, the rapid changes in colonial life. I shall therefore only very briefly refer to a few of the prominent questions now before die public. I am in favor of borrowing Englishcapital to a reasonable amount, to be expended injreproduc tive works and workB calculated to open up the respurots of the colony. I deeply regret the temporary distress which prevails 'amongst the working classes at the present time, but I trust that the dsrit cloud which for some months has hung over the colony will speedily pass away and better times will dawn for all classes in the community. The trade with the Biverina districts requires thejeareful consideration of the Legislature, and any measure tending to develop that trade and remove obstructions from this important branch of its progress will have my earnest sapport. I shall oppose any impost orrestriction calcu lated to fetter or embarrass tile development of the resources of our pastoral, mttiami^ or agricultural interests. I am. Gentlemen, vnnra fnii-hfnihr W. MORGAN. To the!Hon. Thos. English, the Hon. A. Blyth, the Hon. J. T.
