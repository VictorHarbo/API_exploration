The Diederich Pestzdt is a tine brig under the Hamburg flag, and from the general appearance of the vessel she would doubtless have mode a much quicker passage, but for the death of her original commander. Captain Vosz. He was a very cor pulent man of about thirty-seven years of age, and m November wa3 taken ill and died in the course of a day or two after the first attack. The CoSGOU is a handsome Danish barque, which arrived on Sunday morning from Melbourne, bringing later papers then previously received. She has on board portion of cargo for Hongkong, including a valuable racehorse (Souter Johnny), and will fill up in Adelaide for China. During the last severe gales she had a narrow escape from becoming a wreck at Port Phillip Heads; nut the coolness of the master prevented that catastrophe, though she suffered such damage by losing her windlass and straining in a heavj seaway, that in consequence a thorough overhaul and repair has rendered her equal to any vessel afloat for the carriage of cereals.
