Celebrate Manjimup Birthday C.W.A. Greetings were received from Bridgetown, Pemberton, Nyamup, Northcliffe, Jardee, Deanmill and Yanmah, and representatives from most of those branches were present last Wednesday when the Manjimup Branch of the Country Women's Association celebrated its eighteenth birthday anniversary. In the chair was Mrs. A. McKay, foundation president of the . Branch and recently re-elected to the presidency after a "rest" from the position. Mrs. McKay welcomed the visitors who included the SW Divisional President, Mrs. Buchanan. After expressing pleasure at the opportunity of being present on> an occasion so happy. Mrs. Buchanan, spoke of the great work beingdone by the CWA. There were 8,000 members in WA, she said, and new branches were being formed all the time. The CWA was a world-wide organisation, with twenty-nine countries participating, and every three years representatives of those countries met together to forge a link in world fellowship. In Western Australia, there were seven Divisions, but this arrangement was proving inadequate, and it was likely that the next Conference would bring a change, possibly by the creation of Divisions. more A great bond in the CWA was the exchange of views on a friendly basis. With the arrival in Australia of a large 'number of DP S and immigrants, the CWA had unrivalled opportunities to extend the hand of friendship, and it was hoped that these opportunities would not be lost. Recently a Danish girl had been made welcome at Northcliffe, and a Dutch woman at Burekup. Appealing for clothes for th children of Europe and England, Mrs. Buchanan said that Mrs. Hudson, of Bunbury, was collecting- clothes for children of up to 1 five years, and would welcome gifts. The scope of activities within the CWA was a wide one, Mrs. Buchanan continued. Handicrafts, basket-making, leather work, glove and slipper making could all b taught, and instructors would be sent from South-West Headquarters on request. In conclusion, Mrs. Buchanan again expressed pleasure in being present and hoped that all would have a happy time.
