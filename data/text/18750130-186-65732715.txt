A TELECBili announces the death of the Emperor of China. The following pTfa^rf from the ' Statesman's Year-book' gives some information respecting the deceased sovereign : — ' Bagmag Btrnpomr.— Toong chfi, formerly called Ki- tBiaJig, 'High Prosperity,' bom April 21, 1S56, the eldest son of the Emperor HiCTrftiT.jT 'Perfect Bliss;' succeeded to the throne at the death of his rather, August 22, 186L The present sovereign is the eighth Emperor of Cfama of the Tartar dynasty of Ta-tsmg, 'The Sublimely Pure,' which suc ceeded the native dynasty of Ming in the year 1644\. There exists no law of hereditary suc cession to the throne, but it is left to each sovereign to appoint his successor from among the members of his family. Th«* labs Em peror, on designating bis son, a minor, as his successor, ordered that he should be kep]^ till the time of his majority, under the guardian ship of eight high officials, who were to carry on the government in his name. But in con sequence of a palace revolution, occurring soon after Ute aramnnn of tix young ruler, November 2, 1861, three out of the eight appointed imperial guardian* were kuTed, and the rest harmhrf, while the supreme power was taken possession of by two of the wives of the deceased sovereiga, Tzi-an, ihe 'first consort,' and Tzi-ssi, On mother of the new Emperor.

OPERAnoire onthiafipld (says the Northern JinoadxJ are being carried on briskly and with vigour. The decline of one or two lines of reef has not served to cast a damper upon the general workings of our quarts cUums. It would seem as If the falling off in one place gives rise to '»'***«r The engine 'hung up' for a time at the Qneenslander Lease, having passed into other hands during the week, will be-placed on the Caledonia, and active operations commenced on that line at once. As this reef turned out some of the richest crushings on our field, above the water level, there are «»™J1ppt grounds for believing that the precious metal continues downwards. At any rate it will be tried, and Mr. Hishon deserves credit for his puck in the attempt. For a length of tune past, the necessity for a pumping engine became fully apparent in the reef noticed, and no easier or cheaper means could possibly have presented itself than was offered by Hie Qaeenslander Company's plant being placed in the market. Around the Towers, the reefs continue steadily at work, and beyond the find of a rich ™^nAi* leader being cut in the Bambow Compmy's claim, we have not heard of anything new being struck during the week. The muls show constant work, and the crnsnii^s are, as a whole, satis factory. It bnotiaable that the last ernshing taken from tiie Great Pacific although not a large one, has yielded handsomely, and when the body of stone presented therein be taken into account, the result (21 czs. to the ton), must be encouraging to the holdera— the previous crushings seldom taming lSdwte. In fact, the Ai»™-a~ and adjacent lmm Washington, Pacific, fa., are, by their present appearances, about *^Ttnfng up bumps. More machinery is required an the field at the present time, as tnmf^nm yielding stone has not a fair chance. It is a well-known fact that there are reefs after reefs which would be payable elsewhere (on account of the cheapness of crushing) which, in the present state of Bftues mustlie idle.

Ak accident of the most painful and heart .rending description happened to a girl and about thirteen years, named Mary Ann Lee, on Friday afternoon, between 3 ana 4 o'clock, at her father's place at the back of the Orange pound. It appears from what we(IFetCen- JEkubukt) can gather of the occurrence, that the girl was washing outside the house, when and suddenly began to blaze.

The poor unfortunate was conveyed to SB obtained, and every effort posmle to alleviate her agony was made, but the unfortunate girl expired between 7 and 8 o'clock on Friday evening. 'How the Governors were received at Gkndg,' is thus related by the So*tl Ami tra&m; Btgaltr of Saturday :— 'The smoke of tie ELM. steamer Peta was first Been from Glenelgon Friday morning at about 9 o'clock, and the mails were landed soon after half past 10. A large number of passengers came ashore in the steam-tender Fairy, and spent an hoaror two in Adelaide. Mr. F. A-Wdo, Governor of *r'— ™';- . Mr. W. W. Cairns, Governor of Queensland; and Sir William F. StaweO, Chief Justice of Victoria, who wm on board, landed with Captain Metheven in his gig. Although the Dkme and Enter- ,„ prise, both Government vessels, were lying at anchor in the bay, neither offered to con vey the visitors to the shore. Theybadstesm up, but were under orders from the Presi dent of the Marine Board to await his arrival, which took place about noon. Upon their Excdkndes landing on the jetty no person was officially in attn-miince to receive them. Sir John Morphett introduced himself, and directed the visitors to Govenrment- cottage, where they repaired, again to find, however, no one to welcome them. The party re turned, borrowed chairs from the tdegranh master's, sat under the verandah of the post office for half ?an-hour, walked across to Gar nick's Jetty Hotel for refreshments, and then sauntered through the township. By this time Captain Fergusson and the aide de-camp arrived, and it was rumoured that His Excellency Mr. Musgrave was coming from the. city in his carriage by road to meet his fellow Governors, but he had not reached Glenelg when the Dione was sot under way and re-embarked the distin guished party, The captain of the Pera came back from Adelaide by a special train at noon, and at once went on board in bis own gtg, which was waiting at the steps. After this the Fairy took off one load of passengers, and the ocean packet sailed at two o'clock. Seven persons were left behind, although they chartered two boats which chased the Pera. This dosed the day's misfortunes. Great indignation was expressed at the bungling which had been so prominent a feature in the proceedings.' Commenting npon the affair, the Eegiiter says :— ' ilea speak of it as if they were personally aggrieved, as if then own sense of propriety had been outiaged, as if a discourtesy had been offered to them selves. And in our judgment they are right. We^re quite wulingto suppose that this niykw-fc was not intentional on the part of the gentle man whose duty it is, m our judgment, to repre sent the hospitality of South Australia on such occasions. But the recent experience of the same kind should have prevented any danger of mistake or official bungung in the present instance. We believe that Sir George Bowen a week ago waited on board the steamer for some time expecting to receive an invitation to land, which never came, and it is surely not too much to expect that when visitors of his rank are looked for, the aiie-de- ♦ camp or some other official empowered to re- ^ present His Excellency the Governor should be on the spot to bear an invitation onboard, and see to the contort of such gueote in their landing, and in their conveyance to the city We feel bound in the interests of that reputa tion for hospitality which South Australia bas so fairly earned to record our protest against the unfavourable light in which the the na'e visit.'

Tdegram, January as. Jusr now (says tte Empire) tte city and suburbs of Sydney are suffering to an alarm ing extent from tte spread of a pestilence of an epidemic character ; aad to such a, degree has it been aggravated by tte defective sewerage and tte want of water, ttat tte mortality, at least so iar as the city itself is cancemed, may be expected to reach ttis month a higher average than ever before. Measles are tte form & which the pestilence has visited us ; and ttey have, in many cases, appeared in tte compound £otm of measles sod «u-uJ*i.»i. Tnatg*wpiT are numerous where mA*Hr,* has supervened one or two days after tte disappearance of the measles ; and in ttese cases tte result has been very disastrous to life, as well among the ^ni* as f^nmp tte ™ffcyrfalo uortaon xS. tte population. The spread of scarlaiina is set down as a consequence mainly of the slaughter of slock wittm the city, which, A»«pa»» tte watchfulness of tiie authorities, has been carried on for some time, and tte serious nature of the dhfws is assigned, as stated shove, to defective sewerage and an maffiAmt supply of water. The locality of SuBBex-sbeet south, where some of tte houses have for the last seven weeks been wittout water during tiie day, and where tte dnhiB have for some time past bees in a disgraceful state-is described as tte cause of aQ those senoavcases of the epidemic which as ravaging tte immediate neighbourhood, and spreading ttratudLthe city. The accounts furnished as ff ffop ^mJTla«n fJt p^jjA^ra rf f amifipft affrft'^ are really astounding, and appear more like a description of tte ravages of a plague. In several places whole famflifB have been 'ptfa-^fJ by tte disease, and tte individuals rendered entirely incapable of helping one another; and there have been instances where J^a4-» has +»*'?' pl««^» muW q™'^** 42rcum stances.' He. fiosKsr Caldwelx* writing to the MJlwiimid Age, gives tte following glowing description of ttat mneh-abnsed region, 'The Northern Territory :' — ' The resources and natural advantages of tte place m truely wonderful, and ssless sS the go and pluck of tte colonising races are frhir'*''*, tte Terri tory Trill soon become one of tte largest and most important colonies.

The prosperous colonies of to-day bad no known gold or cop per to start with, as tte Kortbem Territory has to help it in its early straggles ; they re lied entirely on tinar pastoral lands, and ttat, too, wittout any appanmt market for then beef and mutton.

The island trade in coffee, rice, sago, spices, pepper, and timber, is now done by native proas or Chinese jonl-a, wiii Macassar, Singapore, or Bafavia, all free ports; but now that Fahnerstonistobea free port, there remains no reason why ttis important trade should not be diverted by tte superior energy of our race aad tte near proximity of tte Territory.
