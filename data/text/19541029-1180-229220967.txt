SHIP AS BOYS' PRISON MELBOURNE, Fri day. — Two boy - stow a ways, aged 11 and 18, may never be allowed to leave the Danish freighter Korea, now in Melbourne. The boys swam out to the ship in Aden to get food. Tire dfrom the swim, they fell asleep and did not wake until after sail ing. They have no papers, and immigration auth orities will not let them land here. Ships officers say Aden may also refuse to let the pair land, as, without papers, there will be no record of them there. Clothes gifts The elder lad refuses to work and is locked up at all ports, because the ship ping company is liable to a fine if he escapes. But smyll, black-eyed Kaed Mohammed is given comparative freedom. The pair are wearing clothes given by passen gers and crew, plus some bought from a wharfies' £7 collection.
