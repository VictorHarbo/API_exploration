Previously announced to take place at Scott's Hotel, we deem It advisable to make provision for as much seating accommodation as possible, and with that object In view have arranged to conduct tbo SALE at the WOOL EXCHANGE, No. 495 COLLINS-STREET (Next door to tho Rialto). The HOUR of SALE will bo 2.30 p.m. SHARP. EDWARD TRENOHARD and Co. And PATTERSON and SONS (Auctioneers in Conjunction), HIS DAY (THURSDAY), 31st MAY. ?t Half-past 2 o'Clock. At the WOOL EXCHANGE, No. 495 COLLINS-STREET, MELBOURNE, Next Door to " Tho Itialto." EDWARD TRENOHARD and CoA trn Mni„n And I iIn PATTERSON and SONS J tl0n' Have received instructions from the Hon. Sir W. J. Clarke to aoll by auction, as above, the GREEN HILLS ESTATE, Near KOMSEY, In the LANOEFIELD DISTRICT, Comprising 9933 ACRES 0 ROODS 2 PERCHES, Subdivided into 44 Grazing, Dairying and Agricultural Areas, varying in Size from 32 ACRES to 906 ACRES. This magnificent property is situated between LANCE- FIELD JUNCTION and LANOEFIELD, and within about 30 miles of the city of Melbourne by rail. In addition to having extensive frontages to the Deep Creek, most of. tbe land is watered by priogs, and the contour of the country affords excep tional facilities for storing water by the formation of dams. The farms are all witbin a distance of from half a mile to three miles and a half of railway stations, and close to the Rouxsey Cheese aod Butter Factory and Creamery, while the subdivision linos have been so placed as to causo tbe minimum expense in fencing, and each farm will have a good road frontage. Tbo estate abounds to most beautiful scenery, and possesses sites for country homes within less dis tance of Melbourne than Mount Mocedon, and has the advantage of being far superior land, at the same time enjoying the salubrious climate of that district. For dairying, grazing and agricultural purponee it can not be excelled in Victoria; the rich pasturage and regular rainfall, in coujunction with its proximity to the railway and creamery, aro features that are very rarely obtained. If proof were required ae to the grazing capabilities of this estate, wc need only refer to the high prices that the sheep aud cattle from Sir William's properties always realise, and to the fact that they invariably top tho market. TERMS— One-fourth cash, balance at 6, 9 and 12 months, bearing interest at the rato of 5 per cent, per annum.
