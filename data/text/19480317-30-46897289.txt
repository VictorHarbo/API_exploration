MIGRANT FIELD Aiding More Aflied Ex-Servicemen CANBERRA, March 16: Dutch, Belgian, French, Nor wegian and Danish nationals who fought in World War II and their dependants will be en titled to assisted passages as migrants to Australia under a scheme approved today by the Federal Cabinet. The Minister for Immigration (Mr. Calwell) said tonight that immediate action to attract these Allied ex-servicemen to Australia was essential as otherwise they would find other avenues for their resettlement. He explained that the scheme was an extension of the plan operating since last year under which British and United States ex-service migrants were pro vided with assisted passages. Close security screenings would be made to ensure that only ex-servicemen suitable for settlement in Australia would be selected.
