MONTE TO FIND TWO HUSBANDS. Much amusement was caused at the immunigration station at Ellis Island, U.S.A., by the urgent petition of two pretty blue- eyed Danish girls, Alllld An derson and Ingeborg Jansen, of Copen hagen, for permission to depart immenli-; ately for Winona (Minnesota). They are the cheerful victims of an eccentric will made by their grandfather, who be queathed them each a half-share of 600 acres of farm lands on the condition that they marry within 30 days of their ar. rival in New York. By the terms of the will, which .the two fair cousins explained to an inteilpreter, title to the lands will not be finally vested with either of them until they become mothers. If at the end of five years one of the cousins has a child and the other has not, the mother less one will lose half her land to the other. If neither has children at the end of five years the entire property is to revert to a male cousin in Denmark. BIoth girls departed for fMinnesota, con fidently declaring in broken English that they would find good husbands within the stipulated term.
