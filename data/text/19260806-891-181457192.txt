"NATION INSULTED" ITALIAN FARMERS INCENSED. MACKAT, July 2?; A meeting of farmers of Italian na-. tionality was held in Mackay to con sider the refusal of mill employees to crush cane grown by Italian farmers. Resolutions were adopted setting: out 'That the action taken by sugar mill workers supported by officials of the A-W.U. is apparently an effort to de prive Italians of the rights of citizen ship. at the. same time damaging their property and depriving them of a live lihood." The resolution also stated that as the sugar mill workers were crushing cane supplied by Germans, Spaniards. Russians, French, Swiss.' Japanese. Chinese, and men of other nationalities they were of the opinion that the Ital ian nationality had been subjected to humiliation and inhuman insults which were both unjust and unfair, as in the Great War Italians fought and died for the cause of Britain and her Allies. They were much more entitled, they declared, to the respect and consideration* of the British people than those who fought them. Italy was recognised as a first-class nation throughout the world, and when; the American scheme of Immi gration was adopted in 1922 they re stricted the people of German. French. English, Australian, Danish. Swiss, Russian. Spanish, and all other nationalities of .Europe, but 'a certain number of Italian people were allowed to enter, and were treated ith full respect. - '' It was resolved to forward copies of the resolutions to the Common wealth and.. State. Governments, the Italian Consul, and Messrs. W. Fdrgan Smith (Minister for Agriculture), E. B. Swayne, M.L.A.. and Dr. L. W. Xott, M.P., requesting immediate ac tion; also to the British Prime Min ister, and the Italian Prime Min ister. and to ask the Italian Consul General to proceed to Mackay im mediately.
