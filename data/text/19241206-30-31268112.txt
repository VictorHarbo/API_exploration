L. W. HARTRICK, L. W. HARTRICK, L. W. HARTBIOK. USED CAR SALESMAN. USED CAR SALESMAN. USED CAR SALESMAN. There are many reasons why yon. should come to me to Buy a USED CAR. In the first place, I sell on COMMISSION ONLY. Secondly, I DO NOT OWN any Used Car that I have for sale, and I am therefore in a position to give AN UNBIASSED OPINION On any that I have for Sale. Thirdly, the value of any Used Car is determined by the PUBLIC DEMAND, and all Used Cars have a definite market value according to tho manufacturer's name, age, mechanical condition, and appearance. Many inexperienced buyers pay TWICE the MARKET VALUE for a Used Car, and it ,is therefore to the advantage of all Buyers, whether experienced or vnot, ^to select their Used Car from a Salesman who has the handling of. Used Cars, and' therefore knows the true MARKET VALUE Fourthly, the VALUE placed by myself on all Used Motor Vehicles coming to me for Sale is determined by the general con dition of the Car, the make, and model, based on tny long experience of the market's demand. I will only accept Cars for Sale where the owners are prepared to sell at a price that I can CONSCIENTIOUSLY ask of a Buyer, and one which is eqnitable to both Vendor and Purchaser. I will aot oiler you Used Cars above their true market value, because I cannot afford to endanger the GOOD KEPUTATION I have already made in Western Australia. I endeavour to give a fair deal to both Vendor and Purchaser, without fear or favour. My Sale Booms are open to. 10 o'clock each evening for inspection. Cars will be demonstrated to intending purchasers be tween 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily. L. W. HARTRICK. Motor Salesman, TIVOLI GARAGE, Hay-st. and St. George's-terrae*. A JU4,— MOTOK BODT BUILDING.
