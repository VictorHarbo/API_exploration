The wonderful and realistic delineation of the sad effects of drink so al ly portrayed by Mr. CHARLES WIRKER in his impersonation of the character of COUPE AU once more causes us to think of the sad effectB of drink and all its concomitants. It is a rarity very seldom met with in the higher walks of life, although drinking to excess is indulged in by all classes of society, but with vastly differentresulti, according to the pecuniary position of the parties so. offending, which we will endeavour to classify thus —Firstly, our aristocracy purchases only thoroughly prime end raataredwines, with a freedom lrom inul oil—A speciality for specialities; secondly, - the choicest of the choice is for those with means to enable them to consume the very prim est of all comestibles, thus saving them from the unfortunate position of poor Coupeau. It Is for that poor individual and thousands of others who have racked their constitutions and are seeking an early grave that we come forward as the true benefactors of those who have not the means to purchase costly wines and beets. You need not fear the Satanic influence when you court the drowsy god of Morphens—no bad dreams, no snakes to chase, nothing to bide from, no bewilderment or bewildering influences, but the very elysium as felt by Aladdin when he discovered his lamp, by all who purchase WARE'S FAMOUS LAGER BEEK and CRYSTAL ALE, sold at all respectable Hotels at 6d per bottle, the acme of parity. By drinking these Beers no ill effects will attend yon. Patronise the guarantors of Pure Beer. M C D 0 w E L L & MADRAS, CIGAR MANUFACTURERS, Sole Proprietors of the Brand | «' BAHADUR."
