HILL, Town Clerk. 22nd July, 1896 GENERATE YOUR OWN GAS by Purchasing the PORTABLE GAS COMPANY'S SELF-GENERATING GAS-OIL LAMPS. Circulars on application to D. KEELEY, General Manager, 31 Wharf-street. Agent at Toowoomba : Mr. N. FRAZER, Margaret-street. Messrs. Kelk & Willes, of 188 Queen street, gave a trial of the portable gas oil lamps at the Wynnum Railway Station on Saturday evening. The usual kerosene lamp on the down side of the building was replaced by a fifty candle power street lamp fitted with a spreader burner. In the station-master's room was placed a nickel wall lamp, fitted with a solar burner of fifteen candle power, and in place of the kerosene lamp in front of the shelter shed a small hand lamp of eight candle power was used. The gas oil was measured, and the lamps filled under the supervision of the station-master, and lighted at 5.40 p.m. The advantage over the old lamps was very marked, it being found possible to read handwriting by aid of the street lamp at a distance of over thirty yards. After allowing the lamps to burn for six hours, they were put out, and the oil again measured. Although at full power, the whole time in the face of a fresh wind, the street lamp had only consumed three-quarters of a pint, and the wall lamp less, the cost being equal to less than 4d. per hour. The trial was witnessed by many people from Wynnum and surrounding stations. F BEST BUTTER, lb. in. MODEL DAIRY. PURE MILK. PakUc Frances. S SOUND AND HEALTHY MEAT. GRAZIERS MEAT EXPORT COMPANY.

Your Lozenges, have done wonders in relieving my terrible cough. Since I had the operation of tracheotomy (the same as the late Emperor , of Germany, and unlike him, thank God, I am still alive), performed at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, no one could possibly have had a more violent cough ; It was so bad at times that it quite exhausted me.
