These will not bo operative in retail until reason- able time has elapsed for the clearance of old stocks. Whatever may be the view of British methods-old-fashioned, ineffective, and so on, they have been called-it is good to read the illumiuating statements by the city editor of "The Times" on 11 r. titaidey Baldwin's first Budget speech. This we are told was "a declaration of adherence to a financial policy which has, ni three years, reduced the income bax from 0/ to 4/0, abolished the excess profits duty, halved the corporation tax, lowered the duties on tea, coffee, chicory, cocoa, beer, table waters, repealed the cider duty, cheapened postal and telephone charges, anil has redeemed £209,11)3,000 of esternal debt in four years, made nn effective re- duction of over £149,000,000 in debt in .lie past twelve months, reduced the cost of borrowing for all classes, and raised British credit. Such a policy, having been testeil in the school of experience, is worth sticking to, even though it calls for great sacrifices from the taxpayer. That constitutes the real answer to the critics of the Budget." Ts there another country in the world which could stand such a strain ?# The people of the British Tslcs suffered in war for freedom's sake; they are denying themselves in peace for their credit's sake. The redemption policy of the British Government as disclosed in the Budget has had some criticism, and Sir Alfred Mond favomed the suspension of re dcmption, and a further cut of 1/ in the ncome tax, the funding of the pensions liability, and a still fuithei reduction ni taxation 1 bat, it was pointed out, wat, despite the fact that the Goiernment was to a large extent under contractural obh "ation to reduce the debt The "Times" nnter fuithei said ' It is a mistake to assume that b\ applying moneys to debt redemption instead ol tax remission trade and mdustiy aie deprived of funds which would stimulate trade Theie might be something to be said for this contention f inoncv were deal and difficult to ob tain, bul that is not the case Ii £50,000,000 m taken from the taxpayers ^nd returned to the public m the form of debt i eduction, the amount available lol ti ade is just as large as if it were left in possession of the ta.,pa}erB Further, Hie ihaige foi interest on debt, which s i lo-il burdon to tiadr-, is ltdueed bj ?C2,'500 000 per innum 1 lins the amoun of money îendeied available for trade by t edemption of debt is £2 500,000 per ai mun moie than if the monei were used lo remit taxation Again, money left in the pockets of the taxpayer in verv small imounts is lil elj to bo fiittcied awa\ m nothing in particular; but if tin« "loney is mobilised by taxation and used .o lepiy debt, it will be regarded as capital, md used foi reproductive purposes "
