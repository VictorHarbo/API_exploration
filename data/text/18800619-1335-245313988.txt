While more interested in the wheatgrower than the wool-grower, I would offer all reasonable inducement to the sheep and cattle farmer to penetrate the vast interior, and secure to him long leases at a moderate rent. 6\. The Northern Territory.—If the mining, squatting, and sugar-growing interests in that unfortunate part of our colony are liberally dealt with, I think we may hope for an improvement before long. 7\. Education.—I should like to see more of the religious element introduced into the Act, but fear that this canuot be done to the satisfaction of all Christian bodies. 8\. Immigration.—The advancement of the material interests of the colony, in my opinion, cannot be developed without a steady increase of population in the shape of free or assisted immigration. 9\. Payment of Members.—Personally I am against this, but would waive my feelings if your representatives in the House of Assembly pass such a measure. 10\. I am in favor of upholding the position of the Council as a cheek upon hasty legislation, but at the same time making it more amenable to the country than at present, first by increasing the number of its members. and sending one-fourth of the Council to the country at every dissolution of the Assembly, and also by shortening the term for which members are elected.
