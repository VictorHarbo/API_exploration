IMMIGRANTS FOR WESTERN AUSTRALIA. Among tlie passengers for Fremantle in the R.M.S. Ortona, which arrived there on 8th inst., were one Swedish and six Danish immigrants, who were entered on tlie list us laborers, and were sent to Fremantle by the Agent-General's Office. Tlie men are all young, seemingly about 21 years of age, ana are agricultural laborers. Tliey are under the leadership of a Swede named Knudsen, who is a skilled dairyman. A Government officer from the statistical office, introducing himself to the men, took them to Perth, lie said that work Imd been secured by the Government for them should tliey care to accept it. The men, the Perth "Morning Herald" states, came to Western Australia on very favorable conditions. Tliey paid only Â£0 10/, or half the fare, the other half being defrayed by the Government. 'L'he leader, Kiiudsen, had a letter from the AgentGcneral's Office ; taring that arrangements had been made with the Orient-Pacific line for them to secure tickets at half fare. The tickets however, showed that the full fare had' been paid. The Federal immigration au thorities appeared to be somewhat suspic ious, but. as the men stated they had no written contract, tliey could uo "take any steps in regard to thorn. It is understood that more Danish and Swedish laborers of the same chess are to be sent out to Fre mantle shortly.
