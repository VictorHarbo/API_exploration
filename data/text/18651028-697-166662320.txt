Experienced light winds and calms throughout tbe passage; passed the City -of Melbourne (s.)20 miles E.S.E. of Cape Schanck, at 9.20 p.m. on the 23rd, and the City of Adelaide, 30 miles north of Montagu Island, at 8 a.m. on the 25th THE BALLINA (s.)— The Clarence and Richmond Steam Company have received a valuable addition tn their fleet to the arrival of the above-named vessel, which c»mc into port on 25th instant She sailed from Portsmouth on the 20tb June, crossed the Equator on the 1st of August, and rounded the Cape of Good Hope on the Sth September. In running down her easting, on a parallel ol 41 -30 S., she experienced very heavy Bales from N.W. to S.V1., and finally passed Cape Otway on tbe 15th lnBtant. TheBallhu, hRVing been constructed with a special regard to llfrht draught of water, is neccBsarilv perfectly flat on the floor, with moderately fine ends. She was built by Messrs. Mitchell and Co, of New castle, is 180 feet in length, 24 feet beam, with. 9 feet 6 Inches depth of bold, and will draw when loaded 6 feet 6 Inches. . She is propelled by a pair of oscillating engines of 8O-horee power, con structed «n Rowan's patent principle, which allows of an extra ordinary saving in the consumption of fuel— thus allowing for a very large carrying capacity. The engines ore replete with all the latest improvements,- and appear a licautiful piece of work. There are also steam winches fitted on deck for the more rapid discharge of cargo, &c.; She has a full poop, in which ie the principal saloon as also a commodious apartment for ladies. Enclosed cabins are ranged on either side, with accommodation for thirty-six passen gers, the whole being fitted up in a most substantial anddefrant rtyle; while a second-class cabin, in the fore-part of the vessel, Is provided with every convenience. She will cam- 200 tons of cargo, and on ber trial trip averaged ten knots per hour. She is most substantially built of the best materials, and has arrived in excellent order, indicating the core and attention which Captain Bobinson must have bestowed during a rather tedious and boisterous passage.

The Alexandra (s.) left her anchorage off the Semaphore athalf past 4 p.m. of the 27th ultimo, in the teeth or a south-westerly gale. After passing- Cope Borda, at 6 ajn. of the 28th, the full strength of the gale and heavy eea was experienced. It was anticipated a long passage to the Sound would result ; but after three days the weather moderated slightly, and Princess Boyal Harbour was reached in 108 hours. The Alexandra passed Breaksia Island, en route to Adelaide, at noon of the 6th instant, with fresh westerly gale and high sea. It had been blowing the night previously very bard. On the morning of the 7th instant, at 8 a.m., while sailing under foietopsoil, foresail, and (on and aft sails, with moderate breezes from tbe N.N.W., and top gallant yards on deck, the steamer made several heavy rolls in the tea way. A sudden crash was heard, and immediately both yards and masts were gone; the foremast went close to the deck, and the tnnin|wp«fr underneath tie crosstrees. Without a moment's delay Captain Brown stopped the ship, and directed his attention to attempt to get dear of the wreck ot the foremost, &c;, without fouling the screw. This, after good management and perseverance, was effected. But the wreck and rigging of the mainmast, mainsail, &c.;, became par tially entangled with tbe propeller. The clearing of this in a heavy sea, and the ship disabled, King like a log in the -water, required not only a seaman's judgment but cool skill and calcu lation.1 With patience and energy the screw was, nevertheless, ?leared, and the Alexandra was enabled to proceed at fall speed within two hours after the mishap. There was nothing saved of the wreck, and most fortunately no lives were lost. The conduct of Captain Brown in the above sudden emergency merits great praise, as in a heavy«eait is well known to nautical men that when a steamer loses her- masts, tbe same as is this case, and fouls her screw with wire ropes, sails, lie., it requires cool and calcnlatinr judgment to deliver or release a steamer from such a position. The conduct of the officers, chief engineer, and crew, on this oceasion, merits strong commendation.— South Australian AdreiHser, October 11. ADELAIDE. CLEARED OIT.

Fatal Accidext ok Boars the Adahakt.— An unfortunotc acci- dent occurred on board (he Adamant, off Kangaroo Island, which cast o sudden gloom over the passengers and crew just as they were enjoying their flnt sight of land. A clear though succinct narrative of it is given in the report referred to. The writer, after describing how the passengers crowded to the ship's side to catch the first sight of rand, proceeds thus:— ?? The wind had been fresh all night and gradually increasing, blowing a point or two towards land, when all at once tbe nuuntop-goUant-staysaUsheet, which is secured midships, and generally lies along the bulwark when the sail is slack, came up with a jerk as the sail filled precipitat ing a poor woman headlong into the water, to the utter conster nation of the spectators, male and female, who happened to be collected in force looking at the gambols of .a . battalion ot por poises alongside. The doctor, sailors, boatswain, and suites had over and over again warned the immigrants of the risk they ran sitting on these sheets. Mr. Bameay, the chief mate, who is every incha seaman, had a buoyinrtantly thrown from the poop within a few feet of the drowning woman, and was himself and five men. down In the quarter-boat to the rescue in less than five minutes after. The cry of some oneoverboard soon went round the ship. The doctor, who is always et his post, ran for his glass to watch the boat, first instructing his attendant to have some warm water and restoratives ready. Captain Consterdlne had promptly thrown the vessel to when Mr. Ramsay left with the boat, but from the heavy swell running inshore and increased violence of the gale, this was neither a safe nor easy operation. After an interval of some hours we discovered the boat foran instant about a Gunshot astern, and coulo guess that they had been unsuccess ful in nn errand upon which, without a moment's hesitation, they had so nobly hazarded their lives. The sea ran bo high no one could expect the boat to come near the ship -without being dashed to pieces. Mr. Ramsay, dripping wet, and standing in the stem holding the tiller-ropes, noticed the predicament, and shouted to us to let ropes down the side for the men to hold by if the boat went. This was n4st fortunate as it turned out. Next minute fhe was under the quarter, and the hooks from the davits in the rings; but as they were drawing her un one of the hooks gave way, and if all hands had not had hold of the ropes they must hove been drowned. With the assistance of those in the shin all managed to crawl on desk, more dead than alive, and the boot was, with some trouble, pulled up by the attached end . without much injury. The unfortunate woman's name, we understand, was Bose Morgan, and it was reported she had somo £15 of her husband's savings sewed in ' her Btays,' — S. A. Jiepiitrr, October 18. We regret being called upon to announce the decease of an old and most respected master mariner of this port,. Captain William Mansfield, who died at Manila, of cholera, on the 18th August last.

The vessel has been fitted up by Mr. Anderson, builder, of this town, and is ready for the reception of troops. The 'tweon dc-cks of this fine vcgecI arc 147 feet in length and 7 feet 2 inches in height from deck to deck. Unlike the invalid transport ships, which are fitted with sleeping oo-npartn.cnts for each soldier, the Eob Boy and John Temperloy are to be supplied with hammocks, which will be hung from the upper deck. The number of men told off for conveyance in the Kob Roy is 200, There are ten cabins in tbe ealoon, which will be taken up by officers of the regiment, although the head-quarters are to proceed in the ship John Tcmperlcy. Captains Bulkeley and Wbitbread, with their wives and familes, are passengers by the Bob Hoy. the former officer being in command of the troops on board. Lieutenants Wrixon and Croft are also passengers by her. ? Every arrangement has been made for the comfort and con venience ol the men. The 'tween-docks ate filled with fourteen tables, athwart 6hlps, each or which will bo occu pied by a mess. The forward end of the 'tween-dreks hw been fitted with a compartment for married men, a hospital, and lying-in hospital, passenger compartments, store-rooms, accommodation for fhip's officers, &C.; The Ship John Temperloy will be fitted op in a similar manner next week, r-i-l follow with the remainder of the regiment about the ICth instant.

SAILING DIRECTIONS FOR THE WEST COAST HARBOURS. The following arc the sailing directions for the West Coast B arbours, as given by Mr. Frederick D. Gibson, Marine Sur vevor: — Hokitiki Elver is situated on the west coast of the Province of Canterbury, Middle Island, in latitude, by observation, 42 degrees 41 minutes 30 seconds B. ; longitude, by chronometer, 170 degrees 59 minutes IS seconds E., and is navigable for vessels of a light draught of water, for the distance of one and a half mile from the entrance. There is good anchorage from two to three miles off its month, in from 8 to 10 fathoms, dork sand and good hold ing ground. Should vessels intending to take the bar have to anchor to await daylight or high-water, they should bring up a little to the southward of the port; for whereas there is usually a southerly current in the crane, a very strong northerly set will often be found within the break on the bar. A constant heavy westerly «well Tolls in on this portion of the coast, and although the prevailing gales blow from the N.W., E.W., and S.E., enabling vessels to lie well off shore and obtain as offing, the masters of vessels should not neglect watching the weather carefully, and in the event of its threatening put to sea in good time. The heaviest break of the sea is immediately out side the bar, in two fathoms water. The bar itself is continu ally shifting indirection, and varying in depth, and after a heavy fresh the river runs straight out to sea, and during the in terval of moderate jm fine weather the sea fills up either the northern or southern spit, and makes a series of middle banks, forming one, two, or three channels, as the case may be, aver aging only a depth of from twelve to eighteen inches at low water. It lshigh water, full and change at Haldakabarninehours thirty-nine minutes (9h 39m,), and the mean rise and fall of tide overages from eight and a-half to nine feet, but this is, of course, greatly affected by the amount of fresh in the river. Grey River is situated in latitude 42 degree* 23 minutes 8., longitude 171 degrees 11 minutes E. The bar at its entrance, like those of all the other riven on the West Coast, is constantly shifting, and after a heavy fresh, when the channel breaks straight in a westerly direction, it is perfectly safe and easy of access for small vessels drawing from eight to nine feet, whereas in the absence of any freshet in the river the channel nukes either to the north or south, but usually in the former direction, Tunning for a short distance nearly parallel with the coast line; and at such times the entrance of theGrey Eiverisfar more dangerous than that of the Hokitika, because vessels crossing the bar take tile sea abeam when in the heaviest break, and, unless under the com mand of very small helm, stand in danger of becoming stranded on the bead before they are in a position to keep away for the entranse of the river, which of itself, although of a great depth ot water, is -very narrow. It is high water, full and change, at ten hours fifteen minutes (lOh. 15m.), but the highest tides often occur the day following. A buoy, painted red, is placed on the only dangcrous.enag lying in the fairway, abreast the Maori pa. Teremakau River, which is situate ten miles to the southward of the Grey, empties itself into the sea at the present time by two channels, the one miming northwards, which is nearly dry at low water, and the other in a souuVwesterty direction, with from five to six feet, tae entrance is not so confined as that of the Grey, nor yet is it equal to the Hokitika, but small vessels drawing from fourto 5 feet eould cr»ss Its bar withoutincurring a greater risk than they would at either of the otherriven. The only obstacle to the navigation of this river is a dangerous snag in the northern side of the 8. W. channel, in the break on the bar which could easily be removed. It is high water, full and change, at nine hours fifty-fire minutes (9, 55.) : mean rise and fall, nine feet. Bruce Bay is situate in latitude 43 'degrees 36 minutes 8., and Mount Goolc beats. N. 71 decrees. E. nuumetic. It is- a bav shown on the Admiralty chart, lying between Makawihoand Perangi rangi Points. The anchorage is dose under the south head, in three fathoms, at dead low water, hard speckled sand, but appa rently good holding ground. This bay is a much better harbour than either Timaru, Oanaru, or Moerald, because it is protected from everything except a northerly wind, which seldom blows here with any violence, and on necessity a sailing vessel oonld put to see without any difficulty, besides which vessels could generally discharge their cargoes in their own boats, so little rarf is there on the beach, and were there 0 short unexpeasive Jetty constructed in the south comer, on the sand, even in a northerly breeze cargo-boat communication would not be inter cepted. This is tbe only protected anchorage between Wanganui Inlet and Jackson's Bay, which latter place it closely resembles. The southern headland is a bold rockv pro montory stretching out a mile and a half in a north-wast iUrec ition, and forming the shelter ; whereas in the adjoining bay to the south this same headland offers protection from theonlywinds to which Bruce Bav is exposed. The Grey, Teremakau, and IIotitikB Bay ore nsky for sailing vessels drawing over five feet water, and steamers over six feet when loaded; but with vessels drawing under these figures, taking into consideration the esta blishment of pilot *nd signal stations at aach of the above ports, the risk with careful shipmasters is not greater than that incurred everv day fcy smallvesselB on the East Coast bars. In the above the draft for sailing vessels is limited to one foot under steamers, as the former cannot so well be confined to the deepest part of the channel. New Chaskei. Bucosi at Hokitika.— The Times is informed by Captain Kerley, tbe Harbour-master, that he is about estab lishing two movable beacons on -the spit, seventeen, feet high., which will be surmounted by a flag. The beacon kept in line with the flagstaff will denote the channel, and tbe flag the set of the current, a most important point for matters of vessels enter ing inwards. When one beacon cannot be placed in line with the flagstaff, to answer the above purpose, the second one will be used, tbe two then being kept in line instead of having an; re ference to the flagstaff. This decided improvement will be carried out at once, and will be of great service. Piract.— In June, 18G4, the French merchant ship Focderis Area sailed from Cette for Vero Cruz. On the vogage, when off the Cape de Verdes, the crew mutinied and attacked the mate {Aubert) with cutlasses. He struggled bravely, though mortally wounded, but was thrown overboard. He managed to regain the ship, but was a second time thrown overboard. The captain (Rechburg) was also attacked. He quietly asked the crew what he had done to displease them, and even reminded them, of bis kind and considerate conduct towards them. They said he was to die. He replied that he would ask them a favour, and that was to kill him without suffering. Whereupon they threw him overboard. He swam for some distance after the vessel, which was going at a flow rate, and was beard to Bay before he sank, ?' Eh bien bon voyage ! Tou will all cut your own throats.' These murders satisfactorily accomplished, the barrels of spirituous liquor were brought on deck, and the orgie which. vuBueu cuutm ui we uuok «^mmuiuxig SUICIUG oy leaping over the bulwarks into the sea, to escape the fate of lieu tenant Aubert. The carpenter was given the command of the vessel, and a paper signed by the crew, which bound each to secrcsy on pain of death. It suddenly otcurred to some of these worthies that a little cabin-boy might betray them. They desired him to throw a bucket over the side. While the child was leaning over the bulwark to execute the order, ke was thrown overboard! The unfortunate child swam after the vessel for some distance, and only sank from exhaustion. For want of wind the ship was becalmed. A Danish vessel picked up the crew, and landed them at C*pe Yerd. There a French manof war, the Mogue, iook them, on board and brought them to Brest, where an inquiry was instituted. The men kept to the same story— that their ship had sprung a leak, that the captain, first lieutenant, and cabin- boy, having gone down below while the crew were getting the boats ready to secure the ship's papers, chronometers, &c;, were lost, the ship having suddenly gone down. The court were satisfied with this story, and dismissed the men. They have, however, been again arrested, on the con fession of oue of the crew. The Am-obs (s.)— At the previous meeting of the Board, Cap tain C. S. F. Coalfield', late master of the Alford (6.), of London, was presented with o gold watch, awarded by the President of the United States, for services he rendered to tbe crew of the American ship Borneo, of Bichmond (Maine), wbioo was aban doned at sea in February last.— Jf itchell't Maritime Register, August 20.
