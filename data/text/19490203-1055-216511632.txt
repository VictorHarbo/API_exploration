NEW CITIZENS ARE INITIATEÂ© CANBERRA: The majority of the seven aliens who today are to become Australian citizens under the new Nationality and Citizen ship Act at a special Canberra ceremony are already typically Australian . Twenty-six year old Span iard, Angel Maguira, who is on a sugar farm with his father in Queensland, on arrival in Can berra, took a glance at the sur rounding paddocks and com mented: "This'd be a good bit of country with decent rains." All have sufficiently ab sorbed the Australian spirit to be enjoying their visit to the national capital at the taxpayers' expense. With the party is Mlclialos Mavrokefalos, known as Michael Black, 34, Greek, cafe proprietor, from Victoria. He is addicted to colourful sports clothes and striking neckties, and complained when an official photograph was being taken that it was not in technicolor so that the public could enjoy the full effect. Frenchman Auguste Leon Durant, 37, an electrician, from South Australia, speaks like an ordinary Australian despite service with the French Army. Although the nationalities of the seven are Spanish, Danish, French, Jugoslav, Norwegian, Greek and Czech they were on the friendliest terms within a few minutes of meeting. The naturalisation ceremony is to be performed by Mr. Jus tice Simpson in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) and the Immigration Minister (Mr. Calwell) are to address the new citizens on thei responsibilities. The ceremony is to be at tended by Cabinet Ministers, heads of churches, head-- masters, and headmistresses of Canberra schools, students, and officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and leading Can berra citizens.
