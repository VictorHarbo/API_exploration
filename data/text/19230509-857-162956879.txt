"BALMY” IMMIGRANTS. In “Hamlet” the advice is given about a Danish -gentleman who had developed distinct signs of "rats in the garret” to “ship him off to England— they’re all mad there.” Well, judging by reports as to the mental condition of Some of the migrants from, the Gold Land coming to Australia, history Is repeating itself, only in this instance the advice is “ship them off tp Australia," and probably, taking a line by many of the things our politicians. are doing—or leaving undone —British statesmen have concluded In their own minds, “they’re a}l mad there.” But this lopg-sufferlng and much-misgoverned Continent is decidedly of the opinion that she possesses enough mental erratics of the Australian brand; and so has politely but pointedly asked Old England to keep and look after her own "dipptes.” Which somehow reminds me of a story. Brown had presented his friend Smith before the court on a charge of lunacy, when the following colloquy took place: Magistrate: “What’s the trouble with your friend, Mr. Brown?” Brown: “Mad as a March hare, your Honor!” Magistrate: “Symptoms?" Brown: “Swears he’s the prophet Mahomet, your Honor.” Magistrate: “Sorry — not strong enough to commit him.” Brown: “Great Caesar! your Honor, not strong enough? Why, sir, I’m the prophet Mahomet myself!"
