A moro luipirtant incident of tho Parliamentary week is the ruptura of the clever and ambitious young barrister, Emilio Olhvier, formerly ono of tho famous "llvo" of the Opposition, whj, veary of the sterile policy of his party (which consists Bimply of opposing every tneasuro, good, bad, and in- different, brought forward by tho Government, ia tho hope of making trouble, and of provoking ill-will towards the reigning dynasty), has determined to tako an independent course, ana endeavour to form a thud party, which, ucijpt ing the Empire as tho result of tho popular w ill and tho constitution as by law established, will take the ground, new in France, of a liberal and progressive policy allied to a loyal acteptanco of the Etnpiro A« tho Emperor hits proclaimed his conviction that the existing constitution u gusceptiblo of improvement, and has invited the two Chambers, while refraining from attacks subversive of tho ousting order of things, to concur with hir* in pointing out; practical improv ementa in the administration of tho count ly, M OLUvior proposes to tako him at his sjvord Breaking with the systematic opposition sffhich is incessantly seeking to undermmo the Empire, he bas raised the flag of a loyal and progres- sive) independence, proposes to support the Government when ho conceives it to be m the ivht, to oppose it whon le deems it to bo hi the wrong, but always with a loyal acceptance of the Empire and the Emporor, no longer en- deavouring to destroy, but always labouring to perfect and te-strengthen. In fact, M OUivior, in tho oblo and states- manlike exposition of principles with which ho has just startled both sidee of the Chamber, takes, m the main, just the ground which, amco the appeasement of dynastio diffi- culties in England, has always been taken by "her Majesty's Opposition."

It appears that only four physicians have fallen victims to it, instead of 40 as reported by the telegraph. It seems certain, also, that diet, damp, bread rendered poisonous by the admixture of ergotised rye, absence of meat in the diet, cold and foul air, from all of which the lower classes of Petersburg have been suffering dreadfully through the winter, are the evident causes of the disease. The latter is now said to be a recurring fever of a bad typhoid character, but quite free from the yet more frightful characterstics of the true "plague," or " black death," with which it was at first confounded. And nlthough, m the ov onhandod justice of Providence, the maladies gonoratcd by negloct of natur ii laws nmong the poor, propágalo themselves among the nch, yet it seems probablo that tho disoaso
