PASTORALIST. FROZEN AND CHILLED MEAT RECENT REFRIGERATING. CONGRESS. Captain A.W. Pearce, secretary of the Australian Stock Owners Association, who represented a number of Queensland, New Zealand and Patagoman meat works com- bJwmies at tihe Refrigerating Inaustnes fcTCongitesa, recently held in Paris, is at v "present in Brisbane, •. and in the course *-« an interview last evening, he referred "f;lo a number of interesting matters in con section with tlie congress and rafrigerat *•; £ng interests generally. f-'. The congress was an tmternational one, £ and was attended oy some 2000 delegartes iiirom all iparts of the world, ivho t -gathered together for the first time, for £ fthe.puupoee of going into the whole matter £-<rf refrigeration from its many potato of g < view. All of the State Governments had |i* their representatives there, and the L tsason why Captain Pearco and fv. other representatives from Ausfcratta **>.-were appointed was, tin tihe nrst I place, because it -was considered that. it -■was necessary for Australia to be repre sented, and secondly, in the hope that the)*, would be able to do something in th*S matter of securing tbe removal of the .-restrictions on the importation of Aus tralian frozen produce into .France, The •congress was the first of the kind that had •rer been held, aad naturally the woik *#*•*"' largely of a preliminary character,, but it -was deoided that another congress should be held in Vienna in 191P, and this,' it was felt, would have faT-reaiching fteffstta. One resolution, howe7cr, wai un &*• aniniously carried at the.recent congrcss^- H,4hat it wns absolutely in the interests of j£.th* French people that the restrictions F* against the importation of frozen meat *.' should be removed. In France, said Cap stan} Pearce, the meat was very poor; *?*st Vas the same in Germany, and in fact Europe. One result of this r?1?d been that Spain-end Switzerland JUid both opened their doors to the frov.en -snssi trade, but they wanted the so cheaply that, in bis r- opinion, there would not be much |f;. si"* an opening there for Australia. PL Howsver, ft would probably reHieve ths g£ (London market by takthg off a lot of &XAt;***entine meat, thus -leading to lesser |k competition in England. It seemed to jj&.tiitn tnat what was urgently required in p; (Australia was a frozen storage association i% ■ *-aa association of all of the people in &>, terested in cold storage of every descrip- I* (ion—so that at the congress in 1910 they IXvould be represented with one voice. This j^"jsr*ai the only country in the world where- X libers was no cold storage association, and S*V siuring the next few months he was going % rsto endeavour to work one up. • |f,' ♦' Speaking of the frozen meat trade gene* ■X"***nlly Captain Pearce said thit up to the. Hj^btssent the price of beef had been so high p''ihat it had been impossible to export any fe.s quantity from Australia, other than to the jf". ontpoyM^--of Manila and Vladivost'ock. EX 'Argentina had almost doubled her export sf.'tiade last year, and much of it was in T£~ cssilled beef. This beef was all from f% animals kfljed at 8 yean old, fattened on fcl alfalfa, or lucerne, and then topped off on rX gsmlse, and it was almost equal to jf. fresh North American beef. Up to tX the present it bad not been found I possible to successfully carry Australian jbilled beef to Europe, but wonderful im- CVB-rements "had been made recently, and ts? -believed that wiubin the next twelve motrt/hs it would be possible to convey Queensland chilled beef to London. Jt would have to be done to make a succe-M tof the. export trade. Several new pro cesses were being worked out. and chilled toe? which had been for six weeks under [lam processes was being sent to London. "Australian mutton was still ths lowest quality on the London market, not be •t-snss ths mutton was bad, but because of K^f* !•** d"rt«nceB '*ba/k it had to twvel >r. ? this country before it reached the '•■■•*.■"*•' and the indifferent treatment j* it received on the railways. -One of the p reasons why Australian mutton had been h. •'•? low in-price during the past few months to- 'twas that there had been a most unusual p.; iacnix of* mutton from tXorth aad Souls Holland,' and. of course, there bad aTUo v been a~ vast increase in tbe exports from A*rgentina. In this tsonoection a ntatbar o* great concern was that for*-ths first tfme jn*:history Argentina: last, month Jhipped ,tff# London 13^000 lambs— more than she had ever shipped in a year before—which was an eye-opener to those who hoped that the lamb trade could be monopolised by Australia. He felt con vinced that Queensland beef would have to be sent to the works at about 16b. per lOOlbs. to have the least chance of compeling with Argentina in London, and he also thought that cattle rai&ers; would find it to their advantage to keep the meat works in full swing, and look for tbe local demand to keep up the prices. Captain Pearce refeared to 4ne fact that for some years past tbe Argentine bad been closed against the importation of Australian stud cattle. On his way back to Australia, he said, he interviewed the President of tihe Republic at Buenos Ayres, and-* received an assurance that this matter would receive immediate and favourable consideration. 'Following on • this, a few days ago he received a cable message announcing that the embargo had been removed, ana that-Australian stud cattle could now be exported to the. Argentine, where very hign prices ruled.'' Next year a very important stock exhibi tion ***** t0 in the Argentine, at which stock from all parts of the world . would be shown s This, he considered, of fered a great chance far Queensland breed ers. Speaking of his visit to Europe, Cap tain Pearce incidentally referred to, the expansion of the dairying industry ifr Siberia. Last year, he said, some 500,000. emigrants ' left Russia for fiiberia,' snd every one of them was going into tbe dairying industry. Vast supplies oi Si berian-butter were now being poured into the London market—lmteh of it repacked in Denmark and Danish brands put on it —and it was equal to Danish. Captain Pearce visited tlie- Fraaco-Bri*. tish Exhibition, but was not at art favour ably impressed "with the Australian dis plays, considering that their effectiveness waa completely spoilt by each .^tate hav ing a court of' its own and thus failing to make such 'an impressivu display as Canada. In going through England' he -had ibeen struck fry the eneigy displayed by the Queensland emigration agent, who was the only Australian official to be met ,at aH the shows entering. into competition with Canada. It was very often stated, said Captain Pearce, that the. English farmer lived a struggling sort of existence. 11 is experience was tlmt he lived in the greatest comfort, his first object being to make his home comfortable, and his second to make what little profit be. could. He did not think many ot these farmers could be induced to'come to Australia, although farm labourers might. He sug gested that the Australian (States might be able to obtain farm labourers from Canada, to meet their requirements, ~m ths same way that Argentina did from Italy. Argentina drew about 25,000 labourers N lrom Ttaly to do harvesting every year, and they returned on the completion of the work. Australia could do the same from Canada it the immigra tion-laws allowed the- men to be brought in to do the work under contract, for there .were thousands of labourers there who would-only be too glad to come here to escape the Canadian Winter, and once here, he thought,^ many of them would remain.
