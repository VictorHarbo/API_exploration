And as we have been advised on all hands that if we don't go in for LOLLIES there will be considerable discontent, we have made arrangements with a well-known colonial firm for just A FEW TONS OF SWEETMEATS i?H»TwCn no CHRISTMAS hours. Again we have been considerably exercised in the matter of BISCUITS, and giving way «J,V!e..UnlTcr,'.a teM" in favour of those TET enticing. and nourishing edibles, we have, with that earnest desire to please everyone which is a marked feature mour business character, contracted for a big supply of THE MOST DELICIOUS BISCUITS ever turned out of a biscuit factory anywhere. So much for the grosser part of our programme. Now for the ""Sarthe aesthetic, the useful, and the fashionable: OUR DRAPERY DEPARTMENTS, one and all will be, in fact are already, duly supplied and primed with CHRISTMAS ÏKT^'nA^?, whether lVs * FAN' a cardinal, or a FASHIONABLE COMUME, all are easily to be found and will be well worth the finding. The CHRISTMAS MILLINERY is indeed delicious; the more we look at it the more we like it, and the more convinced we are that our lady friends will be of the same opal ?,;a.i,0,uo.hin|1 Some very Pretty' PARASOLS and truly elegant SUNSHADES we could say a good deal and were we to start on the FLOWERS and FEATHERS, we might go on till midnight ere we had said all that was due. Brevity is the soul of wit ; let us be brief ; let us not weary our friends with long descriptions, with hyperbole phraseology, warm tugli-!.oundingailjectlves and exaggerative terms of praise; let us rather leave it for our thousands of admirers to come and judge for themselves. But we must say a word or two about a very important matter -about a thing that oppresses us with the weight of Its importance, that fairly crushes us with responsibility-, which occupies our waking moments, and which, notwithstanding our great anxiety, fills our dreams with happy VISIONS of a GREAT SUCCESS. The question which we thus introduce to notice is that of CHRISTMAS PRESENTS and NEW YEAR'S GIFTS; and so vast is it, so marvellous its details, so complicated its ramifications, and so extended its sphere, that we almost faint with joy w hen we think how complete have been our preparations, how mighty our efforts, and how rare a show will be the result. The poor lassie's sixpence, or the rich man's cheque, are equally welcome with us-the one shall have our best attention, our most ardent thanks; so shall the other, and more we cannot say. Is it a PENNY 'TOY, or is it a TWENTY-GUINEA DIAMOND RING is the one for a tiny baby brother, is the other for the millionaire's bude I A HAPPY CHRISTMAS say we to the little maiden who in kindness disburses her saved up sixpence A HAPPY CHRISTMAS say we do the stately dame, with raiment of silk and velvet, and jewels of untold worth. A PRETTY WORKBOX for an industrious girl an ingeniously-constructed DESK for a studious boy; a great big INDIARUBBER BALL for the baby of three ; a wonderful MONKEY, on a wonderful Buck, for a strapping youngster of four; pretty RING for your sweetheart; a TEA COSY for your mother-in-law ; a new PURSE for a maiden aunt ; and embroidered APRON, or some smart RIBBON for a handsome par- gourmand. All these, aye more, and hundreds of others, and thousands besides, yes, scores of them, piles of them, waggon loads of them, tons of them, warehouses full of them; all for CHRISTMAS PRESENTS and NEW YEAR'S GIFTS.

The " busy hum of labour " is a political Idea enough, but, unfortunately, some of us also born with nerves, and I confess that the monotonous white, w her. whim, of a sewing-machine In the house has sometimes sent me out of it. I have often wondered if this could not be remedied without impairing its usefulness. This, I find, you have succeeded in doing in the NEW AUTOMATIC FAMILY SEWING-MACHINE.
