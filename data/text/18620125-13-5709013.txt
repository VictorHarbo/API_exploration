In the absence of any man-of- war, the customary salutes were not fired. She was visited early yesterday by the Russian consul. She sailed hence for Cronstadt on the 23rd inst. H.M.S. Pelorus twenty-one guns, Commodore F. P. B. Seymour, C. B., arrived in Hobson's Bay about noon on the 6th inst, from Sydney. Immediately on anchoring she was boarded by a boat from the Russian frigate Swetlana, and immediately afterwards the British ensign was hoisted on board the Russian man of war, and a royal salute fired, which was im- mediately responded to by the Pelorus with twenty- one guns, the Russian ensign being hoisted at the fore. A large concourse of people assembled on the Railway Pier to watch the salutes. The celebrated ship Norfolk anchored in Hobson's Bay on the 6th last, after a magnificent passage of sixty eight days from Plymouth. We were indebted to Captain Atwood for London papers of the 28th October. She left Plymouth early on the morning of the 29th October, the equator was crossed on the 22nd of the following month and the meridian of the Cape on the 12th ult. Fine weather continued until when abreast of Mauritius ; since then had a continuance of heavy gales. She passed Cape Leuwin on the sixty- first day out. The Norfolk is under the command of Captain Atwood, who, on arrival, was presented with a letter of thanks for his kindness and attention throughout the passage. She will sail hence on her homeward voyage on the 27th February. THE ALDINGA.—The steamship Aldinga arrived in Hobson's Bay about ten a.m. yesterday, bringing 111 passengers, and 14,839oz. 3dwt. 8g. gold-dust. She left Otago late on the 17th inst., and on the following day put into Invercargill, and remained there twelve hours during a heavy westerly gale. She also en- countered very heavy weather during the remainder of her passage. Captain M'Lean reports having spoken the steamer Omeo on the 19th inst., sixty miles west of Solander Island all well ; and on the 21st, when in lat. 43deg. S., lon. 156deg, E., saw a steamer, supposed to be the Lady Bird. The Water Nymph, of this port, under the com- mand of Captain Thomas Stewart, has just completed one of the most remarkable voyages ever made to or from this port. She sailed outward on the 26th June last for London, and arrived off the Isle of Wight on the 3rd of September, or in sixty-eight and a half days. On the voyage home, she left Spithead on the night of the 14th or November, and anchored in Hob- son's Bay on the 22nd inst., thus again making the voyage in sixty-eight and a half days. The Havilah left Adelaide on Tuesday evening. Strong southerly winds prevailed the first part of the voyage ; latter part fine. We learn, from advices received by the Aldinga, that the E. A. Whitney, Captain Robinson, arrived at Otago after a splendid passage of seven days, with her living cargo of over 8,000 sheep. Only 150 were lost altogether, and those during the two hot days the vessel was detained in Hobson's Bay, after the ani- mals were placed on board. Captain M'Lean, of the Aldinga, reports that the ship Ocean Chief, while entering Bluff Harbour, in charge of a pilot, went on the rocks, and sustained some damage. She was, however, got off, and was making about seven inches of water per hour. She will be brought to this port for repairs. The following vessels had arrived at Bluff Har- bour :—Eli Whitney, Capt. Thomas Robertson ; New Great Britain, Capt. Trader. The Commodore Perry arrived at Otago on the 14th, and the Indian Queen on the 18th inst., and Silistria, from Glasgow. Captain Hughes, of the Benjamin Heape, appeared at the Sandridge Police-court on the 23rd instant, to answer a complaint sworn by Mr. Macfarlane, immigra- tion officer, for breaches of the thirty-fifth section of the Passenger Act. It appeared in evidence, that the vessel had a long passage from Otago, and was obliged to put into Hobart Town for provisions. The Bench inflicted a fine of £25, one-half to go to the passengers. The following vessel was spoken by the Eleanor, December 13, lat. 34.50 S., lon. 3.50 W.—W. Lilly, brig, from Shields for Shanghai ; wished to be re- ported. The celebrated Black Ball ship Morning Light, Capt. Gillies, arrived in Hobson's Bay late on Thursday even ing last, after a splendid passage of sixty-eight days, She brings a very large number of passengers, and a full cargo of general merchandise She has had remark- ably fine weather throughout the passage, until the last three days, when she ran 874 miles.
