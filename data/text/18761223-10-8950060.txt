Sire, Maribyrnong, the sire of Hamlet', The Diver, Imperial, Richmond, Miss Jessie, Sunshine, etc. Dam, Rose of Denmark, by Stockwell, the sire of Blair Athol, Doncaster, Gang Forward, etc. ; g. dam, Marchioness (winner of the Oaks), by Melbourne ; g.g. dam, Cinizelli (the dam of Marquis), by Touchstone ; gg. dam, Brocade, by Pantaloon. Rose of Denmark was also the dam of Hamlet, Florence, and Sovereign, and is half sister to Fishhook and Angles. Maribyrnong, by Fisherman, imported. Dam, Rose de Florence, imported, by the Flying Dutchman, out of Boarding School Miss, by Plenipotentiary, out of Marpessa (dam of Pocahontas, S took well's dam), by Muley, etc Rose de Florence, dam of Nathalie, Fenella, King of the Ring, and Ferryman (the sire of Charon, Lamplighter, etc.) She is also full sister to Peter Wilkins (the sire of The Quack, Bonvolio, etc.) On reference to Horatio's pedigree above, it will be seen that, independently of his having a strain of Stockwell blood on the side of both sire and dam, he is closely allied to all the stoutest and best blood in the world, and, without doubt, he is one of the most muscular and handsomest horses now at the stud in the colonies. His victory in the great Metropolitan and 3 year old Handicap, and his running in the Melbourne Cup and other races, prove him to be a racehorse of the highest class. In offering his services to breeders in Tasmania, the proprietor deems it unnecessary to refer to this horse's terms, beyond the fact that his own brother, Hamlet, is now standing at Woodstock at 20 guineas and his sire (Maribyrnong) list is full at 50 guineas.

Ringleader, bred by Mr. Gerrard, in South Australia, in 1869, also the breeder of The Ace, King Tom, etc., combines within himself some of the fastest racing blood, and his points for a sire horse for either hunters, steeplechasers, hacks, carriage horses, or racers have never been questioned. He was at the stud one season in Victoria and for the last two seasons in Tasmania, and he has not only proved himself a sure animal for stud purposes, but his stock are pronounced to be very promising. Ringleader will travel through Hobart Town, New Norfolk, Hamilton, Bothwell, Richmond, and home every tenth day. INGOMAR. Bred by John Lee, Esq., of Bylong, N. S. Wales, in 1873.

Protected by Royal Letters Patent, , Dated October 11th, 1869. Under Distinguished Patronage. DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE. (Ozonio Oxygen.) The New Curative Agent, and only Reliable Remedy for Nervous and Liver Complaints. This Phosphatic combination is pronounced by the most eminent members of the Medical Profession to be unequalled for its power in replenishing the vitality of the body, by its supplying all the essential constituents of the blood and nerve substance, and for developing all the powers and functions of the system to the highest degree. It is agreeable to the palate, and innocent in its action, while retaining all its extraordinary properties and as a specific, surpassing all the known therapeutic agents of the present day for the speedy and permanent cure of Nervous Prostration Lassitude Liver Complaints Shortness of Breath Palpitation of the Ilcait Trembling of the Hands DizzinesS and Limbs Noises in the Mond and Eura Impaired Nutrition Loss of Energy and Aupotite Sluutal and Physical Dolly portions in pression Foinulo Complaints Consumption (in its first General Debility , _ Stanes only) Indigestion Timidity Flatulence [ness Eruptions of the Skin incapacity for Study or Hear Nervous Debility in all impaired Sight and Memory its Staves Nervous Fnnoioa Pick Heailiieho Treinnturo Deoliuo impoverished Blood And all morbid conditions of the system arising from whatever cause. The action of the Flies phodyne is twofold on the one hand increasing the principle which constitutes nervous energy, and on the other the most powerful blood and flesh generating agent known ; therefore, a marvellous medicine for renovating impaired and broken-down constitutions. It quickly improves the functions of assimilation to such a degree, that where for years an emaciated anxious, cadaverous, and semi-vital condition has existed, the flesh will rapidly increase in quantity and firmness, and the whole system return to a state of robust health. The Phosphodyne acts electrically upon the organisation for instance, it assists nature to generate that human electricity which renews and rebuilds the osseous, muscular, nervous, membranouB, and organic systems. It operates on the system without exciting care or thought upon the individual as to the process. It moves the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, stomach, and intestines, with a harmony, vigour, yet mildness unparalleled in medicine. The Phosphodyne gives back to the human structure, in a suitable form, the phosphoric or animating element of life, which has been wasted, and exerts an important influence directly on the spinal marrow and nervous system, of a nutritive, tonic, and invigorating character, maintaining that buoyant energy of the brain and muscular system, which renders the mind cheerful, brilliant, and energetic, entirely overcoming that dull, inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience in all their actions. The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are frequently shown from the first day of its administration, by a remarkable increase of nervous power, with a feeling of vigour and comfort, to which the patient has long been unaccustomed. Digestion is improved ; the appetite increases wonderfully the bowels become regular ; the eyes brighter ; the skin clear and healthy and the hair acquires strength, showing the importance of the action of the Phosphodyne on the organs of nutrition. Finally, the Phosphodyne maintains a certain degree of activity in the previously debilitated nervous system ; its use enables all debilitated organs to return to their Bound State and per- form their natural functions. Persons suffering from Nervous Debility, or any of the hundred symtoms which this distressing disease assumes, may rest assured of an effectual and even speedy cure by the judicious use of this most invaluable remedy. DR. BRIGHT'S PHOSPHODYNE Is sold only In Cases at 10s. 6d.- by all Chemists and Patent Medicine Vendors throughout the Globe. Full Directions for use in the English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Danish, Turkish, Persian, Hindustani, Madraase (Tainui), Bengalee, Chinese and Japanese Languages, accompany each Case. JteS" CAUTION.-The large and increasing demand for Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne has led to several imitations under similar names ; purchasers of this medicine should therefore be careful to observe that each Case bears the English Government Stamp, with the words " Dr. Bright's Phosphodyne" engraved thereon (white letters on a red ground), and that the same words are also blown in the Bottle. Every Case bears the Trade Mark and Signature of Patentee. Wholesale Agents for Victoria : Felton, Grimwade, k Co., Melbourne, New South Wales : Elliott, Bros., Sydney.
