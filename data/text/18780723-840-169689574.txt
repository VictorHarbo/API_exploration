TODD is the Queensland 'Eye Opener.' Ho has an eye to everything in 'the way of business. There is not an acre of land sold but Todd lias his eye upon tho price, con sequently ho knows the valtio of all the land in nuee'i7''land, and his constituents are benefitted by his oxpu''once- ' '?ril!s 'counts for his success. His' busn.l?8 is ''^sing to such an extent that he has had to u.^w uPon Lls 1(md lord for increased accommodation. Ifc )Tas graciously accepted, and Tood has now themost central and commodious Mart in the city. You see how Todd has thus opened his land lord's eye, and, in response, the eye of , the publio is daily upon Todd's Mart. If Roths child was domicile.i in Queensland, his first ris.it would be, to ToSd as the most entcr pnsingm^ jn Queensland. Perhaps it is as '''^'cnat two such stars should not meet, as there would be too great a result. Todd is content to worS Oh alone. Peace is proclaimed. The CongresB have settled their differences, and Todd ;s now permitted to attend to his business without troubling himself about gun powder, torpedoes, ironclads, and such little combustibles. Ho can now conscientiously recommend his customers to settle down in peace, without beinj; in fear, and trembling at the thought of Russian black mail being levied . upon them. Todd can Bee a greater length than most people, and this is tho reason he is so much in advance of tho ago ho lives in. Other great men who have pr^odod him have had to pass through (*« Bame orcleal. When Todd advises a ;nm to buy a property, that man hau belter do it, if ho does not ho loses money. Queen-Btreet can testify to this fact, and so can Toowong. Tood knows whero to buy and where to sell, so that he pleases both classes of customers. The vendor sells when Todd advises, and purchasers turn up quite naturally. Todd opens all their eyes, and the scales drop off bo that they bcc clearly that there is no beam in Todd's oyc- then they buy and are happy. Todd has particularly to draw attention to the lost eye opener — the Victoria Estate at Toowong. Working men can now, at least, get a small allotment in the most suitable part of this suburb at a prico within ovp^y. body's reach. But it must bo done «l'ickly— delays aro dangerous, Call qp ^'ODD for particulars, price, plan, &c.; QUEENSLAND IN8URANOE COMPANY LIMITED. : PnracOTAi.
