COMMERCIAL. Age Office, Saturday Evening. There were no export entries passed for gold at tho Customs to-day. An evident improvement has been experienced in tho import market generally during tho current week. Tho country demand has been greatly in creased, and evinces signs of reviving from that doadness by which it has been characterised for months past ; a healthier and inoro cheerful tono has in consequence been imparted to tho market, which has received confirmation in tho wislicd-for cliango in tho weather witli which wo havo also been favored ; sales having, howevor, been chiefly confined to supplying trade wants and executing country orders, have not been on so extensivo a scale as it is confidently hoped they will bo, as tho season, now commencing to open up, advance?. A largo spoculativo purchaso in bulk ale has been made, GOO hhds of Marrian's and tho Carlisle Com pany's having been taken up by one buyer. 150 tons flour have changed hauds iu one line. Some transactions in rico have been en tered into. In .flour, wheat and oats, several parcels have been disposed of. Maizo has declined slightly. Candles havo had some notico privately, at sustained rates for Bel lnonts, but at a reduction on foreign ; large quan tities have, ns formerly, been sold at auction. In sugar, tea, and salt, thero has been little done. To bacco has been placed extensively, though at low prices. Timber has, in like manner, beou quitted to some extent. In spirits, tho only change which can bo noted is in Mar toll's palo brandy in bulk, which is ngain Bcarcc. Tho English and foreign arrivals comprise four vessels from Britain, ono from Calcutta, ouo from China, and one from Mauri tius. It may be interesting to note, as tho brand is well known in tho colony, that tho Central Society of Vineyard Proprietors liavo commenced proceedings in London, with tho view of preventing the imita tion of their brand, now extensively carried on. The labol complained of is an exact counterpart of their own, save that another name is substituted for that of A. Niox, A. Vallein, Fils and Co., which cer tifies tho genuine article. An advertisement to this eflect will bo found elsewhere. Ale and Stout. — Bulk ale has rcceivod moro at tention during this week ; the trade generally, for consuming purposes, has not improved much, but some large speculative purchasos havo been mado, which havo tended to create a better feeling in the market.
