OUU. RICH INHERITANCE. bird . NorthcJiffc's forceful advocacv of Australian immigration sliouid dwi'nalo rome of the ignorance and muiuidor- standing that have hindered the adequate peopling of this country in the past. In Uio series of articles on this vital wnicii lie Iins just concluded in JiW Englisli journals, Lord NorUii-liffo emphasises the vichnera of our Snhcri tnnre. and indicates the almost limit !cs« possihiiitlcs that awnlb a real tmtinna! scheme of immigration.- This journalist ndrornte of otirs does not hesitate to criticiso Aiirtralinn settlement system. One necessity that he baa repealcdlv pointed out is that settlers must tie carefully selected for tlie typo of lifo thai await them. Immigrant tluil arc "mUfr." hare always been a cause ot economic embarrassment, but now that our capita! cities aro swarming with wot-klMS men, thc mdiscnminnto dumping of freuli contingents of non-rural immi grants into our midst would be nn net of criminal folly. Another point which Lord Xorthcliffe stmroa is thc need ol n more intensive type of cultivation in Australia. Our broad acres bavo possibly made us indifferent to the agrarian eco. nomles that more congested countries are compelled to practise. Tina the Danish row is cu.Hvated, even under the harsh' natural conditions of that land, to pro., ducc twico as much as thc cow in wide omli fertile Australia. In urging Aus. tralian immigration, Lord Northdiffe is evidently moved by two fade. One is tlio urgent need of augmenting our slcn. dor garrison, and the other is tne growing inability t»f England to maintain Uio mil lions of pcop!o within her restricted bor ders.
