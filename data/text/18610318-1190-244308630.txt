Imeort Markets. — Tlioro have been 110 signs of returning activity in business, not at least to suoli an oxtont as to meet tlio wishes of importers. Every ono eompluins of .tho limited demand existing, and of the difficulties of effecting sale3 nt full rates. This, however, is owing as much to tlio largo number of per- sons competing for tho customers ns to tho limited number of customers themselves. Thcro must always bo k heavy consump tion of goods in such n population us ours, and were tlio business of supplying con fined to fewer hands iinportors would have less ground of complaint. As it is, tlio eon. sumcrs, and those through 'whoso hands the trulilo passes, now renliso the advantages which would otherwiso fall in a greater sliavo into first hands. This is not after all an unmixed evil— as when importers can command their own prices it is at' tlio cost of tho vast body of their customers, and 011 tlio other hand, when tho tendency of prices is in favour of tho 1 -ultimnto purchasers, tho public in general liro moro cheaply supplied. During the jlast wook tlio only noticeablo feature has boon tho increased willingness .to accept tlio" offers of purchasers, and accordingly ' prices have in many directions been' qiiiotly giving Way. ' Flour nnd sugar1 have hceii almost tho only "exceptions. Light arrivals nnd a- "report of the probable defloionoy.- of crops in Adelaido liavo given firmness to tho flour market, and best brands are now worth LI8, and tend : upward. ; Tho. great scarcity of Mauritius sugars has made' tho market very, firm, and the cargo ex Planter, just arrived, , brought by auction, on Friday," the following prices Brown, L34 to L3510s ; grained yellow,: L3G to L3G 6s; counters, L42 j 5s to L44 5s ; grey crystals, L49 to L49 2s Gd ; rations, L32 ios. In teas only tlio' best qualities, .which are not -largely supplied, maintain their ground ; all :tlie inferior kinds: are weaker, and are sure to continue declining, as wo have had several arrivals, witliiu a few days. ' Bulk ales have been offering freely this weekj nt lower rates, 'and sales of Boss's No. 3 at L6:10s to L7 are reported.. Bottled nies are in fair demand at. recent rates, and bottled porter sells freely at 10s to 10s Gd. Tlio posi- 'tion ,of brandy is somowlint unsettled, many holders being willihg to tako lower terms than others nro asking— buyers will not gonerally advance over 10s Gd for Mnrtell's dark ; sales of palo at 12s 6d and'T3s;' geneva, .host, 'brands, 1 are "worth 16s.

Whole liains and.;baeon sell freely, the former at 12d to 13d, and tho latter at 9d to lOd sides, and 10£d to lid bellies, '.dandles continue about tho same, though considerable /quantities are just to hands Bolmonts.ls 4£d and Nevas, Is' 6|d ; Composites;1 Is. 1 Bibb has . slightly improved ; .sales are reported at L18 10s and L19 for new ; old, according to; con dition.

Lawraubo re- ports that' tho'corn market cohtinues firm and . steady, with a tendency to advance, so far as breadstuffi are concerned. In horao-feeding grain, etc., there is not much doing,' and prices remain unaltered. Flour : Imports aro 1 light, and any parcels to hand hava 'found buyers from' ship's side. Purchasers of foreign flour, still operate on Sydney account. Stocks of Ohilinn and Californian aro now out of first hands ; United States flour is held for ad- vahcbtl rates. Tho town mills "have advanced 20s, now quoting 'at L17 per ton, while tho closing quotations for. other Borts rulo ns fol low ;i— Adelaide sorts, L17 to L17'10s j-Hart's superfine, L18; Mogaroy's, :Li8 10s; Chilian, L16 10s, per, ton; United .States, 40s | to. 42s per . barrel. . ; Wlieat : 'Oountiy wheat is now being freely offered at tbo town and country mills ; a good many: parcels are now afloat from our own seaboard its also purchases mado 'in South Australia for. this pparkot 7- : As great "diversity of opinions exists as 'to the extent of damage this grain bus- tained bv; the heavy rains during tho harvest, there is no. doubt but damage was done in a greater or less degree, and moro is tbo pity; while, on the other hand, there nro parties to bo found anxious to make somo capital out of it by traducing ' tho '-character of tho. entire crop ,of tho colony, "from interested motives. Excellent samples of wheat have como forward from; one of tho. most extensive grain-growing districts of tliis'colony, and tho advices (from ah undoubted authority) which accompany tho same, nro equally gratifying and satisfactory, and are ns follow " Wo liavo not met any wheat that has sustained any damage beyond losing its usual brightness of colour. None of the samples now sent wo consider are prime, lots :; the grain is fuller and superior to that grown by our farmers laBt year." There is no question that good wheat is obtainable, and that, too, in largo quantities. Tho marketclosesflrmly nnd prices range" from Gs !8d to '7b 6d per bnsliel, according to quality and condition . Oats :. Tho demand is confined to town con sumption and any light export orders. A small parcel of Calcutta has been quitted at auction, at 3s ; Californian aro worth 3s 3d to 3s Gd ; other imported sorts aro perfectly no minal. Closing quotations are as follow : — Scotch and Irish, 2s to 3s ; Dutch and Danish, 3s to 8s 3d; Californian, 3s 4d to 3s 6d ; colonial, 3s 9d ' to 4s per bushel. Barley : The i hot weather causes;! brewers to bo less anxious to purchase, and as supplies como for- ward prices seem to recode. Capo is in tbo market at 5s 6d ; and English malting, Gs 6d per bushel. Maize is - in few hands, and held for such prices as limit ita consumption, 6s to 6s Gd per bushel being demanded for it. Gram : Tho small parcel recently to hand found a buyer, at L13 per ton. Brandy was in request at Ib 3d to Is 8,d Der bushel. Oat- meal remains the same. Imported, L18 to L20. Coloninl, L25 per toil. Malt continues unchanged, English selling at 13s to 13s 6d por bushel. Colonial not quoted. liny: A3 hydraulie-prcssetl hay will most likely bo nil article of import this season, it may ho well to give quotations ; bouio parcels to hand from South Australia lmvo found buyers ntL7 to L7 IO3 per ton. Potatoes are in good supply, and prices rule at L3 10s to L4 per ton. Es timated imports of flour and grain at tho port of Mulbourno from ,7th Murch to 13th March inclusive: — Flour, South Australian, 239 tons ; ' Wheat, South Australian, 3,518 bushels ; Oals, Tnsmnnian, 1,000 bushels ; Barlov, Tusmanian, 150 bushels ; Mnizo, from New South Wales, 200 bushels ; Bran, South Australian, 7r000 . bushels. Postscript.— Saturday evening. — Supplies of flour and wheat have como moro freely, to hand tho last two days, which forward orders will go far to absorb, and tho market closes firm for bread Bluffs. There is no ohnngo in horse-feeding grain.; Tho advices by tho English mail bear little upon our corn market now.: Stock and Share Market. — There lias been an unusually good business dono in tho market during tho wook, nnd in several mining stocks largo sales have been effected, though only nt low rates. Tho established stocks have boon freely sought when offered, nnd for tho most part prices are in tho sellors' favour. Coloninl Bank shares liavo not been put ou tho market to any cxtont, and transactions nt L6 10s to L6 12s Gd have been effected. Nution- nls nro in loss domand, nnd stand nt L2 17s to L3.

In eonsequenco of somo 'disorganization in tho broker's daily meetings, occasioned by recent events, tlio association has suspended tho.publi- eation.of their list, In fact no business of any importance has been done in theso 'meet ings for somo days past, nor does it at present appear likely that business will bo resumed until an improved organization - has been- established.

Good useful wethers may bo quoted at 14s to 15s; middling quality, lis to 13b; inferior, 9s to 10s, without much demand at tho prico.

Deniliquin Stock Market, March i4, 18G1. — The stock market exhibits no ohnngo from tlio ditlness which hns, for so long a time, boon its chief characteristic. A few Victorian buyers nro in tlio market, their inquiries being principally for cow3 or mixed lots of cattlo. Owing lo the prices ruling for fut cattle in Melbourne, however, the domand for sloro slock is languid, purchases in tlio prcsont stale of the markot appearing to offer but flight margin for profit. No fresh lots of store cattlo linve arrived during the week, but wo hear of two or tlirco mobs to arrive in about a month's time. No sales of store sheep are reported. A transaction is pending, we understand, for tlio s ilo of a superior lot of ewes, from th'o flocks of Mr. Peters, of Ilia Murruinbidgco, at a remu nerative price. This is llto most saloablo de scription of stock at tlie presont time. Lai'go numbers of fat cattle are still moving towards Victoria, in spito of tlio udverso state of tlio markets, in which 110 improvement can for some timo'bo looked for, tiiby being now fairly glutted, 11s may bo judged "from, a statement which hns reached us, to the effect that (hero nro near 2000 head of fut cattlo now near Ben- digo awaiting sale. Tlio following lots have crossed : — 0th March, Daroliv's, 230 ; Welsh's, 3001 O11 tho 8th, 220 head' left Werai (H. G wy 11111/5).
