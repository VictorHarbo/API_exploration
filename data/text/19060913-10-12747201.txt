WHO ARE THE SETTLERS REQUIRED FOR AUSTRALIA ? ^ -< Mr August Larson writes to the Immigration League - "In nearly all publications inviting people to settle in the colonies, the for lowing phrase can be seen - What we want is farmers with a few hundred pounds capital to take up land ' but the number of such farmers willing to emigrate is very limited, and they are afraid of losing their few hundred pounds Although everybody appeal-, to those people with a few hundred pounds in their pockets, is it quite ce. Um that those men are really the best and most desirable settlers I do not think so It will be best understood what class of people I mean by quoting the following facts - "On May 5, 180") I assisted a young Danish farm Labourer Knstian Kjeldson to go to West Australia He promised to let me know how he was getting on and also to write to me in a years time On July 31 l'JOb, I received I from him the following letter, written from Upper Swan, west Australia 'Mr August Larson, London 'According to my promise I am went ing to you again after being in West Aus to I for one year, and I must tell you how very pleased with everything here I think of taking up land next year, after the harvest The wages here are very good but still I think more money can be made if I do something for myself - Yours faithfully (Signed) EltlSTIAN KTLLDSEN "None in my opinion Ali Kjeldson is the best man Australia could get He can work and He em have money Aft Kjoldsen with his Â£10 s iv ed during the first year he was in Austin alla will in all probability, in a few years time be a prosperous farmer, and will be ahead of the man who armed with a few him died pounds in his pocket because he has learned the value of money, he his proved he can save money Moreover, he has saved every penny in the country he has adopted, whilst the miners) of those young men with a few hundred pounds in their pockets and to whom everybody makes love has none of those advantages, and nearly everyone of whom come to a new country with money which they have not saved themselves, I think everybody will agree with me that Mr Kidson, with his 9-10 saved in the first year, is a most desirable sett ei and or more value to the State than the young man who gets a few hundred pounds from his family to go out and take up land in Australia Mr Kjeldson s success is so to say certain, but whether the man with the few hundred pounds in his pocket succeeds is doubtful, and has first to be proved On the other hand the number of the farmers with a few hundred pounds in their pockets willing to Smith she is very limited, whilst the number of such men as Mr Field on can be had by thousands if a helping hand is given to them to get out to Australia "
