FOREIGNERS ALLOWED TO REMAIN Desirable Migrants, Minister Decides When two foreign seamen were called before Mr. Sanderson, S.M., in the Port Adelaide Police Court on Fri- day, to answer charges that they were prohibited immigrants because they had failed to pass dictation tests, it was announced that the Minister for Customs (Mr. White) had decided that the men were desirable types of mi- grants. As a result, Customs Officer G. A. M. Edson, who appeared to prose- cute the men, withdrew the charges. The men were Franz Karczmarczyk, a German national, and Frederik Wil- liam Kruse, a Danish national.
