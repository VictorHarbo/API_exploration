LETTERS TO THE EDITOR WHY DENMARK DID ' NOT RESIST Cabled messages have lclt the Im pression that if the Danes did not actually welcome the Germans, they did not resent the . Invasion very much. I trust you will spare me space for a few explanatory remarks In or- der to correct, that Impression Australia has received many Immi grants from Denmark, and I do not think Denmark,, has any reason to be ashamed of her sons. Many of them have glveh valuable contributions to the development of industry and agri culture, and even to. our general cul tural development. Even an Implied slight on their Motherland, therefore, hurts the Danes in Australia. it should be remembered that Den mark has fewer than three million leoplc; The country comprises Jut land, connected to Germany by land and two main islands, besides nume rous smnller ones. The capital b situated on one of the main islands There are no natural obstacles to an invader. Denmark might have built a Maginot line across Jutland alon" the German border, and so provoked the attack, but thei-e are around her coast line about 25 harbors in which German troops might be landed with in a few hours of leaving Germany The impossibility of defending such a country against overwhelming odds is obvious. The Nazis have in the past' spared no effort to gain a foothold in Danish politics, but the people would have none of it. The wearing of political uniforms has lone been forbidden, and'.the authorities promptly arrested some' fifty Nazis, who re cently, in. defiance of the law. tried to stage a demonstration.â€” CHAS.
