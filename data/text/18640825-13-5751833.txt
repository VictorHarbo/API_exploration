COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Aladras, with the August mall from the Australian colonies, will sail from Hobsou's Bay at the usual hour on Friday, the 2fith inst., and will he followed ou Satur- day by the steamship Great Britain, with gold/passengers, cargo, and a ship mail, for Liverpool. The latter will probably be larger than usual, from the increased rate of postago now exacted for letters by the Indian route. The Juno mails from England were delivered punctually by the Northam. The usual anti- cipatory advices, via Adelaide, were received on the morning of tho 10th inst, the Bal- clutha having made tho run from King George's Sound to Glenelg inninety- fourhours. The now ratea of postage will be found in another column. The Post- office authorities have atlast adopted a system of late-lettor fees for the English mail. It has been an- nounced that late letters for France, or foreign countiies via France, will be received at the General PoBtofnceup to eleven o'clock a.m. on the morning of the 2Ctb, for a fee of Gd. if posted before half-past ton a.m., or of Is. if between half-past ten and eleven o'clock. Late letters for the United Kingdom, British possessions, and foreign countries vid the United Kingdom, will be received at the hoad office up to noon, for a fee of 6d. up to half-past ten a.m., and of Is. after that hour. Areceiv ing-box is placed at Sandridge Town Pier, where letters will bo received np to one o'clock p.m., for a fee of Is. 6d. ; and letters will be received on board np to the time of sailing, for a fee of 2s. In all these caaes, the fees are to bo prepaid in stumps. STATE OF TRADE. The month of July-August, like that of June-July, is usually one of the dullest of the year in Melbourne. The roads are usually in so bad a state that merchants do not attempt to send heavy good?, excepting along the railway and the few macadamised roads in the colony. At ' this season, the remoter diggings are scarcely approachable by loaded drays; and packing to the ranges of Gipps Land, where the miners are now settling in numbers, is all but impracticable. This week, for example, a merchant discovered that a quantity of goods despatched by him three months ago are still undelivered, and on the road somewhere. Aa soon as spring seta in, and with the drying up of the roads the wool begins to come down for shipment, buslnoss revives. This year, there is an expectation that trado will become comparatively brisk a little earlier than usual. Tho wool from the lately taken np onuntry on the Warrego, one of the chief head-waters of the Darling, is paid to bo on the way down Eer steamer to Echuca, from whenco it will o brought to Melbourne or Williamstown by the Mulray River line (nearly completed), at a charge of 8s. per bale. As the yield of gold continues very good-some of the larger Bal- larat mines especially giving magnificent re- turns-and as new gold-fields in Gipps Land aTe likely to be opened up with the melting of the snow on tho mountains, there is a fair prospect of a good spring and summer trade. During the month of July ninety persons filed their schedules. Of these insol- vencies eleven were within the jurisdiction of the Geelong Court. The amount of liabilities generally waB small. The largest failure was that of Mr. W. C. Yuille, whose liabilities were stated at £G,98S, and his assets at £930. The next was that of Henry Goldschmidt, late of Chiltern, whose assets were £1,018, as against liabilities amounting to £3,119. At a meeting of the creditors of the late Mr. S. Maurice, it was found that the liabilities, so far as had been ascertained, amounted to £7,800, and the assets to £3,600. In Mel- bourne credit has been well sustained. The unfortunate depositors in the Provident In- stitute have received a further dividend of 2s. per pound, bringing the dividend up to 9s. 6d. in the pound. The assets still to be realized are nominally worth about £20,000. The shipments repotted by the mail are regarded aa being heavy, but prices gonorally have been well sustained. The heaviness of the Btocka in hand has prevented anything like speculation on a large scale, but Bales have not been forced, merchants preferring to w ait quietly for the spring trade. Tbe auction sales, which are increasing in number, havo interfered with the wholesale trader to some extent. In tobacco there has been a fall of about 2d. per lb. on the finer sorts, and of from Is. to Is. Gd. on twists,in conseqnenceof the largeness of the shipments from England and New York. A greater depreciation would probably have occurred but for the proba- bility of an export duty being placed upon the article in the New Customs Duties Bill of the Federal States. Candles have also slightly declined, also because of excessive shipments. The Neva Stearine Company have reduced their price to 9Jd. Kerosene is expected to rule fitmly, and considerable quantities have been sold to arrive at a price which shows an expectation of moderate supplies and good value. In COBTSO salt there has been some little speculation, and a rise of from 10¿. to 20s. per ton in vsiue. Imported provisions of all Borts have been dull of sale, though latterly Sinclair's hams have been inquired for. Case brandy, of the best sort?, is in de- mand ; but the price has been affected by the larger quantity of inferior brands and quali- ties now in the market. Bice is scarcely so firm as it was, and toa is also slightly castor, though the supplies of both expected are un- usually small. Sugar has advanced in valuo. In flour there has been a great reaction. Qunlitiea for which from £29 to £30 were a'ked a month ago havo fallen to £21 and £22. Tina has been occasioned by the arrival of several cargóos from Valparaiso, and tbe advicea of shipments of wheat and flour to a considerable extent from Lou- don and Liverpool. The feeling baa some- what improved again, and flour may be quoted as 20s. per ton bettor since the be- ginning of the week. So far the young crops look well, though the woim is reported aa having appeared in various places ; but we are Btill a long way from harvest, and though stocks in Tasmania are low, the expected supplies aro likely to roach a profitable market. McFsrs. Goldsbrough and Co. held a salo of about SCO bales of wool on Monday last, the whole of which were readily disposed of at very full pricep, advances on previous rates to the extent of 2d. to 3d. being in some cases obtained. These bales were taken for ship- ment by the Great Britain, to be in time for the November sales. The steamship Claud Hamilton continues to tun between Melbourne and Auckland; and the probability of the war being ended early leads to tho hope that our trade with Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, Picton, Sus,, will soon be considerably extended. Mr. M'Culloch, however, bos ingeniously Bhelvod for the present the question of subsidised stoam communication with Auckland. His promise, on the part of the Government, given to a deputation from tbo Chamber of Com- merce, to cortesnond with tho Imperial authoiitles as to tuu Bclectlon of Molbourno over Sydney as the Australian port of depar- ture of tho Intercolonial Boyal Mall steamers means nothing but tho postponement of tho question indefinitely. Mr. J. Chatfield Tyler, whose name has been so long associated with immigration at this port, haB received the appointment of collector of customs at Melbourne, a no st ren- dered vacant by the retirement of Mr. Dry borough. Mr. John Guthrie, who has long been the collector of customs at Geelong, now adds to those duties that of inspector-general of cuetomB for tho colony. BANK RETURNS. Since last month the usual quarterly state- ment, showing the average amount of tho liabilities and^ assets of the Bank of Now South Wales within the colony of Victoria, haB beon published. It shows the total of the liabilities to be, ia round numbers, £1,369,013. This amount is made up as fol- lows:-Notes in circulation not bearing inte- rest. £197,269; bills not bearing interest, £3,818; balances due to other banks, £20,335: deposits not bearing interest, £607,146 ; ana depositsbenringiutereal, £640,414.

At tho tenth annual meoting of the Colo, nial Insurance Company, the balance- sheet shown presented the following results: Liabilities-Unclaimed dividends, £118 ; and capital, £40,8G9. Assets-InveBted capital, namely, life assurance loans, £18,436; and fixed bank deposits, £10,044 ; bills receivable (secured), £2 098 ; bank and agents' balances, £1,284; mortgage?, £7,950; amounts due from mortgagors and borrowers, £662; in terept accrued, £613 The revenue is stated at-From premiums (after deducting £2,832 for r-ommieBion, rebates, and reinsurances), £17,708; interest, £3,330; and transfer fees, £32 ; total, £21,070. The miscellaneous ex penses were £3,708 ; and the losses, £7,994 ; leaving the profit at £9,367. The following report by the directora was read : " The directors have to announce a satisfactory result baillie: attended tlio operations of tho past twelve months, tho bataneo to tho credit of the profit and loss account on 30th Juno last being £9,367 0s. Sd. In tho Tiro department tho anticipa- tions expressed in tho last annual report will bo found to liavo been realized to a very considerable extent, the dirortors being in a position to declare a dividend out of tho profits of this department of five per cent, for the half-jcar on tho paid-up capital, togothcr with a bonna of fivo per cent, which will gil o £327 ISs. 4d. to be carried to the credit of the profit and loss account, and leave the accumulations of tho life fund intact In the life dcpirtmont, tho diroctors havo tho gratification of reporting the continuance of a steady increase of busi- ness Since their last report, 143 proposals havo been submitted for their consideration Of these 120 havo boen accepted and completed, producing an annual In- come of £2,01012s. ejd.

At the meeting of the Australasian "Fire and Life InBnrance Company, the report of the director" and tho balance-sheet were adopted. Messrs. "W. J. T. Clarke, Edward Cohen, and Joseph Griffiths were returned to the boird of directors, the two former having been re elected. It appeared, as regards the recently formed life branch of the buaine=s, that ainoo the 4th of April 133 proposals, insuring sums amounting to £84,000, had been sent in, and eiylity- eight,insuring £64,000, accepted. Thece have, so far, yielded premiums amounting to £1,600-Borne quarterly, some half-yearly, and some yearly-or at the Tate of £6,000 per annum. It may also be mentioned that four fifths of the entire body of shareholder* voted at the election to-day. A special general meet- ing will be called to authorize the capitali- zation of £25,000, as proposed by the directors. In their report the directors congratulated the shareholders on the " continued advance- ment and prosperity of the company." They say:-"The net profit for the half-year amounts to £26,874 7s. 9d, against £22,879 14s. 2d. for tho similar period in 1863, making, with the previous undistributed profit, a total of £28,690 3a. 4d. to the credit of profit and loss. Your directors propose, after paying the usual dividend at the rate often per cent, per annum, to appropriate the sum of £25,000 to capitalizing 10s. per share on the £50,000 shares held in the company, leaving a balance of £1,190 3s. 4d. remaining to the credit of prob j and loss. Your directors, find- ing tho present premiaeB totally inade- quate for the increased business of the company, have availed themselves of a favourable opportunity of purchasing a piece of land on which to erect suitable offices." The balance sheet shows receipts amounting to £63,051 ; losses-fire £«,330, and marino £20,770, and expenses £3,5o4-ia all £36,677. The available balance, therefore, was £26,374. A prospectus has been issued of a new in- surance offico, to be known as the " Southern Insuranco Company (Limited)," the business of which, in the first instance, is to be con- fined to marine risku. Tho capital propoaed is £1,000,000, in 200,000 shares of £5 each, 60,000 of which only will be issued in the first instance. The lint of provisional directors embraces roanv well- known and influential names. The project is placed before the public "tinder the conviction that the esta- blishment in Melbourne of another fitst-claaa insurance company is rendered desirable by the rapidly increasing trade of the colony, and by tho accumulation of capital offering for If gltimato investment" The applications for shares are numerous, and the list closes to day. Piivntcly, a prospectus has been issued of the " Finance and Credit Company of AUB. traíanla (Limited)." It is propoaed that this association should be registered under the Companies Statute, with the head office ia Melbourne. The capital ia proposed at £1,000,000, in 60,000 shares of £20 each; but it is not proposed that more than £50,000 should be raised in this colony. It ia stated that " arrangements will ba made with one of the leading financial companies to place the shares, to take up deposits for the company, and to act as their agents in London, on terms which will be mutually advantageous." The capital of the company would be employed in foster- ing and encouraging pastoral, agricultural, vine growing, and mining pursuits, und gene- rally to advance the interests of all new and legitimate industrial enterprises. It would not, therefore, interfero with the legitimate business of banking and insurance companies, or mortgxgo and trust companies. Thors is, undoubtedly, ample room in this colony for the operations of such a company, and for all the cn pit al which can be brought into use by its means. It is placed before the publio under excellent auspices, and, we trust, will be taken in hand earnestly and energeti- cally. The prospectus has been issued of a dry dock company, for the purposo of construct- ing a dock on the site of Chessell's slip, on tho south bank of the Yarra, opposite the Australian Wharf. It ia proposed that the dock shall bo capable of taking in ships draw- ing thirteen and a half feet of water, the deepest water on the bar at the highest tides. For iron vessels such a dock would be parti- cularly useful, as it would bring them near to the engineering establishments. The prospectus states that tbe cross tonnage of the steamers belonging to and trading from the port is 15,000 tons, and there are fully 500 Bailing vessels, of an aggregate burden of 70,000 tons, belonging to the port, besides others trading from it. The proposed capital is £20,000, in shares of £50 each. The esti- mate for the dock is £13,700, and it is stated that a well known contractor has made an offer to carry out the contraot for a less sum. The plans are by Mr. Elsdon, of the Mel- bourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company. At an extraordinary meeting of the share- holders of the Otago Steam Navigation Com- pany, held at Dunedin on the 2nd Inst., it waa resolved to write off the loss of tbe s.a. Scotia, and to extend tho company's operations, in accordance with the propositions made to them by a large company in England. Cap- tain Newlands, late of the s.S. Scotia, proceeds home ovetland, to superintend the O. S. S. Company's business in tho mother country. The proposed European and Australasian Banking Company has made no great pro- gress during the month. Tho projector writes tous as follows: " Sir,-ïou did mo tho honour to notice my new project In your Issuo of tho 23rd ult., and iilso In your summary of the 25th July, for willoh accept my thanks.

At the adjourned meeting of the Newcastle and Minmi Coal Company, Mr. Alexander Brown agreed for himself 'and to recommend to his brother) not to press for payment of the mortgage of £25,000 held by them, bnt to accept payment of one-half the sum in 1807, and the other half in 1809, interest to be paid in the meantime at the rate of peven per cent, per annum. The meeting was still further adjourned to permit of such an arrangement being made. It was stated that payment of the call now due, and the sale of the tug Bungaree, would enable the company to get out of its other difficulties. We leam by telegram that the mine has been cleared of water, and will bo again at work in a few days. GOLD AND EXCHANGE. The reduced rate of exchange for sixty-day bills, which, last month, was one- half per cent, premium, has, to a certain extent, affected the price of gold, which is now quoted £1 15s, 3d. per standard ounce, for considerable parcels, or a fall of from 3d. to 6d. per ounce. The reduction would have been greater but for the demand for gold for India. Those statisticians who watch the import of the precious metals at home will do well to note tho rapid change which is taking place in the destination of the precious metals exported from this colony. Our gold now nearly all goes to India and the East. The shipments per Bombay last month were as fellow :-Gold-Agra Bank, 13,240oz. 9dwr.; Bank of Australasia, 12,334oz ; Orientai Bank Corporation, ll,364oz. 13dwt. ; Bank of New South Wales, 10,017oz. 6dwt. ; Central Bank of Western India, 7,9G4oz. lldwt.: Bank of Victoria, 7,860oz. 11 Iwt.; Messrs.

The rates of exchange upon London for sixty days'sight bank drafts, by this mail, may be quoted at a quarter per cent, premium to one-half per cent, discount, according aa the sellers are willing to take local discounts or cash paj ment In exchange. Upon tho East the rates aro BB follow, viz.:-Bombay, Cal- cutta, and Madras, at thirty days' sight, 2a. Oid. per rupee ; Ceylon, two and a half per cent, premium ; Hong Kong and Singapore, 4B. lOtf. per dollar; and Mauritius, ás. 2d. per dollar. Interest on deposits ia allowed at the fol- lowing rateB, viz. :-One montb, three per cent, per annum ; three months, four ana a half per cent, per annum ; and six months, six per cent, per annum. In some instances, a higher rate is given for deposits at six and twelve monthB. The rates of discount remain without alteration-viz., eight, nine, and ten per cent., for two, three, and four months' paper respectivi-ly. Tbe clearances of gold during the week ended the 20th inst. amounted to 2,946oz., making the total shipments since the com- mencement of the year l,093,189oz. ; of which quantity 948,170oz. were the produce ? of Vic- toria, and 145,019oz. transhipments from New Zealand. The shipments made bonce during the corresponding period of laat year were l,012,504oz. of Victorian gold, and 183,478oz. of New Zealand gold, giving a total of l,195,982oz. KAILWAT TRAFFIC.

Although the woather has been very severe nttimea on the Australian coast, especially New South Wales, we have no casualties ?of any importance to report. The Gem, schooner, sunk in tho Yarra by collision during the floods, has been raised for repairs. The schooner Diana, of Melbourne, has boen wrecked on a reef in Torres Straits. For Borne months past questions have been pul as lo the fate of the American Jack Frost, thip, Emory, master, which sailed from this rent on the 31st January last. Mr. Hilton, chief officer of the Drover, brig, theu bound to Newcastle from Dunedin, states that, ou or about the 1st February, the Drover and Jack Fro't were in company together off the Snares, about sixty miles from thiB port, when a pudden squall took both vessels, throwing the Drover on her beam-ends. The weather coming on thick at the time, he lost sight of the Jack Frost. About half an hour after tho squall took them the weather cleared up, and on looking for the Jack Frost she WOB nowhere to be seen ; therefore it ia fairly supposed she must have been blown over. She had all sall Bet, and was flying Tight. There can now be no doubt as to the end of thiB line ship and all hands.-Invercargill Despatch, July 30. The Pi ince Begent, which was chartered with coals for this port, is understood to have proceeded into Sydney, in consequence of being leaky or disabled after leaving New- castle, and it is expected that she wonld dis- charge her cargo there. The Prince Regent, now a collier, was at one time George the Fourth's yacht, and Btill retains in her cabin some of her original handsome decorations. Hobart Town. Mercury, Aug. 2. The following notification, under the hand of the Commissioner of Custornp, appears in the"Gazeíf« of this evening :-" With reference to the 'notice' in the Government Gazette, dated 25th March, 1859, the following con- ditions under which 'permits' will be granted to seamen to engagj^with masters of ves SOIP, in the absenciMif certificates of dis . charge, are published for general informa- tion, viz. :-1.

Tho Argus Offlco, Wednesday Evonlng. Our report of tho transactions of tho month sinco tho departure of tho July mall is anything but en- couraging to shippers from tbo homo market. Tho fulness of stocks, and caution on the part of pur- chasers, rcduco sales to a vciy limited amount. Busi- ness was showing a rather improving tendency up to the arrival of the mall, but tho announcement of tho largo increase in tho amount of shipments to this as well as to tho neighbouring colonies, who havo boon latterly considerable purchasers in this markot, has hod a very unfavourable effect on transactions. Thero has boen a complote cessation of speculation ; and although moderate stocks of some few descrip- tions of imported goods In tho adjoining colo- nies havo Induced a temporary demand, no per- manent advnnco in oven tho valuo of theso few articles has boen established. Business Is sound, but trade is by no means brisk ; and if continued excessive shipments aro made, present quotations cannot bo supported. Ales and stout, both ¡n bottle and draught, havo been in unusually limited inquiry oven for tho season of the year, and the demand at present consists sololy of supplies for ¡inmediato use. Tho following aio tho present quotations, but to effect any sales of ox tcnt lower ratos would havo to bo submitted to : New Brewery Co.'s Corlislo, £0 15s. to £7 ; Bass's No. 3 (new), £6 10s. to £7 ; Joule's (now), £8 16s. per lilid. ; Alhopp's, £0 10s. ; Byass s, bottled, 0s. to 9s. 3d, ; London ai.d Colonial Co.'s, Ss. 0(1. to 0s. ; All- sopp'», 0s. 3d. to 9s. 0d. ; othor bottlers', 8s. to 8s.

Candles.-Tbo market for this artlclo continues vory depressed, and the system of effecting sales by auction appears to have becomo so gcnornl that no othor me- thod of salo Is looked to for their disposal.
