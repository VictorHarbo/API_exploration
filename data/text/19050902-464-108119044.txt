[?] SETTLERS' NOTES. An Irish blight ia very bad among potatoes in ? New Zealand. The Queensland Show was a great success, and a record this year. A poultry fanners' co- operative company has been formed at Liverpool. The wheat crop of Western Canada this year is estimated at 100,000,UUU bushels. Paper milk bottles will soon be on ths market in the United States of America. The English wheat crop this year is a heavy one, as also is that of some European countries. From recent cables we learn that there will be very little wheat exported from Russia this season. A dairymen's association has been formed in the Hawkesbury district with a view of protecting the industry. Mr. Lance, Commercial Agent, says that Queens land pine is equal to any timber for butter boxes. He should know. This year's wheat crop in the United States of America is estimated to yield between 6-j,000,000 and 700,000,000 bushels. Owing to the great increase of population in the United States of America there will be very little wheat available for export. Tamworth Dairy Company manufactured during July 14- tons of butter, and paid suppliers £1300 net, including the half-year's bonus. The Dubbo Stock Inspector, Mr. Dulling, says herbage on the Bogan is abundant; stock is in splsudid condition, and the crops are looking mag nificent. At a meeting of persons interested in the dairy ing industry held at Germanton lately it was de cided to form a co- operative company with capital of £3000. A movement is on fott amongst the Clarence Ri ver Dairymen's Association to purchase the factory belonging to the Fresh Food and Ice Company, si tuated at Grafton. The Gunnedah Show, which was held last week, proved a great success from all standpoints. All the exhibits were of a high order, and the atten dance was a record one. The English butter market is firm, with a strong demand and small supplies. Danish is selling at 122s per cwt., Queensland is quoted at 102s, and New South Wales as 100s to 104s per cwt. The English wheat markets are dull, owing to large supplies of the new crop. Continental mar kets are quiet and American firm. Cargoes are firmly held, with 32s 10£d asked off coast and 32s 6d for shipment. Th9 Farmers' and Settlers' Association has been resuscitated at Nevertire. Mr. G. Murphy was elected president ; Messrs. A. M'Donald and ' T. Tyers, vice-presidents; Mr. M. M'Donald, secretary; Mr. L. Campbell, treasurer. During the first eight months of the present year Great Britain imported 27,700,000 quarters of wheat; France, 1,050,000; Germany, V, 000,000; Belgium, 5,675,000; Holland, 1,955,000; Italy 4,125,000; Sweden, 1,000,000; Spain, 1,4-95,000. The exports of wheat and flour from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland since December 1 last amount approximately to 28,393,375 bushels, leaving the quantity to bs ship ped 2,397,738 bushels. New South Wales' share of the exports totals 6,162,384, leaving 337,616 bushels still available for export. It has conx9 to the knowledge of Mr. Moore, Minister for Agriculture, that efforts are being made to induce wine growers to use 'Surcrose' to make sweet wines. The Director of Agriculture states that wine growers should be on the alert against the adoption of this adulterant, as the use of saccha rine, or any of its components, is prohibited by the Wine Adulteration Act. The Grenfell Show, held last week, was a most pronounced success. Mr. Hogue, Chief Secretary, performed the opening ceremony. Mr. J. S. P. Newman, of Adelargo, won the champion prize for merino ram, and Mr. Alf Bemrick champion for merino ewe; Mr. A. E. Sharp won the hunters with Silver King. The award for the best draught pull ing horse, for which there were 12 entries, was won by Mr. J. Stein. To help moulting and to tone up the whole sys tem of birds, the following may be used with suc cess:; — Add to each quart of the feed one table spoonful of the following mixture : One ounce each carbonate of iron, pulverized gentian root, black antimony, mandrake, ginger, and flour of sulphur; three ounces bicarbonate of soda, four ounoss flax seed meal. Start feeding this at the beginning of the moulting season, and use every other day until the fowls have their new feathers. ? ? ? MEETINGS OF LOCAL LAND BOARDS.

Although the praises of Paspalum dilatatum have been sounded from many quarters, still there are those who think the grass unable to resist drought, or to grow in drought-stricken country. Mr. Elliot J. Rien, of Wyee, gives his experience of tha grass as follows in the columns of the 'Agricultural Gazette' : — My experience of the grass may be of interest. I may say I have not seen its equal for adapting itself to any condition and kind of soil, or wi.h standing drought, fire, and flood. ? Having been at Wyee, you know the kind of soil hereabout. Some years ago I obtained a small packet of seed and scattered it around, some in sandy soil, where it grew and prospered ; some in the garden ; and seme in a hole often covered with water, and it seemed to thrive alike in all places. In the garden, where the soil was good, of course it made belter growth. This year we had seven months with scarcely any rain, the soil was cracfesd all over with deep sun cracks, everything was parched and dry, and ihan, over all, the bush fire passed, and then a flood; notwithstanding all these adverse conditions, Pas palum dilatatum came up smiling, and as strong as ever. I scatter seed in the bush and all around, and it starts ahead and overruns the indigenous grasses. I am fully persuaded now that if we can get the land here planted with this grass it will become of somo value. A DURABLE WHITEWASH. A durable whitewash and one which wiii adhei'e well may be made as follows: — Lime, 30 pounds; tallow, 4 pounds; salt, 5 pounds. Dissolve the salt in the water used in slaking the lime, stir in the tallow while the heat remains from slaking, and add enough more water to make tho wash flow well from the brush or work well with the spray pump. One does not spray hen-houses merely to look pretty, but rather to get the killing effect of sharp lime wash. Ths edge is taken off the lime io some extent by the additions. For the outside of buildings and for fiances, tree-trunks, etc., where the main point is fco get long life to the covering and to lessen the rubbing off by contact, the recipe given above is very good. * « ? . ? WHEAT- GROWING IN AUSTRALIA AND CANADA. We hear a lot of the wondprful advantages of Canada as a country for farmers, and many in ducements are pub forward from time to time to ! encourage settlement in that country as against Australia. The following, by T. R. D., in the Sydney 'Mail,' will be read with interest: — If our wheat production does not make the rapid progress that our extensive areas of suitable land would seem to justify, the explanation is probably to be found in the fact that our limited population is under taking as much of this industry as is conssitent with attendance to all the other profitable rural occupations inviting attention, especially grazing. In Canada the farmer must grow wheat, for his climate will not admit of his keeping stock. If, for instance, the immigrant in the Canadian north wisst finds that there is no profit in growing wheat 1500 miles from the sea-board and carting it from 10 to 30 miles over roadless country to a railway station, he cannot, like the Australian farmer, fall back upon, grazing. The best he can do is to grow oats and feed sheep in his barn. ? * * CODLIN MOTH SPRAY. Representations having been made to the Minister for Agriculture to the effect that the spraying regulations of South Australia had been suspended as useless for the destruction of the Codlin moth, the following letter, by our Government Entomo logist, from Mr. Quinn, Chief Inspector of South Australia, will prove interesting and instructive to our orchardists. He says : — The field regulations have fallen into abeyance because our growers have had wonderful success, and have so unanimously adopted the use of the arsenite of soda in lime-water spray (Kedzie's for mula), that we no longer consider it necessary to insist on bandaging, etc., though many still adopt the practice purely on their own account as an auxiliary method of prevention. The use of the spray has become so general that I have no hesita tion in saying that our increased export has been mainly due for the past two seasons to the much larger quantity of sound apples se&ulting; from the work. I can compare the effect of its rapid adop tion to nothing but the utilization of the phos phatic fertilizer by our (farmers, so greatly has it raised the hopes of our apple- growers here. I append a few names, each a leading grower in his locality, with whom I would suggest you commu nicate if you desire proof from 'the man behind the pump.' To this Mr. Quinn appends eighteen well-known names. Kedzie's compound, which is now much used in preference to Paris green among the apple-growers as being more effective, is composed of the follow ing materials: — White arsenic, lib; washing soda, 41b ; water, 1 gallon. The ? materials are boiled until dissolved, which takes only a few minutes. When making up for use, add 40 to £-u gallons of water to a pint, and 2 to 4 lb of fresh slacked . lime. The stock mixture can be put away if not used at once, and will keep for any lengih of time if corked up. This wash has been us£d in the Orange district with great success against the pear and cherry slug, which dies as soon as the spray hits it.
