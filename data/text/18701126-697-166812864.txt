The , bold Qi:d luiy^xdous project was the subject of much amapcnu'nt ut tii«. ViJnc, and about 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon the tiny ' cmft was signallrd approaching our harbour. At 6 o'clock the ! ColiectoiV tug Ktarted down the harbour and met the venture- | Mjme marino's, at about a o'clock, opposite the lower light, and : tuWfdUicm to this city. The boat which has thun aecnmplishwl 1 a voyage h- hiuuu-dou^ and ho altogether novel is named the City , of litiirUftu, ih nvf.nty feet in length over all, six feet j bc;uit, una two lect eight inches in dupth, drawing i two feet of water ; she is yawl-rigged, and ftp -c.ids | seventy yard* of uoiv^ts ; is fitted with a two-bladed Ktcam propeller; worked by hand, and her hull is o) wood, the board*; being only one-hali inch in thickness. In this miniatiu-c hUip are aU the airasgemcnvs for cooking, icc., and the capacitv foj- ean-j'ing provisions and water enfticient i'or the voyage ^h'.en ha^j^l^t b«n ?*o eucecFsfally terminated. The crew eonsiKf? of two men, John Charity Berkeley, the commandcr, and Nicholas Priniorax. Theje ai-e two men 'who, actuated as the former Rays by a ' niero whira,' were induced to make this attempt 'whicu j row could icgard at: anything but foolhardincss, after seeing the craft in which Un-y laiuich'ea their deiitinies and hung their lives by a mne thread. . The former had followed the pea Iront boyhood, and has . passed an eventful liic. He saved two lives of!' the cooKt of Kent on the 2.g.th o i September, 1W3£, for which hp was awarded a mcdui by the Brilifeb Humane Society. He is an lrl-.linia3i, and hc^ a home in Dublin. Ills companion is an Au^trlar.. on 'J'iiursiLiy, Jur.e 2nd, these daiir.g spirits launched Uifir bark, and, aecorapanied only by a dog, left Liverpool. In ton -biys th*»y put into Ciuecnstown, where they were obliged Jo remain iour *lavs, in order to have some caulking done on thiiiv boat, -which was leaking, and left there on the 16th, having on board one ton of ballast and 500 weights coal. They took the northerly route, the same as taken by the Cambria, the pre vailing win&5 being westerly, and for the first thirty-live days they snflered a great deal, being kept wet through continually, T3cy vcrc aiso unable to cook in the first part of the voyage, and were compelled to cat their meat raw, which added to their discomfort, and helped te dis courage them. After being eight days .out they be came short of firewood, with no nicans of getting a ! Htpply. At thin tone they very luckily picked up a barrel co» i mining about four gallons bf tar, which was a perfect god-send, they using the tar upon the dccks and the barrel for fuel. On the 4th July they celebrated the day of the great republic,' drinking the health of General Grant in some prime Irish whfcky, with which they wcjt supplied. On the evening of that day |herc was a heavy gale, through which however, .they rode safely. On the 28th August they lost one of their crcw, the dog, who died from sciu*vy. They bad a gi'cat dual of heavy weather, hut the little barque bore herself nobly, and the men themselves c- pressed suiprise that she rode the heavy gain so stanchly. .She wa* leaking aU the way, and the pumps, of which tl.ey have' two, were kept at work constantly. lfi tic severe gale of last Saturday they experienced the hardest time of the voyage, bat suffered no disaster save the carrying away of the jigger boom. The largest^ umber of miles made in one oay was 153, which was made in the first part of the voyage, and the smallest eleven miles. The average . speed was four knots an hour. A number of vessels were spoken on the voyage, among which were the barque Badcliffe, on the 28th of June, bound to Quebec; the ship Maxwell, August 9, and the homeward bound steamer Russc, August 24. From the first two of these they took in supplies of provisions and water. Two whales were very neighbourly off Cape Clear, coming near enough to be touchcd witii the hand, and giving the voyagers some ahum lest tliejr should upset their frail ship. One of ' Mother Carey's Chickens' attended them from the time thev left Queens town till they passed George's Bank. The men say that they had the most perfect confidence in the success of their uiterprihc, and in the roughest gale could go to sleep with tbe greatest composure,' .Only the -lateness of the season prevents them from returning home as they came. Their original intention was to go direct to New York, i but they conciudcd to put into this port and will go* from here to tbq former place, and will remain this side of the Atlantic till another summer. They were towed to Long Wharf by the lug, and . there can be seen the smallest of all crafts that ever traversed the broad Atlantic. — JJo-stoft Herald, September Q. NEWCASTLE.

GoCertirnmit Gazette, l&fA; Kor ember.) iTn-; following information relative to a sand-bank supposed to Ibe the Diana of Bouganvillc, which is placed 100 miles further ea»t in the Admiralty Chart, and marked doubtful ; has been fur nished by Captain Edwards, the owner of tbe Kate Kearney. Fiuncih HrxsoN, Superintendent. \- Sydney, 14th November, 1870. , ' Cajitidn Hastings, ot the Kate Kearney, reports having seen on VtA phs-*age from 'Sydney to Lizard Island, a sand-bank not laid down on the chart, in latitude 1.V40 south, longitude 149'3b r»*t, tbi8 position may be depended on, as Jie made Lizard Island 40 houj-s' after. 'This is no doubt the Diana Bank, scm by Bouganvillc, in lTpS. in this neighbourhood, but not identified since as it is out ? of the track of shipping bound through Torres Straits bv Raine Ibland, or Bligh's entrance ; it is probable that BouganvUic's two shoal* will be found 150 miles west of this new found bank. 'Fydnry, November 10th, 1870.' NOTICE TO MARINERS. Tnr llear-Adiniral Commander of the Naval Forces and Chjcf of the Marine Department in Netherlands India informs parties interested that the following alterations have been made in tlie beacons to and in Batavia Roads. 1\. The ball beacon of ' Nccrstuk 99 has been taken up and re placed by two white Herbert's beacon- casks moored on the north-west and south-cast points of the rocf. 2\. A second black Herbert's bcacon-ca6k has been placed on the south-east point of the ' Noptunus ' shoal. A while dioptric harbour light of the Cth class will be erected on Tnrdjong, Laboc (Lepar Inland), Macclesfield Straits, which i will probably be lighted in the beginning of October of theprc i sent year. The light lights the whole horizon, is about 12 Dutch yards above high sea-level, visible at a distance of 2 geogj-aphical (8 English) miles, and in connection with the now existing light on To. Tjelagien, will facilitate the passage through Maeclcsfield ' Strait* by night. The captain of the Netherlands Indian brig Johanna reports that, tacking near the island of Tannah Mirrah (N.E. coast of Borneo), he anchored on account of decrease in depth, and a reddish discolouration of the water in three fathoms, on the following bearings S.W, point of Tannah Mirrah N.W. by W. S.E. point of Tannah Mirrah N. by W. Found hnh' a cable's length south of the anchoragc a shoal with 1 fathom water extending in a S.E. direction. ' , The danger is placed in folding's Chart of Macassar Straits, page 1, in 118*4*15 E. longitude, and 3*29 N. latitude. The name captain reports the existence of a reef along the southern pait of Tannah Mirrah, extending about £ mile to sea ward. The ship PureOoie struck on a hitherto unknown submerged rock from whicb tho Peak of Gaspar Island bears S. fa E. at a diEtancc of lj£ geographical -6 English) miles. On the chart of Gaspar Straits, by De Roy van Quidewiju, the danger is placed ih 2*19' S. latitude, and 107*4*10' E. longitude. The following cxtract from the log-book of tbe Swedish ship Condor has been received: — 'Saturday, 16th July. At 12 o'clock midnight tacked round the N.tf. Tockockcmoe Island (Knrimata Straits), bearing 6.W. by £., at a distance of two geographical (eight English) miles. At half-past 2 a.m., going at the rate of live English miles, the vessel touchod the ground, but could not perceive that her speed was checked. Kept away round the N.N.W. to avoid the danger. Sounded the pumps and found the vessel to be leaky.' - The danger is placcd on Edcling's Chart of the West Coast of Borneo, page II., .in 2'22'20a S. latitude, and 10&-37-15. E. longitude. The above are true translations of eight notices received from the Real Admiral at Batavia. Fiusns Mackab, Consul of the Netherlands. Tbe Real1 Admiral Commander of the Naval Forces and Chief of the Masine Department in Netherlands India, iu continuation of the advertisement of the Director of Moan6 and Domains, pub lished in the Jara Gazette of 4th and 7th December, 18GG, Nos. 97 and 98, informs parties interested, that on -the 1st October, 1870, the red dioptric floating light, south of reef 'GrootLae Lae ' (Macassar) mentioned therein, will be extinguished and replaced by a dioptric harbour light, 6th class, erected on shore south of ' Losaiic's Tomb,' which from said date will be exhi bited every night from sunset till sunrise. This light, which i6 12 Dutch yards above high sea level and lights half the horizon (180*), is divided in three sections, the centre one of which (30*) &feow;£ a red light, whilst the two others (each 75') exhibit a white light. Tne red light is visible within 2,' German geographical (3 English), and the white within 2 geographical (8 English) miles. The following bearings are taken from the light ' Beacon on ' Taka Pinjing ' or ' Goa Reef ' south 60*30 W. . Bcacon on the south point of Groot Lae Lac N. 67*30 W. i This light, in connection with the harboar light of Macassar, enables vessels to make for the south or south-west part of , Macat«cr. i To cflect this after sighting the red light south of ' Losarie's j Tomb ' steer right for this light with an easterly course, till the j white harbour light of Macassar bears north-east by cast and the ! lead shows less than seven fathoms of water, after whicb, with the same course and stecriijg more noi'fherly the more one ap proaches the anchorage, ^Macns&r; roads may be made without any danger. If before steering novth'fov the eoastyone of the white sedt:ons of the light is sighted, tiiis is a sign that the vessel Ls too close to ' Goa Reef ' (Taka Pinjing) or to the shoal of the 'Groot Lac Lac.' The commanding officer of his Majesty's steamer Cochoot n reports that the said vessel on a ci*uise along the S.E. cos.b- of Borneo, struck on a hitherto unknown shoal with hard sandy ground, on which the lead showed but two fathoms of water. On the chart of Macassar Strains, by A. C. J. Edcling, page II, this danger is placed in 3'57-SO South latitude, and 115*^7 -?*.?« i longitude of Greenwich. The Rear Admiral Commander of the Naval Forces and Chief of the Marine Department in Netherlands India, in continuation of the notice to mariners, 1870, No. 3, on the situation of the Jason's Rock, informs parties interested, that his Majesty's steamer Borneo ha6 examined the exact position of this danger, and found it to be situated on the following bearings :— Noord- warhter, N. 40* E., Western Po. Doea, ' N. 91* E., West Island of Po. Pablokhatv, N. 118* E. In Dyserink's chart Of 6unda Straits, this rock is placed in 5'L'G couth latitude, 106*16 vast longitude of Greenwich. The commanding officer of his Majesty's steamer Admiral v.in Kingsbergcn reports that the said vessel, sailing along the erfst coat»t of Hanko, struck on a hitherto unknown reef, the shoaiest part of which showed 6 feet of water. The bearings from the reef are as follows :— Tatawie Island, N.W. by N., Bocar Island N., Koba Flagstaff S.W. by W., Pcrlang Shoal'E.S.E. J E. M. fcpaandcrman, captain of the Dutch brig Doesborgh, sauiug in Banda Sea, discovered a hitherto unknown reef geographical (6 English) miles N.W. of Niia Wand, the easternmost, or the. South Western Islands. Latest Shipping. *?* See ' Shipping Gazette' on page 12. ARRIVALS. November 23. Hunter (s.), 310 toss, Csptsio Garde, from Clyde Hirer and Ulladulia 22nd instant. 1. 6. N.

In a volume of reference just published by the Bureau Veritas, we find the following account of the shipping of the world, which shows equally with the official figures the preponderating mari time position which England occupies : — Sailing Vessels.

It is evident too that the estimate of American tonnage includes a great many river craft only, America having very few ocean steamers, so that the real pre* ponderance of England in the ocean trade of the world is pro bably greater than what here appears. The Statistical Committee of Lloyd's have just published their annual analysis of wrecks and casualties reported in Lloyd's list. The analysis is for the year 1869, and contains a compari son in detail with the results of the three previous years. The excellence of the publication can hardly be exaggerated, and we hope to go fully into some of the results wliich are brought out. Meantime we may notice that 1869 as compared with the average was a light year of casualties. The average fer the last ten years has been 3343 per annum, but the number in 1869 was only 2936— the lowest oat one oi ten years, the next lowest having been the previous year, when the number was 2801. On the other hand, the losses of steamers have been greater *ii»n the average of the three preceding fears, though the losses of sailing ships have been less— a fact which perhaps only proves tbe great increase of the steam marine, but certaiily deserves to he noted. The figures are:— Casualties Average of three in 1869. preceding years. Steamers ... ... 1,247 ? 1,012 Ships ? 10,359 ? 10.453 The great cause of cesualties to steamers is still collision— that cause alone accounting for425 of the above casualties in 1869, or about 80 per cent., while in -the case of sailing ships that cause accounts for 1790, or about 17 per cent .—Economist, Sep tember 5.
