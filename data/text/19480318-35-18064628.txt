Resistance Fighters' Migration Prospects\ LONDON, March 17 (A.A.P.).-At present there appears to be little chance of former members of Euro pean wartime resistance movements migrating to Australia in large numbers. The Australian Minister for Immigration, Mr. Calwell, announced this week that members of the Dutch, Nor- wegian, Danish, French, and Belgian underground move- ments would be eligible for assisted passages to Australia. Shipping is the main problem. Under existing arrange- ments such people wishing to go to Australia would have to travel from Continental ports, and few passenger ships are leaving the Continent for Australia.. France, Belgium, Norway and Denmark discourage emi gration. Holland and Australia already have a small migration scheme in operation involving the use of existing shipping for Dutch farmers. Ex-Resistance fighters can- not at present travel in British ships because a foreigner can- not displace a Briton from migrant ship accommodation. The clamour from Britons for freehand assisted passages continues , to overwhelm the Australian Migration Depart- ment in London. Fearful Continentals often beseech the department to get them to Australia. There wdrc 157 last week. These are pcopie who hold Australian landing permits issued from Australia some time ago on compassionale grounds, but the department has to refuse them a passage.
