Mr. Ilonry Shulz, of BuU-ntrcot, South Preston, says:— " Iliad suffered with a complaint in my body which eventually reached my legs, and having been treated for yuars by several doctors during that time, 1 derived 110 benefit, but gradually got worse, until I was told hy them 1 1 would never get butter,' aud that 'they could do no mure for mo.' This tlmy could have told me yearn heforo uud saved mo ninny pounds. However, this Information was a great blow to me. To think that I hud lo liu iu bed a cripple and die for tho want of proper treatment was worse I ban death itself. But I have to thank God that ono day I wan handed 1 Tho Age' newspaper and staited to rcatl it, hut finding my sight war failing me 1 naked my son to read it to me. On looking down Hie Medical Column one advertisement iu particular which took my attention was nbnu t route very successful cures effected by W. Mimtiplay, of Bourke-streul. After hearing my son rend tho advertisement 1 decided to give him a trial, and (00k the first opportunity of doing so, and I solemnly declare flint lit twenty-four (21) hours' time I got morerolief than 1 ever got in many years' treatment hy all the doctor that treated me, and continued to regain my health and strength, and in eight (8) weeks I was as well us over I was in my life. But for tho sake of suffering humanity I would ndvisu nil who suffer not to waste their means foolishly, and then go to a person who can cure them, but to go at once and save their money, for I am per fectly Justified iti Raying that W. Mentiplny, nf Bourke- street, Melbourne, saved my lifo when others had given mo up, and what lie did for me lie could do fur others who have suffered likewise." This houc:'. onufesalon of Mr. Shulz must be beneficial to public sufferers, and if many others whom i have saved from an early grave would hoidiy speak out the tiuth, tho puhtio would benefit largely from thoir oxperi- euce of my treatment.
