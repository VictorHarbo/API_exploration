ITS CENTRAL POSITION is such that it must always command for tho edifice an exceptional value. In every great city there is otic main artery of traffic, one cc litre of rotuincrcu and linance, which always main tains its prc-omincticc. Collins-street enjoys this uuiqno distinction in Melbourne, and what is thought of it hy foreign capitalists is Rutlieieutly shown by the recent ercctinn tit an immense outlay of tho Equitable Life Assurance Society's offices iu the same thoroughfare.

The ARCHITECTURE of tiffs imposing block marks it out as one of the most attractive features of a street which lias become cele brated in this respect. It is admittedly tho tiuesl Gothic Invade in the city, arresting uttentiou by the symmetry, the harmony and the ornate character of its elevation, atxi the imprcssivu effect produced by the exterior of the building is heightened and continued by the grand entrance hall und marble staircase which coufroutyou iu the interior. In fact no money bus been spared iu render ing the structure worthy of its matchless sito. Tho INTERNAL All RANUEMENTS arc perfect. "The basement" forms a delightfully cool luncheon room, and the suited of offices on I he ground and upper floors are fitted with every modern conveni ence; while the thorough lighting is a special feature in the design, and should it lie considered desirable to re model the interior for any purpose, this could bo effected with comparative cose, and at a moderate cost. Tim land on which the building is erected has a FRONTAGE of 57 FT. 84 IN. To tho north Bide of CoUius-streot, by a d"ptli as to part of 143 ft. 94 in. with nccvRs to the side, and at rear by two roadways. It Is part of Crown allotment 5, section 14, city of Melbourne.
