OUR SYDNEY LETTER. (From Our Own Correspondent.) SYDNEY, July 21. If you took all that was said in the I newspapers concerning the Fitzroy scandal seriously, you would come to the conclusion that the whole State was ringing with the cries of the people against the system of Ministerial patronage which the Royal Commission has just exposed Nothing of the sort. The people had very little to say about it. The Opposition went into hysterics, and the reformers outside gashed a little, that was all The people made no sign, they read the papers, lifted up their eyes in horror, and said, 'Can those things be?" But they took no further stop to proclaim their indignation, if they really felt any Had they done so, the farcical proceedings connected with the second vote of censure moved by Mr Carruthers might have terminated differently But, beyond the few moving spirits in the realm of politics and newspaper letter writers, the people were silent This fact must have influenced many members Although it was shown during the debate that nothing could possibly be worse than the state of affairs at the dock, the people remained so apathetic that one may really be pardoned for suggesting that they had settled down into a condition of patient yet humiliating resigna- tion, waiting for the end with dull indifference As for the debate in the Assembly, the replies given by Sir John | See and Mr O'Sullivan to the allegations made by Mr Carruthers were char acoustic of those two gentlemen Sir John was irritable, indignant, and personal, Mr. O'Sullivan was, to some extent emotional It was he who had appointed the Royal Commission and, so far as his sins were concerned in connection with the dock he had acted "in the name of justice," and all he could be charged with was being too good natured " As you all know, the first division showed 32 for the Government and 1-2 for the Opposition, and the proceedings ended in a count out Only once before in the history of New South Wales had a vote of censure been counted out. It happened so many years ago that the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly has intimated that a most exhaustive search would have to be made to discover the date when it happened is stated in a previous letter, it would be exceedingly difficult, in the present condition of political affairs in this State, to forecast the result of the next general elections The moneyed and compara- tively well-to-do classes are continually complaining that the GoveranKUt New South Wales is subordinate to class inter eats, that close, of course, not being their own It is well to remember that at the general elections the percentage of votes cast has never exceeded 70 per cent Con sequently a percentage of almost one-third of the electors did not take the trouble to vote. But the working men invariably poll to the last man The voting power of the people will be duplicated under woman suffrage It is fair to assume that the 30 per cent representative people who are in the higher walks of life, and if they will not take the trouble to vote for what they call good government, they are not likely to receive much sympathy when legislation is passed that has a tendency to lighten their pockets It is an open secret that the proposal of the Government to have separate booths for the women voters in the big centres was to enable the wives and daughters and sisters of the well to do to record their votes without being compelled to rub shoulders with the poorer portion of the community It is on equally open secret that the Labour Party, rea] ising that this provision would militate seriously against their chances at the next general election, intimated, let 113 say in a polite manner, that the provision did not meet with their approval The Government struck it out. The politeness was but an instance of a mailed hand covered with a silken glove If, therefore, the female portion of the leisured classes decline to vote, and a spirit of conservatism does not over w helm the others at the polling booths it is almost certain that the next New South Wales general elections, unless some flagrant breaches take place in the interim, will give the See O'Sullivan Government a fresh lease of power The facts daily growing more apparent that the electors, while chafing beneath the yoke of the present Government, and growling continually at the Labour eau cus, are chary about trusting Mr Cann There, especially as his policy, so far as the other Reform League is concerned, is to bicker and to snarl To be sure, the other league plays the same boards. There is much talk of the report of the Royal Commission on the sites for the federal capital Although the Commission has made no recommendation, the general trend is, of course in favour of Tumut The Reid party no doubt considered at the time that the leader of the Federal Opposition had done New South Wales a good turn by securing a capital for this State, but it is now realised on a most all sides that the good of the concession is ephemeral There are the examples of America and Canada, it is admitted, and it may also be urged that for military and strategic purposes the capital should be inland But, went ed from a practical standpoint, many are expressing the opinion that one of the principal seaports, either Melbourne or Sydney, should be the seat of Government Most of those who talk so airily of placing the capital in Sydney or Melbourne forgot that even were the 100 mile limit and the New South Wales provision out of the Constitution Act, it would be impossible without a di were alteration of the Constitution, to make the capital of either of the cities named. in the Act there is a provision that the capital shall be federal terri- tory, and consequently, if Melbourne or Sydney he came the seat of Government, the electors of the chosen centre would be absolutely disfranchised, as far as the State elections are concerned. Sir John See admits this difficulty, and advocates an alteration of the Constitution He also points out that it would not be necessary to have cohesion in the federal territory, but that various spots might be proclaimed The provisions in the Constitution Act for alteration are, however, well safeguarded, and it is not likely that the majority of the members, with the omni- present State jealousies at work, would consent to such an amendment It is fondly imagined by a few persons that he lauding branch of our Public Library is doing a noble work in the cause of education Many of our citizens point to the catalogues with pride, and tell you that the young people of the city and suburbs may obtain the means of pursuing their studies free of charge, but they forgot to mention that the majority of the young people become mere hero of the institution, not because they may study the solid literature which the shelves contain, but purely for the sake of gratifying their taste for novel reading Take a work on history, or any other branch of education, from the library, and note how clean are its pages, how excellent is its condition, and then pick up a novel of adventure or love Its pages will be found well-thumbed, and probably very dirty. There are many who regard this system of free novel-lending as a grave mistake. Novels are cheap enough nowadays, since the best standard novels may be obtained for sixpence I each, and the latest works of fiction are | now published in that form, after the most expensive editions have been for some time on the market It is probable that if only works of an educational character were sent forth from the lending branch, its power for good would be materially increased Although the citizens generally have not betrayed any anxiety in reference to the plague, still the Board of Health is alive to the danger of a fresh outbreak, ] especially as plague-infected rats- are now and then caught in Sussex and Kent i streets, and at Woolloomooloo, Once I came from aristocratic Potts Point, caus- ing people there to express great indigna- tion, but the duthoTihos state that it had found its way thither from Woolloomooloo, probably in search of a more tasty main than it had previously enjoyed. Queensland has been declared free of plague, but vessels arriving from that State are called upon to produce certificates, or to undergo certain restrictions We cannot be too careful where plague is concerned Of course, Queensland has grumbled, but that cannot be helped. There is still much anxiety concerning the exodus that has been going on from Australia. It is shown in the statistics of Mr. Coghlan that during the last ten years the emigrants from New South Wales have largely exceeded the immigrants hither. The figures recently published must cause politicians and commercial men to think, and, perhaps, worry about the future, more especially when it is considered that the people who are leaving the State are those whom it would be exceedingly desirable to retain here, namely, the strong workers, and those who have a little money Between January 1, 1902, and June 27, 1903, those who left this State for Canada and South Africa numbered nearly seven thousand, ! and at the present time berths are book | ed for the vessels that are announced to sail for months before their departure. Prominent men in the community are almost daily requested to write credentials and letters of introduction for men who are about to seek work mother coun- tree. Canadian statistics show that settlers are constantly flocking to that progressive country Naturally, the opponents of the present Government are attributing the alarming exodus from New South Wales to the policy that has been pursued for the past few years, and we are ever hearing capitalists declaiming against the tendency towards legislation for one class only. Whatever the causes are, the facts are indisputable, and there is the additional unpleasing fact that workless men are at their wits' ends to find something to do for a living Optimists are. however, hoping for the best. Stevenson, the English billiard-player, has awakened a craze for billiards in Sydney in his matches against Mem mott and Frank Smith, him play was so much admired, and the shots looked so easy-just "like falling off a log, you know that lovers of the cue were stimulated to fresh endeavours to top their own previous breaks, and the result is quite a "revival and a corresponding increase in the takings at the billiard tables Tournaments have been arranged, and are played amidst great excite ment, including one in which the press representatives are now engaged, and the talk is over of screw backs, masse shots, nurseries, and so forth Stevenson's play is a treat to witness His numery can none were so skilfully worked that it grow monotonous to watch his performance, at times, especially when he was running up breaks of 416, 500, 335, and so on Masse shots that appeared almost impossible were? obtained with the greatest facility, and his hazards was as certain as death and as true as a hair. Steven- son's record break is 5-18 Redfern has had a "mystery" Upon the site of an old house that was recently demolished there were discovered some bones They were at first supposed to be not human, but after they were examined by a medical man they were pronounced to be nearly all those of other animals, the only human bone being the remains of a jaw, showing apparently, that a man's jaw-bone resists the process of decay longer than the other portions of his anatomy. There were many conjectures as to how this particular jawbone became mixed up with material of a baser kind, and an old inhabitant informed the police that he heard some- one say, when he was a little boy, that a murder had been committed in the old house, which was said to be haunted for a long time afterwards No doubt, if if there be any truth in this story, the ghost got tired of Redfern, the noise and rattle of recent times being too much for it. Ghosts were ever critic. They had in the old days a most unhappy trick of wandering around the places where they were done to death," and continually appeared to gaze upon those who had been their bitterest enemies in life There was that poor horse, for instance whom the gay Francois Xavier Augusto treated so badly that she died so Thomas Ingoldsby told us-and who would persist in sitting beside the poor beggar's hand and keeping him awake at night until his companion" provided him with another ghent, which finished him But ghost? are things, of the past They can't stand the trams It is doubtful if a murdered King of Denmark would re- appear nowadays "Dolores," written by Haddon Charn bors for Miss Nellie Stewart, from a Danish play, is being performed at the Theatre Royal for a few nights It 19 melo- dramatic in character, unhealthy in lone, and there is absolutely nothing in it that is either elevating or refining It is on illogical story, badly conceived, of a girl sacrificing her honour for the sake of an invalid sister The dialogue in parts is clever, and some of the characters, although unpleasant, are excellently drawn It may be said that the writing of this play was a false step Better to have cast it into the fire or upon the garbage heap than to have let the world see it. Miss Nellie Stewart was Dolores. One felt sorry to see talent thrown away upon such a production.
