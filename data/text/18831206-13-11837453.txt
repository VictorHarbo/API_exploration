Under tho circumstances, as wo said before, wo do not seo how the Steam Navigation Hoard could come to any other decision than that at which it anived. Wo must rest content to believe, ap- parently, that a vessel was being navi- gated with tho greatest caro and pro- priety on the evening of Cup Day, whon sho ran into some miraculous obstruc- tion which no one can find, and sub- sequently underwent treatment which rendered it impossible to clear up thu mystery connected with her original mishap. Jf we aro somewhat sceptical with regald lo the narrative given by those connected with the ship, we can only plead the general naturo of tho testimony given by ships' companies in similar cases in justification of our doubts. It is a singular fact that nearly every investigation connected with marítimo disaster shows that everything loading up to the calamity was dono in perfect order, and was calculated to insure safety. In nine cases out of ten tho officers were sobor and attentive to their duties when thoy got into diffi- culties ; tho look-out men were preter naturally vigilant ; the watch was on tho alert ; lights were observed, and if cross-bearings wero not taken, thoro is generally borne excuso for tho omission, which makes tho average man feel that the mero suggestion of neglect implied in the question is something uko an outrago on the finer feelings of our common humanity. Aiftl yot, in spite of all these precautions, mishapsoccur, which can only bo explained by assuming tho grossest carelessness, the most complete neglect of duty, reckless- ness, almost if not quite criminal, or want of judgment so flagrant as to argue total iinfitness for command. Of course it is impossible for us' to explain thoso things, or to show how it is that whenever the ingenuous tar's attention is arrested by signs of moro than ordin- ary caro in navigating the ship to which he belongs, misfortune is almost sure to bo ncarathand. It is customary nowadays to explain everything on the theory of development, and perhaps the key to tho mystery we havo buen noticing may bo found in that direction. According to Mr. WILSON, Captain JOIINSON never said anything to him about an obstruction in tho fairway to tho Heads until ho (Mr. WILSON) was surveying the Rodondo in WRKJIIT and Co.'s dock, although a statcmont liad appeared in the press whilo the vessel was on tho Victory shoal, to the cllect that the master attributed the occident lo floating wreckage. It will bo ob- served that, no matter whether the opinion was formed in the dock or on the shoal, it was a growth, not an in- stantaneous conviction boruo in upon tho soul at the time the accident oc- curred. ]t is possible that the process of development may bo moro intimately associated with the surroundings of maritime casualties than we havo hitherto supposed, in which caso much that has excited our surprise from time to time becomes clear and comprehen- sible. However, wo need only add that it is to bo regretted, on account of all concerned, that the necessity of beach- ing the Rodondo should havo confused tho evidence, and so necessitated a ver 'dict which is simply équivalent to one of " not proveil." A lively interest appears to bo takon in tho gold-mining districts in the visit to bo paid to England by Mr. J. M'1ST vin:, who is a passenger by to- day's mail steamer. When Mr. Hmtvici: loft for Europe in 1880, Mr. M'JNTYKH replaced thu Premier in tho roprosontiition of Mullion. Ho studied tho local minus, started somo new enterprises, and has made money for himself and for others, and he now seeks to raise capital upon a largor nonio in England than can bo dono hero. The journals of tho golcl-fiolds aro unanimous in bearing testimony to the judgment of tho lion, gentleman, and thoy iirguo that if nionoy could bo raisod for venturos so dubious as tho gold-mines of India, it should cortiiinly bo forth- coming for bond-Jitle venturos in Victoria. Of this wo aro not so auro. Bubbles can bo rendered brilliant. Advonturui's can out-prospectus a promotor' such us Mr. M'ISTYUB, who can only uso tho sober language of an honest man dealing with mining prospects which aro legiti- mate, and no moro. No doubt, however, if success can bo achieved, it will bo by tho onorgy and tho character of a gontlo niitn such as tho member for Maldon. Tho reason for tho spocial interest takon in his mission appears to bo that tliero is a confidant boliaf that tho Maldon venture will turn out well for the investors, and that this will lead to tho introduction of capital for tho development, not only of the Tarrengower, but of other promising gold- lîolds. Thoro is forco in this conten- tion. It may seem straugo that if Mr. M'INTYUK has a " good thing" at Maldon, ho cannot obtain local capital for his'pur- pose, but, as wo all know in Australia, local capital is invested largely in tho industry ; thoro is no idle sur- plus, and oven if twice tho number of millions wo havo invosted wore available boro, thero would still bo hopeful openings for moro. Should Mr. M'IKTYIU: fail to acliiovo BUCCOSS, ho will still bo heartily welcomed back. As a politician ho is a capital local member, and ho has dono good service to the causo of " law and order" in his day. It was it mistake on his part, its wo havo urged beforo, to opposo tho formation of thu coalition Government, which tho times required, but it is to bo recorded to his crodit that his opposition last session was logithnato in ehaincter, and that in proportion as Messrs. MACKAY and GAUASOX grow obstructivo and quarrolsomo, ho cooled oil'. If hu does not bring capital back with him ho should roturii with an oxporionco that will add to tho valuó of his services. Perhaps ho will dovelopo into an ardent advócate of immigration. According to the laureate " The poet in ii Holden clime was boin, With «olden stars above." And certainly tho linos of tho successful poet of tho pruBunt day aro costin pleasant places. LoNoniMOw left great wealth behind him. TKNNVSO.V is tho re- puted possessor of a largo incomo do rived fiom tho salo of his works. Bitow.Ni.Nij is said to bo rich, and is coiutcdhysociety. MATTHEW AUNÓLO, who is nocessiitily " caviare to the general," obtains substantial Government appoint- ments during his period of vigour, and a pension in Ina age. LOWKLI,, whoso verso is dear to his American countrymen, is placed in the diplomatic post of honour at the Court of .St. James, and has won now laurels thoro. Now comes tho nows that tho laureaUi is to bo offered a peerage, an honour paid to no pout before, for though Loid HOUGHTON lins nu undoubted gift of som;, yet, its Mr. MO-NUKTON MILNKS, ho had othur claims to a peerage than his poetry. If his vorsos lind been his only qualification, ho mid his titlo would-to use thu nainu of one of tho most popular of his compositions-havo been " strangers yot." PITT'S dictum was that every man possessed of £U0,000 per annum in lund should be a ¡lour, and so long as tho peorugo is hereditary thoro is a reason for allying it with territorial wealth, and, unfortunately for mun of lottura,thoy aro generally little acquainted with those vory important lottors £ s. d. Tho lifo peerages which tho Crown en doavouied to creato during tho prosont reign would give them thoir best opportunity, but still,when circumstances allow distinctions to bo conferred, there seems no reason why genius shown in literature should not bo recognised equally with ability at the bar or in the Bunato or tho held. It may bo said that rank can do nothing for those whom fame baa clowned. The onrapt student forgets that BYRON wies a peer and BURNS n pe.isant ; that SHELLUY wits heir to ono of tho oldest and richest baronetcies of England, while Poi'u wies the son of a Unen dealer. These men ennoble themselves. But tho nation cm honour itself in re- cognising thoir merit. When MACAULAY dated a letter from Windsor Castle there was a storm of satire aroused. But Til.WKiaiw struck tho right vein years afterwards when ho wiote :-" it always " seemed to hu tlmt ¡implo means mid " recognised rank were MAOAULAY'S as of " right, lnnnort.ll gods ! Wies not this " ui.m a fit guest for any pallico in the " world, or a lit companion for any man " or woman in it / The place of snell " a natural chief was amongst the " first of tho land, and that country is 11 best, according to our British notion " (it least, whoio tho man of eminenco " has tho best chance of investing his " genius and intellect." The Quuiitf lues created great warriors poors, such as Lord NAI'IKII of Magdala and Lord WOLSELEY, but probably no eloviition to tho House of Lords has dono moro honour to hor reign than that of tho grout his- torian. Of equal merit will bo tho be- stowal of titular honour-if ho cares to occopt it-upon ono who, whether tho owner of broad acres or otherwiso, is tho crantai* mid proprietor of "Locksley Hull" and of tho .' Polaco of Art." History is likely' to think bettor of tho generation which mado TKNNTSON a poer than of tho olio that provided for Beim tho post of a gougor. _ ' Tho City Counejl has taken fresh action in regard, to tho telegraph wiro nuisance. At its last mooting, a report of tho Publie Works Cominitteo, recom- mending that a deputation should wait upon tho Government, for tho purpose of pointing out tho dangers and incon- veniences of tho overhead system, was approved of. In tho discussion which took' place,a good deal of dissatisfaction was ex- pressed that previous representations on tho subject had been productivo of no result. Councillor CAIITKK reminded tho council that a deputation hod waited upon tho Poslnioslor-Genoral on the saiiio emind two years ago, when a promiso of sonio sort was mado, but nothing had boon dono sineo oxcept to still further multiply tho overhead wires, and thus intensify the ovil. Tho council doos right tci press this matter, for the ovor hüiíd wires uro a source of great dis- comfort and unnoyanco, while tho dangers of the system htivo boen BIIOWII by tho occurrence of accidents of a fatal character in European and American cities. But at the samo timo, it must bo pointed out that tho substitution of underground for aerial wires is not tho'simple matter that some pooplo imagino, nor is it tho caso, us Alderman O'GILADY led the council to suppose, Huit in most of th'o principal European cities all telegraph wires aro carried below' tho ground. ' Tho fact is, as'wo pointed out a few months ago, that the underground system has not boen thoroughly successful onywhoro. .Various methods havo boen tried in London, Munich, Berlin, Paris, and other European cities, and also in tho principal cities of the United Stotos, but as yot only partial success' has boen mot with. Writing on tho subject recently, tho Electrical Review declared that up to tho prosont timo no really satisfactory system had boon dovisod, and tho whoio question, it was added, presented much greater difiieultius than might be imagined. Tho- fact, seems to bo, tlmt wlnlo tho underground system is un- doubtedly feasible-indeed it is actually ,¡11 operation in parts of London and in somo other cities-tho proeossos at pro- sont in uso aro too oxponsivo for gonoral adoption in consequence of thoir imperfec- tions, which involvo heavy oxpondituro in ropairs und renewals. It would bo folly, of course, to rush blindly into heavy oxpondituro which might ond in failure, but at tho samo timo tho Govornmont wo think might show a littlo moro activity than it has hitherto dono. Why Bhould it not send homo for BOHÍO of tho most approved appliances known, and conduct experiments in Melbourne upon its own account 'I Tho-Govorninont might certainly bo asked to do this, oven if it is not propuicdot thisstogoto go any further. Tho timo has arrived when action of somo sort is imperatively necessary. Tlie Australasian Convention, at its meet- ing yesterday, (¡nally revised the annexation resolutions, which were ndonted with un- important verbal amendments. Sir. Whitaker wished to improve the wording of the second resolution by making it more direct, and would have been supported by the Victorian delegates if there bud been any chance of a unanimous decision. The majority thought it better not to reopen the discussion on the general question. The resolutions were then signed, and afterwards transmitted -by tlie Governor direct to the Sec- retary of State for tlie Colonies. A copy for the Kuropeun press was also sent through lieuter. At the atternoon sitting the leedora! Council Kill was considered in committee, and progress made as far as clause '.I. Mr. Service proposed that the first council should meet in Tasmania, and the iden met with generul acceptance, but no formal vote was tuken. At least a year will elapse before the council can meet. The bill will1 have to be assented to by the Parliaments of the various colonies, and afterwards passed by the Imperial Parliament Com- plaints «ere made by the Tasmanian and South Austruliim delegates about iepoits published in the Sgdneii Morning Herald which lind been obviously supplied by one of tlie local représentatives. They said that the reports should either be fair anil accurate in all respects, or not supplied at all. The proposal to admit the press was nguiu mooted, but not persevered in. A cable message waa received from the agents-general asking tlie sanction of tile convention to a course they thought of taking, but their suggestion was disapproved ot. The terms ot their proposal were not allowed to triui spiie. The I*, and 0.

Tlie Calcutta International Kxhibition was opened on Tuesday by the Viceroy of India. Although the weather was unfa\ouiable and considerably interfered with the success of tlie outdoor pageantry, the ceremony was of a most imposing cliarnctei'. The Marquis of Kipun specially complimented tile Australian representatives upon the success of theil cllortson behalf of the colonies. Tlie courts of Victoria and New South Wales aie ilesciibed les complete and well arranged, but all tlie other courts nie in a backward state.

We understand that it is a rather lengthy production as a vast quantity of evi- dence had to be epitomised and dealt with. Much will doubtless be said in it about the disorganisation of the Ordnance branch of the service, and it may reasonably be ex- pected that a strong recommendation will be made that the whole department should be placed under one head. For this position it is understood that there are already some competing applicants two of whom held prominent positions in connexion with the late volunteer force.
