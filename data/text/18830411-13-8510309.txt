SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL SUMMARY. The work of the session was begun on Tuesday, the 3rd inst., and it should be completed next week. Beyond the passing of the long-delayed estimates of the late Government, there is little to do. Most of the votes were carried without discussion last week. Some promotions made by ex- Ministers have yet to be considered. The legislation for the year will be proceeded with in a new session to be summoned for June next. Ministers took their seats, of ter their re-election, on the first day Parliament met after the adjournment. There were 30!) members present, including the Speaker. Ministers and their BUU portions numbered 5t, whilst the Opposition mustered but 14. Of the absentees, the minority are MinisteriAlists. Mr. Service, in a short financial statement, informed the Legislative Assembly how the revenue and expenditure for the current year stood, and explained the condition of the loan fund. Additional estimates to the amount of £4315,858 are required to cover the expenditure for the year ending June 30 They include a vote of £200,000 for arrears of expenditure by the Railway department, where, for two or more years past, an in sufficient percentage of the gross receipts has been allowed for current expenses. " Savings" (as they are called) in the estimates in chief will be effected to the amount of £200,000. The revenue has been coming in satisfactorily. After providing for the additional estimates, Mr. Service expects to close the year with a surplus of £37,000.

With regard to the loan' expenditure, Mr. Service had important facts to submit. The late Government, in providing for the requirements of the year, calculated on being able to float not only the loan of £4,000,000 in January for public works and railways, but also a loan of £3,800,000 about 10th July, to pay off the six per cent, debentures due on October 1, 1883. Before they could place the first loan, however, they gave an undertaking through the agent-general that not more than £('.,000,000 would be borrowed in London this year in other words, they pledged the colony to ask for only £2,000,000 in July. Mr. Service will, therefore, have to apply £1,800,000, or in round nurn Sera £2,000,000 of the January-March loan to redemption purposes this your. Contracts entered into by the late Government before the £4,000,000 loan was floated will absorb within £703,000 of the whole amount, and £104,000, required to complete the railways floated in 1880-1, will reduce the unappropriated balance to £549,000. Those contracts extend over a series of years, the heaviest being for rolling-stock and rails on account of the 840 miles of new lines set forth in the Railway Construction Bill of last session -a bill which lapsed with the proroga- tion of Parliament. Having set aside £2,000.000 of the January-March loan to meet the October debentures, Mr. Service considered how far the remaining half would go towards satisfying liabilities already due or to fall due between now and January, 1884, when the colony will be at liberty to place the balance of the redemption loan on the London market. No allowance was made by the late Government for the possible failure of their loan operations, and before their first application was made to the English capitalists, they induced Parliament to authorise various items of railway and public works expenditure, to be temporarily paid for out of the loan fund of 1880, and afterwards charged against the new loan. The recoups which have now to be made to the 1880 loan, and the charges incurred in floating the late loan, leave £905,010 available for payments that will accrue between now and January, 1884. But the obligations which have to be met this year are estimated by Mr. Service at £1,550,000, and the Treasury will be short by £300,000 on the 31st December next. With the help of the cash balance in the Treasury, portion of which will be at his disposal, and which amounts, in the gross, to £800,000, and also by economising the expenditure, Mr. Service hopes to pay off' all liabilities as they fall due, without having to make special provision for them. When the balance of the redemption loan is floated, the accounts will come right again, and as above stated there will then be in unappropriated balance of £519,000 for railway making in 1884. Mr. Service strongly disapproved of the financing of the late Treasurer, and the extravagance of Mr. Bent, the late Minister of Railways, who entered into contracts for £831,000 worth of rolling stock and rails, over and above the amounts voted by Parliament for those purposes in 1882. Mr. Bent, it is true, informed Parliament what he was doing, and took credit for letting contracts for rolling-stock on an extensive scale, in order to establish large manufactories in the colony. This was done, however, before the late Government know how their loan would go off, and before Parliament had carried the Railway Bill under which the expenditure was to take place. Mr. Service described the various shifts the late Government were put to, pending" the floating of the loan, to find money for the works Mr. Rent had undertaken. They not only drew upon the loan funds of 1880, but borrowed from the cash balance in the Treasury and the Treasurer's advance until both were swallowed up. Mr. Bent, in replying to the Premier, justified his contracts by stating that the Railway department was crying out for rolling stock, and he contended that in anticipating the loan he had but followed in the steps of various predecessors. He differed from Mr. Service as to the amount of the liabilities which would fall due by January, 1881, and believed that there would be ample funds for all the purposes to which the money is to be applied. Mr. Bent's speech left the impression on the House that the case had been accurately stated by Mr. Service. Amongst the bills to be submitted this week is one to come into payment of members. It will be taken charge of by Mr. Gillies in his private capacity. With Ministers payment of members is an open question. The members of the Assembly only are paid, thoirroinunoration being a ""Oa year. Hitherto the system has only been in force from Parliament to Parliament, and there has been no attempt to make it permanent The revenue returns for the quarter and year ending March 31 are given else where for the quarter, the not receipts amounted to £1 475 083 or £00,090 less than in the corresponding quarter of 1882 On the whole twelve months there has been a gain of £88,100, while for the nine months of the current financial year the increase has been £42,477-results owner rather t an excess in the receipts for the September and March quarters than to the rate at which the cane came in during the three months just closed The tone of the excise duty on beer, which was dis- continued on August 31, 1882, and the falling off in the land revenue account for the deficiency in the quarters receipts The decline in the land revenue act in two or three years ago and each success and quit for has produced a smaller income from the sale of land by auction or free selection the in its predecessors For the year, the total revenue of the colony was to IJ31,20O Ministers have been well received at different public b turrets which they have had the opportunity of attending At the dinner given to Mr Robert Harper by his East Bourl o constituents, Mr Service and his colleagues had a flattering reception They were warmly toasted at a luncheon held to celebrate the extension of the premises of Messrs Peters in, Laing, and Bruce, on which occasion the commercial interests of Melbourne were largely represented The c edition Government is gaining strength in the country SOCIAL AND GENERAL The Governments of all the Australian colonies, excepting New Zealand, have at the instance of Victoria agreed to send representatives to a conference on the subject of the desirableness of joining the Universal 1 oatal Union No decision as to the date and place of the conference has yet been arrived at In connexion with the visit of the Brothers Redmond to Australia to raise money on be half of the Irish National League, two of the municipal bodies near Melbourne have resolved not to let their town halls to the agitation for the purpose of holding meetings A commission to look after the Victorian exhibits at the Calcutta exhibition is to be appointed by the Government in the mean time Mr Bosisto M L A has been selected to be chairman of the commission and Mr James Thomson to be secretary Both gentlemen have had experience in connexion with exhibitions The manufacturers are taking the matter up warmly and the list of intending exhibitors already includes the names of the chief prizetakers in the Victorian Court at the late Melbourne Exhibition Parliament will be called by the Government to vote £3 000 to meet the expenses The Tariff Commission has resumed its sittings for the purpose of taking evidence One manufacturer of harness mountings deposed that he wanted a 20 per cent duty on the RTticlea he produced At present he was not doing so well here as he would do in the old country A coach and harness furnishing manufacturer stated that he was doing very well but could not afford toemployanyhunda With a 20 per cent duty he would at once thoroughly enter into the trade He and the previous witness were the only manufac aurora of these things in the colony.

A hostile amendment was moved by Mr H J Browne but lapsed for want of a seconder, and the motion was carried by a very large majority The Victorian turret war steamer Cer. beria is being fitted with new boilers, mode in Melbourne. It was found that the old boilers which were in her when she came out, were in a terribly bad condition They were corroded quite through in places For a long time, indeed, the captain's order to " go ahead " in anything like a rough sea was more a matter of form than performance and it required a good deal of fortitude to issue it The ironwork was eaten into holes in places, and in few parts was thicker than a piece of cardboard This was not to be wondered at, as the boilers, which were made by Maudsley and Son, Lambeth, near London, were only expected to last about seven years and they had actually been in use about 13 The new But have been lowered into the stokehole, and are now being fixed in their place by the makers, who, as they are permitted to have turned out strong and faithful work, will probably have the making of the valves, pipes, and other connexions with the engine, which it is expected will be able to give the Cerberus a speed of nine or ten knots per hour the next time steam 18 got up Another addition in the shape of a small boiler for such auxiliary purposes as general ing the electric light, pumping, or to extinguish fire will also be required to make the equipment of the vessel 09 complete as it should be It may be added that although the boilers of the turret ship became so deplorably bad, her engines, which are of 250 horse power nominal, are as good as the day they left the makers' hands They are kept in excellent order by the engineering staff On Saturday) afternoon, the slit at, the annual commencement of the Melbourne University took place, in the new W Wilson hall (willah has been erected out of a donation of 150 000 given some years ago by fair Samuel Wilson for the purpose ). This is the first time that that structure has been used, and the ceremony attracted a much larger number of spectators than usual. The hall is not only externally handsome, but its interior is admirably adapted, not only for such assemblies as that of a commencement, but for other academirttlpurposes, it being splendidly lighted, and of very large proportion, with good acoustic properties The hall has yet to be formally opened. At a meeting of the council of the University, held on the 2nd mat, a motion brought forward by Professor M'Coy, affirming the desirability of establishing a chair of music, was lost by a minority of one vote.

Mr Mackinnon, as representative of the senior sun i vine; partner in the firm, responded to the toast, and expressed the pleasure it afforded the proprietors, whether present or absent, to be instrumental in bringing to gether such a happy gathering of those in their employment At a meeting of subscribers to the Melbourne Hospital, it has been resolved, by 21 votes to 13, that the proposed removal of the institution to another she would not be expedient at present there has been a "scare about hydrophobia in the colonies L rum this disease, Australasia has, until recently, been singularly free, but latterly it is said to have appeared in New South Wales and 'Tasmania Our Chief Secretary, Mr Berry, is in com mu nicotine with the Governments of the other colonies with the object of securing united as tion in regard to the importation of dogs Mr Berry is in favour of the total prohibition of an Donation, but New South Wales favours the idea of a six months'' quarantine Mr. William Degraves, for many cora is conspicuous Victorian customs!, died in Hobart on the 20 h ult At one time he was extensively engaged in many business pursuits here and mother colonies, but in the disastrous fires which Australian squatters passed through some 12 years ago he lost the whole of his possessions, and during his late years he was dependent on the generosity of a brother for the moderate income which rates had his broken ambition the father of the deceased settled in Tasmania about the year 1820, and the deceased himself eat in the Victorian Upper House for It years Hellas left a widow, a sister, and nephews and nieces Reference was made in the last summary to the death of an Afghan, one of a number of Asiatics in the employ of T.

The Police Commission has at last sent in its final report Subjoined are some of the recommendations therein - The future management of the police force to be vested in a board of three commissioners, to consist of the chief commissioner and of two competent gentlemen selected from outside the force, one of whom shall have had legal training The board shall, subject to the approval of the political head of the department, have full power to deal with all matters relating to the appointment, transfer, promotion discharge, and superannuation of the members of the force, and the distribution of police throughout the colony The chief commissioner to be chairman of the board, and to act as executive officer thereof The officers of superior grade to he recruited from the ranks as at present. No promotion to be made to the superior grades without candidates having passed a strict educational and tech- meal culmination, such examinations to be held periodically the age of admission to the force, both for foot and mounted men, to be from 20 to 25 years, both inclusive un married men to have the preference Officers and constables to be transferred at, least every five years, but not necessarily from the district in which they have been doing duty The pay of constables to be placed upon a more equitable footing and the regulations affecting same to be permanent viz -1 first and second years of Bernie Os 6d per diem , third and fourth years, 7s per diem , fifth and sixth years 7d 6d per diem, after ten years service, 3s per diem Married men living outside of barracks to be allowed 6d a day in lieu of quarters, fuel, light and water Badges to be granted to subordinate officers and men for meritorious service with out carrying any additional remuneration The Police Superannuation and to be handed over to the consolidated revenue, from which police pensions and gratuities shall be made payable Members of the force to receive a copy of any entry made in their record sheets within one month of such record being made. It is not expedient that the present law abolishing the right of franchise by members of the police should be altered. The time has not arrived when a system of municipal police can be introduced with advantage in the colony Retirement of 55 years to be made compulsory upon members of the force, irrespective of grade AGRICULTURE. Reports from the agricultural districts are now of the most favourable kind Ample rains have fallen in most parts to enable ploughing to be carried on with ease, and in the earliest area some sowing has already been done The demand experienced for all kinds of grain has induced farmers generally to make a special effort to work as much land as possible in the best wheat districts in the north eastern portions of Victoria, the area of that crop will be substantially in creased Similar results will be likely to occur in the old forming districts, grain crops of all kinds having been heavier there than for very many years past In the northern wheat growing areas, in which the crops, owing to drought, were lamentably light, of disposition is evinced by farmers to place more dependence than hitherto on sheep There will nevertheless be ploughed for wheat an area not much less than in the season which heR ended so unsatisfactorily in those parts The quality of the wheat there is first class, and a good season may follow a bad one In accordance with annual custom, a summary of the results of the last wheat harvest has been published in the agricultural columns of The Arista alasian The area harvested is estimated on the basis of the numerous returns sent by that journal a farming correspondents at 001000 acres and the average at a trifle over ') bushels per acre, giving a total yield of S,7db02i bushels of wheat Home consumption, allowing r>' bushels per head for a population of '500 000 will take 4,930 000 , 1 500 600 I bushels will be required for sowing 1,000,000 area this season, allow ing 12 bushels per acre, and on 1 118 all bushels have been exported up to date the surplus still available for export is 1159 'IPI bushels In this calculation the breadstuffs exported overland to the neighbouring colonies are not taken into account The vintage, which is nearly finished in all except the latest districts, appears likely to turn out, upon the whole very well AB in the case of the cereals, grapes were an irregular crop Spring frosts did much injury reducing the yield in BOIUO matches by 20 to 30 percent lins decrease was not general, for in many vineyards the yield has been above the average, whilst the quality in all cases has been good As considerable additions are being annually made to the area under vines in Victoria, the total crop of wine is not likely to be less in bulk than usual a few weeks hence, however the actual results, will be known The representation of the Australian vineyard industry at Bordeaux has already led to the opening of a very considerable trade in the wines of this colony with England It is understood that three of our large wine producing firms have received orders for considerable portions of their annual crop Over the Murray, also, an extensive foreign Inquiry has been experienced, with satisfactory results THE LABOUR MARKET. There is no change of any importance to notice with regard to the labour market Business in all trades is fairly brisk and the supply of skilled labour is just about equal to the demand The trade agitations are still going on, and from present appearances they are likely to last some time Trades that never before thought of going in for the eight hours have now formed unions joined the Right hours League, and are demanding and in most cases aucceBafall)-eight hours labour per day without any reduction in the present rate of pay This has been particularly the case with the furniture makers, and their efforts have been crowned with success, as over 10 employers have agreed to the terms and promised to use their influence with other employees to get them to concede to the demands of the men. The conference between the journey man bootmakers and the manufacturers is still going on Trade is pretty good in the face tones, and the prices quoted are the ruling rate paid pending the fine adjustment of the log The committee of the Tailoresses' Union and some of the manufacturers are now engaged in a conference with a view of revising the log submitted by the Union, and which was objected to by certain employers There is a fair amount of work going on in the factories, hut masters are not now making up immense quantities of goods for stock for the sake of keeping their hands employed All the beet hands find plenty to do but a good many of the second and third rate hands are out of work Following in the wake of the other made the coopers, although most of their work is done by the piece are at present engaged in preparing a new log of prices In the iron trade there is plenty of work and the supply of skilled labour is just about equal to the demand, and there is no alteration in the prices quoted The building trade is brisk, but there is no scarcity of labour The coachbuilders are all busy, and this may be taken as a good sign of prosperity, but first-class artisans in nearly every department are few and for between, and good hands would find ready employment at the rates quoted The farmers are sadly in need of good agricultural labourers and a large quantity of work has to be left for want of assistance and it may be safely said that at least 500 farm hands could find situations within a week The some remark might almost be made with regard to domestic servants, as now it is next to impossible to get good servants, notwith Branding the extremely high wages now being offered RACING The principal racing event of the past fortnight has been the annual autumn meeting of the Australian Jockey Club, which commenced in Sydney on Easter Monday, 26th ult Most of the leading sporting men of Victoria were present, and the little island colony of Tasmania was fairly represented, whilst there was a good attendance of the inhabitants of the sister colony The course was in splendid order, and the racing throughout the meeting was good.

At a meeting held in Sydney Daniel Smith, a recent arrival from England, explained in a lecture the reasons for the attempt to obtain Cresswell's release The audience was not at all in unison with the lecturer. A preliminary meeting had been held with the view to the formation of a Federal Geographical Society, whose operations are to be extended to all the unexplored country in this part of the southern hemisphere It is believed that the project will be received with favour by the home and colonial Government, the Governments of France, Germany, and Russia, and the various European and colonial scientific and missionary societies. An unsuccessful attempt has been made to float the S S Austral into Fitzroy Dock, Sydney Harbour. Another attempt will be made, and in the oven of failure she will proceed to London without being docked, as no other colonial dock will admit her It is anticipated that the Austral will be ready to leave for England at about the end of May No passe vera will be taken by her to London It has since been decided not to attempt again to dock her here, but to send her to England Portions of machinery are coming out in the Garonne and Potosi to enable her to proceed on her home voyage The steamer Tasmania engaged in coasting sank in Darling Harbour, but was successfully floated in a short time The ship Nerbudda has arrived from Plymouth with 414 Government immigrants.

Malting barley has, however, been an exception, and a strong demand has been maintained, resulting in some large lines having changed hands at up to 5s 7d Hops continue in good demand, and all prime samples are readily disposed of at full prices A very large proportion of the quantity now coming forward has been damaged by winds and weather, and there are in consequence numerous rejections both of Tasmanian and Victorian Some of the latter are very badly stained by the Spider From all quarters the same thing is repeated so that it is certain that really prime hops will be very scarce and to add to all this from statistics which have been carefully collected, and which are given in another column, it is certain that we shall nor have sufficient for our own requirements without drawing supplies from other quarters, which seems at present an impossibility Thus prices have are why become first r and in our opinion are likely to reach the highest figure obtained last year and early this year, of the do not go even beyond them Some very fine Victorians have been quitted at 4s 4d , but for others in has been obtained For growers lots from £4 01 to 3s 'id is obtained for prime while inferior qualities buyers do not care to touch at any price Further shipments have been made to the Lord m market amounting to about "90 bales By circulars to hand by the last mail, we learn that the market in home IS lower, partly owing to Borne weak holders, and also to the fact that numerous inquiries have been experienced from these colonies Our total crop would not be milliners for the present requirements of the London market, and as we are not likely to ship more than one fourth of that, there is little fear of Australian hops reilly rilfertniK the home market English malt has had cor siderable attention, find large salts have been made to arrive for colonial! made malt, also there is a good demur in and large lines have changed bands on my roving prices Sugars continue in strong, request and large sales are making UB issue mi- n milieu forward We hear, however, of about 1 100 tons having been disposed of in parcels on the spot and to arrive, at full prices Holders are now asking an advance on late quotations Teas have had moderate attention A few parcels of Indian have been taken up for shipment to London, prices have been under Calcutta cost Some large sales of timber were held last week, and fair prices were realised Wines have been noticed to a moderate extent For spirits there is a fair demand, and some good lines, have been cleared off In stations there has been nothing doing during the past fortnight During the fortnight there have been no wool sales but two sales will be held to morrow In Sydney the sales have been re- Burned since the holidays but the quantities sold Brace have not been large and the season is fast drawing to a close Wool still arrives, however in fair quantities principally from the cold late districts of Monaro and New England, and by the Queensland coasting steamers In Adelaide the sales are quite over the following being the result of this season's operations compared with those of last year - - 1st!.! 3 931 2 catalogued _ ..

LIMITED report: The limited demand for export during the month has been noticeable by a very dull and Btammi market, operations having been for the most part confined to supplying trade requirements. Holden however, show no inclination to accept the ranges prices now ruling, and they are looking forward to abotlertouo in the English market or a reduction of flights, and thus permit a. portion of the surplus wheat and flour still on hand being exported before the season advances. Deliveries from the country, Although on a very reduced scale considering the season, were of sufficient importance to supply all our local requirements M A eil ns provide for Intercolonial engagements without drawing on our Blocks in store, which are so large as to prevent any upward movement In value. From the more reliable Information now to hand to the results of last season's yield, we estimate that there is still an available surplus of between 20 OM and 30,000 tons for export. Owing to scarcity of shipping, freights have advanced to 30s. per ton which, at the present price of wheat, leaves little or no profit to shippers. Wheat has stood at about 3s. 2d. to 3s. 4d. during the mouth, with a very limited business, the achill quantity offering being barely sufficient to supply local requirements, and our export business b« therefore been on a very limited scale. Flour, in sympathy with wheat, has been doll of sale, with a falling market, and we now quote £10 100\. to £10 16s., according to brand and quality.

Since the resumption of business after the Easter holidays the mining market generally has been very dull, transactions much below the average, and li. many cases prices quite nominal. The companies on the south end of the Devonshire line, Sandhurst, have, however, been a considerable exception to the general depression. The transactions in them has been both numerous and of good extent, and though prices have been very HuKuating, the result has been a good rise established in most of them. Good results In UulUid Devons and South Devons, and good pro«, poets In Duchess of Edinburgh and Now St. Munro, have been the inducing causes, and from present appearances a good market for this and ad. joining companies may be expected for some time to come. Other Sandhurst companies ball not had much attention, and prices show little change, Kingston companies have had few transactions, sad close quiet without much change in prices. Hepburn and threaten companies quite neglected, and nombi] prices indicate heavy losses to holders. Band and Albion without reported business or much change In Tarlee.
