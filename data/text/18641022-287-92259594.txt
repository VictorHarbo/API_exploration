The steamer Sooth Adstkaman arrived from Mel bourne on Monday morning at 2 o'clook, aftera very stormy passage, during 20 hours of which Captain Fain was necessi tated to proceed under easy steam on account of the heavy sea. There was some slight detention before final departure from Melbourne from low tides ; but she started at 9.46 on Friday ftom Williamstown, and at midnight passed Short land Bluff, and at 6 a.m. was off the Otway, with a strong W.N.W- gale blowing, which continued with violence till Bivoli Bay was passed at 6 a.m. the following morning'. The Woor. Ships are proceeding with stowage in a very Port waters will exemplify : — The Kowesa is lying at the Lightship anchorage fully laden with a dead weight of copper and ore, together with 1.488 bales from Port Wakefield, to which place a gang of Stone's stevedores accompanied the vessel, and performed their work in a satisfactory manner. The Goolwa is the new Orient liner, whioh has turned out at Prince's Wharf a full cargo of general merchandise in capital order, and being now light, she affords an opportu nity of inspecting a very handsome specimen of marine architecture, especially as the efforts of the chief officer have been so well directed as to present her in most excellent order from water-line to truck, though she will improve in appearance when the mam and mizen topgallant masts are sent aloft. In construction she is on the principle of iron frame and wood planking, and in every part it is evident she merits the high dasB befstowed on her in Lloyd's books. The lower masts and yards are of iron, and throughout she is a most suitable ship for the wool trade. She has at pre sent laden 60 tons silver-lead ore, 40 tons copper in ineots, end 30 tons tallow. ''^ * The Damio is a fine spacious craft, chartered from Port Wakefield, where it is expected she will stow 3 300 bales and every exertion is being made to clear out the original cargo, in order that she may be able to start as earlv as DOS Bible for the loading port. The deadweight alreadf on board consists of 270 tons copper and ore. ^^* The Clamaxpotb is to proceed to Victor Harbour where great rejoicings are anticipated on the opening ot direct communication with London. The Shehehbess is a very fine brig, which has just com pleted her first voyage from Europe, aad nag been taken no to load wool at Streaky Bay. v The Coonatto is in admirable order, and reflects credit on Mr. Waghom, who has been incessant in his efforts to im Jteing over, stowing wool is the occupation ot the day. in addition to the copper and ore, she has nearly 1.4S0 bales be low the 'tween decks, and (is expected to take 2,600, if Stone's gang of s towers perform the sorewing operations to perfection. The Sea Stas has 1,100 bales on board. The Adamant is free from her immigrants, and the surgeon-superintendent eailed on Tuesday for Calcutta in the A. H. Badger. The Fairfj£U-, one of Simpson's Black Diamond Line, as undergoing extensive alterations, being converted from a full poop to a flush-deck ship. Captain HaU, the master, has seen some singular service since he -was here in the Water Kvmnh— having served in India during the rebellion, after* fcards under Garibaldi in Italy, and subsequently hi the Federal navy, which be left prior to proceeding to Mel Jsounie in his present vessel. The Havilah reports! fresh W.S.W. sales from Cape Otway to Cape Northumberland, afterwards fine S.W. and aonflierly wind, wifli heavy sea. . - --__ The Danish ship Yircinie, Captain F.
