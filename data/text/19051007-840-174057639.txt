With reference to tho charge that Eng. lishmcn aro unpopular in Canada, Mr. W. T-R' Preston, tho Commissioner of Emigration to tho Dominion in London, writes ;— The. fact that the Canadian people are authorising an expenditure oi £50,000 or £60,000 annually in the British Isios in currying on an immigration propaganda, among Britishers ought to he sufficient answer to tho ridiculous charge that Britishers arc not wanted in the Do minion. "As to tho suggestion that tho Dih mmion Government authorises an exnen-i dituro of 30s. per head for conffinental emigrants, and only 7s. for Britisher®, id is too ridiculous for argument For the last year, for which I have tho full re turns, I may say that tho cost to the Dominion of Canada per head for British emigrants is nearly 20s., whereas tho . cost . por head doc cosfcmsniiak m&fAAta; te-anly, ,1 .
