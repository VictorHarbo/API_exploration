The Rebecca, from Queeasland, left Moreton Bay on Monday, January 11, and passing Cape Howe on the Wth, she experienced heavy gales, which continued for several days, carrying away foretopgallantmast and springing foreyanL She passed the promontory on the 2nd and Cape Otway on the 7th.- The barque has some very fine logs of cedar on deck; but throughout all the heavy weather they did not start. The Formosa is a fine barque, which has been remarkable for rapid passages from Melbourne to Mauritius and back, under command of Captain Lowrie, so well known and respected while in charge of the Havilah. At present Captain Beaton is master. The run from Melbourne has occupied but five days, with a head-wind during a portion of the time. On the vessel's arrival at the Lightship the captain landed in the Corsair for orders, which -were immediately received from the agents, and the vessel proceeded into harbour to load cereals for the Cape of Good Hope. The Greyhound is a very smart brijj, which arrived on Monday night fromFoochoufoo; and if she proceeds into harbour will from her appear ance reflect credit on her officers and crew from the neatness which prevails on board Slie has a full cargo of tea. for the destination of which orders were required, and Captain Putt landed in the Corsair to procure them. The samples were on Tuesday brought on shore by Collector's order, under the supervision of a Customs officer; but it was not ascertained whether the brig would pro ceed into harbour or not. The Athol was towed into harbour on Tuesday afternoon by the new steam-tug Letty. The Utopia was towed up to the Port on Tues day morning, and a huge number of the immi grants have already left the vessel. VESSELS IN HARBOUR. ADELAIDE, schooner (British). 70 tons. G.
