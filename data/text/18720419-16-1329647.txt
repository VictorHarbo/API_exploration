THE REVOLUTION IN FIJI. (VJBOH A CORRESPONDENT.) Levuka, March 16. SINCE my letter of the 29th February we have had considerable political excitement, and last Thursday a collision was imminent You will see particulars in the papers which I send, SB also the Manifesto of declaration of free dom " by British subjects, which was the principle acted upon A white man some months ago shot a Fijian chief, and a warrant has been issued by the Fijian Government for his arrest on a charge of murder, and last Thursday the arrest was to be put in force The British subjects said that "he Government should not arrest the man but he should be dealt with by the British Government through the Consul, as they would not recognise the right of the Fijian Government to deal with British sub- meets many way until recognition by Great Britain As soon as the intention of the authorities became known, the signal for the Volun- teers who are British subjects to assemble was made by firing three cannon shots, and Within about ten minutes seventy three well armed men had assembled to resist the arrest This is more than one half of the males capable of hearing arms in Levuka and the great body of the others are opposed to the Government, and in case of blows would go against them So that in white force the Government was very weak indeed, but they had a body of about two hundred natives in waiting in the background, in case there should be any violence But two hundred natives would not make any stand against fifty whites even, and their appearance upon the beach would have been the signal for every hitherto neutral white to turn out against them You cannot imagine how strong the feeling 18 against bringing the two races into collision. Things hung in the balance for some time Burt, anxious to retain power and willing to do so at the cost of scores of lives oven, urged upon his colleagues to arrest the man at all hazards, whilst they were opposed to taking any step in their weak state to compel by force of arms It is pretty certain that if force had been attempted they would have been defeated, and if natives had been brought into the affray the lives of the Ministry would have been held responsible, and they were to have been shot like dogs " However, the arrest was not at tempted-another tacit confession of weakness on the part of the Government-and things quieted down One good has arisen from this Burt has resigned his seat in the Ministry, and those that remain are honest men Cakobau met the whites on Saturday morning, when he made a threatening speech, which you will read in the papers The translation is a very mild one in Fijian the meaning is very strong Natives are being drilled in large num here I fully believe there would have been a disturbance on Thursday morning only for the fact of there being a German man of war here at the time, and the Volunteers had reason to believe that she would interfere in case of any disturbance But now that Burt has resigned, there is some prospect of matters quieting down to a certain extent but the Volunteers are still determined to resist any act of the Government until recognition by Great Britain Surely we shall have a visit from an English man of war soon It is a crying disgrace that two thousand British subjects should be left exposed to the danger we are now in at Fiji without any help from the mother country She cannot deny us assistance on the ground that she need not run to the help of all her wandering children, for she has already recognised as as worthy of, and having a right to her help by the establishment of a Consul ite here THE Edinburgh Courant says the Admiralty has refused to Lieutenant Dawson, the leader of the Royal Geographical Society's Expedition to search for Livingstone, and his companion, Lieutenant Henri, their full pay and time during the expedition Lieutenant Dawson was in active service at the time of volunteering and in accepting the dangerous task of rescuing Dr Livingstone, he loses half his professional m come It appears that the Admiralty has no precedent for the adoption of the course proposed GRACE GREENWOOD," who has recently been on a tour in the far west of America, gives an account of the wife of the member of the Arizona Legislature, whose house, when her husband was absent on his legislative duties, was attacked by Indians She shot six, and the next day wrote to her husband : " Dear John The Apaches attacked the ranche I have won the fight. "You need not come yourself, but send some more ammunition " The Mineral Statistics for 1876 are now issUed The total value of the metals., coals and other minerals raised in the United Kingdom is given at £47 946 300 Of coal we produced 110,431,192 was an increase of 3 003,035 tons upon the production of 1869 Of pig iron who smoked 5,963 515 tons, being an increase of 617,758 tons, and our exports of coal in 1870 also increased by 1742 933 tons WE understand that the Colonial office has decided to appoint a commission for the purpose of inquiring into the Coolie labor system of the Mauritius Mr Frere, the gentleman who so ably presided over the Demerara Commission, will, we believe, discharge a similar function in connection with the now inquiry Mr Darnell Davis has been appointed Secretary It is understood that the Commission will not leave England until next month MR PUNSHON claims the merit of having produced. a gun cotton in which he can secure any required explosive property At the same time he states that the tendency to decompose tion, and consequently to spontaneous combus- tion, is removed This is effected by covering the fibres of gun cotton with sugar, and by impregnating the cotton with chlorate of pot ash, or Borne similar salt The time table for the now Back Island bridge weighs one hundred and fifty tons It is supposed to be the most massive piece of mo chinery of its kind in the world.
