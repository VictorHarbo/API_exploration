A CLE MENT'S TONIC LETTER. Many Officials in the Melbourne Tram way Service can Confirm This Testi mony, which all Victorian Railway Service Men should Read. In certain periods of the year the weak-chested man or women goes down to inlluenza and other, chest ailments. They cannot be too careful. Here is an instance where influenza was followed by pleurisy, but this great medicine, as usual, worked wonders in restoring health. Read this letter (written from 42 Bladen-street, East Brunswick, Mel bourne, 2 /4/'12) CLEMENTS TONIC LTD. " The end of December, 1911, I caught cold, and was laid up with pleurisy, which became serious. Two doctors attended me ; for three days my tem perature was 104 deg. My lite was despaired of, but through the doctor's advice I live to-day. He advised my. wife to get Clemetits Tonic for me, that ■ there was life in that medicine.' I am convinced that when he said ' LIFE IN CLEMENTS' they were the truest words he ever uttered. I am sure I would have been in my resting place only for that grand medicine. Mv wife paid 2/3 FOR THE SMALL ■BOTTLES. HAD SHE PAID £40 she would have had GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY. I have seen a lot of testimonials about Clements Tonic in books and papers, but what I find fault with is that EVERY WRITER HAS UTTERLY FAILED TO GIVE A PROPER VALUE OF THAT MEDI CINE. You may use this as you think lit." (Signed) CHARLES ROCK.
