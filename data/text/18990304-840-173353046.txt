Fellow-Electors,— Having, in response to a lurgo and influen tial requisition, . consented > to allow myself to bo Nominated ns a Candidate to represent your Electorate in tho next l'oriiamout, I now dosiro briefly to lay beforq you ray viows oh what I deem tho more important political, matters affecting 'tho welfare of this colony; find our olcctorato in particular. The subjoot of the inoBt vital importance to you is that of Relief against Floods. It is now six years since tho disastrous floods of 1893, and as yet no definite scheme to prevent the influx of flooil-wafora into tho lower, densely-populated parts of tho Electorate has beou decided upon. I am convinced that no echcmo wbioh does not provide for tho Divorsion of Flohd- wutors from soma point on the river above tho city to a point on the river below it will be of any material benefit. Next in importance to you is tho subjcot of Harbour and River Improvement, to allow tho largo ocean-going vessels to como up the river and be borthed alongside the wharves. The part of the rivor from the Bridge to the Dry Dock requires dredging to a anfficiont depth, so that vessels, will not tako tho ground. Thcso matters do not ap- icar to havo rcceivod any attention from your ate representatives. If you return mo as your member. I will strenuously iirgc on the Government the carrying ont of theao works. I will also support- Increased Endowments to Local Governing Bodies, with increased powers. Restrictions on the introduction of Alien and Coloured Labour. Tho introduction of a desirable class of Immigrants, such as fanners, agricultural labourers, and domestic servants. Tho Settlement of People on the Land. Tho establishment of a University. The encouragement of tho Volunteer Force. Tho Extension of our Railway System, and the cncouragoment of Production and Local Industries. As the question of Federation will bo sub mitted to a referendum of tho people, it will then be discussed on its merits, aud I trust this colony will not tako up an isolated posi tion. I will support tho present Government. I will at an early date Address you fully on the nbovo and othor matters of interest. . I am, yours faithfully, F. G. HAMILTON. jyj-ORETON ELECTION. To MESSRS.
