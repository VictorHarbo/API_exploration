No spare parts were carried and at the end of the trip Mr. Birtles writes:-"A close examination of the -working parts-after completion of this long journey-Tcvcaled the fact that they ' .were all perfect, and showed no signs of wear, and beyond cleaning the engine, no repairs of any description were necessary."
