As regards drought resistance, the Department of Agriculture in South Africa states that "for drought resist ance kikuyu grass is great, and has no rival. When the surrounding veldt is dry and withered, the kikuyu re mains green, giving ona the impression of an irrigated field of forage. All kinds of stock are extremely fond of i it, and prefer it to other grasses. The food value is high and superior to our other grasses." See Bent em's advt.
