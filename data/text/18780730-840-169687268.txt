TODD'S, SPECIALITIES, NO. 17. TODD'S mind has of late been a bit over- burdened, and it is time his confessions should be given to the world. Todd's position has become a responsible one. His utterances are held in reverence and esteem by his numer- ous readers, and he has to be careful of what he expounds. In all that he says he carefully avoids personalities. He has no desire to wound any one's sensibilities. This is why he is so popular ; and as his popularity increases, so do his responsibilities. His anxieties con- cerning a Russian invasion wore quite nullified by his successful sale of the Sylvan Grove Estate. The intelligence received of the proclamation of universal peace was fitly celebrated by the Toowong con- cert. Todd was there, and was proud of its well merited success. The music has been running in Todd's head ever since. It did him good. That " March Romanie" was something to be remembered ; but this is a digression. Todd has to unbosom, and it must be done. That three million vote is worthy of the new opposi- tion leader. Todd's eyes have opened wide on several occasions, first in the notices of motion, again in reading the speech, and the third and last time. I shall knock it down. No, steady, on reading the Premier's knowing reply. Mind you we shall get the money, because both sides of the home are agreed about it. The Opposition would like to turn out the Government on it. But " our Sam" saw the point, and of course advised thus : " Say we mean to do it, but had not quite hatched the scheme. Todd believes in it be- cause it will improve trade, create confidence, stir up immigration, increase the number of Todd's constituents, and do good to all classes, but the money must be judiciously spent. Any one can borrow, but it takes a man like Todd to lay it out to the best advantage. Lastly, let Todd advise once more the immediate investment of surplus funds in Toowong Lands. lt is the beat thing in the market. If you wait until the loan is floated they will all be snatched up. If you by now, you can then sell at an enormous profit. Todd him got another plu. The Toowong Estate, situate at the corner of Church-street, Sherwood Road, and opposite Todd's House, within a stone's, throw of the (Railway and the Parish Church. This is now being pegged out and surveyed, and will well repay inspction. Todd's bills are stuck up all over the estate, and there is no deception. The sale will shortly be announced, and Todd will preside at the hammer. Auctioneers' Notices. AUCTION NOTICE. TO WAREHOUSEMEN, MECHANICS, AND WORKING CLASSES GENERALLY, SAVE HOUSE RENT.
