An interesting personality aboard the Comorln when she berthed at Woolloomooloo Bay yesterday was Lieutenant-Colonel Vllh Larsen, Vice-Consul for Denmark, at Bris- bane, who. at the ago o√≠ 72, undertook In January last a strenuous tour of Denmark and Europe. Leaving Australia In a Danish motor ship Colonel Larsen trnvellod le'surely to Copenhagen. In Denmark he had a crowded three months. It was 40 years since he had left It, and there were Innumerable old friends and places of Interest to bo Uslted. And, In addition, there was nn audience with the King, a feature of tho trip of which Colonel Larsen is particularly proud, In view of the fact that Just prior to his leaving Australia the King of Denmark had sent him a special decoration for his consular sorvlces. Leav- ing Denmark eventually Colonel Larsen travellod through Europe to Marseilles, where he boarded the Comorln. Despite his age his health was perfect throughout the strenu- ous tour. "Into bed and out of bed at all hours, I have not missed a meal or a cigar," he said proudly. As the result of hlB trip Colonel Larsen does not see much prospect of Danish Imml I gration to Australia. The Dane likes lila ! little bit of freehold, and the conditions re- quired of the Immigrant coming to Australia and the difficulties of obtaining freehold do not attract him. he explained. There aro numbers of fine young mon In Denmark anxious to go abroad, but the bulk of them aro going to Canada. r Better opportunities aro avail- able there. ' Colonel Larson sala that his Inquiries showed tbnt Danish produce was ns firmly established on the London market as over, and he con- sidered that It would be fllfTleult for Australia, as a competitor, to replnco It. Apart fiom the natural advantages that Denmark posses- sed, he said that the co-operative movement wns so strong that only the first quality was placed In a regulated manner upon the mar- ket. ____________________
