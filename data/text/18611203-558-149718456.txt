The following extracts from reports accompanying an lysej, by the in03t eminent Victorian Chemists, will prove the'ttuth of the above: Dr Macadam, Government Analyst, states-" 1 have nc yet met *itb a Guano so rich in those valuable ingredients (ammonia and salts)." * * "The proportions of other Insoluble matter is greatly under the average. I fully anti cipate that agriculturists will have every reason to be satis fied with the results obtainable from the iueof this Guano." Mr John Kruse, Analytical Chemist, writes - "The Guaoo contains nearly a* much ammonia In different forms as Peruvian, has more uf the phosphate?, and contains only a small proportion of sand or stony matter, and is appli cable not only At grain but for all kinds of crops, and must have & hotter effcct than the lat'cr on ccreala on account^ thegreatcr quantity of phosphate* this guano contains. I consider this Guano to be a fertilizer of the highest decree, far superior to the Flat Island Guatio, and 1 believe almost equal to the lot Peruvian." Mr V/. hydney Gibbon* callfit "a trus Guano, counsting almost entirely of animal excrements, and of the substances usually found with them in natural deposits." * * " ihe falls aro just euch as are'most valuable in &oU;«, and the large amount of animal and'other organic matter will enable It to tear favorable comparison with IheotherGuanos inthemarket." Buyers can view the Guano in a heap of 150 to 200 tons, and see it bagged, thereby assuring themselra that the bulk and sample correspond. R II.
