He 13 devotedly fond of his wife. and since the news reached him of her se vere illness he has never been the same man. It has always been a subject of re gret with him that he had no children of his own, and his and the Empress's fond ness for them indaced them to adopt the young Prince Iturbide, sin of the former ill-fated Emperor, intendins, if their reuxi in Mexico had been more fortunate, ttai hi should have been their successor. A canard was rife some few months eince of an amour of his with a very beau tiful Indian girl, and of the birth of a . child, bat no credit was ever attached to j it | Maximilian, as heir-apparent to the . throne of Austria before the birth of his : nephew, was brought up in the scb'.'jl of &n; absolute monarchy, but his view; have a liberal tendency, he aiways cotisidering that the people should be fully and thor- ; oughly represented, aad that the power of the sovereign asaiust their will should not ' be absolute. He was always very much . beloved by the Austrian people. When he assumed the government of Mexico he dis tinctly stated' his wishes that the people should be represented by a Congress, firmly believing that it was by the popular ', will that he had been called to the throne. . and, as has already been stated, he declared ; his intention to govern them by I'jv=. or no: ' at alL These praiseworthy deiipi- were. however, overruled by Marihil Bazaitie. ? and poor Maximilian found. a'. ?=very icrn ; that he was nothing but a tool ia this j man's hands and those of his eqaaiiy un- . Ecrapnlons master, Loaii Napoleon. Had , he been lefi to himself he would never : hare aimed at a despotic government, bat would, to the best of his power, have tried ? to govern the country on his own pet plan. : For the United States he has always ex- , pressed the most friendly feeling. The j writer has frequently heard him say that j an amicable relatioD with that country was j all ha desired to make his rule happy and j bis government stable. He was very par- j tial to Americans, always showing marked ; courtesy to them. The day before he left i Mexico an American lady, wife of one of j his chamberlains, had an interview with i him touching some money due to her, and I in a jesting manner told him that she beard | he was not fond of her countrymen. He ! replied, assuring her that it was a gross ' libel on him, by whoever had told her so : | that there was no people on the earth for I whom be had a greater respect and admi- j ration, and, as an earnest of his sincerity, requested her to dictate her own terms, and that her claim 6hould be immediately arranged and paid as ehe demanded. He tried always to encourage American immi gration to the country, well knowing the strength it would have afforded him ; and bat for Bazaine, who would not hear of it, he would have had a large legion of Ameri cans in his own service. Tbe man who ' couldn't stand it any lodger ' has taken a Mat, and now feels quite comfort able.

The deliberations of the society were presided over by a venerable darkey, who performed the duties with the utmost dignilypeculiar to his colour. The subject for discussion on the occa sion of which we write, was, ' which am de mudder ob de chicken — the hen wot lay de egg, or de hen wot hatches de chick?' The ques tion was warmly debated, and many reasons pro and con were argued and combated by the excited disputants. Those in favour of the latter proposition were evidently in the majority Bud the president made no attempt to conceal that his sympathies were with the dominant parly. At length an intelligent darkey arose from the minority side, and begged leave to state a proposition to this effect: — 'Spose,' ?aid he, 'datdey setone dozenduck'a eggs under a ben, and dey hatch, which am de mudder, de duck or de hen t' This was a poser, was well pub and nonplussed tbe other side^even stag, goring the president, who plainly asw tbe force of the argument, but had committed himself too far to yield without a struggle ; so, after cogi tating and scratching his wool for a few minutes, a bright idea struck him. Bising from Jiis chair in all the j-rid6-nf conscious .superiority, lie announced :—' Ducks am not before tbe house ; chickens am the question ; derefore I rule de ducks out!' and do it he did, to the complete overthrow of the ojipi nenta. ? *
