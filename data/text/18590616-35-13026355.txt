VOTE FOR TERRY ! who advocates the expenditure of half the Land Fund in making good Roads instead of inundating the Labour Market. VOTE FOR TERRY ! who bas shown the means by which every man who is will- ing to cultivate a Farm, can obtain one-where the rich lands of the country aro most valuable, and where, by means of wator carriage, he can bring his produco lo mar- ket at a cheap rate. This may be cfi'ectod by tho simple plan of giving 99 years' credit, on paying five per cent, interest upon the amount of purchase, as a yearly rent in advance to the Revenue. So that, if his Fifty Acre Farm cost fifty pounds, his rent would be but Fifty Shillings a year. This plan leaves tho small capitalist the means whereby to cultivate and stock his Farm, until he can afford to pay off the purchase money. This la the sort of protection to benefit the country. VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who lias shown tho only reasonable means of bettering the condition of the mechanic and working man, that is, by lessening the supply of labour by one- half, and carefully classifying the description of that imported, according to the requirements of the colony-for labour, like other commodities, is a question of supply and demand. This is the protection which reason dictates, instead of placing a prohibitory tax of 25 per cent, upon your food and clothing, and which the political tinkers call Protection. VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who will oppose the shameful charge of a double tax upon your carts and dravs. This IS Protection. VOTE FOR TERRY! Who will advocate Railway Reform with reduced fares for passengers, horses, and vehicles generally. VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who will tax the squatters in proportion to the number of sheep and cattle'they possess, thereby compelling them to contribute their fair proportion to tho revenue. VOTE FOR TERRY ! Who will oppose the introduction of Chinese ; who, by in- termarrying with the degraded portion of our white popu- lation, aro becoming the progenitors of a piebald race in Australia, to bo the companions of your children.
