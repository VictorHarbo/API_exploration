FEDERAL BUDGET: THE' TREASURER'S SPEECH: REVENUE FOR 1911-12: £20;546,361. EXPENDITURE : £20,121,995. A SURPLUS OF £2,261,541. CURRENT YEAR'S REVENUE ESTIMATED AT £20;422,000.. EXPENDITURE SET DOWN AT £22,683,541. ITHE MATERNITY, ALLOWANCE. INCREASED COST OF DEFENCE. , AUSTRALIAN NOTES AND COINAGE. Melbourne, Aug. 1. The Federal Treasurer (Mr. 'Fisher) de livered his Budget speech in the House of Representatives- this afternoon. Mr. Fisher said:-In presenting the last Budget to Parliament on October 26, 1911, the surplus of revenue over expenditure fof the year ended June 30, 1911, was stated at £1,829,524, but when the Treasury books were finally balanced this amount appeared as £1,857,175. It was transferred for future expenditure to the construction of the fleet fund and the invalid and old-age pensions fund in,equal amounts of £918,587. In framing the Budget of 1911-12 it was esti mated that £1,712,679 of that amount would be expended during the financial year. I all happy to say that, owing to the large receipts from Customs and the savings on the estimated expenditure, it was not neces sary to expend this amount, as the revenue exceeded the expenditure by £424,366, of which amount £278,242 was transferred to the construction of the fleet fund and £146, 124 to the invalid and old-age pensions fund. On June 30, 1912, there was in. all at the credit of the construction of the fleet fund and the invalid and the old-age pensions fund the amount of £2,261,541. This amount may be considered as the surplus balance biought' forward from preceding years, and is available for expenditure in the present finanical year. REVENUE FOR 1911-12. The revenue for the year ended June 30 last amounted to £20,546,361. Customs and. Excise reached the large amount of £14,710,199, being £1,729,755 in excess of the collections of the previous year and £910,199 above the estimate. I attribute the present large'receipts principally to the great pros perity which Australia is now enjoying and which, I hope, will Iong continue. The Post Office. yielded £3,916,5 9, being £46,599 over the estimate and £10,584 in excess of the receipts of the preceding year. .This was in spite of the fact that we had penny post age throughout the Commonwealth and Bri tish dominions during the whole of 1911-12, while it was in operation only for two nionths in the previous year. The land tax yielded £1,366,454, being £63,546 under the estimate and £3891 less than the receipts of 1910-11. The gross profits from coinage amounted to £.156,489, being £53,511 less than the estimate and £42,404 less than those of the previous Tear. Some diffi culty has been found in obtainine suffi cient quantities of silver coin from tendon in consequence of pressure of business in the Royal Miat owing to the gold requirements of the Bank of Engand, also in collecting British silver in convenient denominations from the banks in order to exchange it for Australian coinage. I am hoping to make such arrangements that we shall be able in future regularly to export £100,000 per -annum in face value of British silver. Ii is, of course, difficult to collect small coins from every part of Australia, but the diffi culty will be overcome. Included in last years revenue was an amount of £113,340, being the balance of the Defence trust fund accounts on June 30. The Defence Department desired that this amount should remain in the respective trust funis created for the convenient work ing of the various factories established by the department, but I take the view that although trust funds may be used with ad vantage during the year in connection with the working of the factories, the -depart ment should not be allowed to accumulate funds which could be used in future years without review by Parliament. EXPENDITURE FOR 1911-12. The expenditure for the year ended June 30 last was £20,121,995, not including the amount of £424,365, which I have already referred to as having been charged to' spe cial appropriations and credited to the fleet and old-age pensions funds. The amounts paid to each State under the. Surplus Re venue Act of 1910 were :-New South Wales, £2,046,993; Victoria, £1,667,657; Queensland, £761,302; South Australia, £511,719; West ern Australia, £599,991; and . Tasmania, £236,761 .,Total, £5,824,425. CURRENT YEAR'S REVENUE.

PAYMENTS TO STATES. The following shows the amounts payable ;o each State during 1912-13 under the Sur plus 'Revenue Act -New South Wales, £2,099,291: Victoria, ~ 7 08 Queensland, £890,452: South Australia, ;52$ 967; Western Australia, £612,358; Tasmania, £28,974; - total, £5,983,750. POST AND TELEGRAPH DEPARTMENT.. In connection with the Post and 7 elcgraph Departmes., it will be seen that last year the expenditure, not including new works and., buildings, exceeded the revenue by -£385,954. The ex penditure for new works and buildings -was £1,442,475. It is estimated that during the current year the expenditure, 'not including new works, will exceed the revenue by £440,275. The expenditure provided for new works is £1,152275. 'In addition to the amount of £83,000 provided this year for telegraphs and telephones and for wireless telegraphy, the Department will probably. expend £429,460, the balance unexpended of the £600,000 specially provided last year, and paid into a special trust account. Pro vision has been made for a large increase in the permanent staff of the Post Office. It has been represented by the Department that- economy would finally result from such new appointments, the present system, of employing a large number of temporary. hands being very unsatisfactory. 'Provision has accordingly been made for an additional staff of 1,733 officers. The total number of permanent officers provided for in the Esti mates is 18,587. 'In 1906-7 only 10,961 were provided for. In 1902-3 the revenue was £2,404,730, being 12s. 5d. per he.d. In 1912-13 the revenue is estimated at £4,220. 000, or. 17s. 10d. per head. In 1902-3 the' expenditure, not incldding new works, was £2,433,147, or 139. 3d. per head. In 1912-13 the expenditure, not including new works, is estimated at £4,674,715, or 19s. 11id per head. Provision has been made for the erec tion during the year of 10 wirelees tele graph stations. It is estimated that there will be an increase of £19,000 over the ex penditure of the previous year for the con veyance of mails, due to the extension of existing facilities and to the increased cost of existing services An- increase- of £14,000 has been provided to meet the additional rates of payment to the States Railway De partment from .January 1 under.the agree ment providing for a re-weighing of the mails. The sum. of £45,500 as been pro-, vided to allow of remuneration being given to non- official postmaster on an increased scale. THE DEFENCE DEPARTMIENT. The expenditure for defence has largely increased during the last three years. The total expenditure, including new works, etc., from July 1, 1901, to Juno 30, 1910. was £9,578,997. The expenditure in 1910-11, 1911-12, and 1912-13, is estimated at £12.524. 429, of which £5,438,364 is included in the. Estimates for the current financial year. In view of the considerable increase in expendi ture for defence the following information, which has been furnished by that depart ment, will be interesting. It is the inten tion this year to hold a nine-months' school of instruction for the purpose of training 60 candidates for the instructional staff, and provision has been made- accordinely. It is intended to establish d srcTool for the training of officers in aviation, and provision has been made for two pilot aviators and four mechaiics, also for . the purpose of aviation stores, and four machines have already been purchased. The training of cadets at the Royal Military College is proceeding satisfactorily. There are 79 cadets in residence, 15 of which are from New Zealand. The number of cadets will be largely increased during this year, and provision has been made accordingly. The cordite factory is at present engaged in experimental and proof work. The cor dite produced has passed the ballistic test, but the chemical capability tests are not yet completed. There is, however, no rea son to doubt that the cordite produced will be suitable for ammunition. The plant of the small arms factory has been installed, and has passed satisfactory tests, and the anal payment on account of the contract has been made to Messrs. Pratt and Whit ney. Up to the present the factory has been engaged in the manufacture of com panent parts of rifles, a donsiderable stock of which-is in hand. It is anticipated that the assedhbling of the rifles and the output of completed small arms will shortly com mence. The clothing factory, which at pre sent employs 300 hands, began operations in January last, and during the period January to June, 1912, turned out garments • to the value of £26,795. The clothing mann factured was of a high quality; and was turned out at a reasonable cost. It is an ticipated, however, that the cost of produc tion will be considerably lowered during this year. It has been found that the pre sent capacity of the- factory is not sufficient for requirements, and provision has teen made for the duplication of the plant. The harness and saddlery factory has been in full working order for the last 11 months. and during that time a large quantity of high-class military equipment, as well as mailbag, etc., has been manufactured to the satisfaction of the Defence and the Postmaster-Generars Departments. At pre sent 115 hands are employed, and the results achieved by the factory are of such a satis factory nature that it is intended to en large the premises during this year, when the number of hands will also most prob ably be increased. ,A site for the woollen cloth factory has been selected at Geelong aI the Corio Quay, and the erection of buildings and the purchase of the machin ery and power plant are now being proceed ed with. The Estimates for the naval branch of the Defence Department show an increase of £f370,407, the principal items be ing:-3Maintenance of ships and vessels, £186,000; permanent sea-going navarl forces, £14.800. Provision has been made to en ter 24 cadets on January I next in the C Naval College at tieelong. It is acs pated that the buildings at Jervis Bay' will be sufficiently advanced to accommodate tbh boys to be entered on July 1, 1914. So far 99 boys have been entered on the boys' training rhip Tingira. and it is proposed to enter an additional 100 boys before June 30. 1913.. As regards the permanent sea-going naval forces, provision is made for a full year for the crews of H.M.A.S. Encounter Yarra, Parramatta, and Waggego. the gun boats Gayundah, Paluma, and Protector, and the torpedo boats. Provioson has been made for an average of four months each for H.M.A.S. Australia. Sydney. and Melbourne, and the depot ship for submarines, and the submarines AE1 and AE2. Portion of the crews of the vessels has to be collected be fore the vessels themselves are actually ready. The full complements for the above mentioned vessels, totalling 2,539 officer and men, are provided for on the Estimates. As regards the naval establishments at Sydney, during 1912-13 the approximate ex penditure for one month only for salaries-ii provided for. Provision is also made for the necessary personnel for the naval depot and dockyards at Williamstown. also gunnery, torpedo, and wireless schools. As regards naval reserves, provision is made for the boys who pased from the senior eadets into the adult fores on July 1 (i.e., boys at. taing the age of 18 years during 191_". . numbering 807. lTe number of- senior naval cadets on July 1 was 3,225. Tra -is ar? ,- .!.? ^u-'measef of'£6,U000'for' the l am nce o i ships and vessels consequent upon the necs . ary provision for 12 nonths for ILM.A. ships actually in commission, including H.M.A.S"i Encounter, and.for portion of the year for .lhe thro c'eruisers buildingi in SGireat Britain. For the ieserves of stores there is an increase of £150,000 necessary for the purchase of reserves of stores to " .be stocked by the Admiiralty at Sydney be 1,fore June 30, 1913. For the use of the • fleet until an increase of £68,000 is neces sary to: provide for :increased personnel of slhips :and, establishmena :-The Estinptes of expeiditure':is connection-with the mili tary forces for:.1912-13 show On :increase approximately of £369000 'ii! comparison with last year's figures. This increase- is t .partly caused by thelItecessity to provide for the: lar el' incteasecl staffs requircd for ad-' ministration and instruction in connection with the universal training move ment. In connection with the Royal Australian Field Artillery provision has 'been made for the instructional cadre. in Queensland to be brought:: up_.to.tlie: establishment of a full battery, to be 4esig nated No. 3 battery. .In connehction with the. Royal Australian Garrisdn;:Artillery, permanent officers and non-commissioned officers' to comlilete'the first relief of man ' ning for the fixed defences have been pro vided for. A number of. instructors have also been proiided for to carry out the in *stiuotion of the, militia garrison artillery. , In connection with the Royal Australian' En gineers, provision. has been made for. the \- increased personnel required in coniection with the formation of a first relief for the workin?.of defence electric lights, as recom. mended by Lord Kitchener. Increased I rates of pay.,for all ranks have also been provided for. In the 'ermanent Afmy Sii-' vice Corps provision has been made for in creased personnel for the. remount sections required to train and handle remountsfor StheI, new.batteries 'of militia field artillery" which itis intended to raisq this year.' It is intended to obtain the services of an officer of, the. British Army: Ordnance' De-' partment for the purpose of advising' as to the reorganisation of the Ordnance Depart ment in the Comnionwealth. 'An amount' has also been provided to meet the cost'of the increased .personnel which will be re quired upon woriganisation. In connec tion i with the instructional staff, provision has been made for the promotion' of 19 war rant and non-commissioned officers .to the commiasioned rank of quartermaster, and, algo for increased rates of pay to 'warrant and noicomimissioned:officers. 'Anicreiased. number Of - instructbrs has also been pro vided. to meet the requirementaof universal .trainiiig.

" been engaged during the year in the investi- g:atioh: of bitter pit in apples. .He'has fur-: ,ished his 'first progress. report to the Minis-. ter, -who hak instructed that it should be p-,rinted at once and.made' available. In' l-astyear's statplnent it was menitioned that. the Board of Inquiry appointed to investi-. -'gate; the nature and result of the work or ..the trailer Endeavour, expressed a very 'high opinion as to her-performance and the . seriflness' of 'her =-work. -It jalsdksuggested that an experimental 'trip should be mad, an commercial lines., This was 'done, with the result that five tonsbof marketable, fish w: wero:taken during 19hours.of :actual fish ing, or at the rate -of 5901b;. per houir of fishing. Another- noteworthy result of the ship's worth' is the iscovery of extensive and rich. fishing grounds in' the Great' Aus "trolian : Bight-.and within localities that prem?viosly? were altogether' 'unknown. 'T?iugh hler strveywork, incidental tfo the SfisaIing, the Endeavour has-also ascertained ` the positioi .of the hundred fathom line all 'throph the Australian Bight, which' is of \- 'value to'shipping, and her survdys are StHeirwisO .essential to all commercial- deep I-sea' fishini, that may be initiated;: Several; 'local proposals to float fishing companies are d "~snd consideration. 'Owing to a general -i-want'-of knowledge of such matters prog has been slow. Lately, however, several mn giiirs iimade': y fiimsi thle United Kifdlom show that the Endeavour's work is being closely watched, and modern trawlers may be sent out to take advantage of the ex ploratory work already done. There are' still vast: areas unexploited, but sufficient has been attained to show that trawling, if carried out on proper liies, must be a com mercial success in. Australia, even. if fish is sold at popular prices and forwarded a con siderable distance inland. On this occasion last year I announced, in respect of quaran tine, that the .Government had sent Dr. Norris, the.Director of Quarantine, abroad to - ipquiref into. and " report upon quaran tine methods .and equipment in other countries.. Thzis course had been de. cided upon, 'owing to'. the large prospective expenditure. which 'had been recomnieded by the Director on account of the defective and starved condition of the quarantine machinery handed over to the Commonwealth by' the States. Whilst the Government fully recognised that the, pro tection of the public health was the first consideration, it was hoped that it might be possible to avoid uisdue expease. The Direc tor, who was absent for six months, has now submitted a report to the Government, which is satisfied that large and careful expenditure is absolutely 'necessary for the due protection of the Commonwealth-the cleanest country in the world as regards' disease-from the pestilences which are found i. b~very other continent, and which threaten us more every day owing to our in. creasing intercourse and trade. It may be mentioned that quarantinable' disease has been brought to Australia with greater fre quency during the last 12 months than ever before. Fortunately, it has in every in stance been detected and prevented from attaining-a. footing. It-is proposed to dis tribute the expenditure over several years, but during the present year it is intended to make good the more-serious gaps in this the first line of sanitary .ddefence in Aus tralia. The results, it is believed, will be not only greater. security against the en trance, of disease,. but also, a reduction of the delays to trade and commerce which quarantine necessarily entails:. Reports on the coastal lighthouse service have been re ceived, giving fulbldetails of the immediate i'requirements of Queensland, T'asmania, the south-east coast of Victoria. and the North: ern Territory. The coasts of South Aus tralia and Western Australia., havp?also been visited, and reports are nowbeing completed. The coast of New South Wales and the western coast of Victoria, a.total =of about 1,000 miles, remain tb be inspect ed. .The work of this Department has ,greatly increased during 'the' past' year. The great increase in revee~ue and -immigra tion' has been dealt with without adding very materially to thbo'expenses of the De partment- The following statement shows the: cost of collecting per cent. of the Cus toms and Excise revenue' of the Common wealth'for 1909-10, 1910-11. 1911-12, 'and the' estimate for 1912-13 :-1909-10. £2 6s. 5d.; 1910-11; £2 2s. 7d.:.1911-12, £1 17s.; 1912 13, £1 19s. 11d, The c'ost. of. working the Department is less now than at 'any other time since Federation. , THE NORTHERN TERRITORY. The' principal:positions on the admmistra tive staff of the Northern' Territory have 'been filed, and an examination is being made of areas which-it' is propseed to make 'available: for settlers. ý Separate provision has been made'for the office of Judge, as it is considered that the position of a Judge and Government Resident should be', sepa rated. Schools and agricultural. stations are -being provided for-the-natives, who number -bout 20,000. Brogress is beihg anade 'with demodstrationv farms, and, it. is pro 'posed to appoint an entomologist,' in order to deal with insect nests. ' A' Director of Mines :and Geologist has -been appointed, it being desired that the mines shall be worked more scientifically than in the past. Provision -is made for the erection of houses for Government employees, as it has been found that private enterprise has done prac tically nothing towards meeting this want. It id proposed to purchase two steamers, one 'to maintain communication alongthe coast; and the other to act as an airiiliary., vessel for river work. The suni of £2,500 is pro 'vided towards the cost. TROPICAL DISEASES., The vote'fdr the advancement of the study oftropical diseases has been increased from £1,350 to £4,000;. it .being-thought' desirable that the scope of the investigation madoe .by the Tropical Diseases Hospital at Townsville should be increased. PAPUA. The vote' for the adninistration of Papua has been increased'from £25,000 to £30,000, as it is intended to establish a number of dllitionena , ta tious,..the, Lieutena.t?.Governor· iavie'g reporit? that' such are absolutely necessary. The sum of. £10,000 is provided towards tho codst 'of a""ne: "Gteriimeht' steamer, estimated at £25,000, the present. 'vessel havihn been 2pd'clsed 23'years ago anid being practically wdo dut. 'The waire less station at Port "More~iby' will' probably be finished within'th'o next' six weeks.' '.lEPENDFITURE ON.NEW .WORKS. Hon. members will find an interesting statement, in the Budget papers, setting 'forth. the expenditure on new works,. build inggs; etc., from 1901. .The total .expendi .tnre to Juno 30 was '£14,100,754, and the Commoniwealth. 'is to,-be congratulated on having. expendeddthis money from revenue instead of having raised a public debt for the :purpose. :It will-be observed' that the property taken over from the States amount ed to£9,591,588,.so that the Commonwealth Shas sinco expended one and a half times as much. It will also be noticed that during the three years 1910-11, 1911.12, 1912-13, it is'estimated that £10,004,379 will be ex pendea, while during the nine years ended .une 30; 1909, only £?69,245 was expended. On works connectedl with the establishment of the Federal capital this year the amount of £110,000.has been provided for the con truction of a railway to Quenbeasn to the cit' site and for carrying out othdr pre. iminary weorks incidental to the building of the, city.. COMMONWEALTH INSCRIBED STOCK, In "adcordance with the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act. 1911, trust funds under the control of tile Treasurer were invested in stock. On April 1 last, the necessary' authority having been granted by the Loan Act. 1911.' funds were thus made available as follows:- For the construction of the rail way from Kalgoorlie to Port Augista, £39,524; for the purchase of land in Lon don, £400,0: ; to redeem Treasury- bills issued by th6 Government of South Austra lia on account of-the Northern Territory, £226.000; to pay to the State of South Aus tralia the amount expended from revenue towards the corstruction of the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. £34,476; total, £700,000. PUBLIC DEBT. The public debt. of the. Commonwealth amounted on June 30 to £6,361,847.. It con sists.of-. the stock to which I just referred, -amounting to £700,000; balance of loans raised in respect of the. Northern Territory taken over from South Australia, £3,431, 836; balance of loans raised in respect of the Port Augusta railway taken over from the State of South Australia, £121401; to. tal, £6,371,947. As regards the Common wealth stock, provision has been made in .the'Estimateg for the contribution to a sink ing fund at. the rate of 10s. per'cent. per :annum. :Provision has also been made for similar, contributions to a sinking fund in connection with the loans taken over from South Australia in, -the terms. of the INorthern Territory Acceptance Act. The rate - payable in respect of these loans is the' same .-as that which 'the State had promised to pay. TRANSFERRED PROPERTIES. Last year the amount of £673,600 was Soted by Parliament' for interest at 3, per cent-."and- sininng fund at 'per cent. on the value of properfids transferred'frot the States, to the Commonewalth, the interest being' calculated from July 1, 1910. The amount of .£570,095, being interest at 3 per cent 'from that. date,, was paid to the States. No:payment was- made' however, to the sink~ing fund as I proposed, subject to the approval of Parliament, to pay the States the full amount of 3J per cent; in terest?` Provision' has been made on the present Estimnates: accordingly. . -OVERNMENT PRINTING. :An-inquiry into the methods pursued by the: Stateo.:epartment of:.the Government Printer having been instituted by the Pgre omier of. Victoria, I have made .the su gestion that, considering ths interest which the Commonwealth Government has in .the working of.- thb office,, an . expert. appointed by it should Il associated with the gentle men appointed to: conduct the inquiry on behalf, of, the State. ' -I thiik,, generally speaking, that the arrangement" with the Government of -Victoria:'was a good one, but there is no doubt that it is very difficult to work such.an establishment in which part of the' machinery and type ,is owned by the Commonwealth and .part by the State in such a nianner- as to be fair to both. THE COMMONWEALTH BANK. - The Commonwealth Bank was opened for business on July 15, the Act commencing on thatedate,by proclamation, and I am happy to say 'that the' bank has made a satisfac tory commencement._; Up to the .present 2,760 accounts have been' opened. in. the savings branch the amount of deposits being £69,7. Therohaie been'll17 withdrawals, lotalling £818. . THE LAND TAX. W-While malcing a s'bstantiaL'contribution to the revenue, the land tax also has opera ted beneficially;'inducing' some owners to subdivide their large estates, thus providing homes for more settleri and.adding to the produactiveneas of the- land.; INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS. On June,30, 1912, there were 79,071 old \- . . ; , .. . ge' penmioner? g- an mcree -o' E,569 in the 12 months. This increase cannot be considered large. There are at present about 105,000 persons in the Commonwealth over the age of 65 years, and about 140,000 over the age. of 60 years. Of those quali fied by age, 79,000 are pensioners, and 166,000 are not lensioners. A considerable num ber would be debarred from obtaining pen sions through their having property or in come in excess of that allowed by the Act, or being aliens, etc., but it is certain that the number who, from independence of spirit or from sentimentf refrain from claiming old ago pensions is: large. : From, these persons a regular,'increase, in the pension list may be expected, because reluctance to accept old-age pensions is'.gradually becoming less. This is inevitable in a system which recog nises that the pensions are a right and not a charity. On.the whole, it is thought that the increase of 3,569 old-ago pensioners in the year. is only a normal one. On June 30 last the number of invalid pensioners was 10,763, being an,increaso of 3,312 on the figures for:the previousiyear. It may;be anticipated that, the increase in future years will not be so great, because on June 30, 1911, invalid pensions had been payable by the Common wealth 'for a period of six months only, and the first rush of pensioners to take ad- antage of the Act had not ceased on that date. The expenditure on old-age and invalid pensions in -the year just' closed amounted to £2,148,134, compared with £1,868,648 in the previous year., These figures, however, do not represent thl true position, because the pension list wa being added to considerably during each year. The proper comparison is on the annual rate payable on the last day of each financial year.. On June 30 1911, the annual rate of payment was £2,054,364, and on June 30, 1912, it wag £2,224,066, approximately being an increase of £169,702 in -the year. The amount actually payable to old-age and invalid pensioners in 1912-13 is. estimated at £2,405,000. This includes provision for increased payments which will result if Parliament passes the Bill to be shortly sub mitted for the purpose of granting pensions to persons who are at present dasqualified by the <iwnership of homes. The cost of the administration of invalid and old-age pensions during 1911-12 was £41,794, being at the rate of 11 18s. 10d. for every £100 of pension paid. The cost of administration in 1912-13' is estimated .at £45,715, or £1 18s. for every £100 of pensions paid. In this connection it may be inentioned that the cost of administration in New South Wales was in 1908-9, the last year of the State system,: £25141, and the total amount paid in pensions was £602,208. The cost of ad ministration thus represented £4 3s. 6d. for every £100 of pensions paid. It should also be pointed out that the comparison is somewhat unfair to the Commonwealth ad: ministration, in that the cost of the latter includes payments for some services which were rendered free to the State, Pensions Office. A comparison with the cost in New Zealand is not easily made, because the published figured apparently do not include the costs of services rendered by other de partments. The low cost of. the Common wealth administration, as cbmpared with that of New South Wales, is largely ac counted for by the fact that pensions in New South Wales were paid by the banks, which received £2 for every £100 of pen sions paid. Under the Commonwealth an improved method of payment and account ing has been established, and the work of payment costs 12s. 6d. for every £100 of pen siena paid. MATERNITY ALLOWANCE... A sum of £400,000 has been included in the Estimates for maternity allowances. A Bill will shortly be introduced for; the pur pose of making these grants I feel coni dent that a wise step is being taken in initi ating, this policy. The protection of the mother .and the safety of' the child.aro so important to the community, and so hu-. manitarian,. that I feel sure that, although the administration will not be "free from difficulties, suffering will be relieved, health' proinoted, 'and valuable lives spared to the Commonwealth. AUSTRALIAN NOTES. ACT. The Amending Notes Act of 1911 provides that the Treasurer shall hold in gold coin a reserve:of not less than one-fourth of the amount of' Australian notes issued. The. amendment took effect on July 1,1912, and until that date the Treasurer was required to keep in gold coin one-fourth of the amount. up to £7,000,000, and pound for pound abov4 £7,000,000. On June 30 the' ciiculatioa stood' at £9,485 943, and the gold' in the Treasury a?mountedlto £4,279,037, be ing £43,064 above the amount then legally required... In July £340,000 in gold was traisfefred' froni:the Treasury' vaults'to the' banks in Melbourne, and £60,000, received -s,interest,being. also.available, the.amount of'£400,000 was placed on fixed deposit with the Treasurer of New, South Wales, the rate' of interest being'3~ 'per cent. per annum.: It being desirable that the positions of the notes fund should be strengthened as far as possible by the frequent maturing of in vestments, it was arranged that the £400,000 should be repaid in instalments of'£100,000, the first instalment in July, 1913, ani.subse-, quent instalments at intervals of one year. In all, the Treasury has invested out of the notes fund the amount of £4,685,000, and.the annual amount:of interest at present being earned'is £199,300.. The interest earned by the ' notes investments is credited to the Australian notes account," so that the notes fund is accumulating by com peuind interest. Up to July 29 the Trea sury had received interest amounting to £188,594, and the expenses amounted to £31,714, leaving £156,880 as the next addition to the notes account. On Monday last the circulation was £9,849,599: and the gold held in the Treasury against that circulation was £3,842,663 being 15.92 per cent. more than the legal reserve. Not only will the notes he printed in Australia, but the work ing plates will be made hero. Thd expert now ueing imported will train others, and it is hdped that in future it will always be posiblo' to' find men in Australia who can do the work. COMMONWEALTH INVESTMENTS. 'At present the Treasury is earning interest on £7,408,577. beinrg £5,685,000 on account' of the notes fund, and £1,723,577 on account of general trust funds. The total annual rate of interest is £252,124. In addition thier are conHigh lerCommissioneur to tnuh which the High Commissioner lends to the market. These investments are usually made for a few days at a time and then the unemployed. balance in London is kept low. The repayments of the loans is guaranteed by the Bank of England, which receives a commission on the interest earned. The Commonwealth revenue benefited last year by the-amount of £29,251 interest earned in London, TRANS-AUSTRALIAN RAILWAY. The Commonwealth Government has now agreed with the South Australian and West ern Australian Governments as to the Crown lands, to be granted for the work ing of the Kalgoorlio to Port Augusta rail way, although a formal agreement has not yet been sigued. A'deviation is proceeding which will have the effect of shortening the line at the Kalgoorlio end, and, if successful, will have the effect of bringing ,the ma terials closer in to Kalgoorlie than if situ ated at Kurramia. It is expected that this matter will be determined in the course of a few days. In South. Australia, at the Port Augusta end, steps aer being taken to acquire the private lands required with in the township of Port Augusta, and-from 51 to 100 men will, shortly be employed on earthworks. Arrangements are being made for. rails and sleepers for temporary purposes at each end of the line, and ten ders have been received for rails and sleep ers for the main line. As soon as a suffi cient quantity of these rails and sleepers have been delivered a start will he made to push on with the earthworks and perma nent way.. The money required for the pre sent financial rear is estimated to be £1,000,000. GENERAL. Proceeding, Mr. Fisher said that he would introduce a Bill to grant Tasmania a sum of £500,000 in 10 years. The first payment would be £95,000, and this would be. diminjphed every year until the whole amount was paid. The British Association for the Advance ment of Science had accepted the invitation of the .Commonwealth to visit Australia, and its meetings would be held here in 1914. About half as 'many members would inake the trip as had .been expected, and it was intended to take iteps to entertain the visi tors properly. There was every indication of a continued state of prosperity for Australia, and he thought that Federation had done much to',romote this. There were, however, many barriers to .level. Something should also bedone-to give the Commonwealthcontrol oft navigable rivers, and for this and other purposes an inter-State Commission should be brought into existence. Australia had suffered a great lossby reason of the de lay. He had, communicated with' the Premier of South Africa informing him that the Australian fleet unit 'was about to be com pleted, and that, if South Africa desired, the unit would be brought to Austialia round the Cape of Good Hope. General Botha had replied 'that South Africa would be glad to show it'every hospitality. (Cheers.) He hoped that General Botha would shortly visit Australia." SHTo 1:ad hlso been in communication with the Government' of New Zealand on the question' of reciprocity, and had-hopes that this would be arranged. Mr.' Bryce, the British Ambassador- at Washington,'had remarked that the mother country had protected the dominions until she thought they could walk alone.. That wavs true,, and the time had 'come 'when the mother country had said to the dominions, "Go and manage your own affairs.'' Then S. . -: ; = . it' had' happeneda'at the ?Impe 1 Conference that the mother country had Eaid, "Come back as equals." No country had greater freedom to manage its own affairs than Australia, and they were glad to' be asso dcated with the mother country in protect. ing . the Empire against foreign • foes. (Cheers.) ADJOURNMENT OF TIE DEBATE. Mr. Deakin congratulated Mr. Fisher on his address, and congratulated the Govern ment on the suggestion that an Inter-State Commission bhould he constituted. He moved the adjoirnment of the debarte. SUPPLY BILL. A two months' Supply, Bill for £1,503,574 was introduced and passed through all stages.
