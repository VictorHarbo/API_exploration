MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL, j The. Argus Office, "Wednesday Evening. The issue of £1,250,000 -1 per cent. Treasury Bills in London by New South Wales has proved a success. As regards the net price realised we are without full data as to the dates upon which payment' is to be made by the allottees, but our cable service indicates that the bulk of the money is to be paid upon 1st proximo, the interest accruing from 1st inst. The currency of the bills is two years, the price of emission 499. From the particulars available (and equalling the term of the accrued interest at, say, three weeks the discount is equal to close upon us. On the some conditions 44 per cent. Treasury bills having a currency of two years should realise, say, 1200, less accrued interest. It may, however, prove difficult to realise a premium. Some of the purchasers of the New South Wales Treasury bills are trying to re-sell at par. Our advices state that a, similar issue by Victoria, if made within a week, would probably be successful, owing to the market being in an exceptionally favourable condition. As it appears to be settled that Victoria is to raise money by' Treasury bills, it is to be assumed that the opportunity which now offers will not be missed. "We have received the following communication from the secretary of the Associated Banks :? LONDON EXCHANGE. The Associated Banks have adopted. the following exchange rates on London for bills at 60 days' sight on and from to-morrow morning, 21st inst.:? ToBuy. I To Sell. 12s. 6d. discount. | 7s. 6d. premium. The buying rate was previously 15s. per cent, discount, and the banks have practically retraced the step which they took on the 6th inst. A disposition is manifested by some of the banks to favour a reduction of deposit rates, arid possibly if the matter could be settled in Melbourne along a reduction might be feasible. But some of the Sydney institutions do not at present favour such a movement. The adoption of a 4 per cent rate for 12 months would undoubtedly tend to relieve the monetary position in general, and from that point of view would be welcome. But there are several considerations to be taken into account, and unless it is certain that a lower rate could be adhered to for some time it might not be prudent to adopt it. Several banks hold a large amount of British deposits, and possibly it is advisable to test the permanence of these before taking any such step as that suggested. The difficulties arising out of the, issues of terminable debentures by various land mortgage - companies may enhance the uneasy feeling existing in England with regard to investments in Australia. The position of the Queensland investment and land mortgage company towards its terminable debenture-holders has already excited attention. But the position of the South Australian Land Mortgage and Agency Company is still worse, for it has issued terminable debentures to the amount of £893,430, all of which are repayable within a comparatively short time. Against this amount the company has an uncalled capital or £1,200,000. . It would appear, however, that most of the paid-up capital, £800,000, will beTequired to meet losses incurred. The price of silver has again receded, the quotation now being 42 relict. per oz.. standard. The lowest price ever before reached was died., in July, 1888. The fall is favourable to purchasers from silver currency countries. In his fortnightly circular, dated January 18, Sir. Frederick Wright reports upon financial affairs in Adelaide as follows: "There is no change to report in the money market. Few securities of an acceptable hind are being offered, and the results of the harvest do not tend to induce farmers to increase their holdings, and until rain falls they are wise in holding off. Meantime money is accumulating on fixed deposits at the banks, but these funds do not circulate, for there is no encouragement in the uncertainty of the labour question to embark in any new undertakings requiring large employment of labour. This is the more to be regretted, as in the present stagnation In Melbourne many of our former labourers and artisans are returning here, and the Immigration and the emigration returns show that at last we are regaining population." The following, which is taken from an article in The Miller of December 7, is of interest to Australian millers, as indicating the relative positions of Australian and New Zealand wheats for flour making purposes :? " In the following table is summarised the mean results of many investigations, showing the quality of wheat by the weight per standard bushel, and the average yield of flour on milling, together with selected organic constituents in the various foreign wheat.

The quantity of wheat and flour afloat for the United Kingdom shows an increase for the week of 208 000 quarters, and the quantity afloat for the Continent shows an increase of 108,000 quarters. The total quantity afloat again exceeds 4,000,000 quarters. Private cable messages received from London report a further fall in Australian wheat. For parcels 38s., and for cargoes 39s. per 480 lb., c.f.i., are now buyers' offers. One message is as follows: " The market is weak. The nearest quotation is 39s., with all options." The freight market is weak, and is quoted at 27s. 6d. to 28s. 6d. for large to medium sized vessels. The Adelaide Chamber of Commerce has declared the weight of fair average quality South Australian wheat for the present season at 631.- The weight of Victorian wheat will be declared shortly. The local market in wheat has been rather firmer to day. The Adelaide shipping firms who are operating in Victoria this year are giving full rates in the country, and are thus intercept ing supplies. The country millers are also buying largely, while many farmers are preferring to store. A good business has been done at 4s. 1d., and for a few small ex- station lots 4s. 9½d. has been accepted. Out of 1,824 bags wheat offered at auction, 1,108 bags were sold ; 72 bags prime fetched 4s. 1d., 155 bags good milling 4s. 6½d., 554 bags medium 3s. glad. to 3s. ink., and 327 bags weevily old 3s. 7d. to 3s. 8d. Trade lots of town roller flour are quoted at up to £10 IBs., and parcels at £10 10s. In barley, sales of about 800 bags Cape have been made at 2s. 2d.

Out of 800 bags maize offered at auction 458 bags were sold, prime red at 2s. 10d., good at 2s. 6d. to 2s. Old and damaged at Is. 10d. Peas are unaltered at 2s. 4d., with moderate sales. None of the 135 bags peas offered at auction were sold. Bran is quoted at 10d. to 10d., with small sales at the latter figure. At auction, 40 bags pollard were sold at 1s. Id. Town millers quote Is. 11d. The import markets have been moderately active. For sugar a strong demand continues, but, penning the receipt of the cable messages from Mauritius, due to-morrow, holders do not sure to entertain offers. Business reported covers about 30 tons Mauritius manufacturing. A fair amount of business has been done in tea, sales comprising 1,000 half-chests common to good common Congou at DAd. to Go., 200 half-chests panyong at 7d., 100 half-chests panyong at 8d., 100 half chests line paying at lid., and 300 quarter chests buds at 10d. The following is from Messrs. (Gow, Wilson, and Stanton's weekly report on the London market, dated December 14 :? " The following table of clearances from all the bonded warehouses in the United Kingdom should be an accurate gauge' to the home consumption of tea in Great Britain. Being calculated from the commencement of each season (June 5) to November 30, It shows the volume of home trade carried on during six months of the year, and embraces the period at which the market is usually most affected by heavy arrivals of the Indian crop. Prices of both Indian and Ceylon tea have this year reached a lower point than ever before? taking quality into con sderation. The great increase in the use of Ceylon tea is no doubt partially traceable to the earlier date of its fall in price. The drop in value of Indian tea being of more recent, date has not., yet correspondingly reflected by deliveries. The exports show- an damaging- developments in the shipping space for Indian".
