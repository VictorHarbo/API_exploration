But especial attention is callod 1 to tho more important fact that SINGER'S MA CHINES make the TRUE LOCK STITCH, which is exactly aliko 011 both sides of tho fabric, and one that ( positively will not ravol ; that thoy do not mako a , ridge on 0110 side of tho material sowed, as do all ; CHAIN STITCH MACHINES ; that thoy do not use one-third as much cotton or sowing material as do all CHAIN STITCH MACHINES ; that they will not ? ravel when one end of a seam is started, as will all Ciiain Stitch scams. And further that Singer's Ma- ; chines do not uso a curved noodlo and circular motion. , On the contrary, SINGER'S NEEDLES are straight ^ and tho motion porpendicular, lionco thoy will stitch f through a vory groat thickness, and sow across seams, ( which would prove instant destruction to a curved or . bont noodlo. 1 For a confirmation of our assertions wo would ro- | spectfully refer to tlio manufacturing establishments t of Messrs Sargood, King k Sargood, Messrs Harris i k Hoymanson, Messrs Solcsborg k Son, Monster 1 Clothing Company ; Mr Skinner's Crinolino Manu- ( factory, and to all othor largo manufacturing houses ] both in Victoria and tho othor Australian colonies, c and to tho thousands of familios who have Singer's c Machines in daily uso. 1 STANFORD k CO., c Corner Bourko and Russell streets, Molbourne ; c Pitt stroot, Sydney ; £ Prince stroet, Duuodin ; 1 Ouoon streot, Auckland. 9 fob 27 j — 1 Tenders. £ OROUGIl of EMERALD-HILL. — Tho TEN- { DERS for the FENCING, Ac., at the Sand- t ridge- road Toll-gato will be received until seven t p.m., on THURSDAY', 1st FEBRUARY. r 49 122 JAS.
