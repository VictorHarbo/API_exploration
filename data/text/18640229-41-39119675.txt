The qnusual circumstance of five steamers being advertised to Ieive the Port about the same time on Saturday caused some little excitement, and attracted a large number of persons to the wharf in addition to the friends of the passengers. The Coorons left shortly after 3 o'clock, having on l-oard Bishop Patteson anil several other passen gers for Melbourne, also a number of men, who are to be lnniled at Port MaeDonnell. The Penola, for Port Robe and Melbourne, was the next to leave, at about half-ptst 4; afterwards the Lubra, for Port Lincoln: the Barwon, for Melbourne, about 5.30; and the Havilah, for Melbourne, at 6 o'clock: ' The Mary Miller, barque, arrived on Saturday from Melbourne. Captain Brown reports losing the head of the topmast when outside the Passage. It carried away in the sheavehole of the topsaU tie, and the topgallantmast and yard came down by the run. The damage was temporarily repaired, and the passage concluded without further casualty. The Dos Jrux, from Sydney ami Newcastle, experienced light easterly winis to Kent's Group, and subsequently strong south-west gales to the Passage. The Hehxt Ellis, though a very smart-looking iresseL has ifot made a brilliant passage, from the Fact that iU commencement and conclusion were both marketl by a continuation of contrary weather, which of course prevented any prospect of making a noteworthy voyage. She is lauen with the usual description of general merchandise, and on the .^eatn-tug Letty discharging her out ward cargo into the Elphinstone. she proceeded to the Henry Ellis and towel her into harlwur. The Marijl, which arrived from Newcastle late last evening.' reports having lieen in company in the Gulf with the Kate, brig, Sinclair, master, from Newcastle. ?
