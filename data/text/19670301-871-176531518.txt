It's an old Danish way Danish custom demands that a flag be consecrated by a golden nail driven through the flagstaff. The Minister for Immigration, Mr Snedden (below), observed the custom in Sydney recently. Mr Snedden had been instructed In the proper technique by the first Danish Ambassador to Australia, Mr E. Blytgen- Petersen, during a dinner in Sydney. Danish and Australian flags were presented to the Association Denmark, a social group begun in Denmark in 1895 and which now has immigration as its main interest. According to ancient ceremony with which the Danish flag has been honoured since the country's flag was created in 12i9, three nails must be driven into the flagstaff: one for God, Monarch and Country; one for the People; and a third for the city accepting the banner. Mr Snedden wielded his hammer in the first cause.
