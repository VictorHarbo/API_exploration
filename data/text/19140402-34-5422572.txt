In Anaemia, the red corpuscles are more or less deficient. Thus the blood cannot properly sustain and nourish the body. The eyes become dull, the face white, and a feeling of intense weariness pervades the whole system. There is nothing so effective in Anaemia as ' Wincarnis.' Because ' Wincarnis' floods the body With new, rich, red blood, which gives a sparkle to the eyes, brings the roses into the cheeks, and gives new vigour, new vitality and new life to the whole body.
