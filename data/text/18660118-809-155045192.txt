Carrick, Androw Lyoll, Alexander Miller, Henry Jennings, W. H. Dickson, David Wood, and other gentlemen signing tho requisi tion. Gentlomen, — Your kind invitation is with pleasuro accepted by.me, as I am nssured that you will fulfil tho promises therein contained ; and all tho re luctanco which I may have folt to accept so onerous a position as a candidate for your suffrages, has been entirely removed by the warm expression of your esteem and confidence. I feel that at tho present important juncturo of political affairs a determined stand should bo mado hy thoso amongst 11s who do not hail tho reign of Protectionas the Millennium, nor accept tho actions of the prcsont Ministry in thoir onslaught on tho judges, their defianco of tho juries, and thoir deter mination to govornthe country by their own dospotio will, aa the summum bonum of earthly happiness. I therefore place myself at your disposal as tho ex ponent of principlog dianiotrically opposed to tho thoroughly unconstitutional conduct pursued by Ministers in tho lato session of Parliament. To attempt to givo oven an outi'no of the various circumstances which led to tho dead lock, the crisis and tho dissolution of Parliament, would far exceed tho time and .space I intend to occupy in my reply to your requisition. They havo beon discussed by every newspaper writer in tho country (aud out of it too for that matter oro this) ; thoy havo been argued by cveiy candidato for Legislative honors who has addressed a constituency ; and to attempt to oxtract anything new out of them would, on my part, bo simply presumption. It is, according to Ministers themselves, almost im possible to defino tlio issues at present boforo tho country. Is tho Ministry for free trado or protec tion ? is an old question. What is the tariff? is another ; and so on ad infinitum, until thoy aro nar rowed down to this :— Shall wo support a Ministry which despises trial by jury, which would make tho judges officers of a department, and govern tho country by its own arrogant decrees? Or shall wo support men who will with all thoir might oppose such illegal proceedings ? So far as this district is Concerned, tbo matter is in your hands. Should you do n.o tho honor to return me as your representative, I shall, while having the abovo object in view, strive always to merit the good opinion you havo expressed towards me. In all matters connected with the goneral welfare of the colony, I shall endeavsr to act so as to ad vance its material prosperity. 1 am in favor of a reform of tho Uppor House. I would reduce tho qualification both of electors and eloctod, increase the number of membors, and shorten the term during which they sit. Upon othor topics affecting tho publio intorests of the colony, and the local intorosts of tliis constituoncy, I shall take an early opportunity of making known my viows. I am, Gentlemen, Y our obediont servant, JOHN WHITEMAN. 64 Park-street, Emorald-hill, 8th January, 1866. 48 011 mO the ELECTORS of RODNEY'. Gentlemen, — I sincerely thank you for so marked a renewal of your confidence in now, tor tho third timo, returning mo as your representativp, and 7/hen I havo been mj'solf wholly unable to give my per sonal assistance to those who have so strenuously lumust also express my deep obligation to the Hon.

Election Notices. rpo the ELECTORS of EAST MELBOURNE. Gentlemen, — Having beon solicited by a large scction of tho electors of East Melbourne to offer myself as a candidato for its representation in Par liament, nnd feeling, as I do, that the present im portant political situation of the country affords me an opportunity of giving effect toBconvictions which I havo held for many years on tha subject of en couraging local industries and manufactures, I readily place my Fcrvicos at tlio disposal of the electors of tho district. Fourteen years' experience as a manufacturer in Melbourne has produced nn my mind tho conviction that only with such a tariff as will afford encourage ment to local manufactures can tho mechanical skill of our operative classes be developed, provision n.ade for tho proper training and future employment of our youth, native industries established, and tho material intorests of tho colony permanently se cured. I shall, therefore, earnestly support the fiscal changes contemplated by the present Adminis tration. The conduct of tho Ministry in the dcfence of tbe privileges of tho Assembly against tho encroach ments of tho Council has my warmest approval ; and I would, if elected, offer them my strenuous advocacy and support in their determination to preservo to the people, through their representa tives, the time-honored right to control the taxa tion of tho country, which is in fact tho only true safeguard of the rights and liberties of tho people. Without a thorough reform of tho Upper Houso, I feel convinced there can never bo that accord and good feoling between tho two Chambers of Legislature, which it is necossary should exist, in order to sccuro practical and pro gressive legislation and a full representation of all interests of tho community in both chambers. I shall therefore support the proposition for reducing tlie present extravagant qualification for both mem bers and electors, and also tho giving tho Governor power to dissolve the Council when any bill shall have twice passed the Assembly and boon twice rejected by the Upper House. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obediont servant, ? WILLIAM WILLIAMS. Furniture, Fittings, &c.; TTWRNITURE, Bodding, Venetian and Wire Blinds I Offico Fittings, &c.; W.
