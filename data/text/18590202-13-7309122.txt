George Robertson's Address to the Public. Ladies and Gentlemen, Before I commenced bush fire here, now more than five years ago, the price of books was fixed by standard, and you had generally to pay double or treble the English price for any you required. Considering such charges not only unreasonable but injurious to trade I adopted a scale of moderate prices which gave great satisfaction at the time, and has continued in operation ever since. You have expressed your approval In a way at once practical and nnmiatar'eanle, and. for my part, I have no reason to complain of the result. During these five years, however, many changes have taken place Id Victoria and amongst them is this-that by immigration and education The number of readers has been greatly increased. while at the same time the average means possessed by each reader fnrthepurchasoof banks has decreased. Ohaorvlnir this state of things, I feel assured that the time has come when a further reduction in the price of books will be as acceptable to you, and at beneficial to trade an was the change I made in 1853. Acting on this conviction, It gives me much pleasure to announce that on and after the 1st day of February, 1850, I shall sell EVERY BOOK At ENGLISH PUBLISHED PRICE (for cash) and trust that with such an inducement you may so far enlarge your purchases as to compensate for the great reduction now made. This reduction does not apply to newspapers or periodicals.
