The Hon- B- B. Moreton's address to the German Electors. On Tuesday evening the Hon. B. B. Moretoa addressed the German and Danish electors of £; Maryborough, in the Town TT«11 There was a m very good attendance, and the proceedings were ^Jf commenced at 7 '50. Smk Mr. Moeeton, after stating that owing to having been down at Dundathu,.he had been unable to keen his aDnointmsnt. with t-.Vio m exactly at 7*30, and having apologised for the delay, proposed that Mr. M. Boge take the chair. In introducing Mr. Moreton to his audience, Mr. Boge stated that it was only because he had been asked to do so by Mr. Moreton, that he had taken the chair, and he wished it to be distinctly understood that by doiug so he did not pledge himself in any way. He was an independent voter, and he intended to remain so. Mr. Moeeton then handed over his address to Mr. Reinhardt, who read it to the audience. The fo lowing is a translation : — ; '?To the German and Scandinavian Electors of Maryborough. 'Gentlemen, — I am aware that there are many amongst you who are not thoroaghly acquainted with the English language, and are, therefore, of a necessity, dependent for in formation relating — to the present election — to the merits and demerits of the (Efferent can didates, on the knowledge obtainable from others Knowing, also, that you are told much, that is barely correct concerning the; motives and origin of my candidature, and that' my supposed disabilities are placed before yott in the most adverse light, I have deemed it advisable to thus address you. First, th-»nJ as to my candidature. It came to pass thus : ? When the new Electoral Bill, which gave a second member to Maryborough, was passing through the Assembly last, session. I was asked if I would become a candidate.' I replied I would. As to my motive, none other than being an old resident in these districts, and knowing them well, I believe I can help in their developement and progress. Secondlyr as to what are termed by others my disabili ties ; one of them is that I am a squatter. I don't know that my being such makes me a worse colonist, or less likely to represent yonr wishes or yonr opinions, than those who manu facture from a lolly pop to an iron barge, or those who retail from a needle to an anchor, or those who gain their living by sawing timber or making railways. But-,, because I am a squatter, there are some who are trying to V make you believe that therefore I am con' nec-ted in some funny way with a certain Mr. Morehead, who made some remarks against German immigrants. But I am sure your own common sense will fail to find any connecting' link between Mr. Morehead and my candidature1 — I don't follow men of that stamp. Another supposed disability has been urged against me,, and that is, that when formerly member for Maryborough I resigned somewhat abruptly, and it is insinuated from insufficient cause, and a silly motive. I can only say that such a statement is more than incorrect. The neces sity of my resignation arose from other reasons than those given — reasons that would have . ^ caused anyone of you, if placed in ,a similar position, to have acted in the same manner. Now, as to my opinions ou the political questions of the day. First of all, we must have a very careful consideration of our present financial position. Our expenditure is out- J runnings our receipts ; there is a certainty of a fj deficiency at the end of the year, and that, perhaps, a large one. To meet this deficiemgr ' we shall have to increase our taxation and enr tail our expenditure. I believe that increase should be gained by direct taxation, so as to make property pay its fair share. We shall, have to reduce our expenditure, and be. as economical as we can without actually stopping our public works. Our debt, at the present - time amounts to £10,200,000, and to finish the railways already authorised will raise it to - - £11,500,000. I maintain that our territorial revenue should all go to building railways by either paying principal or interest, and that it . should not go to the consolidated revenue for ? common expenditure. Whenever the colony is prepared to undertake any further railway ^ extensions it shall, if I am elected, be my earnest endeavor to obtain for our district a deviation from the present Maryborough and - Gympie line to the west, via Miva and Kil kivan, and I shall, with all my power, resist the scheme proposed by the Government, which would cut off all our back country traffic from us. In any alteration of the tariff I would try and reduce the amount on those articles which are of a necessity : more used by the poorer classes. Our immigration system wants revising; at the present time it is being some what overdone, and should he partially stopped. The present condition of the colony, owing to'. . the two late droughty yearSj may have 4 somer ? thing to do with our inability tb absorb st- many immigrants. I think our energies 'should, be spent more on inducing people to come here who have the means an 1 the willingness to . settle on the lands. All foreign immigration; should, I conceive, come direct from their own homes, not filtered through another source. The Licensing Publican's Act requires altering. I consider- that the municipalities and shires under the new Act should have the whole con trol over the public houses within their area ; by that means the people themselves; through ' their aldermen and councillors, would have a ' ' :' distinct voice in the matter. Registration 'of title deeds should be inade less costly jihd much more simple than at present. I think that can be effected by having local registra tion ; time and expense would be materially saved thereby, and in such an office there should be one of yourselves, who could under %tind whatis «'anted by ahy of yon on Apply-; ingfor^«gist^^^gt%^^e, deeds. 1 believe our CS.vil Bet^^^^^^e«Teduccd, and any . ; fatnre promo^ons Seniority and merit, apd that all ^»^p^irttmehts should be com ^^t^^^fHew»JhGar^ s Apppintmentsto the vwnm«£bn (if Ithe PeauSe should be 'by recom te.enda%)n from the judges of the Supreme & ^?nin%ter ioJhrow \ *TOllieti6ff MnesW guOTdohs for services i?ec^ved-^}iereafc-; ln conclnBion, f must once, more reler'to myself, however much I may dis-. ft?i£:J#ssarted.
