She has lost jib-boom, bulwarks, stanchcons, &c;,, on both eides deck planks and waterways opened up, ahd outside planking started, some of the treenails being out from the side on inch.

Early on the 7th. the boats, galley, &c.;, were washed overboard, and the decks completely swept. The gale stiM increasing in violence, Captain Brown cut the laoyards of the foretopmant rigging, and the mast and yards went over the side, which somewhat eased the ship. During the whole of that day the sea, which was fearfully high, was rolling com pletely over her, all hands anticipating that she would settle bodily down. At night, tbc Sydney light was seen bearing W.ls.NV., distant sixteen miles ; and at 4 a.m. the following morn ing the main staysail was set but almost immediately blown away ; and to add to the disasters, the pump spear was broken* For tunately, however, the gale began to take off, or the vessel wouid not have lived in her leaky state. The treenails have started oat in several places, and the greater portion of the bulwarks and etancheons are gone.

The South Australian liegiitcr or the 25th ultimo says:— We believe that the White 6wan is now to be subsidised by the New Zealand Government for the coast service between Otago and Auckland, via Taranaki, Thus South Australia is now dependent again only on the Havilah for steam communication . with Mel bourne. With the trading advantages which such a speculation would seem to oflcr, it is singular that no enterprising firm in the other colonies should think of placing a good steamer on the lina between Adelaide and Melbourne.

After leaving l^ondoa, tbe prevalence of westerly gales retarded her progress down channel, and, the weather continuing unfavourable, it was the 3rd January before crossing the Line. She arrived at Swan River on the 24th February, and landed Governor Hampton, who met with a most enthuaiastic reception. On March' 9th, the Strath ailan sailed for Port Adelaide, and during the first seven days experienced strong south-easterly winds. On tbe following day signalled the ship Themis, of Liverpool, steering N;W. ;. and on March 22nd, the ship Mystery, from Canterbury, New Zealand, bound to Akyab, twenty days out During the progress down channel of the Strathailan oac of the seaman was drowned, on the 25th of Novcmbor, It appears that when the vessel was off the Isle of Wight, one of the apprentices, named Septimus Pan court, fell overboard from the poop, and the darkness of the night rendered it impossible to rescue him, he was lost. — South Auslra ton Register t March 2G, A Bov SrowhD Awat i.v a Ship fob Srvbn daw without Food,— The Rock Ferry steamer Nymph, which left the landing stage, Liverpool, on Friday, November 22nd, at eleven o'clock, called alongside the ship Blue Rock, lying in the river off the Rock Ferry Pier, and bound for Sydney, to put on board a passenger. 'When alongside a boy was sent on board the Nymph, and tbe captain told to take ihiui oa shore. The steamer, being on her way to Rock Ferry, of course first took him there and then to LivcriK-oL He was almost naked, and little else than skin and bone, and made the following statement to the passengers and crew of the Nymph He is a native of London. His father and mother are in Melbourne, and he wishod to get out lo them. Finding that the Blue Rock was bound for Aus tralia, be stowed himself away on board of her (when she was lying in the dock) on the 15th instant, expecting she would very shortly go to sea. She, however, went into the river, and still remains there ; and he, being fairly ' hungered out,' was obliged to come out of his hiding- place on Friday, lie said tne people on board the 6bip gave him some coffee and biscuit, but it would not remain on his stomach. Several gentle men on board the Nymph, on hearing his tale, gave him money, and, on being asked what be intended doing, he said he did not know, but very likely ' wouid be in prison before night' When asked what he intended doing on getting to Sydney. Melbourne being a long way from it he replied that he knew that, but be in tended walking irom Sydney to Melbourne. He said that when he went on board the ship on the previous Friday he had not any thing to cat or drink with him ; he had consequently been seven days without food or drink. The lad's story was corroborated by his appcaiance, for he looked more like a skeleton than anything elsj. He also stated that another boy was stowed away in the Eaxno ship, but that he did not like to tell the captain, as bo (the boy) appeared as if he could hold out a little longer. This boy appeared lo be about fourteen or fifteen years of a ge.— British Standard. Weeck of tbk American Barque Waverlkv,— ' The Mina haha, of Glasgow, anchored in Table Bay on Tuesday afternoon, February 4th, and brought in a shipwrecked crew taken off from the wreck of the American barque Wavcrley, Captain W, C. Henderson, of the Minabaha, thus describes the perilous position in which be found the poor fellows : On Thursday, January 9th, 1862, 19 degrtcB 31 minutes 6., longitude 78 degrees 10 minutes E,, tbe wind S.S.E., fresh breeze, with a heavy sea, ship going eight knots pa- hour, at half-past ten p.m. saw a vessel dose on the starboard bow, dismasted, waterlogged, and the 6ea breaking heavily over her. Hearing the cries of the cicw, immediately called ail hands on deck, lowered the light sails down, hauled the courses up, took studding-sails in, and brought the ship to the wind on the Etarboard tack, with the maintopsail to the mast Seven of the crew of the wrecked vessel succeeded, after great exertions, in reaching the Minabaha in a very frail boat, which was well filled with water when it came alongside. We let the boat go, as it was of no use. being badly broken. Tne master and five men still remaining on tne wreck, I immediately got tbc pinnace out, and sent the chief officer and four men to take the remainder of the men off the wreck, which they succeeded in. doing, and brought them safely on board. At midnight made aU sail, and proceeded on our course. During the time we remained, hove-to close to the vessel. 1 saw the sea breaking heavily over her, excepting a small portion of the deck of the after-house, where the crew were on the top, the main deck being constantly under water, the vessel being very much by the head, with a heavy list to port, and to appearance as if iu the act of going down, head first, with every tea that broke over her. On Mr. Bcvcn (my chief officer) going near her, he found the vessel in a fearful state— the jlbboom gouc— the foremast gone a little above the truss-hoop, with the forerigging and everything, above gone— the mainmast head wrenched off closc to the rigging, and all spars and rigging above that gone— the mizenmast carried away close to the spidcr-band, the rigging with everything abore gone, and the stern stove in. 1 am happy to say that wc saved the lives of the master and twelve seamen. One of the seamen was brought on board with Us skull severely fractured, and his body sadly bruised all over, from the effects of which he died on January 24, after lingering in pain for five days. The master of tbc vessel informed me that on Monday night the 7th January, the chief officer and one seaman were washed over board, as they were missed the following merning at daylight. They bad been lashed in the rigging for twenty-four houro, and were without bread and water for seventy-four hours. Tacy had a small pontpkin, whieh was equally divided among them. tVhen 1 .received them on board they 'had saved nothing but what clothes they had on, the master having kindly shared what clothes he bad with the crew while on the wreck. Tbe vessel was the American barque Waverley, of Kcnocbank, U.6., Stephen Thomson, master, from Moulmcin to Falmouth or Cork, for I orders, with a full cargo of teak timber, fifty-five days out The ' above crew have been on board the Minahaha for twenty-six days when 1 put into Table Bay to land them.'— Cape Argus, February 6.
