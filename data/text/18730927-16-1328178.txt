TASE, Commander. She is laid on tho berth to plj botween Sydney, Brisbane, and Maryborough, mulling the round voyage ovuy IO or 12 days, and book- ] trig gooda and pnesongors right through, lo and ( from Melbourno, in connection with tho Mel- bourne Steam Companj. The KEMBLA is a i cssel of immense strength of build, while her ongines aro of such power ( that they ure never put to their extreme point ( of propulsion, unless compelled by heavy hoad weather. The advantage of having this power I ( at command was fully manifested in her last trip [ ( to Sydney, against a heavv soutborly gale ; on ( which occasion she made the trip from wharf to ( wharf m 48 HOUBS, wbilo it took the City of ( Brisbane 66 HOTOS, and the Leichhardt (öloso ( behind them at Cape Moreton) no less than 87 j HOT/BS ¡ t,nd these are looked on as the Oom- j pany's best boats. j Such a passage m such woathor ii the j strongest possiblo proof of the KEMBLA'S immensely superior sea going qualities, as well as speed. On her voyago bael, IU fine vtoathor (arriving here yesterday) sho again beat tho City of Brie- j bane 15 HOURS IN 46 nouns' RUN PBOM SYDNEY ( All passengors epeai. iu tho highest terms of ç her easy motion in all weather1', many who havo j suffered severely m other boats, making the j passage m tho KEMBLA « ithout inconvenience, j Inclosed state-rooms amidships, and other j passenger accommodation. BUT AS SHE IS TRI, BEST, SHE IS AMO THE M03T BXPKNSINE BOAT ON THE 1A.SB, AND TO BE CONTIMTED SHE MOST BE IIBEBALHT stn? T0BTKD. Thero is no sacrifico a«lced from the public in soliciting for her their deoided preference. It is their obvious interest to discourage the pro- j sont or any other monopoly. Perhaps some of j tho opposition boats hitherto eompotmg have j hardly boon equal to the old Company's. But j thiB one, at any late, is in all rospects their su porior. She is simply tho best boat for tho trade that money eaa procure m all Australia Bho phos regulaily and at short intervals, and she has reduced passenger fares to the moderate icalo oharged for similar voyages m the sou- thern colonies. It IB earnestly hoped, theroforc, as no effort will bo spared to dnvo her off, that the KEM- BLA will obtain suth instant and liberal sup- port as will maintain her permanently on the une. D. LITTLE.
