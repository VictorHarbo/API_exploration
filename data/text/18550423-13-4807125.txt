The captain read the ship's log, detailing the refractory conduct of the seaman when the vessel waa making to this port, by which it appeared he had done no duty on board for thirty eight days. The defendant alleged, as in excuse for his conduct, that when he was ordered to do certain duty on board the fair Charles Napier, on the 12th of March, the captain was intoxicated, and did not know what he was doing, as he would have carried the foremast over the vessel by doing as ordered. The seaman was ordered to join his vessel, and come before the Bench this morning to prove his statement by witness. —Geelong Advertiser, April 21. The Gambia brings 210 Government immigrant a Capt.
