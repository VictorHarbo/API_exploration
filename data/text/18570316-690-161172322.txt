The Coquette, from Wide Bay, gives no further report respect ins the Jenny Lind. Captain M'Lean states that when about 10 miles from the township he sighted the two boats considerably to windward ; that he immediately tacked and stood towards them, but they appeared not at all anxious to speak him ; and that when one of them came alongside with either the first or secon-1 officer in her, the men merely asked for a drink of water, and pertina ciously avoided any direct answers when questioned respecting the loss of the vessel. The cargo of the Coquette consists of 36 bales wool, 2 casks tallow, 1837 homs, and sundries. TnE Coii.a.— A shameful piece of negligence has been brought under our notice on the part of the master of this vessel, lately wrecked near Port Albert. She sailed hence with a full cargo and several passengers, yet strange to say left his longboat on the wharf, where she now lays, thus running a needless risk of jeopardising the lives of his crew and passengers, and showing the necessity of vessels being inspected immediately before their departure, so that in the event of the necessary regulations in thie respect not being properly complied -with, they may be detained. The Emily Jane, Captain Beer, has, as usual, made a good run from Melbourne, and completed the voyage in twenty days, in cluding her discharging and re-loading in Melbourne. She is i advertised to take the place of the steamer William Denny, which i vessel will be laid up for a month on her arrival from Auckland, | for the purpose of cleaning, &c.; The high terms in -which Captain Beer is continually beiug spoken of by the large number of pas sengers who have always sailed by the Emily Jane on her Mel bonrne tiips will be a sufficient guarantee thai during the terapo 'rary withdrawal of the steamer there will be no lack of comfort on board this smart craft. The Sporting Lass reports the arrival of the William Denny (s.) at Auckland, she has to leave again on the 2nd instant. The Vis count Sandou from Louden, and Euphemia from Liverpool, had also arrived. On the passage across of the Sporting Lass to this port, one of the steerage passengers named W. Hall, who when he oameon board was suffering from delirium tremens, suddenly sprang overboard on the 5th instant, and was drowned almost immediately. The boat was launched over the side, the vessel rounded to, and the life-buoy cast adrift within five minutes, but, he sank at once, lie had on a pair of very heavy boots which would assist in taking him down. The Beejnpore has made a fair passage of 89 days from the Isle of Wight. She originally left Southampton on the 2nd December, but was detained a considerable time in the Channel. She brings 469 immigrants, classified as follows :S6 married couples, 107 single men, 81 single women, and 113 children. There have been seven deaths and three births on the passage, but her passengers look remarkably well, and the ship is a credit to her officers for the cleanly state in which she has arrived. Captain Drenning reports the Flash, brig, from Adelaide 6th July, to Talcahuana, and from thence to London, as having been spoken on 17th January, -with loss of bulwarks, and would put in to Pernambuco. The Mountain Maid sailed from Nelson for Wellington on the 19th ultimo. The Waterwitch has been absent eighteen months, and has taken 600 barrels. She has only spoken the Jane of this port, iritu 50 barrels sperm, and 200 barrels humpback oil. The cargo of the Boomerang consists of 27 bales wool, 14 bundles skins, 106 bide,=, 18 bags flour, 13 cases pineapples, and sundries. Captain O'lleilly has again made an excellent passage of 49 hours from wharf to wharf, and has favoured us with the following report :- March 2, Parsee sailed for the Chincha Islands ; 5tb, Albion and Ebenezer sailed for the Richmond ; 8th, Don Juan arrived at the Bar, and Brisbane (s.), arrived off More ton Island. The Gazehound was loading for London. There was no further intelligence respecting the Jenny Lind. The Live Yankee has been 57 days from San Francisco ; has not touched at ary intermediate port, and reports, the Salween, ship, of 550 tons, on the berth, for this port and Melbourne, would sail about the 20th January. The Swiss Boy, from Huraboldt for Sydney, was also in port ; on the 9th instant passed the Osprey, hence for the South Sea Islands. ' ? The Swiss Boy is bound to Sydney with timber. After leaving Humboldt, she encountered heavy S.W. gales; sprungaleak. split eail=, &c.; ; put into this port to repair damages; left at Hum boldt ship Lucas, loading for Australia.— San Franckeo Herald, January J2. The Gipsy brings up 75 bales wool, and sundries. The Ariel arrived in the Bay, as the Gipsv left, Lnss of the Favourite. — Intelligence has been received in town of the loss of this vessel ; she was commanded by her owner and builder, Captain Scott, and left here for the Tweed River, taking the bar at that place in company with the Liberty. She went on shore, and became a total wreck. Unfortunately she is not insured, The Acacia, on her passage from Manila, whence she sailed 8th January, has had very variable winds the greater part of the passage. She passed Angler on 18th January. The Prima Donna was loading for Melbourne, and would leave in a few days. The Prince of Denmark reports tbe arrival at Hobart Town on 5th instant, of the Polly and H argraves, both from Newcastle. Extracts from the Melbourne papers : The American clipper ship Samuel Appleton, has made a first rate passage of 85 days from Boston. She ia a splendid vesse', and has very superior accommodation for passengers. We are indebted to Captain Doane for a file of Boston papers to the IStu of December. The Ocean Eagle is the next vessel on the berth at Boston for this port, and would leave about the latter end of December.

Slip rpnnrts having maimed tbe loneitude of the Cane of (land Hope on December 30th, and that of Cape Leuwin after being 116 days at sea, from which point continued strong easterly winds have prevailed. March 2nd, to the S.W. of Kangaroo Island, they were signalled by the schooner New Perseverance, from Swan River, bound to Adelaide, in distress. The Ascendant bore down, and the Perseverance reported having both her masts sprung, with other damage. She was out of provisions, and was making water with such rapidity that it required the entire exertions of not only the crew but the passengers, forty-one in number, to keep her afloat. She had a cargo of rum and oil, and was con signed to Mr. Samson, of this port. The following is a copy of the letter sent by tbe New Perseverance to the captain of the Ascen | dant, the request contained in which was immediately complied with. The Ascendant reports having entered this gulf on Saturday last, the 27th ult., by Backstairs Passage :?— ' New Perseverance, j March 2nd, 1857.
