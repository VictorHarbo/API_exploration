F. T. Sime the vice-preeident of the Parliamentary Labor Party (Hon. A. W. Stylee, 5LL.C.) was introduced to an enthusiastic audience. He delivered an interesting address on the gerrymandering Bill now before the Leprielative Council. The" 6peaker. placed before his hearers the plain facts, and asked them to decide for themselves their duty. It wafi evident from the interjections that the electors in this portion of the Mar\x=req-\ ray electorate were ready when the call came to vote, and use their influence in the cause of justice: From compari\x=req-\ tive figures given it was very easily seen that the Labor Party \vas justified in dubbing the amending Constitution a "gerrymandering Bill," and Mr. Styles did not forget to allude to ihe fact that the Jtinifiter who introduced the Bill into the Assembly had taken care thai although he was prepared to cut up other districts he was careful to leave his own electorate untouched. Mr. Appledore. in moving a vote of thanks nj Uie speaker, spoke in kindly terms of the excellent service rendered to the cause by Labor members, and impres^d upon all of tLe friends °- Lal>or to rally aruimd the standard and do their duty to the cause. M r. Styles, in reply, took the opportunity to I thank those who had assisted with him\x=req-\ iSelf in providing the evening's entertainment, The musical and other items were supplied by the Misees Noble am!
