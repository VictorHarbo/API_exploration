TO the ELECTORS of the CENTRAL PRO- VINCE. Gentlemen, It was not my intention to take part in public life so soon after my return from England ; but from the repeated solicitations which I have received from so many of my friends, of all shades of politics I feel it my duty to offer myself as a candidate for the seat in the Legislative Council rendered vacant by the death of the late Hon. John Hodgson. As I have hitherto not taken an active part in public affairs, it is incumbent on me, in seeking your suffrages, to express my opinions on the chief political topics of the day. It is now generally admitted that the Land question can only be settled by mutual compromises; and as I am most anxious to see this long-agitated subject dis- posed of, in order that many measures of practical importance to the country may receive a due share of attention, I am prepared to advocate its adjustment upon liberal and equitable principles. A constant influx of population is essential to the development of the industrial resources of the colony and, as our gold fields fail now to attract a sufficient stream of immigration, I should be glad to see such appropriations of the revenue from time to time as would secure this most desirable object. My views on the question of the " Abolition of State aid to religion" are that, whilst to the towns and great centres of population the grant for religious purposes might now be disposed with, it might still be continued with advantage to the thinly-populated districts of the interior. In the event, however, of a hill for the abolition of State aid again passing the Lower House, I should offer no opposition to it. With respect to education, I advocate one general scheme, in lieu of the costly and comparatively ineffi- cient systems which are now in practice. I am prepared to support any measures calculated to conserve and promote the great producing and commercial interests of the colony. Our altered circumstances render a revision of the tariff necessary, I shall, therefore, if elected, give the subject my best consideration on its being brought under the notice of Parliament. The increase of our public debt and the stagnant state if our revenue necessitate thr greatest vigilance in reference to our public expenditure, and I would therefore give my support to any Ministry exhibiting an earnest desire to practice a wise economy in all branches of the public service. In conclusion, I may mention, for the information of those electors to whom I am unknown, that I have been a colonist for 10 years, and that my interests are materially dependent upon the prosperity of the colony. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, J. P. BEAR. August 16, 1860. The undersigned agree to form themselves into committee to insure the election of J. P.
