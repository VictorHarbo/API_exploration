There was no intelligence of the Maroo Polo, Georgo Marshall, or Morning Star. The American ship Boston Light had not orrivoi in. tho Bay up to twolvo o'clock lost evening. IMMIGRATION*.-WO find tho following Important notice of tho revival of emigration from the United Kingdom to tho Australian colonies, in tho Ooerlani Mail of the 10th Juno :-"Since the poaco, and with tho opening of tho season, the Emigration-offtco of tho Government has boen very busily engaged in tho despatch of emigrants, and the following ves- sels havo lately sailed for one or other of the Australian colonies :-tho Horald, from Liverpool, .with 300 omigrants; the Hooghly, 218: the Bermondsey, 192;>tho Omega, 270; thcAllquls, S84 ; the Lloyds, 372 ; and the Shanghai, 80\. Nearly all those belong to London ownors, and took theil* passcngors on board at Southampton or Plymouth. With the honovolent intention, of adopt ing over}* precaution for tho Hvos of tho hundred" "?whose lot H thus, for the time, cast upon tho wa- ters," the Commissioners have lind two boats ol each of those ships fitted with Clifford's now plan for instantly lowering and dotachine; them from the ship, In tho event of emergency.

Tho ratos of freight ex- hibit a tendency to improvement.-Time», 10th Juuo. It haï soldom fallon within our province, ai chroniclers of matters appertaining to shipping, to speak in such warm terms of coinniondatlon of any commander of a merchant vessel as wo aro now calle I upon to hpeak of Contain Byrne, oftho barque Marlon. Hollas shown by lils many froquont and rapid pas- sages to this port, that ho stands in tho front rank oi what are termed "smart" commanders, and tho pub- lic will agi'co willi us that ho deserves tho thanks ol theso colonies for tho intelligence ho has displayed on this occasion, moro particularly, in seeming olaborato liles of English news down to so lato a date as tho 10th Juno. It is quite unnecessary hero to allude to tho line of conduct Captain Byrne lias thought right to pursue in holding back this news for a few days from tho public, for ovory ono must fool the disgust lie sulicrcd in being placed lu quarantine, having, as ho had, nows of a nature tho most into resting. We should not omit to record that through tho courtesy of Captain Bymo theso colonies wore enabled to forward by his vessel, when sho last lett 11 Is port, duplicates or letters and papors sent horns by tho Marco Polo two days boforo the Marion loft foi Point de Galle, and wo should not neglect to montlon also that Captain Byrne, hy his rapid run to the latter port, placed Victorian nows in tho liands of out readers nt home some days boforo tho Maroo Pola airivod in Liverpool. Tho passago of the Marlon from Colombo to Mauritius, and from Mau ritlus to this port, is uuprecodented. The um from India to Port Louis was made in twelve days and twenty hours, and from tlioneo to Port Phillip in twenty-fivo days, being tho most rapid pis cages wo havo ever boon called upon to record, and the inhabitants of tho Mauritius wore enabled, througl! tho perseverance of Captain Byrne, to road Engllsli news only forty-one days old, being, wo behove, on< day earlier than was ovor before convoyed to that island HosiKWAnD BOUND.-Tho clipper ship Lightning Captain Enright, will Bail from this port this oven ing, or early to-morrow morning, with tho mails foi England.
