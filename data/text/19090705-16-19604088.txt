TtVING MADE "EASY. There is a tendency in many depart- ments of life towards gi eater simplicity. Til« aim of the most enlightened civilisation is really to make life less complex, less strenucue, and less unsatisfactory. Beecham's Pills are thoroughly modern in this respect, for their umuiling effect i«. to cure those disordeis of the Stomach, Liver, and Bowels, which so gieatly in- crease the nieo-sure of our troubles and difficulties. Existence, which under the evil spell of ill-health may appear hard and gloomy, will become bright and pleasant BY TAKING Beecham's Pills. However much human ingenuity may do to make life less of a straggle the man who is suffering' from any derangement of the digestive organs will ulways find living a heavier bu.thn than he would otherwise do. To him life will always he ' more of a painful duty than a delight. It is, indeed, a mystery why he should continue to allow dyspepsia, biliousness, disordered liver, sluggish kidneys, and the accompanying loss of nerve-power to overshadow hi» happiness, when a certain remedy for all his tioubles ii to bo found in BEECHAM'S PILLS.
