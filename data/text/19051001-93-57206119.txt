What .do the Labor; Party-or, rather rabble, fdr they have apparently ceased to be a-party -rpropose ? It is "^guifieant of the de-' gradation to which" State politics have sunt' that upon the' most urgent pro- blem with which tí» country -pi faced the three.- alleged parties, despite all the blare and mimic jthunder of their struggles for tie spoils, are mute. Tibe* /fact that a^t least four thousand of theigtate'-s able-bodied.'íutá¿w?|(Ít.'--':»: safe in this connection to multiply the Labor Bureau returns "by two), one thiriieth^of the Aggregate.: bread-win- ners; one-sixtieth of the .total popula-' tion, aré out of work, is of no con- sequence to ihem. '.Jit is a thing that may airily be . ignored. Yet of all the scorching indictments that might. be preferred against them' for brazen use- lessness and extravagance and inca- pacity there, coijld be nothing -more burning, more completé than this-the simple and terrible fact that there ar« four thousand out of work ! It is at once"'the stultification of present and past potiticisns:, The State, which is returning £2,000,000' a year :to fo- reign investors, whichv is producing in proportion to population "the highest revenue «ii earth-which is even now preparing to -add largely to its popu- lation ' by immigration, has three per cent, of its breadwinners unemployed^ We are tempted to labor the . fact to the point bf weariness. It is only by insisting on it, in season and out oí season, only By presenting it in. all its shades, and all its ' relations, only by iterating that every willing worker unable tb get work is a living reflec- tion upon those who are permitted to govern .the country, one may. hope io ' pierce the thick hide of-ignorance and levity.that encloses the'political body and sting it to a sense of shame. Th« position of the average Westralian politician in regard to the unemploy- ed is the cowardly position taken up by Daglish. That elongated streak of snuffle and insincerity lubricated his easily-satisfied soul with the reflection that the unemployed problem was caused here, as elsewhere in Australia, by an undue crowding into the capi- tal, and spoke as i&ihat; ended the mat- ter. Even as an explanation of causes -a brutally callous explanation-it isn't true. There are more unemploy- ed beyond the metropolitan district than there are within it, there is mora genuine suffering from worklessness.on the remote and thirsty stretches of the outback than there is adjacent to the comfortable, city, where at least Government rations are available if a man is reduced to 'want. But sup-' posing Daglish's theory were true what then? -its wouldn't relieve the Go- vernment of responsibility. The duty of the State to provide work for its work less toilers is emphatic. It is recognised bp a "Conservative Government in ' no less a country than Conservative Eng- land. It is even .'admitted ia this country as regards foreign immigrants -witness the advertisement of the Di- rector of Agriculture requesting work for Walter James's Danish farm-labor ers-though it does not apply, except j to an infioitesiiaal estent, io the men j wno have made the country prosper- j o us, ? who have transformed the re- j venue- frons -tine oí the smallest to thc ; blendest on earth. The time has come,, however, when the State must accept ; its sacred duty ot finding.work for its workless. li is the burden it has to bear- for i i s ghastly failure to redress the g-3îir;ne iur?qualrties of society. It' is a hnmaimarian necessity, a social necessity. The legitimate aspirations of the honest unemployed Who has been finn? on the rooks by the waves ?of a .remorseless industrialism must- be gratified, tho cry of the hungry chil- dren must be answered, the legion of the Wiliiag-to-Work must be rescued from the wastes of Want which ¿are en- compassed bv Crime. PJ«ce-liuuting Premiers may trim, and say "Thn time is not ripe.'1 or ''The matter is under .consideration," or "lt is not thei province of the State," but- fer every industrial derelict whom neces «tyí Si time of ;i%iü^;,h^.;drii^..^ : crime, for every ruined-«oui vhoin famine and .despair have scourged over the Great Divide, there is a black mark against their names in the Re-j cording Angel's script. - We have dealt ' mainly "with the moral side of the problem. But -consider the sordid, fi- nancial, aspect of if. Could the fr tate1 want à better investment than spend- ing'money tó provide wiUing non-pro- ducers with good, productive work ? Suppose the Stats ;iook 1000 nfea from the ranks of the unemployed ard spent; £200,000 OT £300,000 in ¿-.¿kin« pro.dueers~of\them, what, would he the ; result? W*U, the men would supply to the State Treasury che<t an annual revenue of £14 a head. They would «am an equal per capita revenue for, pay. -three thousand dependents. They would provide employment 'if or hun- ; dredi of the larger .section of society which caters for Wie needs * he pro- ducers, «nd would, put, hundreds ox thousands to the. capital wealth of the .State.
