OUR IDLE LANDS. A BOLD POLICY NEEDED. PAMPHLET BY THE IMMIGRATION LEAGUE. . "The Peril of -Melbourne" is the title of a pamphlet to be issued -towards, the end of the week by the Victorian Land Settle ment Division of the Immigration League of Australia. Tbe object of the pamphlet, which lias been prepared by the bon. secre- tary for Victoria,- Mr. Marshall Lyle, is to arouse tbe interest of all sections of the community to the urgent necessity for an enlightened and thoroughly up to date land policy, which will not only secure land for our own people without the exasperating delays which are so fatal to settlement, but will provide, for the, absorption of- tens of thousands of new producers,, for" whom there is. ample room. Three very significant statements are made at the beginning of the pamphlet, which are worthy of special consideration. It is pointed out that there are 5(5,245,760 acres of land in Victoria; and that while 34,518,526 acres appear in the departmental records as "occupied," only 4,209,877 acres are under cultivation. The second statement is that from 1891 to 31st December, 1906, Victoria lost by net emigration by sea (by excess of de partures over arrivals) 77,068 persons, of whom 24,428 went to New Zealand. The third statement is that Victoria is. threaten, ed with further losses in the immediate future owing to land in the other States and in the Northern Territory being made available for thousands of settlers. It is admitted that the first duty is to provide land for our own people before in ducoments are -held out to immigrants; and it is contended that tbe aim should be 'to make the -settlers so satisfied about their condition and prospects that their letters to friends in Europe and America will prove the best advertisements we could display to desirable immigrants. Tbe position of tbe public estate on 31st December, 1905, is stated as follows:;— Approximate ' Areas. PRIVATE LANDS. Acres.

Vic toria, as before stated, has 56.245,700 acres, and it has a population of 1,231,733. Den mark has an area of 9,500,160 acres, and a population of 2,449,540. Of this number 948,997 are engaged in agriculture, against 126,840 in Victoria. The Norwegian poet Bjomsoii testifies that the Danish agricul turists are the most enlightened peasan try an. the world. Victoria exported in 1905— Meat (including rabbits, hares, bacon and liabi) to the value of £652,419, while Denmark sent away in 1904 eggs worth £1,404,833, and has in view an export trade iu that article of the yearly value of £8,000,000. Wool is Victoria's Principal ex- port, but it is not equal to the value of bacon (which is not Denmark's principal export), sent away from that country, namely, £3,448,444. In 1905 Victoria ex ported £2,501,990 worth of wool. £1,835,204 worth of wheat, and 1,576.189 of butter and cheese, malting a total of £5,913,383. Dcninark export of butter alone was £8,1(4,944, which exceeds tlie export from V ictorta of wool, wheat, butter, cheese, flour, skins and hides, hay and chaff, oats, dried and fresh fruits and jams. The value 01 the agricultural production of Victoria ui 190o was estimated at £7,728,421, and of . Ptoi;al and dairying production at £10,83/, 410, making a total of £18,565,831. Eleven years ago tlie farm products of Denmark were estimated at £35,0(H>,000 per annum, and enormous increases have been recorded annually since then. There were 1039- men employed in the Victorian fishing" industry in 1905. and the fish they caught was valued at £08,000. The industry in Denmark finds employment for 15,000 men, and the value of the product is £600,000. victoria pays annually £158,000, for im- :®r' LDenmlrk receives annually £250,000 for her export of fish. . SricBlturally, Victoria is. divided into ejgut beds, and the statistics show that the one. most cultivated has. only 19.09 per cent, of its area behig made .-. productive, while the others range down to as low as e bat of eighteen "flowers J - garden is given, and it is stated that in 1887 a greater acreage was devoted to ten out of the number than tliere is now. A decline is noticed in. the production of barley, peas and beans, potatoes, mangel l)cet> carrots, parsnips, turnips, cory, hops, tobacco and. grapes for wine Attention is drawn to the lesson to be learnt from all these statistics., "Unless Victoria unlocks her lands," it! is argued, Victoria must lose more of her popula tion. Other Australian States are making land available, and taking our farming population away. Agents are conducting parties of v ictorian farmers to other States. J. h.e results must be disastrous to the city, of Melbourne and its suburbs. New South Wales, Queensland and West ern Australia are arranging for lands for settlers, and pursuing vigorous immigration policies.. Victoria cannot prevent immi gration into Australia if other States de sire immigration. The "dog in the manger policy is hopeless. Last Sppo persons arrived in New South Wales in excess of departures. Last year 215,912 immigrants entered Canada, and tliey brought with them more than the annual value oi" the total gold output of Australia. We want these immigrants here, but we do not believe in giving pre ference to. immigrants over the genuine seekers after work and land who are here. We want more work for all here, and a good deal more money. We 'do not Want to' flood tlie country with the idle and thriftless from _Europe. - We are not in favor of indiscriminate immigration. We do not want to make life harder for any man or woman in Australia. We have a splendid country, upon, which millions of money have been expended to lit it for vigorous agriculture. But we have "left it to the Government." California and Canada have gone ahead so rapidly because com mittees of private citizens and public bodies took up as public duties the business of seeing that people were settled upon the lands in these countries. We must do the same. . The only, way to keep undesirable immigrants out of Australia is to bring plenty of desirable immigrants into it. The only way to secure the standard of living of . tlie white man in Australia is by having enough white men to defend it. The I standard of European civilisation must be j maintained iri Australia. This continent! has the vastest jp-eas of unoccupied or slightly occupied lands on the earth. Aus tralia has over 8000 miles of coast line ab solutely unprotected. In our present state we invite invasion. Asia is crowded with teeming millions, always on the verge of famine. Eight millions are within a few days' steaming time of our northern shores. We are 4,000 ,000 — men , worn en and childien | — and we have to provide for the defence of j a continent. Our backdoor is lying open ! in the north. We live upon a continent which 'we cannot internationally claim to be our own without effective occupation of it. Wo do not and we cannot effectively occupy it with our present population and its natural increase. Agriculture is the first line of national defence. The world is filling up fast. The East .is awakening. No power on earth can prevent immigra tion to Australia. The only question is what races of men will occupy it.
