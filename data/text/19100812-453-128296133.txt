A Farmer State. The cablegram announcing tliat the Victorian immigration Commissioners had had no success in Denmark, is not surprising to anyone who knows the conditions of that small, but prosper ous State. Denmark is a farmer State, a country of peasant proprietors, and essentially a land of co-operation. About 90 per cent of the farmers own their farms, and the average size of a farm is 39 acres. A generation ago a Danish farmer was threatened with extinction. To-day the country is cul tivated like a market garden, and has captured the English market in butter, eggs, and bacon. Co-operation' lias worked wonders for the farmers. Near ly 95 per cent of the farmers are mem bers of co-operative dairies, which ship Â£200,000 worth of butter every week to England. The Co-operative Egg Export Society lias often been quoted tor its methods, and exports nearly a million and a half pounds worth of eggs a year. Moreover, the co-opora tive societies buy as well as sell for their members, and through them the farmer gets practically all he wants, from agricultural implements to clothes.
