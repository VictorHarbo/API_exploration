Lack Of SMppiiiff J ?' :' ?'? '? ' . LONDON, Thurs. (A.A.P.) â€”There is doubt in London about how Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, French and Belgian members of war time resistance movements will be able to migrate to Australia. Immigration Minister Calwell has announced that they will be eligible to do so under the asslst ea passage scneme. Shipping is the difficulty. Under existing arrangements such people would have to travel from Continental ports and few passenger ships are leaving the Conti nent for Australia. France, Belgium, Norway and Denmark discourage emigration. Holland and Australia already have a small migration scheme for Dutch farmers involving the use of existing shipping. Ex- resistance fighters can not travel in British ships because foreigners cannot displace Britons from mi grant ships and the clamour from Britons for free and assisted passages continues to overwhelm the Australian Migration Department in London. Applications average 5009 a week. A Copenhagen message says that Danes are showing great interest in the migra tion proposals. About 50 Danes have been able to migrate to Australia since the war, but more than 5000 have applied for immigration permits.
