Unfortu- nately, neither of the pilots happened to bo in the Bay at the time-Pilot Croaker having left on Friday, and Pilot Montgomery being engaged in piloting the Yibiliu, schooner, down the river. The Golden South, 475 tons, Captain Faithful, Surgeon-superintendent Dr. Mackenzie, with 450 passengers on hoard, left Liverpool on tho 26th February, and cast anchor in Hcrvey's Bay on Satur- day, the 2nd June, and has consequently made the very rapid passngo of OG days.

She is now taking on board 1200 tons coal, and leaves on (he 15th instant for Panama, via Wel- lington, as the pioneer of the new mail line. S. M. Herald, June 7. The gradual Bilting up of the shoro at the Williams-town side of tho bay, to which atten- tion was directed some time ago in these columns, does not in any degree nbate, but, on the contrary, gives every indication that it is quietly, but unmistakably, on the increase The lessened depth of water at the patent slips seriously interferes with tho taking on and off oí vessels, nud 1 ho Victorian Railw ay Pior, which at no very late period could accommodate ships of large tommgo having an extreme draught of water, has now, confessedly at low tide, a depth of water barely sufficient to prevent a vessel drawing 23 ' feet from touching tho ground. This was notably instanced yctor clay, when the ship Glee Maiden, from Liver- pool, with a draught of water of 22ft. Gin., in attempting to moor at an outside berth stuck hard and fast, and could not be warped along- side until Die afternoon, when tho tide had risen. Considering the immense prospective advantage oí the pier to the Victorian railways, it would bo a matter of much regret if this hitherto efficient structure, .with its enormous and singularly serviccablo appliances for the discharging and loading of vessels, should be rendered compara- tively useless, or of doubtful und insufficient accommodation, for tile lack of a little timely investigation of the causes of this silting up, by the proper authorities.-Melbourne Argus, June 2.
