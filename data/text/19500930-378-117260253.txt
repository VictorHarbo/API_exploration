REFUSED ENTRY TO BRITISH FAMILY SYDNEY, Sept. 29.- A British family which spent its life savings coming to Aus tralia sailed for Italy to-night after being refused permission to land. The family reached here last Monday in the Italian liner Toscana. The family com prfses Salvatore Callus of Maltese parentage (55), his wife, Ursula, and 22-year-old daughter Pierette. Immigration Authorities detained the family on board. They claimed, according to the family, that the father was suffering from a lung complaint. Before coming here, the family sold its home and possessions in Turkey. Federal Government officials considered the case for several days before the Immigration Minister (Mr. Holt) late to day announced that the family would have to leave Australia when the ship sailed to-night. After Mr. Holt's announce ment further representations were made to the Government on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Cal ius and their daughter, but no answer had been received to night. Members of the family say that they have no country io go to because they will not be permitted to land in Turkey where they lived for the past 15 years.
