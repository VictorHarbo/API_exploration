Walter, and just published vby the Anglo-Ger man Publishing Company (4/6 net). The German Bmpire in Europe cov ers an area of 208,777s square miles, Tiie population of the Empire is now 'about sixty-eight; "millions; Its growth has been continuous during the last century, particularly since the foundation of the new empire in 1871\. At present it increases at the., rate, of over 800,000 per year, due mainly to the surplus of births over deaths, and to a small extent to immigration from neighboring coun tries. The emigration of Germany into foreign": countries is miich smal ler than the emigration from Eng land, but there is, nevertheless, a large number in every habitable part" of the globe. All European as well as; oveirsea l countries have a more or less Ger | man population, running very often running into sis figures. The aggre gate -number of Germans - in the wotld in the current- year, as far as can be estimated, reach 1,000 'â€¢millions.', Large numbers '.of for eigners live in Germany, Austrians, Hungarians, Poles, Russians Ital iahs, Dutch, French' and Danish to a large extent permanently settle i in Certainly .because opportunities. : are greater there than in their native countries. The foreign, population in Germany proper amounted at the Census in 1910 to 1,250,873. More than 50 per cent- were of Austrian nationality (634,983). Dutchmen came next witli 144,175, followed by Rus sians (137,697), and Italians (104, 204) . Of Britis h nationality there were 18,319 people, as against. 16, 130 in 1900. The great number of these foreigners are unskilled labor ers. Like all other great nations of to day, Germany has become a nation of town- dwellers. Almost three-fifths of the population' live under urban conditions. The number of people en gaged in agricultural pursuits : has remained stationery since the begin ning of the last' century, while all increase of (population during the last fifty years has gone to swell the town population. When the Empire was founded ah 1871 there were only eight towns with a population of oveil 100,000 inhafoitantsi whereas the nunther 'of such towns in 1913 was 1,150. Towns with over 500,000 inhabitants in 1910 were seven.
