ST. PATRICKS DAY. AN ENTHUSIASTIC CELEBRA TION. Every nation has its peculiar traditions, customs, and festivals; and Ireland is not behindhand in honoring her feast days. Englishmen revere the memory of St. George, , as do Soutchmen . that of St. Andrew, and \- ~ WelahmeathatofSs. David, but the people of! ' none of. these Jjatkma pay such enthu-j . tiaitic honiag* to flWf patron saint as do \- ' the Irish to ttieirs.On the occasion of the anniversary of the b&A;' ot St. Patrick, "the \?_ giorious apostle of Iretind. 11 Whether on his " riative heath" or maiar-off clime the Celt \- never fargeta his fijWityto tbe land of his birds, aswell as .to Se*! cause and her hopes.

Some grave historians hed said Si. Patrick was a Frenchman, others would | have it that he was a Scotchman, and again it was averred he was a German. Personally as a historian he believed he was an Irishman. (Laughter and cheers.) Another subject upon which there was a divergence of opinon was Home Rule. In SoutU Australia they went j in largely for politics, but with all due respect j to the members of the Ministry and other j political gentlemen present be thought itj would be better to leave politics abne—(hear, bear>—because if they once got into the arena of politics it might interfere with their digestion. (Laughter.) There was the sweet little, dear little shamrock of Ireland Bti\l left for their reflection ; it was much in evidence that day. (Cheers.) The shamrock had a will of ita own —it was thoroughly Irish, and while it grew luxuriantly in its native soil it per sistently refused to thrive anyvruere else. (Cheers.) In "Love and Idleness" Shakes peare spoke of a western flower, and although I he did not push his botanical investigations into a neighboring country still ths description corresponded exactly with the shamrock. Shakespeare was a genius, and his knowledge of men and things was too extensive for him to believe that the bard had not heard of the dear little, sweet little shamrock of Ireland. (Laughter.) Shakespeare, bow ever, having- no doubt a due regard for the susceptibilities of his countrymen, did not like to name tbe western flower the shamrock of Ireland. (Laughter.) There were two kinds of shamrocks—the four-leaved and the three-leaved. Tbe former variety had talis manic effects. If a man wanted money or de sired Parliamentary honors and had the four leaved shamrock in his possession, his wishes were gratified. (Laughter.) Unfortunately it was on record that the discovery of the four-leaved shamrock was rare. (Laughter.) He was sorry for it, as otherwise half tbe mem bers of our Legislature and also the iederal Contention would be Irishmen. (Laughter and cheers.) Tbe three-leaved shamrock was a less uncommon plant. However, it was supposed to have medicinal effects, and where an Irishman was struck down it was supposed to cure the wound, and certainly prevented blood poisoning. (Laughter.) He hopedtbey might all live long to celebrate tbe feast of St. Patrick. (Loud cheers.) Mr. Gltkn, who was greeted with cheers, in reply, said he confessed be felt inclined to take advantage of his position as chairman and refuse to call upon himself. The dim culty on each occasion was to say something new, but he thanked his grace for his re ference to Shakespeare's " Lovb and Idleness. He must, however, say there was not much idleness so far as he was capable of judging about Irish love. (Laughter.) Irishmen did not sleep in their love. On many occasions even tbe blackthorn had bean called into requisition in such matters. Moreover tbe character referred to by tbe archbishop could not have been Irish, Use Fletcher had said, "Faith, she has devils in her tongde." He thanked his grace for the kindly way he had spoken. (Cheers.) .. _ ,' Dr. O'Coskbu. submitted "Australia," the land of their adoption. It was only (air, how-, ever, that their native land should have prece dence on these occasions. He was pleased to seetheMuustry present. It had been well said that wherever one *went he was butb to meet an Irishman. If the Antarctic regions were explored they would surely :fihd. one there. Australia had been built up by irish men, so that in honoringthe toast they were to a certain extrat honoring their native land. (Cneera.j Victoria, Queen- and Empress, reigned over many lands, but no fairer inheri tance was under her temporal sovereignty than this—to some the land of adoption, to .others the land of birth,- and which they called AoatraHs, (xxrad cheera.).: . .;_ Mr. W. J. DbnkY responded. He was sur prised that Dc COonuell as an Irishman should express Bia-aimpence to propose that or anyoSier toast" As> rule Irishmen were eqnal to any emergency. ILaoghter.) Unfor tuaatoly Australia Had not a patron saintlike St. Patrick. Onemigbt come in time, although institutions in which a boy was free to aay anything but hi? prayers did not ?apply the; materials of which eainte were made. (Laughter.). Australians had alack of atqnfomjnt but they were not deficient in the good finalities that went to make a man. Their want of national scenery was proverbial, but they had political institutions that might oompate with-much more' favored -conntnes. Most Irishmen had heard ot the teus ef Shaqdonjand of the poetry weaved round their . t/amriitirmn, bat; Australians wonUie jnote concerned to know whether the dock at Shaodon kept accurate tune. Aus tralia had no "good people" or shillelaghs, and " turf had quite a different significance to that attached to it in Ireland.' Australians had some of the best strains in their composi tion. They had *hB 'cnteness of tire American, the business tact of the Anglo-Saxon, the poetry and eloquence of the Irish, the shrewd ness of: the Scotch, and the solidity of the German: '(Loud cheers.) ' The Tbeasojieb, in proposing "The chair man," said Me Glynn was held in high esteem not-only by bis fellow-countrymen but by the people of South Australia, as was evidenced by lus election to the Federal Convention. (Loud cheers.) Lest he should be tempted into the devious paths of politics he would content himself with merely* submitting the toast. : Mr. Gx.T?nr having suitably acknowledged the compliment the proceedings closed. THE SPOUTS The sports were successfully carried. out although at times^he starting of some of the events was Somewhat hindered by the public crowding the course. Tfae racing on the whole was very good, the finishes' of some of the events being exciting. The St. Patrick's Day Sheffield Handicap brought out a good field, and after two rounds of heats had been run the first place fell to H. Jones off 13 yards mark, -while £. J. Whiteford with 13§ yards start came in second; 'and J. H. Trathen off 10J yards mark came third. In the fust heat of the seeped, round some of tbe starters were dis qualified by the officials. The hurdle race fell to H. Jones after several heats had been run. A good deal of interest was taken in the Tanning high jump, which was won by M. B.

One of tbe most pleasing and popular parts of the programme of St. Patrick's Day celebra tion is tbe national concert which is held in the Town HalL On the present occasion it j proved no exception to the rule and a large, audience assembled, amongst wbom were the i Archbibhop, the Premier and Mrs. Kingston, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, Arch deacon Russell and Archpriest Nevin, and a large number of city and Euburban clergy. Mr. P. McM. Glynn delivered an address on "Our National Festival," in the course of ' which he said:—No race is more tenacious of traditions than the Irish, no race is fonder of i idealising the past; you will not on this earth j find a people with a feeling of nationality more intense, or domestic instincts more developed, than the people whose national festival we I celebrate to-day. The historic ideal is an' abiding reality with us; we have perhaps more than other nations a fondness for the romance of the past, and for what is poetic and inspiring in national memories. You I remember bow Moore suggests this eide of the | national temper in that song which might be' I considered our national anthem, and in which ] ;he asks the Sons of Jirin to remember the days ?of old :— On Lough Ncagb'a tank as tbe fisherman (trays, Wbrn the clear coM eve's declining. Be sen tiic round towers of other days In the ware beneath him shining. Thus shall incmorjr often, in drains sublime. Catch a clinijice ot the ciavs that are over ; Thus, eipbui^, look through ibe waves ot time For the long faded glories they cover. I am not going to believe, therefore, that the child ren of Irish parents—of parents so devoted to tbe national ideal—have altogether cut the | painter with their historic records, or affect a vubjar insensibility in relation to their races and traditions. We arc commou-plaoe enough, God knows, without assuming a want of sense for tbe poetry of patriotism. Agreatlrifihstates man—the greatest, according to a contempo rary, that the world had ever seen—says that "people will not look forward to posterity who never look back to their ancestors." But let me refer to a living writer. Ruskin, con trasting at the time of the Indian mutiny the effect of natural sumjuading?, those surround ings from which patriotism draws its inspira tion, on the capacities and moral habits of the Scotch and East Indians, Bays:—"Oat of the peat cottage, come faith, courage, self-sacrifice, purity, piety, and whatever else is fruitful in the work of Heaven; out of the ivory palace come treachery, cruelty, cowardice, idolatry, bestiality—whatever else is fruitful in the work of hell." And he ascribes this to the fondness of the Scotch lor the natural scenery of their native land—to tbe fact that their passions and principles axe directly luwy^tH with tbe charm and power of nature. How many instances of this association of natural scenery with the purest and most salutary patriotism, the patriotism that at once refines and inspires, is famished by Scotch poetry. Most of the references in Irish patriotic poetry are to the beauty sod grandeur of natural scenery—to, of course, as is inevitable with Celtic natures, the brightness and blarney of Irish eyes, the Boftness and silver purity of Irish lakes, and tbe boldness of the mountain cliffs that beat back eternally the breaking swell of the Atlantic. Let me now say a few words, and a few only will be re quired, as to some of the half-forgotten reasons why we should keep np our memories of the past. If history repeats itself Ireland outfit to have a bright future before it. Thierry says that " the poetry and literature of ancient Ireland were tbe most cultivated, perhaps, of all western Europe." Some of the beginnings of the great elemental dramas, of which. Wagner has made such use, can be traced to Celtic, if not Irish sources. It seems to be the function of some races to supply tbe foundation of literature; of others to raise the structure of the imagination. The great German epic, the Nibelungen Lied, has Irish scenes; tbe Isold of Tristram, of the old love story modernised by Arnold, Tennyson, and others, was an Irish girl, one probably as bewitching as these that the great Danish warrior. King Magnus, loved better than himself and whose beauty made him declare his heart was in Dublin. And now, ladies and gentlemen, having sounded the praises of ourselves and oar mother land —lor of course patriotic eulogies are to some small extent self-regarding—let me nay a few words as to the objects which underlie lie celebration of this day. As a race we stick with some tenacity to the memory of our great dead, and St. Patrick is in all conscience-dead long enough to be borne in strong remembrance. He leaves, I need (scarcely tell you, an historic name, for now that as a professor says, history should be written backwards and ancestors and posterity are liable to become some what mixed, I might say that he m i*nll?4 after myself. Twjpf^ X can claim a further acquaintance with St. Patrick, and hope, of course, hereafter to make it I was once under the spiritual supervision of bis historian, the Bey. Father Shearman, of Howth. Father Shearman, I thiak, bad an idea that there were three St. Patricks, bat to that there can be little objection, as one cannot have too much of a good thing. Perhaps this explains the assertion of the eons of Caledonia, who have a knack of appropriating what is valuable, that St. Patrick was a Highlander. But tc be serious. It is not alone as the anni versary of our patron Baint, bat as a'preserva tive of ourisense of nationality that we cele brate St. Patrick's Day. On the 17th of March the unity of the race is made perfect through the touch of a common memory. It has been said of the British Empire that it is one "on which the sun. never seta" and " whose-morning drum-beat* following the son and keeping company with the hoars, encircles the globe with an unbroken chain of martial airs." Well, "St. Patrick's Day in the morn ing" follows the bugle of the dawn ; I think you win hear the music of the brogue wherever die flag of freedom flies, from' tropics to Arctic lands, from "the Orkneys to the Ham," some eon of old Ireland wul be found to comme morate the festival of his native land and ??g r even in climes where the satires strut in naked majesty, " The Wearing of the Green." The fact of it is, (here is no life' without ideals, no sympathy between men possible without^a centre of common interest, and devotion to the country that bore us, or was the scene of oar ancestral records, rapplies as salutary and comprehensive an ideal as life is likely to afford. And does not this patriotism, poetic or retrospective though it may be now that the sphere of oar activity is here, react upon ns as citizens ot thisyounjr and healthy state. Are we aot, whatever' may be the land of our descent, the letter Australians for remembering on the return of a' festival day the land of our father's love ; are we not the tetter fitted to found, as we are about J? a i.,aeJ r na^?ll wrtay ** our blended bloods from having dwelt upon tbe memories of the old home across the sea and warmed oar hearts from time to time at tbe living fire of her altars? It must be so. As Englishmen we may boast ?f??"" "fioeptred "isle," as Scotchmen of tbe wild beauty of oar mountain scenery, as Irishmen of -what you will; but it is only men that do bo who can feel to the full the spirit of Kipling's toast to tie sons of the Empire ? who can rise to the height and abandonof his concluding lines— We've drunk to tie Queen, God bless bar ? We've drunk to our mother's land: . We've drunk to our English brother (And we hope hell understand}. We've drank as much as we're able,. And tbe crass swings low to the d?ra; Last toast—and your foot on the table— A health to the native born. An excellent programme had been arranged by the secretaries, Messrs. W. J. Denny and P. F. Kiley, and was well carried out The organ recitals by Me W. Sanders, first a "Fantasia on Irish airs" and then a march by Dunster, were in each case pleasing pre ludes to the portions of the programme which followed. The air " There is a charming girl." from Benedict's "The Lily of Killarney;" was rendered by Mr. F. Monk, who was in eood voice, and met with a warm reception. MooreB "Last rose of summer," as sung by Miss Nellie CSuUivan, appealed to all present, aad the songstress only escaped an encore by the fact that, owing to the length of the programme, they were strictly forbidden. Later on Miss O'Sullivan soared another sucoess in Lover's ballad "The angel's whisper." Haynea'a popular "Off to Phila delphia." as sung by Mr. 0. E Taeuber, was given with vim, and elicited loud applause. He was also expressive in "Me darlin' Asthore." Mr. A. C. Quinn'a masterly manipulation of the violin, combined with his powers of expression, ma" Fantasia on Irish melodies" won for him undoubted expression of approval. "Kathleen Mavoumeen" always appeals to an Irish audience, but as sung by Mr. R. Nitschke it evoked more than usual enthusiasm, bnt when after wards he sung "The minstrel boy" the audience was_ "agin the law," and in sisted on him singing the last verse. Two pieces essential to the occasion were The Irish immigrant" and "Comeback to Erin," and it is needless to say Miss E. Lohrmann in each won solden opinions. Equally suitable to the occasion were tbe con tributions of Mrs. Geach, who sang "Eil lamey" and "Asthore" with most pleasing effects. " The moon has raised her lamp" was given as a duet by MV^m^ Monk and Taueber while "God save Ireland," in which Mr! Nitechke sang the solo parts, brought the entertainment to a close. THE BANQUET. For several years the idea of holding a ban quet on St. Patrick's night has been talked about, but nothing practical has oome of it However, on Wednesday night, at the Exchange Hotel, Hindley-street* the first of a series of annual banquets in connection with tbe Irish National Federation was held. Over 100 guests sat down to a capital spread provided by Mr. C. A. Marten, and the banquet was a brilliant success. In the menu cards was the following verse: — And hearts chat have been long estranged And friends that have groira cold. Shall meet again like parted streams And mingle as of old. Mr. F. F. Whoiohan proposed "The day we celebrate." No man must think that Ire land was crooning over the irreparable past; 1 she was to-day a vigorous personality battling j for her rights, and they should remember that i there was no statute of limitation which < barred the rights of' a nation. (Cheers.) The toast entrusted to him was one that would be honored and received with enthusiasm all the world over. (Cheers.) There were many em pires, but there was a nobler and and a name less empire which spread all round the globe lan empire of Irish hearts, which extended from furthest north to south, and from furthest! j east to west, (Cheers.) He was afraid Irish-1 j men w?~? setting very matter-of-fact, and were, trudging their weary way for 361 days in the rear. Sorely on the remaining day they could | be allowed to give themselves up to the enjoy ment of celebrating the natal day of their patron saint. (Cheers.) The time had cone by when Ireland's past could be despised or ignored. A flood of light had shone on the deeds of tkeir noblest men—deeds which recalled the ' greatest glories in history. (Cheers.) Ireland ' was famed for the beauty and chastity of her | dark eyed colleens, the eloquence and piety of her missionaries, and the picturesqueness of her scenery. Ireland was only too willing to hold out the hand of friendship to all nations; and if she were only united there was no power on earth to deprive Irishmen of their rights. (Cheers.) They saw Ireland only throuch the mists of memory, but though tbcy lived beneath the Southern Cross they still had a warm corner in their hearts for the dear old land far away. (Cheers.) It was said that Ireland had been conquered, but sue never had been in the real eenne of the word. (Hear, hear.) Who now feared to speak of '98? Was there an Irishman now who bung hi* head with shame at the sound of the glories of'9B? (Cheers.) They hoped to see the Parliament again established in College Green, and, though it might seem incongrous to some people, Irishmen could love South Aus tralia and yet not be false to Ireland. (Cheers.) The Chaibvan, in reply, said the sentiment embodied in that toast needed neither elo quence nor rhetoric to commend it to those present. He had not the good fortune to belong to Ireland, nor to have seen the preen shores of Erin. He was laboring under a disability in this respect, but no more so than St. Patrick himself. Seven cities laid claim to the birthplace of Homer. A good many had put forward a similar plea for St. Patrick, and yet the very land he bad sanctified and glorified made no such claim. (Hear, hear.) They were charged with being too exclusive because they united in doing honor to one to whom they vowed their allegiance, and who was a great benefactor of their race. (Cheers.) They were prepared to extend sympathy to anyone who was in sympathy with them in their national aspirations. This celebration was not ~~>"^?^ with the triumph of one party or the disaster of another. St. Patrick belonged to no party or faction, and Irishmen ot all creeds and classes could unite in celebra ting tins festival without introducing those bitter memories which were unfortunately associated with other celebrations. They were all met in one communion to do honor to Ireland's patrou saint, whose name was Attached to two of the noblest sentiments to be found in Irish hearts—faith and fatherland. (Loud cheers.) St. Patrick was claimed by Protestants as well as Catholics, bat, like the teetotaller who excused himself on the ground that "he was not bigoted," if Ireland a patron saint were a Protestant he. was not a biiroted one. (Laughter.) The Scotch hod gloried in St. Andrew and the English in St. George; then why should not they do honor to St. Patrick, whose memory earned them back to the time when Ireland was the island of saints. (Cheers.) Why was there a disposition on the part of some of their countrymen or countrywomen to despise the Rood old names for their children at baptism ? The name of Patrick was going out of fashion, and some newfandangled name was substituted. Wo had picked op such names as "Norman Stanley Flanagan,' "Leslie Plantagenet Murphy" and "Vic toria Angelina McCarthy." (Loud laughter.) He hoped there were none there who would be ashamed of the old-fashioned, good old names:; what was good enough for their forefathers ought to be good enough for them. (Cheers). In times of trouble and disaster they should not grow cold in their warmth towards their native land, but rather help their countrymen in their fight for liberty. (Cheers). He hoped that this -gathering would be an annual one, and that they would meet again to honor St. Patrick's Day. (Cheers). Mr. B. J. Cayanaoh snbmitted "Ireland a cation," which was a subject for an orator and an inspiration for a poet The history of Ire laud famished them with fllustmous examples of men who had fought undaunted for the liberty of the country. In every phase of their history men had been produced who would lire for ever in the memory of all tame. It was absurd to say Irishmen were not capable of governing themselves. In every country they had acted as Premiers of their, colonies—(cheers)— tnayors of their towns, and representatives of their districts. (Cheers.) Me GtrNN said in these days the force of thought was practically more powerful than the force of arms, and as Irishmen they were more hopeful of the sympathy of other nations than ever—a sympathy which stimulated that intense enthusiasm for the cause they had at heart—lrish nationality. (Cheers.) They were fast approaching the year of 18D8, which recalled memories of a mournful character, and 1752 saw the establishment of a Parlia ment on College Green. What could be done at one time could be accomplished again with faith and energy. Let them not be daunted by what had taken place at home amongst the Irish Party, but hope that all disputes might soon blow over and that all would be found working for the common weaL . Mr. J. P. Dobekt, in proposing " Aus tralia, 1' eaid no one could dispute die right of Irishmen to be proud of Australia. He re ferred to the late Mr. W. R Dalley. Aus tralia's first Privy Councillor, Chief Justice Hiftginbotbam, Charles Gavan Duffy, Sir Robert Torrena, and Sir George Kingston, not to ?wn|am? worthy descendents like the Kingstons and O'LoghUns. (Cheers.) He rejoiced that is Australia they bad not felt the arm of oppression, and that the grip of the evictor and tyrant had not been put upon tbethroatof struggling humanity. (Hear, hear.) Though short was our history it was none the less glorious. Tbe pioneers had leftusexamples of their heroism, and the lessonsof our explored would not be lost upon young Australians, who were full of coarags and determination. (Cheers.) The Pbekjxb, who was greeted with ringing cheers, said the warmth ofthe reception made him feel that he was in a room filled with warm Irish hearts. He wad reminded previously that he was in an Irish gathering by a variety of circumstances, not the least being that delicious touch of the native tongue which he had never heard on its native shore, and by the eloqnence which had marked every speech throughont the proceedings, and whichnad been soconspiciousinMr.Doheny'eaddre?S. (Cheers.) The chairman had found fault with the fact that Irish fathers and mothers had adopted a certain style in connection with the nomencla ture of their offspring. Both Mr. O'Loghlin and Mr. Glynn had now a glorious oppor tunity of altering t\w\t. (Loud laughter.) If they only abandoned their desolate state of what some people miscalled "single blessed ness" and gave practical proof of that adoration of the sex which they so eloquently professed — (laughter)—.in the natural sequence of events there would occur opportunities of perpetuating the patronymic of " Pat," which they could not hope to enjoy whilst they remained bachelors. (Loud laughter. \ The new woman was supposed to be with them; but he was contented with the old. However, these two gentlemen at present retained the right of selection. Let them make their choice. (Laughter.) They had opportunities in the direction he had suggested of meeting a long-felt . want, bom as regards an increase in die Irish population and securinE a perpetuation of the patronymic of Pat, which they bo much deplored as having gone out of date. (Loud laughter.) He did not know that his name bad often been associated with saints— (laughter) — but if tbere was one aunt more than another for whom be had respect it was St. Patrick; and it would be strange if it were not so. St. Patrick was the patron saint of old Ireland, which he had never seen, and for which for various reasons he cherished the most san guine ideals. (Cheers.) If he ever got so near as England—and they saw it was suggested that there was Borne prospect of his doing so—the time would not be far distant when he would make himself inti mately acquainted with Ireland and her people in their native home. (Cheers.) They were reminded that they owed much to the pioneers of South Australia who came from the countries of the Old World. What wonder then that the son—though it might be an unworthy son—of that grand old Irish pioneer whose name bad been mentioned should be tempted a little to dwell on the debt of gratitude which South Australia owed to Irish enterprise, and which she had einos done so much to generously repay. Australia was his native land—in which be was born and bred and in which he hoped to die. (Cheers.) Breathes then a man with tool so dead Who never to huuselt hath said This is my own, my native land. They bad little fear that a glorious mother bad elsewhere any such recreant sons. She appealed too powerfully to their patriotism. They were reminded of the freedom they enjoyed, and well might that be so. Well might our consti tution be held up as an example and a source of admiration to the countries of the world. The short period of our history forbade a long record of military achievements such as that to which less favored coun tries might point. Might our soil never be polluted with the wholesale outpouring of human blood, but peace has her victories as well as war—-(loud cheers) —and a conquered wilderness, a thriving country, a pros perous and contented community, spoke more eloquently of Australia, its people, and resources, than centuries of bloody fratricidal strife. (Cheers.) Achievements such as these accomplished by individual ! states opened to them the most glorious vista of the portabilities of a united Australia, tee ideal of all true Australians so magnifi cently apostrophised by an Australian singer. O, (Air ideal, unto whom. Through days ot doubt mud nights ot gloom, Bnve hearts hare clung, while lipe of scorn Hade mock of ihee as bat a dream, Already on the heights of mom i We see thy golden sandals gleam. ' And glimmering through the clouds that wrap thee I yet, ; Thp twin (tan that an toy coronet Politics were properly tabooed on an occasion lof this sort, but they would hardly wish him to refrain, in view of the great national gather ing of Australian statesmen who would shortly meet in Adelaide, for referring to tbe greatest of all Australian questions — federation. (Cheers.) Might it speedily be accomplished and on an enduring basis. (Cheers.) When that day came for the relisation of the poet's dream and the patriot's aspiration, but not till then, it might happen that someone would j have even a greater honor than he had now in responding to tbe toast of united Australia. (Loud cheers.) During tbe evening a programme of national music was carried out under the direction of Mr. W. J. Jacobs, those contributing items being Messrs. P. Healy, J. C. Healy, D. Bothe, J. McDermott, F- Field, E. Berming ham, J. H. Lyons, and J. P. Doheny. Mr. Bothe sang Heuzenroeder's "Australia" after that toaet had been proposed, and at the close ot the evening's proceedings Mr. Doheny gaye " God save Ireland," the company joining in the chorus.
