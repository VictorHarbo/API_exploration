The schooner Harbinger, which was obliged to put back for repairs, was taken into the floating-dock on Saturday ; she is expected to be ready for sea by the end ot this week. The Empress Eugenie, from Liverpool, brings 328 Government immigrants, under charge of Dr. Long- staff. They have enjoyed good health during the passage, and the vessel is remarkably clean. Her immigrants are classed as follows : - 32 married couples, 8 single women, 118 single men, and 72 children. The Lady Bird broke down when abreast of the Upper Light-ship, and was towed up to Hobson's Bay by the steamer White Swan. The "PLANET" STEAMER. - The trial trip on Tuesday last proved satisfactory in the opinion of all conver- sant with the matter. The Planet left the jetty at a quarter past three in the afternoon, taking about fourteen passengers. She had been supplied with a small quantity of English coal to mix with that on board, which was a very inferior surface coal, obtained from a newly-opened mine ; while the English coal lasted the pressure was high, and progress was very satisfactory ; but when the New South Wales coal alone remained the pressure fell to little more than half, and a corresponding difference was apparent in the speed attained. The passage to Pigeon Bay was against a strong N.E. wind, and was accomplished under these circumstances in exactly three hours, the distance being about fifteen miles. Here the party of passengers landed and were hospitably received by Mr. E. Hay and others. At the expiration of two hours, from 6.15 to 8.15, the Planet got under weigh for her return. By this time the wind had changed to S.W., blowing stiff, so that the return was made also against a head wind; from the inferior quality of the coal the upward passage occupied an hour longer than the downward, and the anchor was dropped in the harbor at a few minutes after midnight. The alterations necessary have been commenced. - Lyttelton Times. WRECK OF THE AMERICAN WHALING SHIP ALEXANDER. Intelligence reached Wellington early on Monday morning last, to the effect that the American whaling ship Alexander, Captain Dougherty, of New Bedford, Massachusets, had been wrecked near Cape Camp- bell, in Cook's Strait. The following particulars relat- ing to this unfortunate occurrence have been com- municated to us by the Captain: - The ship Alexander, 421 tons, was commanded by Captain Dougherty, and owned by Swift and Perry, of New Bedford. She sailed from Sydney on the 3rd January last, on a whaling voyage for the South Seas. Nothing particular occurred until the ship neared the coast of New Zealand, when, the ship sud- denly struck upon a reef of rocks running about seven or eight miles out from the main land; the weather at the time was thick and hazy, and a strong breeze was blowing from the southward, the ship being under double-reefed topsails at the time ; immediately the vessel struck she carried away her rudder and knocked a large hole in her bottom ; the captain then directed the boats to be cleared away, thinking that the ship would sink immediately; a heavy swell, however, drove the vessel over the reef into deep water ; but, finding that she had then seven feet of water in her hold, he (the captain) determined to make sail, and endeavor to run her on the beach, thinking this the only chance of saving her cargo. He succeeded in working her clear of the reef, and ran her ashore on the beach ; immediately ordered the masts to be cut away, and let go the anchors. At this time the water was level with the lower deck. In landing the crew, one man, named Joseph Soldier, was unfortunately drowned in the surf. Finding it useless remain- ing with the ship, Captain Dougherty at once char- tered the schooner Australian Maid to pro- ceed to Wellington, and arrived here on Monday morning. The Alexander has been out 28 months, and had 1,300 barrels of sperm oil on board at the time she was wrecked. The captain states that his position on the chart upon the previous day, by his calculations, placed him about 70 miles to the south- ward of where the vessel struck, and that the reef is not laid down in any of his charts. From the posi- tion in which the ship was lying when the captain left, he believes that a portion of the cargo may be re- covered, but the vessel herself is a total wreck. She is stranded about half a mile in a north-westerly di- rection from the White Bluff, and nearly four miles to the southward of the mouth of the Wairou River, on the middle island. The captain, upon arriving in Wellington, immediately placed himself in communication with Mr. James Smith, the American Consular Agent at this port, when it was determined that the vessel, as she now lies, should be sold at public auction for the benefit of those concerned, in terms of survey. Yesterday, Mr. J. H. Wallace, instructed by Mr. Smith, offered the Ship for sale in five lots, at the Exchange, which, after a spirited competition (the attendance being very numerous), was sold as follows : - Lot 1, the hull of the ship, sold to Mr. J. Varnham for £270 ; lot 2, the whaling gear, sold to Mr. J. Martin for £50.; lot 3, four whaleboats and fittings, for £95. ; lot 4, ship's stores, for £70. ; and lot 5, the whole of the oil, for £2,800, Mr. L. Levy having been the purchaser of the last three lots ; the whole proceeds of the sale being £3,295. We understand that the captain leaves again immediately for the wreck, in order to render any necessary assistance. - New Zealand Spectator.
