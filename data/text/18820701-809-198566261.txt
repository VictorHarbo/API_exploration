OPINIONS OF THE PRESS: Tho UrUish QutrUrly for January. Mr. Syme is favorably known to us by a fresh little work, "Outlines of an Industrial Science," In which ho took a new departure in the " dismal science." In bis hands political economy received thoughtfol yet lively Illustration, ami we looked forward with some degree of expeotaney to his next venture. We have It before lis In a treatise on " Representative Govern ment In Eugland," whloh is alike interesting and in structive. ... Mr. Symo has the haupy knaslc of writing on abstruse topics with force and felicity. Ho is master of au excellent style, not too ornato for the discussion of political principles, yet pointed, forcible and clear.' He writes, too, with ample knowlodgo of his subjects, so that It is Impossible not to recognise that he has investigated as well as thought for him self. The Wcttminster Jfctrfrte for January. Mr. Syme's thoughtful and independent criticism oi our existing constitution is a valuable contribution to the literature of an important question. We cannot profess to agreo with all his conclusions, but we agree inost oordlaily with the spirit and Intontlou of his essay, , . . We can cordially recommend his ex position of the weakness of our Parliamentary system to all students of polities. The Graphic, 12th January. Mr. Syme's views are woll worth reading, and his chapter oa Early Parliaments is full of Interesting 5L Jamet'i Gazette, 25th November: His book Is, on tho whole, well written and instruc tive. The Netccaitle (England) Chronicle, 29th November. Among tho numerous works that have recontly Issued from tho proea treating of thie subject (Repre sentative Government), wo know of uonethat presents tho problem iu a more luminous light than a treatise entitled "Representative Government in England," by David Syme. Mr. Syme is an Able and accom plished Journalist, He lias thought doeply on econo mic and political quostlons. Ills ideas on political economy aro embodied in " Outlines of an Didustrial Science," aud his discourse on the faults and failures of our representative system is at once stimulative and suggestive. The Melbourne Review for January. Ono very pleasant feature of this book Is its finished literary workmanship. Mr. Syme strictly clrcum scribes tho limit of bis argument, and refuses to be tempted beyond it by any hazy vistas of possible dls cuvory. Ho does not touch upon any of tho abstract reasonings for or against representative governments Ho assumes, as a first prlnciplo, that the more repre imitative a government le the better it is. Ho start! with the axiom that in legislation the electors .oulj are to ho considered, and "not the elected j and thai tho majority of the electors are entitled without unj hindrance to the ahsoluto mastery of all affairs o State. Questions of the franchise are excluded, am problems such as the representation of minorities art eschewed, simply because they llo outsido of th< straight path of iris argument. Ho does uot treat, a Mr. Harrison does, of the procedure of Icglslatlvt bodies, but concentrates all bis attention upon thi relations which subsist botween tho electors aud theii representatives on the ono hand, and between mem bars and tholr representatives, tho Ministry, ou thi other. To elucidate theso conditions, English con stitiitional history from the vory earliest times hai been laid under contribution. But tho work Is do historical, and the (acts of history only appear eitbei as illustrations or as furnishing the material foi an induction. In general style and manner of hand ling his subject Mr. Synia resembles J. 8. Mill There Is tho same calmness, the suiue lucidity, tbi same reserve of strength. . Thore Is a severe eonolse ncss of expression, which loads to a condensatior and crystallisation of thought. The book is interest Dig in itself, and pregnant In suggestions ; wrlttei entirely without the technicality which might terrlfj the general reader, and still thoughtfully cnongh t< merit the attention of the philosophic student. The Tasmania#, 2Sth. February. The book wilt bear careful perusal, though, as I matter of course, every render may not be expected to agree with Mr. Syme's conclusions. In inannei and matter the volumo is such as will make it an in valuable handbook with reference to the importaal subject of which It treats. The S, A. Register, 20th February.) The book is very valuable for ail ilut, aud oontaloi a number of political facts aud principles which can not bo disputed, along with opinions aud suggestions which may not please everybody. . Arthur Arnold in the Academy, llth February: This is an interesting book, and its readers will in crease every dav now that a now Uotorm Bill, with s re-distribution of electoral power, U regarded as thi goal of the present Parliament. the Town and Country, 6th May. Tills work ought to be read by every person wbc admires or feels Interested In whut is called the Rritlsl Constitution, l'bo lattor is a. thing of shreds ami patches, and has gradually become what It uow is bj means of additions and improvements designed t< remedy its faults and prevent the recurrence of in failures. It treats of the early . representative Parlia ment, of government by party, of outside pressuri applied to Parliament, of the political unity of thi Cabinet, of tho true principles of representation, and of the functions of Ministers. Tho opinions of the author on all these poiuts are illustrated aud enforecc by copious historical examples. Tho Btyle of tho worli 1b clear and ornate, bnt tho Author never attempt! showy or lino writing. Although wo strongly dlsaonl (rem Mima of Mr. Syme's conclusions, wc nevertheless admit that be has stated those conclusions with great perspicuity. Every person who wishes to obtain deal views of the nature of the British Constitution, and ol (he Innumerable changes it has undergone, ought U read his work. . . . . .. . r BY HE L li A 1> JS R JL Of Saturdat, lflf J I'll, Contains— Political Cmos The Situation in Eoypt TIIK WKCR Under the Verandah Amusements--' l'bo Theatres —Musical Events, bj Frudel Sciexcb— Srientlflc Gousip, by (Edlpus, Patents— New Applications Tub Farh— Answers to' Correspondents, Lands Open for Selection and Deselection, I.oo»l Land Boards, Approaching Land Soles, Ploughing Matches and Agricultural Shows to Come, Ac.

Mount Heemskirk, 7th June, 1882. Gentlemen,— In compliance with your instructions I have ex amined tbe sections held by you, and £ find there ore four distinct lodes two north and south and two east and 'west. These lodes have been opened up In various places, and are highly stanniferous. The chlorido lode nearest to the boundary is about 2 feet thick, and cau be traced right through the sections, > and appear to be a continuation of tho Prince George > lode. That nearest the south boundary is no doubt a continuation of the lodo known as " Ricbardsou's," i belonging to tbe Cornwall proprietory, and is a well defined lode, from 8 to 4 feet thick, and is composed of porphyrltlc granite, In which tho tin appears to permeate through the stone. The two north and south lodo9 are also wall defined, aud consist chiefly of porphry and tourmaline, in which the tin can also be seen. The facilities for operations aro exceptionally good, as the lodes can bo wurked to a great depth t rom adit levols, thcrebynvoldiug the heavy outlay in pumping appliances ; and as the adjoining company, tho Corn wall, aro proceeding to oroct reducing plant, you could, oo doubt, arrange for trial crushings previous 1 to erecting a plant of yonr own. You can obtain a 1 good site for machlnory, worked by water power, on a permanently running creek immediately adjoining your western boundary. .

J. 3. TAYLOR, Acting Secretary. Calcutta Tea Association, 26 King-street, Melbourne, and 28 Charlotte-place, Sydney. THE CALCUTTA TEA ASSOCIATION Has been. formed for the purpose of offering to the Merchants, Grocers and Consumers, PURE INDIAN TEAS, chosen for us by tho CALCUTTA TEA SYN DICATE, and Guaranteed Free from nil Mixture of Chinese Tea, as shown by the following letter, from Messrs. James Uenty and Co., a Firm of the Highest Bunding, and agents for the CalcuttaTe Syndicate:— Little Collins-street West, Melbourne, 19th August, 1881. To the SECRETARY of the CALCUTTA TEA ASSO CIATION, 2d King-street, Melbourne. ' At your request we have Inspected your largo stock of teas, ami fouod same all PU ilE INDIAN TEAS, se lected in India by the CalcutuTca Syndicate.— Youre, 4c., J AS. HKNTY and Co. p.S,— We have also transferred to yon the stock and solo agcucy of " Sibthorp's " Jndiiin teas, as sup- plied to visitors during the wholoof the International Exhibition. . If stronger evidence bo wanted wo can supply Read tbo following— there can be no stronger testi mony adduced of the unrivalled superiority of our Indian Teas over all other competitors. Messrs. New- bery and Dunn, tho Government analytical chemists, report as follows 31st August, 1881. Report on tbree samples of Indian Tea received .from the CALCUTTA TEA ASSOCIATION. The above samples have been carefully exstmued by us. ' They are ABSOLUTELY PURE, and we may add that even tho lowestquallty of your Tea has a higher extract Mian any Packet Teas wo have examined. J. COSMO NbWBERY. FREDERICK DUNN. It will thus bo seen that the highest and beat autho rity procurable announces even our lowest priced Teas at 2a fid. per pound to bo superior In purity anu analvsis to any of those .abovciucntloncd Jleas at Js. fid: per pound. 'Further comment Is euporfluous. Tho Teas of the Calcutta Toa Association' are Hie produce of upwards of fllty of the most celebrated In dian Tea estates, which, ldendtd together, make tbe most perfect Tea the world can produce. They are blended by competent tea tasters, assisted by analyti cal chemists of the highest staudjug.

This Company has been formed to acquire and work tbree sections, containing 240 acres, uearNornmnvlllo, e-street on the shores of St. Vincent's Gulf, South Australia. Cutlery Tbe mine is within seven hours' drive of Adelaide on a splendid road. The sc:tions will be held under Co.. mineral leases for 99 years, at tlio nominal £4 etch per aonnm. The mine Is situated on the im\ beach, where the cliff rises about 260 feeL By a falling rURAL away of the rock, two reefs are exposed to view from tho top to the bottom of the c.'iff, drawing together as thoy descend, averaging from 3 feet to 3 feet 6 inches In ers. thickness, and visible on the upper surface for over a ie» and 'quarter of a mile. Vessels could load in deep water close up to the mine. It is estimated that the cost of mining, dressing, freight, wharfage, cartage aud smelting at Melbourne Style, would not exceed £7 per ton of lead. At the present prico of leal In the Melbourne market, viz., £18 per ton, (bis would leave a murgin for profit -of £11 per eg ton. As the mine can bo worked from four different J Cook- points at once by tunnelling, the output could bs made very large, iriety Two ' processes aro proposed for preparing the ore &c.; for smelting; one by crushing the matrix (which is id Re- a soft carbonate of ilmo or marble) in a atonu crusher nprove- and rollers, ami dressing by Hunt's Ore Separator ; tbe cost of plant to crush and dress in thi9 manner is estimated at £869. By another process, the matrix, ra. after picking tbe largest lumps of g.xlena therefrom, ted and fr calcined in au ordinary Ilmo kiln, slacking and washing away the lime in a puddling machine and Hlok'f, alnicubox, thus saving the balance of tho galena and all the catbonates, which are very rich in silver. Two Carpen- of these kitns arc estimated to calcine 400 tons per week, and would co3t about £260 each. Tbe absence id Farm of refractory substances in this matrix renders tbe process practicable. With the first process, and a small additional outlay for griuding machinery, tho matrix, when tho ores are extracted, could be con- pement. verted into tho very best description of building cement, for which there is an unlimited market iu zabetb- Australia. The simple and cheap process recently Introduced is-street or separating the silver from the lead, aud. known us " Patterson's process," greatly enhances the value Izabeth- of this mine, as all over 3 ounces of silver to the ton of lead Is a clear profit when treated in tills way. Rooms: Having regard to the very high precentages of lead und silver, which bavo been obtained from the undressed anu promiscuously gatlicrcd ores, this promises to be a permanent and nrofltablo venture. From the superior quality of the lead exhibited, one ms. finn in Melbourne is. prepared to take from the Com- -cr 23 )&ny; 1000 tons per anuuiu at within 10s. per ton df ved, ex current prices for host English lead, which at present thenope commands £18 to £19 per ton here.

The amalgamated claim will embrace an area ofi about 657 acres, and will bavo a frontage of about on#J mile and a quarter to the Lady Ethel lead and tb# main gutter which is believed to exist in the vnlley of the Broken River, and to be formed by the confluence! of the numerous tributaries that come in from tbo -oast, and will probsbly traverse tbe compaoy'ti ground near its eastern boundary. Tbe richness of the quartz reefs In tbo BenaUa dis trict, so far ns they havo becu worked, is proverbial,- but want of capital, nbseucc of machinery aud inju dicious working generally ha9 Jed to their early abandonment in most cases, usually when tbe water, level ha3 been reached, or a rich shoot of stone ha# been worked out or lo9t through a break in the country. It Is universally true that where reefs of great rich ness exist payable alluvial ground is present likewise, and it Is unlikely that the Bcnalla goMfield will prove an exception to that rule. The alluvial working# hitherto, however, have been confined to the slope# and immediate neighborhood of the reef country; and as a natural consequence the gold obtained has been coarse, natchy and oniy slightly water- worn. The deep ground lias never been thoroughly tested, but there can bo no reasonable doubt that the leads of tbo Bc nalla district, as of all other goldfields, will becom# better defined and more uniformly auriferous as tbey make away from tho ranges and enter tbe settled ciimtry. The claim of tlie New Lady Ethel Company has been thoroughly prospected, and the deep ground. Iiroved. The washdirt obtained from the gutter/ >efore the water came in nnd rendered further opera tions impossible without the aid of machinery, was ex ceptionally rich. The claim is in an advanced condi tion ; the pcruinucut shaft has been sunk to tba water level, and tho machinery Is on the,ground and partly erected. It is estimated that withtn two months of the BenaUa No. Ono Company being incor porated the claim wilt be in full working order and getting gold. The shareholders of tho Now Lady Ethel Company have agreed to sell and dispose of the whole of their right, titlo and interest in the coinpauy's claim, .to gether with the machinery, plant and effects of th# company, t-o the Bcnalla No. One Company, in consider ation of receiving 6000 paid up shares, and the Bcnalla No. One Company taking over and guaranteeing to pay their liabilities, amounting to about five hun dred and flftv pounds (£560). The Bcnalla Estate Company will lense to the BenaUa No. One Company upwardsof five hundred acres of land immediately adjoining the New Lady Ethel Company's claim, in consideration of live per cent, of the gross yields to be obtained by the IJenalla No. Ono Company. Two thousand (2000) paid up shares aro reserved for the purchase of au adjoimng company, but should the purchase not bo completed these sliarc3 will bo sold for the brnefil of the Bcnalla No. One Company.
