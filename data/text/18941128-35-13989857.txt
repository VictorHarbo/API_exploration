FOUR NEW ZEALAND LETTER, j A MINISTERIAL VISITOR TO SYDNEY. FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) WELLINGTON, November 22.. The steamer which conveys this will convey also the Hon W P Reeves, Minister for Education and Labour Mr Reeves a measures have probably met with more controversial discussion than those of any other member of the present Ministry, but no one of them over attracted so universal an attention as the undesirable immigrants Bill of the last session, respecting which your readers were fully informed Now Mr Reeves himself is a remarkably clever young man, well educated, w ell road, and possessing considerable oratorical power as -w ell as literary ability Above all, he is possessed of a mordant wit Yet, with all his sense of humour, he cannot do thojokoof his Immigrants Bill Notwithstand- ing the ridicule which has been heaped upon it, he is still enamoured of his bantling, regards it as " a very good bill, wanting perhaps a little consideration in committee," and proposes to reIntroduce it next year in some form By profession he is a journalist and is also a non practising barrister, but by choice he is a poet, and he has written some very exquisite verse In his salad days his v case was mainly humorous, and dealt caustically and we fully with the foibles of the world political, but now that Ministerial honours have come to him his muse has become serious and reached a higher plane, and the wit and humour formerly expended in more extended efforts are now given vent to in neat epigram or apt phrase Mr Reeves is the hero of compulsory arbitra- tion, of the much discussed and much condemned Masters and Apprentices Bill, of what he is wont to describe as "the host Factory Act in the world," and of a host of " advanced " measures of the type for which New Zealand has become notorious There is the gown of good in many of them, combined with many possibilities of undue restriction area of evil At least, however, he has the courage of his convictions, and I give him thorough credit for an earnestness which a great many of his own party, as well as the majority of his opponents, will not admit it was Mr Reeves who was the object of that extraordinary legislative satire "The Washers and Mauglers Bill," which set the whole country in a roar when its author, Mr Buckland the member for the Manukau, succeeded in getting it introduced into the House, past the Argus eye of the then Speaker, and issued from the Government Pi lating Office It was an exquisite satire on the " ultra advanced " labour legislation of the day, and copies of it are now rare and treasured curiosities But, as an effort of pure humour, it is to-day universally admitted that the Minister's own seriously intended effort regarding " undesirable immigrants" excels the clever parody The humorist u generally most humorous when he intends to be serious One amusing feature of the present Australian jaunt is that it was but a week ago that the Minister for Labour announced that he intended to tour this colony from end to end to explain away miscon "options which he said were held regarding the labour bills of last session including, of course, the "undcsirahloimmurrants " and to rouse the people to a sense of their importance This led to much now spapor "chaff," and the suddenly altered decision will lead to still more Meantime, Mr Reeves's colleagues are spreading themselves over the cattle shows of the land, endeavouring to watch the ears of the enemies and allay the discontent which is growing amongst their supporters As a general principle it would be better if Aus tralasian Ministers would visit adjoining colonies and become acquainted with their methods and experiences more than they do There would be less provincialism then The temperance agitation is likely to enter upon a new phase in consequence of a judgment of the Court of Appeal in what is known as the " Clutha Licensing Case " Clutha is an electoral district in Otago which at the late local option poll declared for prohibition Consequently all the hotels were refused licenses Several of the hotelkeepers determined to apply for whole sale licenses, and claimed to have their applications heard before the chairman of the Licensing Com- mittees stipendiary magistrate instead of before the committee In spite of the protests of the committee, the magistrate granted wholesale licenses to four of the applicants Now there had never been any wholesale licenses in Clutha previously, and the prohibition party were very wroth The magistrate based his decision on the fact that the law allows the magisterial chairman of a committee to grant wholesale licenses without reference to his committee, and that the local option poll did not affect these licenses The voting papers refer to " pub licious," " accommodation," and "bottle licenses The prohibitionists hold that local prohibition, once carried, applied to all licenses, and that section 14 of the Act of last year prevented any increase of "licenses,' unless the population of the place had increased 25 per cent, when one might be issued for each 700 of the increase provided A fresh poll declares in favour of this by a three-fifths majority, and as there were no wholesale licenses in the Clutha, they claimed that to issue one was to effect an illegal increase However, the magistrate stuck to his guns, and a test case was brought in the Supreme Court, when Mr Justice Williams (the ablest law) or on our bench decided against the issue of the licenses The publican party however, went on, to the Court of Appeal, and there last week secured the reversal of the decision of the Supreme Court, and the upholding of the magistrate's action. The decision was given by Mr Justice Richmond, one of the most able, cul puree!, and caustic men we have yet had on the bench - an exceptionally able man He held that who sale and retail licenses had been treated separately in all legislation upon the subject that the law did not contemplate that wholesale licenses should be affected by the local option poll, and that the magistrate had power to issue these licenses The wholesale licenses affected "large classes of society whose actions in the matter of buying and selling fermented liquors are as yet beyond the control of local majorities " This is a phrase particularly galling to the prohibition party, and we are likely to see as a part of the agitation of next session a movement to expressly include wholesale licenses in the local option poll The increase in the number of deaths from cancer and of cancer cases reported continues to excite considerable comment Rising from 2 69 per 10 000 living persons in New Zealand in 1881, the death-rate from cancer last year was 5 82 per 10 000 living the proportion of sales to fournies being, in 1893, 5 3 and 4 65 respectively to each 10 000 living of either sex, while 10 years ago the proportion was 3 26 males and 3 69 females The latest official figures hero available from England were 6 92 per 10 000 living in 1891, as against 5 20 in 1881 Ourrateof increase is therefore much greater than theirs The theory of better diagnosis will not account for the proportion of deaths doubling itself in New Zealand in 1-' years During each of the two last months there were 15 deaths in the colony from cancer A singular commentary, too, upon the Joyporo Hospital figures with, respect to cancer among; vegetarians (out of 102 major operations for the disease at that hospital 61 were on strict vegetarians and 11 on meat eaters) is the story told the other day in . the Blenheim (South Island Police Court by Tcmpealay, a Government stock inspector Before his appointment as inspector to the Westland district there was an average of H cases of cancer in the three chief hospitals of the West Coast During his term of office he ruthlessly destroyed every beast which came under his notice by possessing the slightest trace of disease, and when he left, a few months ago there was not a. single case of cancer in any of these hospitals though the general cases for the colony had largely in creased in the interim There is likely to be before very long a " boom " in the New Zealand timber trabe, and an outlet found for what is now waste material All over the North Island hundreds of thousands of feet of splendid timber are destroyed yearly under the settlement conditions of the country simply felled and burnt and got rid of in the speediest way possible We have thus destroyed annually enormous quantities of the most beautiful furniture woods of the world, and equally large quantities of woods which would be of great value in wood-paving, of which there is practi- cally none in this country. The rise of wood paving in Europe has caused an extraordinary demand, which threatens speedily to exhaust the present sources of supply chiefly Baltic pine, with much "Jarrahdale" jarrah The first is now running out, and so great is the run on the 'matter that our Agent General has just cabled out that no order can be fulfilled before February, while the price is up to 27s 6d per 100 ft (Gin ) But it is in regard to blocks for wood-paving that the greatest benefit promises to arise So much attention have Mr Froyberg's Mocks of rims, red birch, and silver pine attracted that the Danish Government has sent an expert over to London to see them, who has returned and strongly recommended their adoption And now, the sawmillers of the colony are being engaged to at once send home largo trial shipments through the Government to supply and test the at present empty market, and this it is expected will be done.
