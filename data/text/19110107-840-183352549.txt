JOHN M'COTTER, Returming-offlcer.- Shire Offioe, Roeklea, 6th January, 1911. g, lection notice, .. town of Ithaca's to the ratepayers of, no,- 3 ward. LADIES and GENTLEMEN, -My time having expired as one of your representa- lives on the Council, I take this oppor- tunity of thanking, you for honouring mo with .vour confidence and trust in the pasy and intimating that I intend to seek Re-election at your hands, in tho hope that you think my services havo been such as to warrant you in again choosing m.e as ono of your representa tives to serve youi interests. In the event of your doing so I will do my utmost to do what has always been my endeavour— to serve you faithfully. During the municipal year just ending, I have had the honour of being in the chair, and have thus come into touch .with tho needs of the whole town as well as tho No. 2 ward. I feel sure what we need just now is a progressive policy our town Is becoming more popular as a place to live in , medical men arc sing ing the praises of Ithaca ; and as citi zens we must rise to the occasion. We need "better streets, more effective drain age", and greater transit facilities. A policy -which embraces these and other progressive measures will receive my hearty support whether in or out of the Council. If returned, I shall stu'dv the pockets of the ratepayers by closely watching the finances, but at tho same timo I believe that economy cannot be obtained at the expense of efficiency. This has been exemplified ins several ways during tho year just ended. I am, &c.;, Your obedient servant, jas. b. luggrf DEVELOPING MANiXL'AND.— An extonsivo scheme is being con sidered for the reclamation of thousands of acres of waste lands in the Isle of Man, chiefly in the northern districts, for creating small holdings for the culti vation of garden and other produco for export to the English markets.
