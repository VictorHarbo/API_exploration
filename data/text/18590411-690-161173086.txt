W. Delaney,nn attempting the passage coming out of the above island, went ashore on the south ret f, the wind suddenly fell calm, a .heavy . swell setting in, together with the flood tide against her ; let go both anchors, but tney did not hold her, and she became a total * wreck. Tfae captain and first anduecond officers are as passengers in. the Gralia, The Maria was owned by Captain Smith, and is believed to be insured. The Claremont left Glasgow on the 1st December, but had to anchor again at Lamlash, as it was blowing a heavy gale. On the 6th she again got underway with the wind at north, but in the afternoon it chopped round to south and blew hard. Captain Burgoyne went oni by the North Channel, but the following dey heavy gales from S.S. W. compelled him to bear up again, having lost his foretopsail. On the 7th and 8th the gale still continued, and finding it impossible to reach Lamlash, 'he came to at the Isla Sound. The succeeding day the ship dragged her anchor with 75 fathom chain tor eix miles, when she was brought up with the second anchor. It was afterwards discovered that the stock and one flue had been carried away. On the 10th the vessel again began driving, and a third bower anchor was let go, but the stock and flue of the best bower giving way soon after Captain Burgoyne wa« compelled to get to pea under close reefed canvas. On the 21et a hurricane was experienced of 10 hours' duration, the ship under bare poles ; on the 25th Arras Island ; bore E. by S., distant 15 miles from whence he took his departure with a NtW. gale ; after leaving the S.E. trades heavy gales from the S.E. prevailed, during which carried away thejibboom; altogether the weather throughout the passage has been very bad. The following ships have been spoken— December 30, Charlotte and Ann, from London to Hobart Town, latitude 89*5 N., longitude 16-15 W. ; January 21, Reliance, Irom London to Port Natal, latitude 1-4 N., longitude 20 W. : January 29, French ship, steering S., with SB in foretopsail ; February 6, Nepintha, from Havre to Singapore, latitude 32-26 S , longitude 31'28 W. The Yarra Yarra (s.) bringsup 394 bales wool, 20 bundles skint, * 80 hides, 3d casks tallow, and sundry cases fruit. The Melanie brings up 50 tons soul, 300 hides, 120 bales wool, and (UBdries. The Gratia is originally from the Nav'gators'Is'andB, January 26, called at WaUis Island February IS, Tutuma, February 16, and is last from the Feegces, 12th March; on the passage James Baling, one of the hands, died from dysentery. Th£ Lady Dkmson.— TWf fine clipper-brig returned from her maiden voyage on the 3rd instant, and the remlr has proved her to be in every way a ci edit to her builder. She sailed from j Sydney on the evening of the 5th Mavch, and made New Zealand on the fifth day out, arrivicg in Wellington on 1 3th. Sbe Bailed again on the evening of the 24th, and made Wollongong on the . 1st instant. The voyage has thus been accomplished in thirty days. Camain Bell speaks of her in trie highest terms as an excellent sea boat and fast sailer; her log showing a speed of twelve knots for several consecutive honrs. S.W. to N.W. winds have bpen experienced the greater part of the passage, and for thirty-six hours the vespel was becalmed. The BiHiton reports the Dutch ship Koophandle as loading at Manila for Sydney. The Vulture, brig, has been disposed of by Mr. Cuthbert to the French mission. The aubtbalaj-ian and European.— Instructions were re ceived by the last mail to discharge all the claims on these two steamers, and they will, therefore, be despatched for England as early as possible. . The Weixington, feom Southampton.— This vessel, which, arrived irv Port Jackson with emigrants, on Friday last, left Southampton on the 30th of November- not the 3rd, ap, stated in our issue of Saturday. Tbe Canaan, from London, was detained in the Channel for 15 days with strong westerly gales. The General Windham cleared the Channel on the 15th i December, and experienced heavy S.W. and N.S. W. gales up to | the 25th. which delayed her passage considerably. She brings no { report of importance. Tbe Nimroud, Capiain Henry Tillman, sailed from Plymouth December 27th, with Government emigrants. She embarked 316 I on December 13th and 14th, and tbe remaining 23 on Dscember 20th, and was then detained until the 27tb by hard westerly gales, with much rain; she had heavy S.S.E galeB off Madeira. j February 17th, latitude 39* 8. longitude 6- W., a heavy gale from ) S.S.E. to S S.W, barometer 29 28 ; at3 a.m., while close reefinp the maiBtopsail, Henry Stroud, ordinary seaman, fell from the yard 1 overboard, and was drowned. March 13th. latitude 46' S., longi- ] tude 81* E., experienced a hurrictme from N. E. to N. W., barometer A 38*55, blowing the sails from the yards, and damaging the spars ; 1 several heavy seas broke on board, and flooded the lower deck. j March 17th, latitude 48- S. longitude 94- E., a W.8.W. to W.N.W. wind, of hurricane violence; barometer 28'54 ; run under j two close reefed topsails on the cap, with the sheets * ] well off. Shipped mnch water on account of the N.W. cross swell; ? j March 28th, heavy gale at west, ship running under two close j reefed topsails ; a fearful sea ; barometer 28-86 ; obliged to go [ south of Tasmania ; I never experienced such a continuation of j heavy ga'es and wet weather before. 31st, Charles Smith, A. B., I missed, supposed to have jumped overboard in a fit of insanity, j Tbe number of immigrants at present on board are 369, claBsifi. d as I follows, 153 married couples, 66 single men. 84 single women, and ' I 89 children, under the superintendence of Dr. Jelly. There have I been six deaths and five births on tbe passage. j The Waratah (s.), arrived on 7th instant at 8-30 p.m. from Wide 1 Bay, bringing up 207 hales wool, 6' hides, 4 ba.es Bkine, 10 casks. i tallow, and sundries. The Emily Hort, from Rockhampton, was I in company, and would leave the same day. The Yam. Yarra I (s.), was passed at 1 a.m. yesterday off the Manning. Experi- I enced northerly winds until off tbe Richmond, thence moderate | southerly winds and fine weather. Whilst laying at anchor inrfde I the Bar, a copper ball was obtained from the blacks, which was I marked BO over broad arrow, it is apparently a pqrti n of the I lifebuoy of a man-of-war ; also a portion of cabin fittings veneered 1 with mahogany, afterwards painted white and gilt panels, with a 1 flower in centre. A quantity of pine timber was also thrown on J the beach and floating about the harbour. Several pieceB of -wreck 1 were passed off to the south of Double Island Point, it appeared to I have been but a short time in tbe water. Should it nave been a 1 portion of the wreck of the Defender it can probably be identified 1 by the officers of that shfp in Sydney, and can be seen on applioa- I tion to Captain Mann, at tbe A. S. N Co.'s Wharf. J The Emigration Commissioners have chartered the Glentanner, to sail for Moreton Bay with emigrants at £14 9s. 8d.; and the James Jardine, to sail from Birkenhead for Adelaide, at £14 13s. 11d.
