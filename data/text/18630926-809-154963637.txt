MR AND MRS KEAN AT THE PRINCESS'S. The brief fortnight is over, and Mr and Mrs C. ICean have terminated their farewell engagement at ^ the Princess's, not to re-appear in London till they have returned from tho Australian colonies. In tho short time of their sojonrn among us, how much has been done! 'Hamlet,' 'Othello,' 'Tho Mer chant of Venice,' which aro three of the principal - plays bequeathed to us by Shakspeare ; the portion of ' Henry the Eighth ' in wliich tho genius of our _ great tragedian is most prominently shown ; ' Louis XI,' naturalised upon our stage by Mr Kean's excel- C lent acting : and Coleman's pleasant comedy of ' Th'o Jealous Wife,' represented with such exuberant humor that it is almost impossible to identify poor Mr Oakley p and his tyrannical spouse with tho Danish princo ti and his consoience-stricken mother. These pieces, u wo say, represent no small amount of mental or ti physical labor to be performed within eleven days. I Every one of the principal characters severally put forward on the list belongs to tho highest depart- d ment of art. Mr and Mrs Kean have left us amid acclamations and hearty wishes of snccess in a new I and untried region, fairly earned by4many years' a toil endured in the best of causes, tho maintenance of tho national drama ; and their admirable per formance during tho last engagement at the tl Princess's, newly impressing so many vivid images p on our minds, renders ius more painfully aware of a; the magnitude of our lose.
