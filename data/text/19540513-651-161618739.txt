Danes Are j Keen To Come Here SYDNEY: Australia could get between 1000 and 2000 Danish migrants a year, according to immigration Department Chief T. H. E. Heves. Mr. Heyes returned by BOAC Constellation after a six weeks' migrant sur very in Europe. Although the Danish Government did not finan cially assist emigrants, it looked upon Australia as the place it would like its people to go if they did migrate, he said. 'The Danes have a high birthrate, and anticipate this will eventually pose a population problem,' Mr. Heyes said. Of particular interest to Australia was the fact that Danish dairy farmers were probably the best in the world.
