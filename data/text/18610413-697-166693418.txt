The Gazelle left Kew Caledonia on the 27th ultimo, and shortly afterclearing the land encountered a very bean- gale from the southward, followed by strong breezes from the N. K. She sighted a vessel 150 miles from Port de France on the 39th, supposed to be the French war steamer Coutlagon, from this port 2tth ultimo. Captain Stafford also reports that the French Government schooner Calidoniennc had been despatched to Lefoo tor the purpose of re gaining from flie natives a quantity of property, taken by them from the schooner Ariel, belonging to Mr. Caphom, which had been wrecked there. Information bad, however, reached the mis sionaries at Port de France that the Calidoniennc had been taken possession of by the natives, in consequence of which, together with the fact that she bad been absent three weeks, the French war steamer Gazelle left for Lefoo on the 2Gtb ultimo to ascertain the particulars. The authorities at New Caledonia were, however, under Uie impression that she had probably been disausted, it being known that her mainmast was badly 6pruug, and to replace which a nnc spar has been sent down by tJioGoutlaVon.
