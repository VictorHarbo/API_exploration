' TRANSFER OF HOTEL LICENSE APPLICANT'S NATIONALTY A BAR. PREMAYDENA JUSTICES' DECISION. At Preymadena on Monday before the Warden (Mi G ], Clarke) and Messrs John Paul J 1 Blackwood and T.F. Locke Js P An application was made by J D Danker for the transfer of the license of the Tasman Villa Hotel at Carnarvon from H F W Frerk to himself. Mr Fullerton appeared for Mr Danker and Inspector Carr opposed the application on behalf of the police on the ground that as Danker was a naturalised German, his holding the hotel license would be likely to lead lo disturbances. Mr Fullerton said Danker had been born at Kiel while it was Danish territory. It was afterwards annexed by Germany. Danker afterwards came out here as an immigrant under the assist ance of the Tasmanian Government and had lived here as a good subject since. He was naturalised some years ago and now had all the rights ind privileges of a British subject The Bench with the exception of Mr J.T. Blackwood were of opinion that it would be too great a risk of public dis order to transfer the hotel license to a naturalised German. The Bench had no objection against the applicant personally. lhe application for the transfer was refused. Mr Fullerton then applied for a justices permit for Violet Adelaide Webb to sell liquor until fourteen days after the next justices licensing meeting. The Bench granted the permit.
