The victim is a girl 10 years of age, named Margaret Nolan, the daughter of a well-to-do farmer, living about a mile and a half out of the village. The girl was sent in to the township with butter at 3 o'clock on Satur- day, and then went further on to what is termed the old township over the river. From this place she was seen returning, and as she was passing up the road going in the direction of her home at about 4 o'clock, she was walking beside a man on horseback, who has been identified as James Morgan, a farmer at Lake Warrnambool. At 8 o'clock in the evening, finding that the girl had not re- turned, her patents became uneasy,and the alarm being given, the whole township turned out in a search, which was kept up all night. At 1 o'clock on Sunday morning the party, headed by the father of the child, dis- covered her dead body lying amongst some tall ferns about half a mile from the town- ship. It was lying on its back with the arms extended, the clothes disarranged, and a fear- ful wound in the neck. ln her left hand the child grasped some ferns, and all around her were evidences of a desperate struggle. Morgan has been arrested, and the black trackers have been sent for to follow up im- portant traces which have been found.

Mr. Higinbotham said that for the first time since he delivered his lecture in the Scots Church out of which Mr. Strong's last difficulty had arisen he felt at liberty to venture an explanation upon one or two points upon which his meaning had been misapprehended. He accepted the full responsibility of the treat- ment of the subject of the lecture, and absolved Mr Strong from any con- nexion with his views. Referring to Mr. Strong's approaching departure his Honour said that the loss to the colony was embittered by the fact that an insignificant ecclesiastical minority had been able to drive from us a gentleman who had endeared him- self to all thinking men. Mr. Francis spoke in warm terms of Mr. Strong's worth and presented him with an address from members of the Church of England. Other addresses were then presented from the Scots Church congregation, the Con- valescent Aid Society of the church, the District Association, the Literary Associa- tion, the Elsternwick Presbyterian Church, and residents of Geelong and then Mr T. Baillie, the senior elder of the Scots Church, handed Mr. Strong the cheque for £3,000 Mr. Strong who was received with long- continued demonstrations of favour spoke at some length. He alluded to the difficulties which a preacher who desired to speak frankly experienced in these days and went on to say that he hoped the rancour which had arisen around him would die away when he had gone. At the same time he desired that the congregation should fight to the last to be free and to overcome ecclesiastical tyranny, which was the deadliest enemy to religion. There was quite a demonstration at Mr. Strong's departure in the Salazie. Hosts of friends crowded to bid him farewell. Besides all the prominent numbers of his congrega- tion and numerous representatives of the different societies in connexion with the church, there were many leading citizens of other denominations present. Mr. Strong arrived in Victoria to take charge of the Scots Church in August 1875. Under his ministry the church prospered greatly, the congregation increasing not only in numbers but also in influence and in religious activity. While the poor were won on the one hand, the lenders of thought were attracted on the other ; and the breadth of view, the tolerance, and the fearless claims for liberty appealed with power to his hearers. But it was not long before divines of an older school began to regard Mr. Strong with ill-favour, and exception was taken to some of his writings in the Presbyterian Review—particularly an article on Lessing, —and subsequently an essay on the Atone- ment was referred to a committee of the Pres- bytery, who reported that the phraseology was vague and that the essential element of "the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ" seemed to have been omitted Mr. Strong's congregation as a practical proof of their sympathy and confidence resolved to increase his stipend by £200 per annum, but the rev. gentleman declined to accept the offer. He tendered his resignation on July 28, explaining that his relations with his brethren were strained, that he was excluded by them from the general work of the church and could not conscientiously invite any young man of liberal views to come out as associate minister. Ultimately he was induced by his congregation to take six months leave of absence in order that he might visit Scot- land. On his return a conflict with the Mel- bourne Presbytery speedily occurred which terminated in the manner described above. AGRICULTURE.
