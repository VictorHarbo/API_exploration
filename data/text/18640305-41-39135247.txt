King and Co.'s yard on Wednesday, . and as a specimen of boat-building she is a credit to them, and her great length (41 feet) is calculated to give her supremacy over any other craft of a similar character in the colony. She is built to the order of Mrs. Manson (the widow of the late con tractor), on whose behalf an appeal was made to the public some time back; and it is gratifying to notice it had the effect of producing- such a result as to enable her to procure a boat not surpassed in the colony for the purpose for which it is intended. During the heavy gale on Monday last, the brig Welcome drove ashore, and the tide being at the time about fire feet higher than ordinary, she stands almost dry at low water. The Alexandra, schooner, drifted ashore at about the same time, and owing to the continued severity of the weather has not yet been got off, Early this morning, the wind having moderated, she commenced lightering; and hoisted a signal for a steamer; but the tug not showing up, and the gale having commenced afresh with renewed vigour, she is now worse off than ever, as the seas make a clear breach over her, and will probably drive her farther and farther up the bank. The brig Eleonore is dragging slightly, af-d unless the wind abates, will probably be added to the list of vessels stranded by this gale.— Southland Ntics, Otago, February t». ♦ Important Decision*.— The following report of a case recently tried before the Supreme Court of New South Wales will be interesting to our mer cantile readers :— ' Molison and Another v. Loutitt. —The trial of this case was resumed and concluded. This was an action by Messrs. MolUon & Black, as endorsees of a consignment of hay from Ade laide, against the mxster of the ship Sea Star, for non-delivery of the same in pood order, &c;, to the consignee or his order, according to the bill of lading. The material issues were these, raised upon two of the defendant's pleas --The first of these pleas was that, according to tiie custom of the Port of Sydney, ships from Adelaide, after the lapse of a reasonable time, lauded any residue of cargo at reasonable hour* at the wharf where the other goods brought by them had lieen landed, so that the same might be ready for removal by the consignees: and that defendant had done this. The other plea was. the cargo of this ship was landed at the Circular ' Juay; that the defendant was ready to deliver the hay within a reasonable time, of which plaintiffs had notice; that plaintiffs, not having been ready to accept delivery within a reasonable time, the bay hail been unshipped; that it was landed on the quay in good order and con dition ; and that it had been carried away by some person to the defendant unknown. There were also pleas of the general issue (which was given up) and of actual delivery. Mr. Butler appeared for the plaintitls, and Mr. Isaacs for the defendant. There was no question but that the hay ha lieen landed, and that in good condition. Hut eight bales had been lost, and the contest was whether this was, in law and in fact, the result of the plaintiffs' laches or of the defendant's negli gence; and which of the two was responsible for the value of the hay thus last. The amount at issue to* small— only £19— but the question was one of principle— as to the relative obligations of shipowners and consignees in reference to the landing of goods. The defendant had landed the cargo of nis ship with extraordinary speed, working extra limits and piling up the goods on the wharf as they were unloaded, for the con signees to take them away as they could. There \- was contradictory evidence as to the amount of confusion consequent upon this course of pro ceeding, hut as to the gcods having been landed with extraordinary speed, became the defendant wanted to get away again, there could be no doubt. According to the plaintiffs they hail had ilraymen in attendance, anil would hare taken de livery, as they were most anxious to do, if the hav could have been got, but from the way in which the goods were thrust upon the wharf and inter mingled, they could not get at it, and ere they coul* lo so eight bales were missing. According to dtiendant, delivery might, with a due amount i if energy, have been secured His Honor told the Jury that a consignee was bound ,to take notice of the arrival of a ship with his goods, and te be ready to accept deliveryat a reasonable time and in a reasonable way. The contract here being to deliver 'at the wharf.' a delivery at the Circular Quay would suffice, if properly made. But there must be a practical delivery— such a delivery on this wharf within reasonable hours as would enable the consiunees to come and take away their goods without impediment; not a mere piling up of goods on the wharf in such a manner as to render theirprompt selection orremoval impossible. It was for the Jury to say, as a matter of fact, whether there had or had not been a practical delivery here. The Jury, after a few minutes' con sideration, found a verdict for plaintiffs for the amount claimed. £19. His Honor granted a certi ficate for costs, considering this case, owing to the importance of the mercantile question involved, to be a very proper one for trial in that Court.' VESSELS IN HARBOUR.
