AVOID AUSTRALIA." ' Three months ago the Swedish Consul*. General for Australia, stationed at SjfJney ; (Count Morner), communicated with the Stockholm Government warning to emi grants. against proceeding to Australasia, on account of the difficulties of securing ; employment and the higher cost of Buste i nance. The advice was published in . the ! Scandinavian newspapers, and, following it ' up, the. Danish Ministry also issued a np I tice of dissuasion couched in similar terms.. I The warning met with denials in Aus ' tralia, and the Continental authorities con I cerned were communicated with. The Da I nish Minister for. Foreign Affairs (Dr. Scliavenius) has now made an explanation ; to the Agent-General for New South Wa'es I (Mr. T. A. Ooghlan, I.g.O.). He states 1 that the warning against immigration to ; Sydney had been made on what had been i considered sufficient authority. The I Danish Consuls throughout the Common: wealth had been instructed, however, to rfe j port upon the"*subjcct, and if the "state ] ments were found untrue or exaggerated the Danish Foreign Office would issue -tl^ , necessary correction.
