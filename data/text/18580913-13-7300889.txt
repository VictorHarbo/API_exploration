COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. -. The Argus Office, Saturday Evening, in the gold market this week there has been but little doing either in shipments or in purchases for the mail steamer and other opportunities. The quantity offering in Melbourne has been very small, Of the prices on the gold fields are somewhat higher than those of the Melbourne bullion brokers, which are as follow:- Omeo gold, 63s. to 75s. 6d.; Pleasant Creek and Goulburn, 75s. to 75s, 6d.; Bendigo, Castlemaine, and Jim Crow, 763. 6d to 6s. 6d.; Ararat, Maryborough, Dunolly) Fiery Creek, Avoca, and Amherst, 77s. to 75s. ; the Ovens, 77s. 6d. to 76s. ; Ballaarat, 76s. 6d. to 19s. 6d. These prices are founded on the basis of 74s. per ounce for standard gold. The escorts delivered this week at the Treasury have amounted to 49,760 ounces. This quantity is 2,080 ounces above the average of the year 1867, 7,826 ounces above that of the first quarter of the current year, and 4,469 ounces above that of the second quarter. As compared with the corresponding week of last year, it shows a deficiency of 78 ounces Comparing the separate items, the returns present a healthy appearance. The Sandhurst district is the most regular in its total In the following table, the fortnightly escorts are distinguished by the prefix of an asterisk : Castlemaine Sandhurst .,, Ballaarat ... ,,, 'Avoca .

This, added to the previous shipments, the total being corrected by comparison with the export entries at the Customs, brings the total of the year to 1,710,640 ounces, or 71 tons 9 cwt. 2 qrs. 3 lbs. 4 ozs. troy, the value of which at 3d per ounce amounts to £6,842,660. The local papers give the usual summaries of mining news but. they contain little that calls for remark. The new tracts of land that are being opened up in the Western district, are yielding paying quantities; and the escorts from Pleasant Creek and Ararat are increasing. Ballaarat, Creswick Creek, and the surround- ing tributaries, are still below the average of former seasons. The Maryborough and, Dunolly district 1s again increasing in population. At Maryborough, the over-abundance of water in some of the leads is found difficult to deal with. The claims on Mariners' Quartz Reefs are at a stand still, and the several parties are trying to come to terms as to co-operation in keeping the water under. At Avoca, the established puddlers are doing well. A great deal of labor is now being expended in the construction of races. At New Bendigo there is still an influx of population, but it is estimated that the de- partures equal the arrivals. This district is proved by recent prospectings to be more or less auriferous, but very few paying spots have been hit on- The quartz miners on Kingower are doing better than for some time past. Competition has reduced the price of crushing very considerably, and a larger proportion of the yield of necessity falls into their hands. There is nothing now from the other districts. The number of persons who arrived at the Port of Melbourne during the week just ended was 274, comprising 269 from the neighboring colonies, 11 from the United Kingdom, 1 from Mauritius, and 8 from San Fran- co. The departures are computed at 210, The not addition to the population of the colony, corrected by the official return, as regards the month of July, was 13,342. Arrived. Departed.

Money is still plentiful for advance on mortgage of landed and house property at from 10 to 12 per cent. The rates of discount at the banks are For bills under 95 days' currency, 8 per cent. ; from 95 to 126 days', 6 per cent. ; over 125 days', 10 per cent. and on overdrawn accounts, 10 per cent. There is very little done in commercial paper outside, the banks. Exchange on England remains at former quotations. The selling rates of the bank are 1 per cent, premium for 60 days' sight for: large amounts, and 3 per cent, premium for 30 days' sight for bills under 50, Freight on gold by sailing vessels is taken at from 2yds 3d, per ounce, deliverable in London; Insurance 15 per cent. by the overland route pa cent. that is, 7d. per ounce as nearly as pot Bible-insurance, li to 13 per cent. In the stock and share market a moderate amount of business has been done. Sale have been effected of Victoria Bank Shares at £37; Colonial Bank of Australasia, at a 2e. ; Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company, at £71 ; Melbourne Gas and Coke Company, first and second issue, at 835 p cent, premium, and new issue lit 64 percent premium ; Colonial Insurance Company, i £1 14s. ; Australasian Insurance Company; 12s. 6d. ; Melbourne- Fire Insurance Com pany, 12s. 6d. The two new joint-stock companies recently launched under the; favorable aUspices have not succeeded in securing a favorable introduction of their scrip into the market. The cliffe races which have arisen in the board room: of the National Bank of Australasia will produce a considerable effect on the value of the shareholders' property, if not speedily adjusted The Directors of the Bendigo Waterworks Company have not yet, it appears from an official statement, performed the first day which was looked for at their hands settlement of the claims of the projecto This difficulty was foreseen by Mr J. < Francis, at the first public meeting called Melbourne on the subject. It is manifest,' to the interests of the shareholders that a difficulty should be allowed to smoulder of so long a time in their midst. A company projected for the supply of the Ovens dis tri with water, to be called the Ovens Gold-field Water Company. A deputation from the Provisional Committee, consisting of Mr. Brown, the chairman of the Beechworth M uicipality, and Mr. G. W. Henderson, attend by Mr. Joseph Brady, O.R., had an interview on Friday with the Vice- President of t Board of Land and Works, for the purpose of explaining more fully the nature of the powers which they have ask from the Government, The deputation was promised that the applicant should be granted, provided a reference the local authorities disclosed that it c; tained nothing injurious to public or prive interests. In wool, tallow, and hides there is nothing further to report than that, awaiting arrival of the small, buyers and sailors i alike out of the market. A few small sales tallow, for home use, have been reported from £38 to £40 per ton for beef, and £50 £62 per ton for mutton. The returns of I declared values of goods entered inwards a outwards at the port of Melbourne are a most favorable, when compared with those last year. The value of the exports is excess of that of the imports of the current year by £151,814; while, during the fore period, the balance of imports over expo was £788,620.

Unquestionably, the existing system has nothing to recommend it but custom, and in times of pressure it probably leads to some embarrassments or suspensions, which would otherwise never occur. Among all sound economists the effort is to render their engage- meats from day to day as nearly uniform as possible, and the Government recently metal on this principle when they adjusted the periods for the dividends on the public funds so as to remedy the inconvenience which had been found to arise from the great previous disparity between the amounts payable in July and January as compared with April and October : Sir, Although many of your readers may concur with you in opinion as to the note in your impression of last Friday week, In reference to " the 4th," I be I lieve that none who are practically acquainted with the subject will deny that great inconvenience is caused by the present system, by which nearly the A whole of a particular class of bills is made payable on one day in each month. M the wholesale houses who are accustomed to draw these bills must be prepared beforehand to meet the Go that may be returned dishonored, many are brought at the same time into competition with the ordinary applicants for loans in the money market. The point, however, which your correspondant appears to have overlooked is this-viz, the greater probability of the bills in question being regularly met If their pay month were spread over the month, instead of the acceptors having to provide funds to meet is sir engagements to different parties on the same day.

The heavy rains have deterred. country buyers from operating, and town dealers held back in the belief that the overdue man will bring intelligence of continued excessive shipments having been made. Importers generally have abstained from attempts to force Bales and prices, although in many instances merely nominal, are sustained. The market is almost free from speculation. During the week whatever sales have been effected have been for consumption- an indication that stocks in second hands are low. Should this state of affairs continue, an improved tone of business must soon prevail. The stocks of most staple articles are too heavy to admit of the pro Director augmented prices. (¿?Liquors.-Draught ale has continued in steady demand, and sales of Bass' and Allsopp's No. 3 Burton have been readily effected at 85. 17s 6d. per head. Holders of those sales are asking 6s., but we hear of no sales at that figure. Other brands are in better request than of late, and bring proportionate rates. Draught Stout has rather improved in inquiry, but the consumption is comparatively light, andsalosaro confined to small parcels of most profound brands, In bottled beers a fair amount of business has been done, most favorite bottles' brands bringing from 6s. 6d. to 10s for equal proportions of ale and porter, for good second brands there is improved demand, and considerable sales have been made at from 7s to 8s. per dozen. We quote ale and beer (duty paid): Als: Boss's, had., 81, 15s. to 3!. 17s. 6d. ; Ind, Coope, and Co's, 83. ; other Burton, do,, 6. 10s. to 84. 16s. ; Turnouts, 71. lie. to 71. 15s.; Charrington's or Godiug's, do., ores. to 120s, ; Byass's and Friend's, quarts, dozen, 6s. 6d. to 10s.

In wines there has been very little doing : a few small lots of good quality ports and sherries have changed hands at maintained prices, but the general amount of business in this line has been comparatively of trifling amount. Sales by auction have been made of Cousens' sherries, double diamond, in quarter casks, at 645., and treble diamond at OOf. per butt, duty paid. There; is, however, no change in quotations, which are Burgundy, 30s. to 40s. ; champagne, 25s. to 40s, ; claret, 22s, to 28s. ; port, 25s. to 45s. ; sherry, 23s. to 25s. per dozen. In wood Port from £60 to £85 per pipe ; shortly, £40 to £100 per butt, according to quality, ranging from ordinary to fine sorts. The demand for spirits has been very light, and prices are, from the small ness of transactions, rather nominal than actual. In hulk spirits there has been very little doing, and quotations are wholly unaltered. U. V. Co.'s brandy, in cases, is somewhat scarce, and, being in few hands, 1 Is bringing 18s. per dozen, in bond by auction, Eenessoy's has been sold at 30s, 6d. ; Olozeau's, No. 6, at 50s. 6d. s Olavlez's, at 26s. per dozen and a parcel of Oommandon's dark, in bulk, at from 6s. 6d. to 10s. per gallon.

Flour, Grain, &c.; There has been a steady demand for flour throughout the week, and as the purchase made have been either for consumption or export, the market for this article has assumed a degree of firm 1925 which it has not for come time past exhibited. Considerable sales of Adelaide and Tasmanian sorts have been made to country buyers, and several parcels of the former have been purchased for the Sydney market. Buyers from Geelong and the western goldfields are in the market to-day, which has created some degree of surprise, as it was generally understood that the latter places would require little or DO supplies of this article before next harvest. Prices appear to have become settled since they were disturbed by recent attempts at speculation, and the soaked coins in a more healthy state than it has been for some time past. Adelaide may be quoted at from 181. 10s to 102. 10s. per ton for town brands, paid 18s. for Tasmanian. Stocks of American are light, and none offering, Wheat continues in steady. quest, prlcosrulhigatlrom 7s. 9d.to8s.sd. per bushel. 1 barley continues much depressed-; considerable arrivals have taken place, and in absence of transactions, prices [can [hardly be quoted.

OalB.-Notwiihstandlng the heavy arrivals par JTdxrin Forrest, from San Francisco, and Invincible, ircmLiverpool, this article has fluctuated but little. Prices dropped considerably on Monday and Tuesday, but have revived with the Improved demand. The arrival of the Caroline, Vaquero, and Benjamin Deane, from San Francisco, with large shipments of oats on' board, Is daily looked for, but holders seem firm in the belief that consumption being brisk, no further material decline will take place, Scotch cannot be purchased under 8s. ; Californian Taring Os, and colonial, Os. 3d. to 6s. 9d. By auction about 8,100 bushels have been disposed of. Californian at from 6s 9d. to 6s. 2d., and Scotch at 6s. 2d. per bushel; the purcell were, however, doled out in small lots, which accounts for the extreme rates obtained. Mars is in tolerable, demand only, and brings from 5s. to 6s. 3d. per bushel. Grain continues somewhat neglected, the low prices of other descriptions of hops) were diverting attention from this article. Groceries In teas and coffees there are no changes to report ; demand for both these sort acres continued Port steady. Btcol'o are chiefly in few hands, and Prices are consequently well sustained and unlikely to undergo any alteration of moment. The suffer mat to It appears in a sickly condition, and although i of much has been doing, the few parcels brought forward during the week have been disposed of at rates showing an evident downward tendency, which has been confirmed by a forced sale by auction of a portion of the cargo per Africaine, from Mauritius, i to-day, and of which, notwithstanding its being [advertised for sale without reserve, and the un- (usual day for holding sales of this descrip Mon, about 2,000 bags only were disposed of. Low bright, but strong to very good yellow, brought from 376. to 411,16), ; low white crystals sold at 48. 10s, and fine white crystals at 82. 10s. per ton. A parcel of No. 1 Cossipore sugar was also disposed of at 68. 10s. per ton. several other cargoes are daily expected from Nautilus and although the last a J vices from there state that the prices of the new crop had opened at advanced rates, no corresponding au varies appears likely to ensue here. Elco has been in rather Improved request; and as reports from Sydney indicate a probability of a demand for that market, holders are tolerably firm. The arrivals of the past month, however, amount to 1,100 tons, and as yet nothing over 221, per ton is procurable for Patna.
