New Settlers. Melbourne, Monday. Two Danish immigrants who have set tled on land at Kamarooka, have written to Mr. Hansen, of Melbourne, who was instrumental in inducing them to emi grate to Victoria, to the effect that they were doing splendidly in their new homes. They stated that they had never had such good day3 before, and already were commencing to harrow the fields, which was much easier work than they antici pated. They were well pleased with the country generally. They also wanted to know how much they owed to the Govern ment, as it was their.' intention to pay oft their debt. The officials of the Lands department wore greatly ploised when shown the letter by Mr. Hansen, and pointed out that such letters would do a great deal of good in otiiei* countries, as they bore out the statements made on behalf of the Government.
