Danish husband says wife stowed away in his cabin SYDNEY, Tues. â€” A Danish family stayed aboard the liner Castel Felice when she berthed at Circular Quay today because the wife was a stowaway. Ip Thomsen, a glazier from Copenhagen, is migrating to Auckland with his son James, aged 8. He said the arrangement was made that his wife, Inga, would follow after he was established In New Zealand, but four days out of Genoa, where the voy- age began, Mrs Thomsen was found. "She had stowed away in my cabin nnd I did not see her," Thomsen said today, smiling. When they reached Aus- tralia the Immigration authorities allowed father and son to land, but stopped Mrs Thomsen. All had transit visas and the fares to New Zea- land of father and son had been paid. But Mrs Thomson's had not and they had no money. The regulations prevented her from landing in Aus- tralia because of the possi- bility that she might be a charge on the State. Later officials of the Danish Consulate inter- viewed her and gave the necessary guarantees. She was then allowed to land.
