" De Monthan Village, Swdnoge, Dorset, "6th March, 1681 ' I hare long felt that I owe you an acknowledge ment and many grateful thanks' for the benefit conferred upon my wife nnd daughter through the uta of tee Blood Mixture, A swelling In icy daughter's neck, so vory' rrsrihftl that wo scarcely noticed it coming, ut lengtn became so largo and . unoomfortabls that medical advice was callad in. The child was then at a critical age, and the doctor thought, thut when the change beeoino settled tlio ncc would get well under . trcaimcat. binding little improvement, wc called in a puyslclan, wiio, at once agreed with tho other doctor that Jt was a case of Goitre, needing great care and greater patience. He recommended an Immediate chaugo to the seaside, and certain : treatment, all of which was perscvcrlngly tried, but without success. On the return home of my daughter wo had another medical attendant, who endorsed tiio previous verdict— le., that tho disease was Goitre. As, howovcr, lio did \- not effect Improvement, my wife mentioned to him Clarke's Blood Mixture, and after ex amining a bottle ho assented to its being tried. 1 can only most thaukfully say that (under God) it was tlie means sf effecting a perfect enre, and that there is not the slightest sign cf swelling or anything' to remind us, of tho disease. Wo used about eqrntl to two lis. cases. Theu my wife had a sovere attack of rheumatism (so tho doctor ealled it) at tho hip joint. She was confined to bed fer somo time, and every kind of outward application kept at the Military hospital, besides other remedies, were tried in vain. 1 cannot but look upon It as wonderful that n few bottles, ccf- taioly net more than four— I think only three— completely removed every sign of the affection, and there has been no reiurn. t feel sure that it will bo aSefut in an omiucnt degree to make knomi tho efficacy of your medicine in Goitre, and also in the ether cases, where, in both instances, the usual mediiial treatment had completely failed.
