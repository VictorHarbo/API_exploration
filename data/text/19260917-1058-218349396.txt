COUNTRY SHOWS I GYMPIE . OFFICIAL OPENING INTEREST IN THE RING (From Our - Special Representative.) .GYMPIE, ThursJny. — Although a few light showers fell at intervals during the afternoon, the concluding day of the 45tli annual show of the Gympic A., P." nnd Mining Association was well attended. The estimated attendance was approximately 5000. Chief Interest centred in . the. Ting events, which were of a varied and interesting nature. There was good competition in the hackney classes, the champion award going to Mylcs M'Don- nelJ's bay horse JDonald, a consistent performer at the Wido Bay and Burnett district shows. Mr. F. 3V, M'Gill's Domino was awarded the rcservo ribbon. The harness and pony sines were also well represented, W. T. Wald's Tokio and Archie Bradley's Danish Lass securing the championship ribbons in the class for buggy horse and harness pony, 13 and under 14 hands, respec tively. The, open wood-chop contest was, as usual, a most interesting erent, necessi tating three heats and a final, the latter being won by T. Cox, of Imbll. from R. AV. Kinman, of Traveston Siding. Tho. high jump attracted ' only two entries, J. M. Webster's Try Again win ning after dislodging and becoming jammed across tlic . rails on his first at tempt after the bar hud been raised to Oft Gm. ' The largo crowds which inspected the pQvilion exhibits throughout the day were impressed by the excellence of the farm produce, fruit nnd vegetables dis plays, despite the bad season, ' while another exhibit which attracted h good denl« of attcution- was that of the Forestry Department dealing "with re afforestation work and banana cultiva tion. TIio Forestry Department also dis played a collection of finished articles from polished native woods, >. which called for much admiration. In declaring tho show- open Mr. A. J. Jones, Minister for Mines, apolo gised for tho abscnco of Mr. T. Dun- ston, Minister' for Landsr .who was to havo opcued tho show, and . also for tho district representatives, Messrs. H-, F. .Walker and E. H. C. Clay toil, Ms.L.A. Ho whs surprised .to ' sco such a nice display of produce, friii:, and vegetables, in the face of the very unseasonable conditions prevail ing, which only went to show what a really fertile district the Mary Valley was. It was a pity that' such a dis trict display could ' not be transferred as it stood overseas, as no botter means of advertising the wonderful resources of Queensland or of attract ing the most suitablo class of immi grants . existed. Australia, and par ticularly Queensland, had received an excellent advertisement- through tho holding of the Wembley Exhibition: in London' rec'eptly; and. he hoped .that the tlmo was. not far distant when there would be sufficient development of tho secondary industries' of tho St'ato to . ensure a local market of consumption, without having to spend any ' mora, than .was,, possiblo on one overseas for tho disposal of such pro ducts as buttor, cheese, wool, beef, etc- ' . .
