REVOLUTION IN FIJI. (FROM A CORRESPONDENT.) Levuka, March 10. SINCE my letter of the 29th February we have had considerable political excitement, and last Thursday a collision was imminent. You will see particulars in the papers which I send, as alao the "Manifesto of declaration of free-1 dom." by British Bubjects, which was-the prin-* ciple acted upon. A white man some.months•' ago shot a Fijiaa chief, and a warrant has been; issued by the Fijian Government for his arrest on a charge of murder, and" last Thursday-the arrest was to be put in force. The British subjects said' that the' Government should not arrest the map, but he 'shquld'be dealt ..withby! , the British Government through the Consul, aa* they; would* .not recognise the right of the- Fijian Government"'te deal* with British sub-!: J3cts in any"way until recognition by Great Britain. As soon as the intention of the autho rities- Became known, the signal for the-Volun teers—who are British subjects—to assemble was-made".' by firing three cannon shots, and within about ten minutes seventy-three well armed men had assembled to resist tbe arrest. This is more than one-half of the males capable of bearing arms in Levuka, and the great body of the others are opposed to the Government, and in case of blows would go against them. So that in white force the Government was very weak indeed; but they had a body of about two hundred natives in waiting in the background, in case there should be any violence. But two hundred natives would not make any stand against fifty whites even, and their appearance upon the beach would have been the signal for every hitherto neutral white to turn out against them. You cannot imagine how strong the feeling is against- bringing the two races into collision. ■ Things hung in the balance for • some time. Burt/anxious to retain power, and willing to do so at the cost of scores of' lives even, urged upon his colleagues to arrest the man at all hazards, whilst they were opposed to taking any' step in their weak state to compel by force of arms. It ib pretty certain that if force had been attempted they would have been defeated, and if natives had been brought into the affray the lives of the Ministry would have been held responsible, and they wore to have been " shot: like doga." However, the arrest was not at tempted—-another tacit confession of weakness on the part-of the Government—and thingß quieted down. One good has arisen from this:- Burt has resigned his seat in the Ministry, and. those that remain are honest men. Cakobau met the whites on Saturday morn ing, when he made a threatening speech,'which you will read in the papers, The translation is a very mild one; in Fijian the meaning is.very strong. Natives are being drilled in large num bers; • I fully believe there would-have been a disturbance on Thursday morning only for the fact of there being a German man- of-war here at the time, and the Volunteers had reason to believe-that Bhe would, interfere:: in case of any ' disturbance.■••; But: now that Burt has resigned, there is: some prospect of matters quieting down ;to a certain extent, but the Volunteers are still determined to resist any act of the/Government until recognition by Great Britain. , Surely we shall have a vieit from ah English man-of-war soon.'.- It is a crying disgrace that two thousand British subjects should-be left exposed to the dangers we are now in at Fiji, without"any "help froni' the mother country, . She cannot deny'us assistance on the ground that she;need-not run to the help "of all her wandering - children,-for ■she bas: already, recognised us as worthy, of, and having a right to, her help, by the establishment of a Consulate here. - I*'; ''■.'■'■■'; v-"!.> - ..' .
