ENGLISH. MONEY MARKET AND CITY INTELLIGENCE. (From the Times, April 25 The week preceding the " budget" is usually an anxious one in the city, and it is not less so on this occasion from its being generally looked to as decisive of the fate of the property-tax. Many persons have come to the conclusion that, as the present surplus of revenue is much below the amount produced by that tax, and as the prospects of other branches of revenue do not warrant the expectation of an increase sufficient to make up the difference, Sir Robert Peel will propose its continuance, rather than suffer the finances of the country to fall into the state they presented under the Whigs, of a growing deficiency of income compared with the expenditure. Others, however, and that a large class, are prepared to maintain that when the time shall arrive when all income from that source is at an end, the Government will be very well able to do without it. This is at all events so much more desirable a view of the question than the other, that it becomes well worth while to examine carefully on what basis it rests, for if it can be shown that the Minister, is able to do without it, the abandonment of the tax will necessarily follow. The statement of a correspondent, whose letter (signed "A Constant Reader") appeared in The Times of Monday, and who takes this side in the discussion, has attracted on that account some notice in the city. His calculation, which it is unnecessary to repeat, reduces the deficiency ? which may he expected to exist after the pro perty tax is at an end, to about £1,300,000, in addition, to which it has been remarked that between the 5th of April, 1843, and the 5th of April, 1846, an amount of terminable annuities ^exceeding-£200,000'per annum will certainly fall in, and of course a large further sum will accrue from the lapse of life annuities, to which, t owing to the very high price of the funds, a greatly increased ; amount has annually found way for investment. There would thus remain a deficiency of less than £1,000,000 to be provided for after the property-tax is withdrawn, and it must be manifest that a relief to the country from a direct tax of £5,000,000 must of itself greatly expand the indirect revenue, besides which, as many duties are ad valorem, the existing scale of high prices, if continued, must increase their productiveness. It is of some importance to bear in mind that practically the property-tax act did not come into existence till 1843, for only £313,844 was received in 1842, so that for revenue purposes it will continue to operate till 1846, which gives another year for the development of the national resources from other branches of revenue. A very common notion prevails that this act requires to be repealed to get rid of the tax, but its clauses expressly limit its duration to three years from the 5th of April, 1842, so that the tax will cease on the 6th of April, 1845, as a matter of course, if a new act is not passed to continue it. The silence of Sir R. Peel on the subject, therefore, when he brings forward his budget on Monday next, will set the whole matter at rest. These remarks are to be received as proceeding from a party in the city who are prepared to make all the resistance in their power to the continuance of the property-tax. It will be for the Minister, if he really intends to apply for a new term, to make out his case. Immediately after the budget will follow the announcement of the measures in contemplation on the subject of banking and the currency, so that all classes may be said to be in anxious expectation of what next week may bring forth. Complaints are made by some of the leading brokers of the Stock Exchange, that business is occasionally impeded by the lax attention paid to the ready passing of powers of attorney at the Bank of England. Under the new regulation, which gives the clerks a much longer period than formerly for the necessary examination and signature of these documents, it was at least expected that punctuality would be insured ; but, instead of this being the case, it is stated that they are later than ever. The Bank authorities should look to this. The Consul market has been steady to-day, without remarkable change. The broker for the savings banks took his parcel at 996, and the last quotation for money was 99 to #, and for the account 89. Bank Stock left off 1955 to 1975 ; Exchequer-bills, 74 to 76 premium; India Stock, 289 to 293 ; Three per Cents. Reduced, 99 to 3 ; Three-and-a-half per Cents. Reduced, 1928 to 4 ; Long Annuities, 127-16; New Three-and-a-half per Cents., 100 to 5 and India Bonds, 99 to 93 premium. The foreign securities were much as yesterday, with a tolerable amount of business. The first quotations were-Spanish Five per Cents., 252 to 2 ; the Three per Cents., 368 to J ; Portuguese, 46 to 47; Peruvian, 29 to 30; Mexican, 35s to 3 ; the Deferred, 156 to a ; Dutch Two-and-a-half per Cents., 100 to 5 ; the Five per Cents , 100 to of Danish, 98 to 89 ; Columbian, 15 to a ; Chilian, 102 to 104 ; Buenos Ayres, 34 to 36 ; Brazilian, 80 to 81 and Belgian, 104 to 105. Railway shares are rather firmer, and business improves in this department. In the following quotations, when neither premium nor discount is mentioned, the price is per share: Birmingham and Derby, 60 to 62 The Thirds, 20 to 21 ; the Eighth, 22 to J premium ; Birmingham and Gloucester, 99 to 93 ; the Quarters, 223 to 23 ; Bristol and Exeter, 73 to 74 ; Eastern Counties, 126 to } ; the New Registered, 143 to the Extension, late a premium ; Edinburgh and Glasgow, 66 to 67 ; the Scrip, 166 to 176; Great North of England, 97 to 99 ; Great Western, 36 to 37 premium; the Halves, 219 to 226 premium; the Fifth, 7 to 3 premium ; Hull and Selby, i 50 to 60 ; the Quarters, 34 to } premium ; Brighton, "438 to of the Loan Notes, 114; to a ; Blackwall, 5 to 6 ; Greenwich, 49 to 54 ; the | Preference, 16 to 17; Birmingham Stock, 226 to 236; the New Thirds, 36 to 37 premium ; the New Quarters, 24s to 25s premium; South-Western, 84 to } ; the Eighth, 3 to 4 premium ; Croydon, 175 to J ; the Scrip, 75 to a premium ; Manchester and Leeds, 39 to 41 premium; the New, 166 to 17}premium ; the Quarters, 7 to 2 premium ; Manchester and Birmingham, 55 to do ; Midland Counties, 85 to 90; the Quarters, 21 5- to 229 ; Newcastle and Darlington, 24 to 25 premium; North Midland, 83 to 90 ; the Half-shares, 44 to 45 ; the Thirds, 29 to 30 ; Northern and Eastern, 12 to } premium ; the Scrip, 9s to 10s premium ; the Quarters, 46 to 5 premium ; Paris and Rouen, 37 to 38 ; Rouen and Havre, 8 to } premium ; Paris and Orleans, 376 to } ; South-Eastern and Dover, 359 to 361 ; the Scrip, 5s to 6s premium ; York and North Midland, 117 to 119; the New Shares, 32 to 34 premium ; Scarborough, 166 to 176 premium ; Yarmouth and Norwich, 6 to a premium ; Norwich and Brandon, 5s to } premium and Dublin and Cashel, 25 to a premium. The dates brought by the West India mail are Jamaica, March 23 ; Trinidad, 15th ; Antigua, 19th; St. Vincent's, 21st j Barbadoes, 20th; and Demerara, 19th. At Jamaica the Legislature had terminated its sittings, the Assembly having agreed to memorialize the Queen, setting forth the condition of the colony, and representing that many estates would be thrown upon account of the scarcity of labour, the want of capital, and the unfavor- able state of the weather. The island was in an exceedingly quiet condition, and health was generally good. Agriculture was at a standstill. The transport vessel the Glen Huntley had brought from Sierra Leone 118 immigrants, and 24 Africans who had been to their native land, but returned, preferring the island. The Planters' Bank had declared a dividend of five per cent, upon the half-year ending the 31st of December, and carried £2,000 to the reserve fund. The Demerara papers are much occupied with a legal case respecting the sale of the " Sans Souci" estate plantation, in which the characters of the registrar's assistant is concerned. In fact the doubtful title of landed properties has caused general alarm. The manager of the Colonial Bank had been elected to the Legislature, and had brought forward a motion for a return of all the plantation land sold since the 1st of August, 1838, the date of complete emancipation. Sir- M. M'Turk's plan of constitutional reform had appeared. By this absentees would be deprived of the right of voting, the college of electors would be abolished, and open voting alone would be adopted in the return of members. On Spanish finance a correspondent submits the following notes : " It will appear by the budget of the Spanish Minister for the years 1944-45, that a deficit between the revenue and the expenditure exists to no less an extent than £3,600,000 sterling. " In the above amount of deficit not Is. of the dividend due on 40,000,000 foreign debt is taken into account, independent of other domestic funds of different denominations. " We now come to the immediate amount of Three percent stock, for which great sacrifices, by way of anticipations and usurious rates of interest, have been made to provide for the dividend of the fractional part of the foreign debt-say, on the current amount of 3 per cent., a " Foreign and domestic, per annum... 240,000 " On the contemplated loan of £10,000,000, 3 per cent, negotiated, or to be negotiated, with Signor Salamanca, would require per annum 300,000 " Additional amount of Three per * Cent, stock to be created if the conversion of the 3 per cent, should be carried into effect, would amount to 6,000,000 capital at 3 per cent, per annum. 180,000 " Total amount of dividend on the actual 3 per cent, created and to be created . 720,000 " It results that the Minister of Finance stands in this position-that neither the loan in question nor the conversion of the Active Stock can be carried into effect without the increased issue of bonds of 3 per cent, to the extent of £720,000 per annum, or capital 24,000,000 " These operations will leave in a dead letter the whole of the active debt unprovided for 40,000,000 " Further amount of Foreign Passive Stock .11,174,000 " Total amount of foreign debt to 1844 .76,174,000 " The amount of the domestic debt of Spain of different denominations in 5 and 4 per Cents, and floating debt, Passive and Vales real, in round number, from 135,000,000 to ... 140,000,000 " Grand total.215.174,000 " Considering this mass of debt, foreign and domestic, with an income of 4,000,000 below the expenditure, it is perfectly obvious, after the creation of 24,000,000 of 3 per cents, as described above, that no dividend of any description, or to any amount will be practicable for payment, except by following the ruinous system of fresh issue from time to time, at the exorbitant rate of 40 and 50 per cent., which has marked the career of each successive Spanish Ministry for years past. " For any Government to attempt to face such a charge on the current revenue of the country, so crippled, under a narrow policy of carrying? everything by force, and without a sound and comprehensive system of economy and retrench- ment, appears totally impossible; nor can it be expected that any confidence can be attached to any financial measure emanating from such source, so long as such Government shall not adopt and submit to the wisdom of a national assembly the mode of legally reforming those com- plicated evils so peculiarly characteristic of Spanish finance." QUANTITY OF LIGHT IN WATER A very beautiful illustration of the great quantity of light admitted or contained, as it were, in water, is to be found in what is called the " blue grotto," at the island of Capri, near Naples, which has been seen by most travellers. This grotto is a natural cavern of great extent. It is formed by an arch, or dome rather, which is an integral part of the rock. It spans over, from its attack ment on the left to perhaps a hundred yards to the right, much in the way that a person my hold his left hand, putting his fingers together, and making a dome of the hollow of the pain. Closing the thumb upon the second joint of the forefinger, he will leave a small aperture, what resembles the little hole at which you enter), hardly large enough for a small boat. This B the only place at which light is admitted dV rectly, and this is so small, that when you an within, and lock towards it, it looks only like a star or blue light burning. The only illumination of the cave, which goes to its full limits, s by light which comes up through the water. If you fancy your hollowed hand to represent the roof of this cave, and the ends of your fingers dipped to the second joint in water which set. round your hand,leavingthehollowunoccupiec, and the sky gives light which enters under the ends of them, you will have a good notion of the form of this natural curiosity. There is a space between the bottom of the sea and that part of the rock which dips down into it, and which is represented by the ends of your fingers, of who; extent I don't know, but large enough to admit a sufficiency of light, which passes thence by means of the water, and illuminates the cavern. with blue light of the most magical character. Artist and Amateurs. Magazine. BRISTOL. THE GREAT BRITAIN STEAMER. Some curious particulars have just transpired on the subject of the large steamer Great Britain, the property of the Great Western Steam-ship Company. This immense steamer has been in the dock at Bristol from the time of the launch, which took place in the presence of Prince Albert several months since. The completion of the vessel has now been effected, and the Great Britain has been actually advertised to depart on July the 13th for New York. But in attempting to bring her out of the dock it has been discovered that her breadth is too great to admit of her passing the gates, and thus is the Leviathan steamer embayed and imprisoned without a prospect of release, as the only mode of extrication appears to be to widen the gates of the dock. Application has been made for this purpose to the Bristol authorities, but the corporation refuse to alter their property as a remedy for the errors of the builders of a single ship, and the difficulty is therefore proposed to be overcome by the extraordinary expedient of bringing a bill into Parliament to authorise the compulsory enlargement of the gates of the dock. The success of this appeal is considered doubtful, and what may eventually be the fate of the Great Britain the people of Bristol cannot very clearly foresee Times.
