PATENT CALORIC ENGINE The undersigned invite the attention of manufacturers and others who require the application of motive power to this novel and successful propeller, whereby the common atmosphere is practically employed as an agent of propulsion without the aid of either water or steam. 1\. Within the limit claimed for this motor its power a certain uniform, and entirely sufficient. 2\. The machine is not attended with the numerous pests that attach to the steam-engine, and make it so uncomfortable and dangerous a servant ; but, on the contrary, it is absolutely free from danger. B. It requires no engineering supervision, as it is not liable to much tear and wear, or to get out of order, and may be kept in action by any workman, her boy, without interfering with other duties they may have to perform. I. its consumption of fuel is very trifling (about 88 per cent, of the steam engine), and It does not increase the rate of Insurance. The caloric engine is no longer a subject of experi- ment, but exists as a perfect practical machine, daily at work (chiefly in America) In numerous and diverse fled met with undeviating success. It is employed for job printing; and printing daily newspapers, working hoisting gear for warehouses, docks, and ships, mills of various descriptions ; pumps of all kinds from those used in raising water in houses for domestic use, and those employed at railway stations and mines, and for purposes of Irrigation and supplying villages, with water. It is practically employed in bakeries and tanneries, also by bookbinders, cabinetmakers, and carriers, for wool cutting;, for elevating grain, grinding quarts and paints for wood turning for sawing and planing timber, for tobacco (rating and pulverising, for soda- water manufacturers, bone ching, malt mashing, roasting, grinding, and pulping coffee, for grinding corn, cutting feed, domestic sawing, and for the various operations of farms. To the agriculturist and squatter this engine pos. easts peculiar advantages, not only from its being harmless, but especially in country districts, where mechanical skill is not easily procurable, and where it is sometimes inconvenient and expensive to supply the water necessary for a steam-engine. The engine can be worked either portable or stationary, and can be attached to the ordinary portable thrashing machine, and at same time drive all the other machines in use on the farm or station.

These pills require no restraint of diet or confine- ment during their use, and are certain to prevent the disease attacking any vital part.
