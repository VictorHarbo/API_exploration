Danish A large number of Scadinavians and Australian friends .assembled in the tastefully decorated rooms of the Danish Church, in George Street, for the annual commeration fete. Speaking on the annual report, Rev. P. C. Ligaard said that the pre- ceding year had been progressive. He regretted that the work' in Queens- land still had to rely to a large ex- tent upon the support from the mother church in Denmark. Apart from the purely spiritual work, the church had engaged in social activities, and im- migrants from the Scandinavian countries found a hand stretched out to welcome them on arrival in Queensland. The scope of the church had been extended to centres outside Brisbane, and Mr. Ligaard called for support from all Scandinavians in Queensland and other well-wishers. At the banquet the Vice-Consul for Denmark, Lieutenant- Co!onel V. Lar- son, was among tho speakers who ex - pressed their appreciation of the un- selfish endeavours of Mr. and Mrs, Ligaard to meet the spiritual and material needs of their countrymen in this part of the world.
