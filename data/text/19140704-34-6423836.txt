If this inflammation Li not arrested it invades the passages which lead from the nose to the head, ears, throat, and lungs. It injures the sight and hearing, destroys the sense of taste and smell, renders the "breath offensive, breaks down the affected tissues, and consumes the nasal cartilages. The discharge causes dyspepsia, also consumption. Probably 20 per cent, of the population have but one good nostril- the other is clogged with catarrhal deposit or by some weakness caused by neglected cold. This forces them, perhaps unconsciously, to breathe through the mouth, and, unless at tended to, will result in lifelong annoyance and other serious trouble. TREATMENT WITH "0Z0NIA" restores the organ to its normal condition, and enables it to perform its functions properly. Hay Fever may be known by its violent fits of sneeze V6 OZONE 1/6 gives instant relief, and is a quick and easy way of curing Nasal Catarrh, Hay Fever, Irritated and Sore Throat, Earache, Noises in the Head, and Ear, Discharges from the Far.
