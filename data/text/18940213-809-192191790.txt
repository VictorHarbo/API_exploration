I was not allowed to prove that 7 was not collecting on that day. I was that morning talking to a dealer on the City-road when the conatabie came up, and. instead of asking me what was in my cart, put bis head in and started hauling over the contents— to put me down io front 6f the people standing round as a thief. That is why 1 would not show the licence, If I had been collect ing that day I would have showed my licence. I would not have paid the fine after ; but I did not want to loao the licence,- Yours, 4c. , THOS. ROTHWELL.
