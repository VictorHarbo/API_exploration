SUMMARY FOR EUROPE. I (Continued from iJie Supplement to The Argus of this day.) COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. THE MAILS. The R.M.S. Geelong, Captain R. T. Dundas, after shipping her mails, specie, and passengers for India and Europe, left her anchorage on the 9th ultimo, and proceeded on her voyage. The P. and O. Co.'s R.M.S.S. Malta, with the European and Indian mails, anchored in the bay at a quarter to 6 o'clock p.m. on the 25th ult. The Malta left Galle at a quarter past 4 p.m. on the 4th inst., and experienced light variable winds to at. 7deg. S" and from thence moderate S.E. trades to lat. 28deg. S. The rest of the passage to King George's Sound was marked by moderate variable weather. The Malta arrived at the Sound at half-past 11 p.m. on the 17th inst., and left again at half-past 5 p.m. on the 18th. Strong south-easterly winds, increasing to a fresh gale, attended with a high head sea, prevailed until midnight on the 23rd inst. Moderate N.W. winds and thick rainy weather then continued until abreast of Cape Nelson. Cape Otway was signalled at 6 p.m. on the 24th inst., and at half-past 10 p.m., in consequence of the wind freshening into a furious gale from the southward the steamer was hove to during the night. The Malta on her present trip is commanded by Captain N. J. Skottowe, who has resumed his position in the Australian route after leave of absence, and his welcome back, in so far as the weather is concerned, has been somewhat of the wildest. The mails (which were in charge of Lieut. Bridger, R.N.) were landed with considerable despatch, and forwarded at once to the general office. STATE OF TRADE. Dulness and inactivity are the most prominent features in the trade of the month, a rather unusual occurrence at this period of the year, when it is to be supposed that preparations for the festive season alone might have stimulated the market, and for a short time, at least, relieved the monotony and want of animation which has been the burden of our story for so many months past. No thing of a speculative feeling has been evinced; indeed, it has of late been very generally remarked that whenever one holder more than another shows any thing like a desire to indulge in speculation the trade refuse to follow the market, and effectually destroy all chance of the speculation proving successful, by refusing to make other than hand to mouth purchases for a long period afterwards, until the speculator, thoroughly disgusted at the supineness and want of spirit displayed, is forced to place his goods on the market again, and wind up his speculation at a heavy loss. Dundee goods have once more fallen into neglect. Cornsacks, which promised so well previous to the mail's arrival, have since been allowed to fall completely out of notice. The value of candles has been mainly sustained by the action of a speculative buyer, who had the courage, during the last two months, to purchase close on 20,000 boxes. Breadstuffs, and likewise all descriptions of grain, present a very different aspect to that of last month. Flour has undergone a good deal of excitement, but the tendency of the market has been downward. Nor could that be arrested, notwithstanding that some 5000 tons of flour and 20,000 bushels wheat changed hands about a fortnight ago, and over 300 tons flour the week previous, the market now closing with prices showing a reduction of £2 10s. to £3 per ton on flour, and 1s. to 1s. 3d. on wheat. Maize during the same period declined Is. per bushel on oats, also, we have to record a similar reduction. In oil we have to refer to a rise of 3d. per gallon on kerosene, and 4d. to 5d. on castor oil. Rice is in better favour. In sugar, a large business has been done at advancing figures ; about 39,500 bags have been cleared off in the course of the month. Transactions in tea have not been extensive; they comprise the Foldon's ship- ment, balance of the Isabella Brown's, portions of the Feronia's, &c.; The entire cargo of the Dioscuren was also offered, but only; about 1,200 packages were sold. The advice of the loss of the Bella Rosa near the island of Formosa has helped to stiffen values ; but the destruction, in addition, of the Marie Gabrielle on our own coast, with another cargo, caused some excitement in the market, and on advance of 14d. per pound all round has been generally asked since. The sales of colonial produce have gone off throughout the month with great spirit. The Government, in accordance with their advertisement, received by the last mail tenders for the establishment of steam communication via the Cape of Good Hope, and the Chief the same, said the Government fully recognised the desirability of a line of ocean steamers by the Cape, if such could be established at a reasonable cost, and if the voyage could be performed in something under 50 days, and if by that means a stream of immigration could reach the colony as rapidly and as cheaply in proportion to the distance as it could to Canada and the United States. If they found that they could attain that object consistently with the economy a Government was bound to observe, by accepting one of the tenders, they would be prepared to submit resolutions to Parliament on the subject. The remainder of the lease of a guano island called Malden Island was sold on the 29th ultimo. The lease, which has two years to run, was sold to Messrs. Grice, Sumner, and Co. for £5,000, the barque Icon, which is on her way here with a cargo of guano loaded at the island, being also included in the bargain. The failure of Mr. Donald Cameron, of Kerang, squatter, was reported a short time ago. The causes of insolvency are stated to be-fall in the value of wool, sheep, and station property ; loss of sheep by drought, and being made liable on accommodation bills which insolvent accepted without valuable consideration. Liabilities, £102,0 15s. 9d.; assets, 25; deficiency, £102,64115s. 9d. EXCHANGE AND MONEY. For the present mail, almost all transactions in exchange have been due at par, this being the banks'' selling rate for 60 days' sight bills. Discount rates show no alteration, 6 and 7 per cent, being charged on bills at three and four months' currency, and 8 per cent, on longer periods. Interest is allowed on deposit of three months at the rate of 2 per cent., 3 per cent, is allowed on four months, 4 per cent, on six months, and the maximum rate of 5 per cent, on deposits lodged for a period of twelve months. r WOOL. The sales during the month have been conducted with spirit, the attendance has been good full prices, have been realised, and altogether a very satisfactory business has been transacted. Altogether, about 18,353 bales have been disposed of, of which 3,670 bales (including 550 bales saved from the Lightning) were sold at Geelong. The prices realised ranged from 5d. to 9d. for greasy, 12d. to 17d. for scoured, and 10d. to 18d. for fleece, the latter consisting chiefly of inferior to average descriptions. STOCK AND STATIONS. From the interior we learn that the exceedingly fine season has inspired renewed confidence in the future among the stock owners of the district between the Murrumbidgee and the Murray, and the pastoral show which took place at Wagga Wagga, a short time ago, was proof of the light-hearted ness which prevailed there. The show was a great success, and did much credit to the promoters. We are glad to hear that the meat preserving companies are progressing, and the good effect of them on the Victorian markets is already very marked. The company formed at Echuca promises to go on satisfactorily, and as the success of a few of these institutions is developed, confidence will be inspired in the public mind, and capital will be plentiful in all probability. ''Another and very marked improvement in the getting up of the wool, says the Pastoral Times, is to be commenced next season on a large scale, at Messrs. Wilson's station on the Yanko. In addition to the hot water washing and spouting process, the sheep are all to be combed and brushed by machinery-in fact, shampooed. This comb- ing and brushing process is to follow immo-, diately after the 'spouting,' while the wool on the sheep is, wet and soft, the only time when the combing and brushing can be performed. It is now found that, owing to the prevalence of burr in wool of the best kind, the latter is depreciated from 1d. to 6d. per lb To got rid of the burr the shampooing is to a be tried by steam next season. It was tried by hand labour during the past shear- ing, and it was found to answer admirably. The sheep is thrown on its back, and turned as required, in order to undergo the combing process, which effectually takes away nearly all the burr." The following solos of station property have been effected during the month Messrs. De' mahoy Campbell and Co. sold the Tchelery station, comprising Windouran, blocks A and B, in the Murrumbidgee district, together with 21,000 sheep and 9000 lambs, to Mr Harvey Patterson, at a satisfactory price, and on the usual terms. Messrs R. Goldsbrough and Co. sold the Booligal stations, together with the blocks Alma and Avondale, situate in the Lachlan district, New South Wales, to the Hon. W. Campbell, on account of Messrs. ,, Nilson and Parker-price, 10s. 6d. per head for 42,715 sheep and lambs, the latter count- ing as sheep. nirOBTS AND EXPORTS.

It is expected that the course of post with London by this route will be 44 days for Sydney and 40 for New Zealand, and that this will be reduced by four days when the line is well established, and all things in working order. The Consul, the Post believes, has communicated with the Governments of New South Wales and New Zealand on this subject, and it is hoped that he will meet with such liberality at their hands as will induce him to carry out his intention. BEETROOT SUGAR, At a meeting of the provisional directors of the Agricultural Distillery and Beetroot Sugar Company, held on the 24th ult., it was announced that 4,560 shareS had been taken up, the share-list comprising the names of many of our leading merchants and others, The enterprise, therefore, may now be considered as fairly launched. PUBLIC COMPANIES. Australasian Plate-glass Insurance Com- pany The first meeting was held on the 22nd November, Mr. T Y. Anderson in the chair. About 4,000 shares were represented. It was resolved that Messrs. W. Weaver, T. Y. Anderson, James Hay, Robert Buckle, and A. K. Smith be appointed directors that Mr. Oldham be appointed solicitor and that the Commercial Bank of Australia (Limited), be the bankers of the company. Messrs. Sprigg and Boyd were elected auditors. A meeting of the directors was held on the 24th, when Mr. A. K. Smith was elected chairman, and Mr. G. T. Wyleigh was appointed secretary and legal manager of the company. It was resolved to proceed to business immediately. Proposals for insurance for upwards £12,000 were handed in. Agricultural Distillery and Beetroot Sugar Company At a meeting of the provisional directors, held on the 24th November, it was announced that 4,500 shares had been taken up, the share-list comprising the names of many of our leading merchants and others, The enterprise, therefore, may now be considered as fairly launched. Victorian Fishmongers' Company. At a meeting of the shareholders, held on the 12th, it was resolved, with the view of facilitating the catching and sale of fish at more moderate prices than now obtained, the operations of the company should be extended, and for that purpose that the capital should be increased by £2,000 by the issue of £1 shares; and that the general public should be invited to take up shares in the company. A motion for the division of the unallotted £10 shares into scrip of £1 was also carried. AUSTIULASIAN YACHT COMPANY. A bold idea in respect to passenger traffic between this and Europe is now being pro- mulgated by the prospectus of the "Australasian Ocean Yacht Company, capital £250,000, in 50,000 shares of £5 each, £1 per share paid up," Such is the formal language of the document, but the enterprise does not take so much the shape of a share broking venture as that of a project calculated to forward the dearest interests of two J classes, viz., those in England whose pro perty in life would be insured by emigration to Victoria, and those in Victoria whose fondest I hope is to pay a visit to the mother country. We may, therefore, refer the more freely to the company's proposal, which is to establish a line of ocean yachts each of about 2,000 ions, to carry passengers only; to insure in them, by quick sailing and the action of a 30 (working up to 90 horse power steam by draub'c propeller for crossing the belt of cairns at the equator, passages ave- I raging 50 days to give to passengers an unusually large space between decks, consequent upon the absence of cargo to afford the comfort of a flush clear upper deck; and not only immense sailing superiority, but a large variety of conveniences for passengers, only obtainable in ships devoted to passenger traffic. The following additional advantages are enumerated as among those to be experienced by those visiting home. viz. No unpleasant or unhealthy effluvia from cargoes of hides, horns, bones, etc ; no danger from spontaneous combustion, as in wool ships and no loss of time in taking in and discharging cargo. With all this, moderate fares amounting to less than half the present expense are to be the rule, and it is contended that, with 300 passengers per trip, this could be profitably done. Finally, it is proposed to build the ships after a model to be submitted to the inspection of shareholders. This model was first exhibited recently at Captain Coffey's Shipping Exchange, in the new CorpoTation-buildings, opposite Scott's Hotel, and was inspected by a number of gentlemen, who, whether familiar or not with nautical matters, could not but admire the beauty of this little pattern of a hill, made up of graceful lines and gentle curves, which lead from a sharp cutwater to a substantial beam, and finish with a clean run aft without a hollow. It was designed and modelled by Mr. W. Thomson, of South Yarra. It is certain that the verification after experiment of the expectations of the embryo company would confer a vast benefit on the country, and help to bring about a much needed reform in respect to the passenger traffic of the world. UPPER MURRAY RAILWAY. In respect to the progress which the Government propose to make with the Essendon and Upper Murray Railway, the following paper was laid before Parliament on the night of the 10th ult., by Mr. Longmoro:-"Vic . torian Railways Statement of proposed expenditure for the ensuing 12 months, under the provisions of the Railway Loan Act, 32 Vict. 331, prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 13 of the act. North Eastern Railway Purchases of land, clearing and fencing, level crossings, earthworks, bridges, culverts, c, £180,000 ; road across Wodonga- flat, £10,000 ; total, £190,000. Francis Longmore, Commissioner of Railways. Nov. 11, 1869." MAP OF VICTORIA.' The value of the work done in past years by the Survey department of Victoria is about to be strikingly developed according to a plan laid down by Mr. Surveyor-General Skene, since his predecessor, Mr. Ligar, left for England, and carried out by the department with a very creditable zeal. Two maps of Victoria are in course of preparation in the Survey-office, one composed of four sheets, comprising together an area of 6ft. by 4ft., and another which is reckoned to measure 24ft. by 18ft. The former and smaller is a general map of Victoria, showing in the clearest detail every township in the colony approximately according to its size, all the main lines of road and telegraph, all the telegraph stations, and every pre-emptive right, duly named. The latter indicates an important feature of the map (which is on the scale of one-eighth of an inch to the mile, with the parallels of latitude and longitude carefully marked for the pre-emptive rights will show with plainness and simplicity the original settlement of the country. PASTORAL OCCUPATION. A very voluminous return regarding pastoral occupation shows that in 1860 the total area occupied for pastoral purposes was 29,049,338 acres, the total rent paid being £199,902 8s. 4d., or PG's of a penny per acre ; while in 1869 the area occupied was 27,034,785 acres, with a total rental of £174,331 17s., or T55 of a penny per acre. The return contains the following particulars of the stations of which Messrs. M'Culloch, Sellar, and Co. are the licensees Lowan flats Station, area 111,280 acres, rent £48 per annum ; Stratford, 40,190 acres, rent £22 18s. ; Peechelba, 114,000 acres, rent £950 ; Strathmerton East, 128,000 acres, i rent £1,003, amount of reservations 19,200 acres ; Burrowye, 40,000 acres, rent £150 13s. 4d. ; Emu, 11,150 acres, rent 2818., amount of reservations 640 acres ; Springs Station, 18,200 acres, rent £200, amount of reserva- tions 9,000 acres ; Tatong, 24,000 acres, rent £292 2s,, amount of reservations 1,800 acres. EXPENDITURE ON PUBLIC WORKS, ROADS, AND BRIDGES. A return was laid on the table of the Legislative Assembly on the 1st December, in accordance with a notice by Mr Macgregor, showing the total amount paid out of the consolidated revenue in every year from 1861 to 1863 (both inclusive), either indirectly or by way of subsidy, for the carrying out of public works, roads, and bridges.

The markets throughout the month have been very languid, and as a whole have shown few signs of vitality. Nothing of the briskness which usually cha raotcrUcsthis period of the season has made its appearance, but instead great dulness has prevailed for the greater part of the month. In been, either bulk or bottled, little of a special nature has come before us. Cormicks, after a very brief period of activity, have become once more languid and neglected. Gunnies, however, are fast rising into favour. Values of candles are v eil supported. Cements are easier. Chicory and police have met with but a moderate inquiry. Fish has had more attention. Driodfrultabave been well noticed, but no further advance has been established. In breadstuffs, we note a decline on both flour and wheat. Feeding grains have also fallen considerably in value. Hops are low in price Malt is improving. Motors are in fair request. In oils, kerosene has undergone some excitement. Castor has risen in value. Rice is meeting with attention, Patna, but more especially Java. Salt has improved in value, and the market presents quite a different aspect, though prices are still far from being satisfactory. Sugar has been largely dealt in at better prices, Tea has been somewhat excited in consequence of the loss of two cargoes for this port Tobaccoes have not been much dealt in. Timber has been largely sold at low prices, but is generally supposed to have ECOH its lowest. In wines and spirits generally nothing of a novel or interesting character has transpired. , Ale and Stout have presented a very quiet aspect throughout the month. Sales have been limited to supplying requirements, and, as a consequence, they have been willing and unimportant. Joulo's has been disposed of in trade parcels at £8 bs. and Marrian's has been quitted at 38. An took no the last shipment of the season of Bass's ale came for- ward- about 60 bilda. We quote £8 for this brand likewise. There has been scarcely anything doing in bulk about. Some small lots of Wh I thread's have been placed at £0 10s. ; but no further sales have transpired. Bottled ales have met with a fair in quiry at about last month's figures. Tonnent'a has been freely sold at 10s. We quote 10s. for Foster's. Sales of Dovenieh's, according to quantity, have been made at 9s?. 6d. to 10s. Blood's has been quitted at 9s. 6d. Allsopp's has been disposed of at Os. 3d. to 6s. 6d. Sales of Arrol's are reported at 8s. 6d. Aitken's has been moved off at 3s. 6d. Jeffreys's is saleable at 8s. 3d. to 3s. 6d. for small parcels, while large lines can be purchased at less money-. We have not observed much activity in bottled Stout. Burke's has been in favour at Os. 6d. Henry White and Co.'s has been quitted at 6s. 6d. Blood's has been disposed of somewhat extensively' at Os. 6d. O'Brien's dagger brand lisa found' but ora at Os. 8d. Ztlachon's is quoted at 6s. 6d. Borthwick's is offering at 3s. 8d. to 8s. 6d. for a line of 1,000 cases sold last week a concession on the rates named was allowed. Sale of Byass'shavo come under our notice at 8s. 3d. to 8s. 6d. Bagging Previous to the mall's arrival considerable firmness was evinced in regard to cornsacks, In which transactions to a very fair extent were reported at 11s. 6d. In bond, and 11s. 6d. to 12s. duty paid. During the last fortnight, however, inquiry has ceased and scarcely any transaction has been allowed to come under our notice. Woolpacks do not obtain the slightest attention ; the season is now over, and scarcely an inquiry is to be heard of. Gunnies are beginning to meet with inquirers; a shipment, nor Wolverene, was cleared off at 7s. 3d. The Aboukir a parcel, rather small in size, was sold at 6s. 10d. Privately sales have of late been effected at 7s. 6d, and the market now hours an upward look. Boots and Shoes and Loatlienvaro.-Considerable sales have been made in the course of the month. On the 16th ult., 1,132 packages of Mr. S. D. Tailor man's goods were offered to a large attendance of the trade, and the prices obtained showed a decided improvement on all classes. On the 10th an un- reserved sale of 284 packages S. Flatau and Lion'd smoke was hold. Girls' kid elastic, 40, brought 2s. 8d. ; do., 7-10, 3s. 6d. ; do., 11-1 D, 43. 4d. ; girls' all-lasting boots, 4s. 8d. ; women's coloured cashmere, S.

' Candies For some time after the departure of the last mall steamer the market appeared quiet and without animation. The few transactions reported went through the auction mart, and prices ruled at from 10d. to 10d. The advices regarding shipments reported at 35 tons only-being looked upon as very favourable, more Inquiry has been stirred up, and about 5,000 or 6,000 boxes have changed hands since, at 1933. for Brandon's. Speculation, however, cannot be waked up, as there is every appearance of the October shipments proving heavy again. The Neva Company continue to charge made. for their brand. > Cement The value of Portland has been steadily maintained, notwithstanding that supplies have come forward very freely. Ordinary brands of Portland are saleable at 10s. For White's we cannot now quote over 10s. 9d. to 17s. American plaster has met with purchasers at 12s. 6d. to 12s. 6d., all that has arrived having been cleared off at our quotations. Chemicals have been by no means active. Soda crystals are quite a drug in the market at present, and even at £7 10s. sale: can be with difficulty effected; as low as £7 7s. 6d. has been accepted at auction. Caustic soda has been sold at £16 10s. ; buyers now, however, would give £10, and some large sales might be effected were holders more inclined to meet their views. Flour of sulphur is still nominal at about £24. Tartaric acid is in slow sale at 1s. 6d. to 18. 7d., and for cream of tartar we quote 12d. to 14d. Tar- table acid was sold by auction, on cask, at 4s 4d., and cream of tartar, also in cask, at 11d. Bluestone has been placed at £32, and lump alum at £11 10s. Fro pared opium has been very steady at 26s. Chicory has been moved off in moderate lots to suit requirements, at 2d. for best brand in bond ; colonial continues to realise 5d. to fill. Coffee. Trade in this staple has been confined to meeting a fair local trade demand, as well as a good inquiry for export at well sustained rates. Best plantation has realised from DId. to Old. Java of good quality is valued at 6d. to 7d. A shipment of Bon tyne coffee brought 63d. under the hammer. For native Ceylon we quote 6d. to Old. Advices from Colombo to 2nd November speak more encouragingly of the new crop. The David and Jessie cleared on 30th October for Melbourne! with a cargo. Confectionery. There is only a very moderate business doing. Kolller's assorted Is disposed of at Did. for Wotherspoon's we quote 9d. to Old. Assorted candied peel is in good request at 15d. The market has been better supplied of late, and the price has In consequence been more regular. Jujubes are firm at 14d. Cordage The utmost dulness continues to be reported as ruling in this market, and only the most trifling inquiry is being experienced. Victorian made cordage, up to three-quarter inch size, realised 8d. per lb. Assortments of one inch to four and a half Inch sizes bring £03 ; flat rope brings £78. There is little or nothing done in Imported rope. At auction, Calcutta clothes lines were quitted at £52, and declines M ero sold at £32. Seaming twine is In very slow sale at 13d. per lb , while shop cordage was got rid of by auction at 6d. to Old. Fish. There is not much activity in the market. Ling is quitted at 6d. to Old. lib. fresh herrings are saleable at 6s. 6d. ; red herrings in tins are disposed of at 25s. to 26s. lib. salmon meets with a free sale at from 13s. 6d. to 14s 3d., according to quality and cure. An invoice of Bainton, herrings, liaddocliB, and mackerel was quitted this week at a fair price. Hah es sardines are somewhat scarce, and 0s. 3d. can readily be obtained for any parcels offering. Quarter sardines are being placed at 5s. For lib. oysters we quote 7s. 6d. lb. lobsters have advanced, and may now be valued at 7s. 6d. to 8s. Fruits.-Notwithstanding the high expectations entertained of this market, no better rates can be quoted this month than last, although it was Bup passed that the mall's advices would have the effect of sending up the price of currants to 5d. per lb. at least. Holders have not been able to realise more than 4d. in ordinary and 4d. in exceptional cases. Raisins, however, have been more noticed, and for good fruit 4d. has been obtained. Cape are most freely inquired for, but Elomo an Valentia command notice at a similar advance. Sultana have ranged at from 4d. to 5d. Muscatel have been sold by auction at 8d and we quote for Uno fruit 3d. to Old. Figs are scarce, and saleable at 6d. Dried apples are offering Flour and Grain On breadstuffs we have this month to report a marked decline. The month opened with the same sort of dragging market we have had to notice for many months past. On the 16th ult., however, a large business was transacted through the auction mart, and notwithstanding that some surprise was expressed at the reduction in value, and the low prices accepted for flour, yet something was required to be done to impart the spirit, and remove the heaviness which prevailed. Some 300 tons of flour of Victorian and Adelaide brands were offered, and the whole cleared off at prices rising from £18 15s. to £14. This sale In some degree . unsettled the market, and we found a difficulty in giving a quotation for trade parcels; but from the class of buyers Into whose hands the flour went, and the large parcels taken up, comparatively little alteration could be made on our trade quotations, which ranged at from £15 to £16 5s. for best | brands, and a fair inquiry for the supply of imme , date wants was maintained, but as the week closed quotations fell to £14 10s. to £16. The following 'workroom decided reduction could not be avoided. Some 400 tons were offered by auction, but only 40 tons were quitted, at prices ranging from £11 17s. 6d. ,to£1215e. The result of these sales did not cause any immediate alteration on the trade price required by holders, as Email parcels continued to be disposed of during the remainder of the week at £13 10s. to £14, and so far from their having had an injurious effect, the contrary proved to be the case, as the following day a very improved tone was presented in the market, and an extensive business was reported, the low prices ruling for flour having encouraged the larger buyers to come forward and operate, more freely. Some 600 tons of flour, of various brands, changed hands at £13 a higher rate than could possibly have been obtained at the auction sales the day previous This week, however, the market has been again interfered with by the auction sales. On the 1st Some 60 tons Adelaide flour were sold at the low figures of £12 2s. 6d. to £12 5. 'An Improved feeling in favour of wheat WAS also called forth ; some 20,000 bushels Adelaide changed hands at about 0s. 3d., and sales of Gipps Land were reported at 5s. 6d. to 5s. 7d. The cause of all this decline, as may be inferred, is the very promising character of the coming harvest, which accounts from all parts of the country combine in making out as likely to prove the finest and most abundant that has ever been produced here. Feeding grains have also been subjected to a great decline, a drop of fully 15. per bushel on last month's parcels of maize being now quitted au -maize!? while for large parcels 3s. 9d. is as much as can be got. Oats are offering at 3s. 6d to 4'., without leading to much business. Bran has ruled at about 4s. 5d. Colonial Oatmeal has declined to £22, Pearl barley Is saleable at £20. Furniture. American chairs were sold publicly at the following prices Wood Beats were placed at 44s. per dozen ; oak Beats, boot tops, brought 55s. per dozen ; spindle, Grecian, 72s. per dozen ; rockers, 188s. per dozen; Douglas wood, 34s. per dozen; child's table, 30s. per dozen ; folding cane, 60a. to 120s. per dozen. A shipment of 360 cases was taken up privately at a fair advance. Gunpowder is without improvement of any description ; somewhat castor rates have been accepted during the month. Ball's is now quoted 6d. For games, Od. Is wanted, but a farthing less was taken for a con- siderable Uno ; other brands are valued at six. to 60 Hops still continue to present a very heavy and unsatisfactory aspect. The sales effected go chiefly through the auction mart, and exceedingly low prices are In most cases accepted. For five Kout OS's as much as 1s. 4d. to 1s. 6d. is got. Fine Bavarian have been sold as high as Is. Sa. inferior to good Kent, and middling, are moved off at from 7d. to 11d. and up to 2s 2d. 200 pockets were this week offered by auction, and realised from 10d. to 11 îd. Malt. Fine quality has come forward more freely of late, and more business has been got through during the past week than previously. As much as 9s. 6d. has been got for very prime samples, but buyers generally have not cared to go beyond 9s. 3d. Sales of middling samples have been made at 0s. Helens have not been marked by much animation. Pig iron is steady at £4 14s. Galvanised Iron is difficult to move, and very low prices have to be taken. Scotch 20-gauge is quoted at £22 10s. to £23 at which sales have been made. English ordinary brands are quitted at £26 for 20 gauge, and one shipment of an outside brand was cleared off at £23. By auction sales were last week reported-Ex Glen- mark, 45 COSTS galvanised corrugated iron, 20 gauge, GOP brand, 5ft, 6ft., 7ft, 8in, brought £24 10s. to £26 per ton. Ex Duke of Edinburgh, 23 ? cases, 6ft. and 7ft, 24-gauge, Smith and McLean's brand, realised £21 6s, to £23 6'. per ton. This week a small parcel of Braby's 6ft. corrugated tinned iron was placed at £27 7s. 6d. and early in the month, Braby's galvanised corrugated tinned iron, 20-gauge, Castle brand, City., was sold at £23 2s. 6d. per ton ; 6ft. brought £25 do.; 7ft., £23 178. 0d. do.; 3ft., £24 16s. do.; 6ft., £27 do.

Sheet iron has been somewhat dull and neglected. Nos. 3 to 18 maintain a steady quotation of £1909.; Nos. 20 to 20 are valued at £13 10s. Bar and rod iron u firm at £0 to £100. Plate Iron is quoted at £11 15s. to £12, and a fair amount of business has come under our notice. Hoop iron is dull at £11 10s. ; the demand is trifling, and stocks are very heavy. Fencing wire is moving off very freely at £10, £17, £18, and £10 for NOR. 0. 7, 8, and 0 Ryland's, and 105. loss for other brands. Colonial rolled sheet lead realizes £20 10s. to £27. Shot is dull of sale, and quite neglected at £29. There is nothing whatever doing in tin plates ; we quote 16, percent, advance on invoice Muntz metal is without inquiry ; we quote 8d. to 8d. Sales of Ewbank's nails have been made at 22 per cent, of list. American nails have declined to 16s. 6d., at which, however, there is little doing. Collins's and Sharpe's heavy axes find buyers at 74s. Ames's shovels are in fair request at 03s. Day's D.H. shovels, 24in. to 36in., are quitted at 52s. and other makers', same size, command 503. Sales of holloware are made at 276- per cent. off list. on.-lveroBCEO has been looked upon with favour for more than a month, in anticipation of a falling 912 in shipments being advised; but as those of the importers who hold stock to any extent had refused for some time post to quote a price, there was no room for speculators to operate unless by buying from second bands and outsiders, from whom, however, several considerable parcels have been picked up. Oriental was sold early in the month at Is. tOld. ; Devoe's at le. lid., and Downer's at 2s. ; but by the time of the mail's arrival prices were forced up fully 3d. per gallon. Sales were reported last week of Oriental at Is. Hid., Downer's at 2s. 11d and Cozzens's at Is. 6d. This week, however, 2s. 3d. is asked for Downer's, 2s. 11d. for Devoe's, and 2s! 6d. for Cozzons'a, At auction, damaged Cozzens's brought Is. 11d., and damaged Downer's 2s. 6d. Six thousand cases were reported to have changed hands yesterday, Cozzens's, Uevoo'p, and Downer's, at up to 2s. By our New York advices, which reach to the 25th September, we observe that the month's shipments \- o this port, by one vessel that has cleared out, do not amount to more than 100 cases, while 1,500 cases go forward to Sydney by the Nulla. Four vessels were loading at New. York, and three at Boston for the colonies. A movement in castor has sent the price of that oil up from 4s. in bond to 4s. 4d. and 4s. 6d., at which latter sales are now making. In duty-paid oils there has been exceedingly little done, and we have few alterations to refer to. Linseed, in drums, commands 4s.' 5d., and in bulk 3s. Oil. Colza is quiet, but quotations are are steady at 4s. 6d. per drum, while purchases can be made, in cash, at 4s. 4d. Olive oil is nominal at 6s. 6d. in drums and Gs. In wood. Chinese quoted at 4s., but the market is heavy and few sales ' are made public. Polar oil has declined to £42. Oilmen's stores meet with a very fair inquiry, and the prices realised are considered satisfactory. Com- mon brands of pickles bring 8s. for ordinary we quote 9s. 1, while prices ranging from 10s. to 10s. 6d., and up to 12s. 6d., Is obtained for best brands. ' Bottled fruits, assorted, have been sold at Ila., and black currants at 11s. 7d. ; lib. jams, colonial, find buyers, according to quantity, at 6s. to 8s.

Provisions The market is not noted for any activity. Colonial made butter is in fair request at 6d. Victorian cheese is moved off according to quality at 8d. to 10d. Hams and bacon do not obtain much notice; the former are saleable, but no more, and bring 1s. to 1s. Id. ; bacon Is likewise neglected, we quote Od. Quicksilver is extremely quiet, and without anima- tion, and quotations, which are not much more than nominal, may be given at Is. 11d, to 2s. 9½d. Rice The determination of holders to get rid of stock by the end of the year directed some little degree of attention towards Patna, and a movement was observed early in the month which led to sales at about the rates required by holders, say £21 lUa. to £22 for 60-ton parcels. The Wolvonno's shipment of 150 tons was offered by auction, but did not sell ; a portion was sold privately at under £20. Java, however more decidedly monopolises attention, and more business has been transacted in that description this month than for several months previous. Undreisod is wanted at £17 to £17 10s., and mill- dressed is freely disposed of at £20 to £20 10s. The Charles Tottie arrived last week with a cargo. The Bangkok rice per Clara Sayers, via Mauritius, about 250 tons, was disposed of at the low figure of £0. Salt is very steady al £4 5s. for trade parcels. Shipments as they come in are purchased at extreme rates. About 600 tons were taken to arrive and on the spot at up to £4, chiefly out of the Stockbridge, some 400 tons of this vessel's shipments having realised our quotation;. Sugar. Supplies have not come forward very woolly, and as Importers have refrained in consequence from pressing sales, a corresponding benefit has been secured. The course of the market can be best observed by following the month's sales. On Wednesday, the 10th ult., the Sea Bell's cargo of Mauritius sugar, amounting to 0,100 bags, was offered for sale under the hammer, and the whole found buyers at prices which showed an advance of about 20s. per ton on low and best kinds, while the middling qualities scarcely supported previous rates. Rations realised 30s. to 34s. ; browns, 33s. to 32s. 6d. ; low yellows, 32s. 9d. to 33s. 6d.; fine yellows, 34s to 35s. 3d. and low white, 33s. 6d. to 37s. 8d. The cargo of Mauritius sugar ex Bclslzo, was offered on the 12th, at Geelong. About 1,000 bags changed hands. Yellow counters brought £32 6s. to £84; grainy yellows, £83 to £84 ; yellow crystals, £34 15s. ; white crystals, £36 to £39 16s.; and grainy browing, £34 10s. The biddings were slack, but Importers were firm. The following lines found buyers A B C D J L R T V and V 3. Throughout the following week more activity was evinced. On Tuesday, the 16th, some 2,000 bags were sold privately at £80 to £38 for good to fair white crystals ; Uno yellows were also wanted, and £35 was offered and refused for considerable sized parcels. The cargo of Mauritius sugar per Elizabeth, was disposed of on the 17th, and the entire shipment, comprising some 4,577 bags, found buyers at prices which showed a slight improvement on browing sorts. nations were cleared off at 30s. 6d. to 34s. 3d. ; browns, at 34s. 6d. to 32s. ; middling yellows, at 33s. 6d. to 38s. 6d. a good yellows, at 35s. 6d. and greyish white brewing crystals, at 383. 6d. On the 22nd two cargoes of Mauritius tho Selina Jane's and the Adriatic's-were offered for sale under the hammer. The former, amounting to 8,630 bags, was all cleared off at prices which showed a slight advance on previous sales ; but the latter, comprising 0,212 bags, was withdrawn for still higher rates. The damaged portion of the Elizabeth's 943 bags-was sold on Wednesday, and the Selina Jane's damaged portion, 1,714 bags, was got rid of on Thursday, at middling prices, for not cash. This week more activity has been experienced. We hear of the Salacia's China sugars, about 2,000 bags, having changed hands privately, as likewise a line of 4,600 bags, being the bulk of the Adriatic cargo of Mauritius sugar, on terms withheld, but stated to be full current rates. On the 2nd Inst. the cargo of the Robert Passenger, amounting to 5,692 , bags, was offered for sale, every bag of which was quitted at 8s. 6d. to 32s. 3d. for medium to good rations, 52a. 9d. for good brown, 34s. to 35s.

The cargo of the Shepherd, amounting to 0,770 bags, was cleared off yesterday (the 3rd) at prices fully supporting the above quotations. Tea.-MCSBTS. J. Curie Robertson and Co., in their UEUBI monthly circular, report as follows:- "Since the date of our last circular we have to chronicle the total loss of the Marie Gabrielle off Moonlight Road, on the 25th ult., with a cargo of 302,4001b,, from Foo-chow. This, combined with the news by last mall of the loss of the Bella Rosa for this port, and short shipments as advised, has had a good effect on the market, which has assumed a more healthy appearance than has been experienced for some time past. A large amount of business has been transacted, principally under the hammer; private sales, although not of any magnitude, have been numerous, the total amount showing a good average, extending over most descriptions, more especially medium to fine congous, for which rather Improved rates have been obtained. Importers and holders generally are keeping back their stocks, hoping for a better demand and higher prices. Auction Sale On the 11th November, the cargo ex Foldcn, consisting of 600 cheats, 2,100 half clients, and 1,450 boxes, was offered, and all sold, at Is.

The market, however, now appears to have seen its lowest being virtually 40 per cent, less than two months ago, and buyers are more willing to operate in consequence.

The market altogether is in a most unsatisfactory state. The advices which come forward from month to month turn out of a most favourable character, and for a time create the impression that an improvement is likely to follow; but though movements may be initiated which may appear to lead to so desirable an end, yet the market is so heavily stocked, the feeling thus created cannot be sustained for long. These remarks, however do not apply to Cameron's goods, which continue to retain the full attention of the trade, who do not hesitate to clear off every shipment of this favourite brand as it comes forward, at most extreme prices, while tobaccoes equally good are offered in vain at half the rates realised for the former. Twists have come into notice in consequence of the small quantity coming forward. In the he ginning of the month a shipment of 80 cases Venus tens was taken up privately In one line at 1s. 4d. At the same time 82 packages, saved from the wreck of the VictoriaTowor, Bill Cameron's casks, were offered for sale, and 9d. to 10d. was realised for tens, lOrd for fives, and UJd. to 12d. for twist. The following week GO packages Two Seas, tens and fives were disposed of at 1s. 4d. to 4s. 5d. The Hawarden ship- ment of Bound on the 22nd, brought is. ia. to is. 4d. for Two Seas ; tens and fives realised Is. Ed. The damaged, ex same ship was cleared on the 26th, at is. 3d. for tens, Is 5d. for fives, and Is. 6d. to 4s. 4d for Raven twist A line of 100 packages low twist, out of condition was taken up for another market at a low figure. It was reported yesterday that four shipments Two Seas were sold yesterday at a full price, and a shipment of St Andrew twist realised 6s. 5d. On our trade quotation, it is unnecessary to make any actual change ; 6d. to 8d. is obtained for common dark tens and half-pounds ; good medium teas realise 10d, to Is.; and first- class, 1s. 3d. to 1s. 6d. Twists are moved off at Is. for Korr'B; 18d. to 14d for Black Swan; while St. Andrew's and Haven are hold for Is. 6d., owing to the small quantity coming forward. Barrett's is saleable at Is. 6d. Aromatics, half-pounds and pounds, are quoted at 1s. to 1s. 3d.; Navy, 14d. to 16d. ; fancy aromatics, 1s. 6d. to 1s. Od. Ormond's Swiss cigars are valued at 35s. ; Manilla cheroots, 15s. to 30s., stock very low; German clears, 35s. to 50s. ; Hamburg made, 60s. to 120s. Havannah, £10 to £80. Wines and Spirits Business in wines has been confined and limited ; very little demand has been experienced. An attempt to sell by auction last week resulted in the disposal of only equal to 20 butts and pipes port and sherry, at £35 to £38 for middling sherry In bond. Low red wine was quitted at £14 to £10, and medium port at £34 10s. Parcels of the Rhenish Wine Company's moselle, No. 2, have been placed at 40s., duty paid. The value of brandy has undergone no variation since our report of last month. Hennessy's pale, in bulk, is moved off slowly at 7s. 6d. Martell's pale can be purchased at 7s. 4d. ; dark is valued at 7s. 3d. for CA.P. 7s. has been steadily required Vine growers is disposed of at 5s, 9d., white 5s. 9d. to 6s, 10d. Is obtained for Otard. Associated Vineyard quotations stand at 5s. 3d., Marrott'a at Ga., and Olouzcau's at Gs,; B. Freres' commands 5s. 10d. and for Central Vine- yard we quote. 4d. to 6s. 6d.; a line of equal to 100 quarter-casks of this brand was taken up early in the month. Case brandies have been neglected, and to make sales less money has had to be taken. Sales of Hennessy's have been made to some extent at 20s. 6d. Martell's has been sold at 24s. 6d. Otard Is saleable at 24s. Renault's has been quitted at 21s. 6d. to 22s. A fine of 2,600 cases Associated Vineyard changed hands at about 17s. 6d. Of duty-paid brandy we note considerable sales of Elephant brand at 40s. Hum is well hold at advanced rates; some considerable sales have been made at 4s. for Lemon Hart's 10 per cent cop., and a trifle under for outside brands. For 30 per cent o.n. we quote 4s. 8d.; about 160 hands, altogether of this strength have changed hands in parcels. Geneva shows no altera- tion ; JDKZ, long strength, realises 16s., and short strength and contents Is wanted atlas 8d. There is little doing in whiskey ; we continue to quote for bulk 4s. 3d. to 4s. 10d,, according to brand. MELBOURNE MARKETS. SATURDAY, DEC. 4. THE MILLS.

Good fair milkers at from £7 to £8 10s. are most in demand. Anything really first-class should bring £10, but buyers willing to go to that figure are limited. Hardly ODJ' stores came forward this week ; buyers are still in the market, and remunerative prices can be obtained. Fat calves were fully supplied, and prices ruled a shade lower. Pigs. This market was fairly supplied, and prices are unchanged. Really prime bacons and porkers are worth 6d. per lb. ; good fair do., 5d. to 6d.

The interval which has elapsed since the last null's departure has been a very trying one at times the depression has been profound, and such changes as have occurred have been chiefly downwards. The causes of this stagnation have been detailed in previous monthly reports, and may be briefly recapitulated as follows :-The excessive speculation of a year ago induced the launch of more companies than the public could pay calls In. The process of opening up a quartz mine requires a long time, and the promoters, in many instances, underrated both the time and the money required. There, are scores of mines as yet in the mordy progressive stage, and calling up money, which holders find it inconvenient to provide. The perpetual calls chill speculation, and even dividend-paying mines catch the prevailing infection, and decline in price. Money is generally scarce, the banks not being easy until after the Christmas holidays. Investment stocks have in some cases given way a little, for no other cause than scarce capital. Debentures hold their own, Government sixes being exactly at last month's quotations. Banks have undergone but slight change. Gas companies' shares unaltered. Insurance shares rather easier. Bendigo quartz mines are steadier than the stocks of other districts. Clunes, after being severely depressed, show signs of rallying. The Egerton district very dull, and Blackwood the same. The Steiglitz quartz mines are looking up well. Stringer's Creek quiet ; the two leading mines maintain their value pretty well. The alluvial mines of Ballarat proper have fluctuated considerably. Some once favourites have receded greatly, and some of the fresher mines have advanced a little. During the last week there have been symptoms of a favourable to. action, and In some instances stocks have largely recovered themselves. The Tasmanian gold-fields begin to attract attention in Victoria, Skilled visitors from our gold-fields express surprise at the obvious richness of the stone at Fingal and Waterhouse, and say that the roofs exposed, if in Victoria, would create a furore. The Tasmanians are displaying a good deal of enterprise, and with a fair prospect of being adequately rewarded. There have been some yields of diamonds from Mudgee during November, and a sale by auction is announced of between 200 and 500 stones of various weights. Debentures Victorian Government sixossold al 1916, and very firm at that; no anxious sellers. Melbourne Corporation sixes sold at 108, down 107; no others dealt in.

Commercial Bank have given way a few shillings, without any real cause ; sales at £5 4s. to £6, and a demand at £5 ; sellers at 66 2s,, There have been changes in the staff, and that may have had some influence on the price.
