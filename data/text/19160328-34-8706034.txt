The constable was ordered by Mr- Bevan, P.M., to repeat the language complained of, but -sub-inspector Westeutt objected, on the ground that there were ladies in court. His instructions were to place all obscene language before the court on paper. -Mr. Bevan said he did not know from whom the sub-inspector received his instructions. He (then 1\\.\1.) was- in charge of that court, -The ladies could retire if they chose. They. oR ever, remained-a dozen of them-au Seddon repeated the words alleged to have been uttered by defendants, who denied having used them, the soldier saying he would release. his denial if on his death bed.
