The Aldisga left Melbourne at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday, and at 3.3) p.m. on Monday the Shipping Reporter Iwanled her at the Lightship. Captain Stewart reports light easterly winds and smooth water throughout the passage: and when off Cape Button, at 5.:W p.m., passed the steamer Coorong hence. , The Viceroy bripmtine. from J^ewcastle, was passed by the Aldimra in the I full*. The Kate, Sinclair, master, arrived late on 'Snmlay night, in company n-ith tlie Freak and Maria; but having anchored .rather to the south ward, she was not boarded in time for telegraph. She i3 a very line vessel fur colonial purposes, luring now on board almost 400 tons cargo on 12 feet 6 inches draught of water. The atmospheric disturbances in the Gulf on Monday wen? of a character bearing peculiar interest to those who study such matters. When the Aldinga hove in sight she loomed in an extra ordinary manner from the mirage, and it was evident' that several conlhcting currents of wind prevailed within sight of the stations. To seaward it appeared to be south-west, while on shore it ?was from the northward, and alonif the line of coast there seemed to be a belt of variables in ?which cyclonic currents were plainly visible, though of limited diameter. When the Corsair left the jetty to board tiie steamer, though a brisk breeze blew on the sandhills at the start, she was becalmed on proceeding towards the Wonga buoy. The wind could be distinctly heard, and the water appeared crested with breakers to the southward; but notwithstanding this, the steamer waited five minutes before she was boarded. After leaving, however, a further manifestation of wind currents occurred during the passage on shore, for occasionally the boat headed £. by N., then broke off to X.E. by N. for a few minutes, when she returned to the former course. This ?was repeated several times, and in the gusts of wind tne changes were very sudden in the direc tion of force, afterwards settling into n strong S.E. breeze. __*____ VESSELS IN HARBOUR.
