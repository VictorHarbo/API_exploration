The Australian success is challenging the attention of other countries, and is inducing them to enter into the trade, and there might even be it period of cut-throat company Uou, that the cheapest producer must win in the end. Among our now oom petitions will be Canada, which, as the cable tells us, Is coming strongly into the field. But with the natural advantages which the Manchester delegate indicates we can look forward to the future with confidence. Probably there is no great reason to be alarmed about frosty, ice- bound Canada, last Camilla means business. 'The Liberal lender who is now in other lines formulated his position on this question sub shamefully (wo ciiiitli'iiso his remarks) as follows-We cannot live upon each " other. We must sell abroad. As " regards butter, The (Government will " employ experts to give Instruct))-. "If state grading is considered necits sary, Ministers will tell. We will lower its import duties so as to " facilitate, interchange." Mr. Laurier indicate- what the state can and what it ought to do. There is no doubt that as the permanency and the magnitude and the profit of the trade are proved private enterprise In Victoria will seek to render farms drought proof and to improve the dairy herds, and the departure will grow for the removal of restrictions upon our British Trade. Mr. George (Graham's remarks about the wine trade are to be classed as among the most sensible that have been published of into. What The Rutherglen vigneron says about the prospects of the claret trade being poor may not be the last word to be spoken on the subject, but great value is to be attached to his assurance that there is a growing market for the " full-bodied dry wines of a Burgundy " character, which are widely room " mended by medical 1 men in England, and have latterly chiefly helped to " build up the trade." But Mr. li in but in (oils us that there is a difficulty with the dealers. The dealers have not so much a prejudice against as a distrust of Australian wine, soon use some of it is not out in) proper oniitllllon, and requires much handling In Great further letters it can be put upon the market. They prefer the article they are sure "bout and they always will. Here is the case for those central! cellars for the treat ment of Victorian wine which we have strongly advocated, and which we should have had long before now but for the continuous effort that state aid should take the form of a bounty on of port. The High Tariff' mind must always run in the protective direction. The policy which we would press upon the public is, " improve the quality of the article. " and when the article is good push It '' well in the market you will be " seen me." And now Mr. (!. Cirnhnin, as a practical man, declared for good " wine and good advertising." In so many words, the first consideration with our vignerons is quality, the second is quality, and the third is quality. Mr. Graham tells us that, give the British denies assurance of quality, and the future of the Australian wine trade is safe, and it is in this direction of assuring quality that this state can legitimately help at the start. The British consumption of Australian wine has increased from 2000 to vl.")U,O0t> gallons in ten yours, and here again the British market has no prospect limit for this. With wool, butter, wine, and gold to dispose of, there are boundless potentialities for Victoria. If she has lagged not fall behind in the race it is because she has thought far too much of fostering foreign and improBable trades, and far too little of intelligently perfecting her native industries and of develop- ing her own great as tariff resources. there is to be no Easter encampment this nu A mote -illing course of rationing than that which has led His lining Golan "lent to this iliriMon it would be kind to nature Still it is the pull of ill tooth utmost to minister Mnnstuitil methods if they mi It stems that the eli -pitch of the sender contingent of Mounted Rifles-, to England will cost 1. 100 Hit tinfield str vite parade and review to lit lull in Melbourne are for the Queen s Pittliilnv sales i union will east "initiating, laws and to li it into the expenditure the 20th) ordinarily spent upon the chief causes must It swell Sir George Turner has iiiiiiomitetl lins is the result the Ins arrived at after veil stir out Hit sum and the Minister of Defence appears to June ttc\utescccl with sheep his closely 1 ville nth the I ovtinniciit has been strongly!
