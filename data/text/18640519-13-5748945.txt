Private transactions have been some- what restricted. Tasmanian flour has been sold at £21 per ton, time one month; in Adelaide flour wo havo not heard of sales. Ilorse-feed is in rather bettor demand, and colonial oats, ex You Yanga, with other paTCels, have been placed at full rates. Tho quotations are 4s. ¿ti, to as.

Balk beers are rather dull of sale, and easier in rates. Brandies of the best qualities continue ia demand, at firm prices. Wo have two foreign arrivais to-day-one from Kotteidam and one from Calcutta. The new wharfage duty promisos to press heavily upon timber. The amount of duty paid upon the cargo of the Peiu,213 standard, was £132 ;- under the registration rates the charge would have been £19. The Dutch barque Columbine, 510 tons re- gister, -which Bailed hence for Colombo on 6th December, has sailed thence for Madras coast, to load for Melbourno.

We have received a communication upon the conflicting nature of the news contained in tho late telegrams about the number of veEsela said to be loading at Sin Francisco for Australia. This communication states : - " We have now dates to the 20th Maroh, and on that day no vessel was loading for the Australian colonies with flour. The only one expected to load was the barque Forres, 280 tons, for Auckland, chiefly with barley and oats." Our Tasmanian files are to the 17th lush The Hobart Town Mercury of the 10th says : - " Tho news from tho nolghbourlng colonies recelvod by tlio Tasmania and City of Launceston has com- pletely unsettled the markets, and for tho prosont has effectually checked trade. Arriving just at tho closo of tho week, it was bardi} to ho anticipated that any immediato chango would occur, and it is now roally impossible to quote prices, as no transactions have taken place. Wo know that holdors of vvhoat will demand a considerable advance, but no oporatlons having boen made, it is impossible to fix what that advanco will bo. AYo hoar that a largo parcol of wheat has boon sold at Os. por bushel, 'to he delivered lit three weeks, but wo havo no reliable information on tho subjoct, A fovv small parcels of flour havo been sold to meet lmmodiato local wants, but subject to tho riso in the market when ascertained. In other produco, thoro has been nothing done, and wo, thoroton), doom it advisable still to withhold quotations until business again be- comes active." The Launceston Examiner of the 17th inst reports as follows : " During the early part of lost wook buainoss in the flour and wheat market ruled quiet at former quota- tions, viz., £18 for flour, and from 7s. to 7s. 3d. for wheat. A suddon riso was caused, hovvovor, by tho news roceived per s.S. City of Launceston, on Friday, and tales aro reported at £23 for flour, and 8s. Od. to fls. for wheat. Oats romain at about 8s. lOd. to 4s. for feed. Hay, trussed, £310s. Tasmanian oatmoal, £22. Potatoes, £3 us. to £-110s., according to satnplo, and vvhethorwith or without bags." Tho Sydney Morning Eerala says :-" Wo have papers from Auckland to the 5th inst. The commercial intelligence is unimportant." Onr own dateB are to the 4th only. We are indebted to the Sydney Empire for the following review of the Californian market for breadstuff's, for ten days ending March 21st, the same being extracted from the Mercantile OaztUeoxii Prices Outrent, published at San Francisco, under date March 22 : "Ten days ago tho speculation in broadatufTs ap- peared to bo at Its height, and owing to tbo groat riso In valuo, operations vero measurably suspended. The export demand for England, China, and elsowhero ceased, and largo parcels of whoat and othor grains, bought expressly forshlpment abroad, woro promptly thrown upon tbo market and sold, tbo owners having full confidence that tho advance was not well founded, that tho alarm was prematuro, and that copious rains during the month of March would suffice to socttro au avorago crop of wheat, and bo In good soason to allow of barloy and oats to bo planted. Theso lattor rains that woro predicted by us havo boon vouch- safed to tho stato at largo, and tho supply, it is believed, has been ample. AVo havoprivato ad- vices from Liverpool of tho 3rd of Mareil, via tolo g.am from Now York of the loth inst. Tho market for brcadstuffs was on tho decline. California ship- ment« were selling at a loss, and parties, fearln ra still greater decline, havo withdrawn tho bulk of thtlr wheat orders. " Advices from tho interior aro such as to loavo no doubt in our mind that tho stock of flour and wheat in tho Btato is largo, oven groator than wo liad pre- viously boon led to believe, particularly ia tho counties of Butto and Tcham, also In Sierra county. A merchant travelling through thoso districts carno across a small country mill where woro stored 20,003 quarter-Bick9 flour. At Rod Bluff, anl all through that section of tho country, the stocks of both wheat and flour aro large, and It was to theso points that tho Sacramento millers rosortcd upon the first alarm of tho approaching drought, and thoro mado extensive purchases of grain with which to stock their mills at Folsoin and Sacramento until tho timo of gathoring in the next harvest. To this end they have mado con- tracts with tho steainora to their full carrying capacity, for tho next thirty and sixty days to como, paying 0 nor ton freight on tho rlvor, tho wheat having cost thom in bulk 00c. to 112Jc. per 1001b, in tho in- terior, the buyer furnishing tho sacks. Previous to this excitement in brcadstuffs, thoro had hoon no market for tho surplus wheat and flour in tho counties named, and this flurry was a perfect windfall to tho farmors of that distant region, and thoy woro wiso enough to sell at least a liberal portion of their surplus crop." The Daily Alta California quotes as fol- lows : "Flour.-During tho wook the heaviost transac- tions have been at auction, as follows :-1,000 barrols, Golden Ago, superfino, being a portion of that known as tho ' Garthvvalto ' lot, at 4Jdol. to Sdol. per barrel ; also 645 quarter- casks suporfine, outBido brands, also belonging to tho Garthwaito lot, at 4Jdol. to 4}dol. per barrel. Extra brands aro soiling at about 7dol. por barrel.

From the Port Louis Overland Commercial Qazclte, dated Mauritius, April the 0th, we gather the following commercial Intelli- gence : " The hanks havo lately fixed their rates at 1 por cent, premium on England, which has causo I a do mand for privato bills, at 1 to J por cent, discount, and oven at par.

For Aus tralla there is nothing doing notwithstanding tho favnurablo reports from that direction.

A communication was read from tho hon. the Commissioner of Trade and Customs, having reference h the complaiut of the Chamber with respect to the inconvenience espc-rlenced by the mercantile community in the loading and discharge of vessels, from the frequency of holidays in the Cus- toms department. The SECHETAUY was instructed to acknow- ledge tbo communication, and a deputation was appointed to wait upon the bon. the Commissioner of Trade and Customs on the subject. GIFT TO THE OHAMDEU. The followingcommunicationwasroad from Professor Neumayer : "Montpollcr-torraco, South Yarra, Hay IO. " Sir,-As my stay In tho colony is drawing to a closo, and I am about to roturn to Europo, with the special object of publishing tho result of my labours in connoxion with tho Magnotlc and Nautical Observatory and tho niagnotio survey of tho colony, I fool it in- cumbent upon ino to address you as roprosontant ot a body who, over shire my first arrival in tho colony, gavo mo a most cordial support In carrying out tbo objects of my visit to this part of tho globo. "I respectfully request you to oxprois to tho Chamber of Commerco my sense of appreciation of tho kindness oxtendod to mo, and anxious still further to substantiate my toolings by a small tokou of grati- tude, I havo prepared tho accompanying register of voyagos from Eurolie to Australia, which I bog you to accept on behalf of tho Chamber of Commorco. In years to como such a woll- authonticatod roeord of tho voyages naiuod will nrovo highly valuablo, hy aiding in Billi furthor developing and perfecting tho means of communication with tho mothor country. ' " Based upon this document is my discussion or SCO voyages, which resulted in tho construction of my average routo and trado chart, horoby also proaontoJ to the Chamber of Commerce It romains only for nie to montlon that my work on motoorology and navigation, of which tho abovo-nauiod chartfornna part, will he duly forwarded to you when printed and ready for distribution, which will bo in less than a fortnight. " Kcqucstlng you again to express to the Chamber of Coiniiicrco my most cordial thanks, " I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant, " NEUMAYER. " To the President of tho Chambor of Commoreo, Holbourne." A description of the valuable gift of Pro- fessor Neumayer will not bo out of place here. The Begister contains 800 named voyages from Europe to Australia. The longitudes and latitudes for each day are given ; and the croEsingof the line and the passing of the meridians of Greenwich and the Capo are in- dicated by red lines, thereby facilitating the comparison of the voyages. Below tbe name3 of the ship3 are inserted the exact dates of departure and arrival ; and the seasons in which tho voyages were made are shown by the colour of the fields bearing the geographical position. The seasons are those of the northern hemisphere, green representing spring; red, Bummer; blue, autumn; and white, winttr. This is explained on the bordor surrounding the whole, which is a fixture. The charts are mounted on canvass, and move round two rollers, so that sixty voyages are at once exhibited, and may be compared. The whole ia tastafully ornamented with a border emblematic of ocean navigation, and is in a large cedar case covered with glass. The heading biara tho following inscription :-" Three hundred voyages from Europe to Australia, 1858 1802\. aDd beneath, the words-" Presented to the Chamber of Commerco of Melbourne, by Georgo Neumayer, director of the Flagstaff Observatory." The writing is from the nan of Mr. 0. Willberg, and the construction of the case and the mounting ot the charts were entrutted to Mr. Grimaldi, of Quean- strcat, and the workmanship reflects great credit on both of these gentlemen. On the motion of Mr. BUSH, seconded by Mr. DB LITTLE, the secretary was instructed to convey to Professor Neumayer the high appreciation entertained of his very valuable gilt, ond their reciprocation of the feeling manifested by him towards the Chamber. MEBOANTILE TRADE MARKS BILL. The attention of the Ohamber was directed to the progress made in the Legislative Council with this bill, and the amendments made in it as originally intrcduced, and it was an instruction to tho sub-committee to take steps to secure summary jurisdiction in the infliction of penalties, whether of fine or imprisonment; Buck fine not to exceed £103, and the imprieonment not to exceed one year. ** Tho meeting then adjourned.

HORBB MARKET.-Mr. Charles Brown furnishes tho following ropurt :-" Tho market has boen bardy sup- plied this wook, and tho domand still continues brisk for good useful hacks and light-harness. Heavy draught unbroken stock is likewise in request. I should recommond parties having roally food mobs to forward them as soon as possible." Icssrs. George Kirk and Co. i eport :-" Thero is not much chango in this market to notice sinco our last report. Thero was a fair demand throughout tho week for first-class and good medium draught stock, but tho number offering was limited, and but littlo business was transacted. Inquiry for first-class hacks and light-harness horsos continues oxcoodingly brisk, and high ratos aro freely offorod. Inferior descrip- tions meet with Utile attention. Transaction! in un- broken stock havo been unimportant, but fow lots having como to hand. Good strong upstanding colts oro much wanted, and wo would adviso holders of such to sena thom forward." LABOUR MARKET.-Tho female immigrants per Tudor havo all boon engaged, and about ono-thlrd of tho married couples by this ship have also obtained employment. For farm servants gonerally tho demand Is very limited, and lu town, comparatively fow en- gagements havo been made. Inquiry for malo domestics is still very light. Thoroughly competent female servants with good references readily procure situations, without any chango in rates of wagoj.
