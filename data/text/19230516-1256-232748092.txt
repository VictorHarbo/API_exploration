? In "Hamlet" the advice iB given about a Danish gentleman who had developed distinct signs of "rats In the garret" to "ship him off to England— they're all mad there." Well, judging by reports as to the mental condition of some of the migrants from the .Cold Land coming to Australia, history is repeating itself, only in this instance the advice: is "ship them off to. Australia," and prpbably, takiug a line by many of the things our politicians are doing—or leaving undone —British statesmen have concluded in their own. minds, "they're all mad there.". But this long-suffering and much-mlsgpverned Continent is decidedly of the opinion that she possesses enough mental erratics of the Australian brand, and so has politely but pointedly asked Old England to keep and look after her own "dlpples." Which somehow reminds me of a story. Brown had presented his friend Smith before the court on a charge ot lunacy, when the following colloquy took place: Magistrate: "What's the trouble with your friend, Mr. Brown?" Brown: "Mad as a March hare, your Honor!" Magistrate: "Symptoms?" Browti: "Swears he's the prophet, Mahomet, your Honor." Magistrate: "Sorry — not strong! enough to commit him." j Brown: "Great Caesar! your Honor, j not strong enough? Why, sir, I'm the] prophet Mahomet myself!"
