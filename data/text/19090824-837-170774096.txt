Clark said inat- it is the intention to in time send out eicht or nine Bibli- v.-ajr«J-Jas '-to work districts m whktti so far there is no Minister of the Gospel so that the Word of God can be placed in the hands of tbe people- So far one waggon is readv to jro out, and will be started on 31*. Clark's return to Bris bane. This was a gift of Mr. John .per ritl, of Coolibunia, while the harness is the gift of Mr. Fleishman, of Ipswich, anil half the cost of tin horses andv outfit has been provided by various friends in dify.'rant parts of the State. The .money for a second waggon, horses an.1 outfit has been left to the ScJcjoty bv the lat-- Mr. ]\Larcus Hansen, of Kiiigaroy, a voung Danish settler who died last November. These sifts were spontaneous.
