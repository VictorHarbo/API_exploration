The 'Schooner Little Fred is a small craft of about 130 tons, which arrived on Wednesday night from Gottenburg, after rather a long passage, which was somewhat increased by her being necessitated to call for provisions at the Frith of Forth. She has been 120 days from Stilly. She had a very tine run to the Line, but thence to tha Cape her program was very slow. On her arrival in the Gulf she passed the pilot-cutter unobserved, andthe master brought her up in the roadstead. The Phillis brig bejng expected from the out ports, the keen opposition amongst the piluts in duced one of them to proceed overland to engage himself as her conductor, and having arranged for that purpose he returned to Port Adelaide till she was ready for sea; hut, in the meantime, another visited the southern port on the same errand, but he was too late to secure the prize.
