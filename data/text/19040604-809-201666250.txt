TRADE m FINANCE. Friday Evening. Shipments of wheat find flour from Com- momvonltli ports during the past week were ngnc, tue uuik again lieing sent from this State. To oversea centres only the shipments to date compare thus: — Exported Nominal to Date. .Surplus. Bushels. Bushels. Victoria 12.227,350 .. 10,500.000 New South Wales .. 0,870,150 .. 17,000,000 South Australia .. 0,640,600 .. 9,760,000 Totals .. .. 25,050,000 .. 40,250,000 To the New South Wales exports by const must be added a moderate total, which lias' come across into Victoria, and been shipped from our ports. But even allowing for this, there are undoubtedly grounds for the impression that the New South Wales crop has been overestimated. The Vic torian crop, as we showed on Tuesday last, is turning out to be above the official preliminary estimate. Of the nominal surpluses of three States there are 20,000,000 bushels still to be accounted for. This is reduced to 10,750,000 bushels by in- tcr-State movements, nnd of the balance from 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 bushels is con sidered by the trade to be under export standards of quality. The total shipped to date is equal to 087,000 tons, of an ap proximate value f.o.b. ports of £3,800,000. The Savings Banks Commissioners will shortly announce another issue of deben tures for the purposes of Credit Foncier advances to fanners. Under the amended provisions of the act governing these issues, the ComUilSoiolicio have the power to issue at one time £200,000, and it is probable that the new emission will amount to this sum. A loan of the extent stated would last the Commissioners, on the basis of present applications from farmers, fo a full year, and no further issue would bo needed until the middle of 1905\. The lust loan on behalf of the .Sav ings Bank was issued on 1st December last, for £100,000 at 3% per cent, at 90%, and the net return to investors was about £3 19/0 per cent., allowing for redemp tion. If it be found necessary to increase or maintain this rate of interest, the rate for advances to farmers will probably be raised from its present level of 4% per cent., exclusive of. sinking fund. The offi cial announcement regarding the Fremantle nnd East Fremantle loan of £80,000 at 4% per cent, at 00, for twenty-five years, will also be made this month. The improved position of the London money market is clearly indicated by the satisfactory manner in which recent loans have been supported. The London County Council's recent loan was covered 44 times over, applications reaching £219,250,350. Small investors, as is now usual in London, received preferential treatment, as com pared with speculators applying for large blocks— a system which should be culti vated locally. Tenders for £2,500,000 India 3 per cent, stock were opened on the 29th April at the Bank of England. The applications amounted to £12,050,000 at prices varying from £97 5/ to £94 10/ the minimum, 'lenders at £95 10/ received about 3 per cent, of the amount applied lor, those above that price being allotted Ick'is £05ei8/6rag PriCC btainEd fr Lh0 The open market rate of discount for hne three months' paper in London has cased slightly during the past week, from ? i .2, I.r .cent. The Bank of Eng land official minimum stands at 3 per cent, so that it is being underbid in the open market by 1 per cent.

The latest statis- i tics indicate that the size of steamers is S'f '' advancing and all the contracts booked during I lie first quarter of the pre sent year give prominence to this fact. Aus- tralasmn orders have, it seems, been coins in freely, and there has also been a decided leaning in certain directions to the ndop- tion of the turbine system. The success 'j t'ns system appears .to be assured, but the actual working results on long ocean voyages have yet to he 'practically demon- j ,lu- A cable advice to-day, address- t ii Avid A lilla, the representative of the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, announces that the first turbine steamer for the Australian coastal trade, the Loongana, was successfully launched yesterday. This steamer is expected to ar rive in Melbourne in September, and will be placed immediately in the Launcoston mail service. It is expected that this ves-. sol will make three 'trips each week and reduce the time of the voyage very con siderably. The effect of cheapening the price of an electric supply is very plainly demonstrat- cu in the reports of the various corpora- turns and companies catering for the wants of householders in other countries. A few days since reference was made to the operation of a London company, but it lias been contended that in that centre popula tion induces extraordinary results, and hence, the inferences drawn from compari son with local facilities may be unfair. The Newcastle Electric Supply Company's figures, however, cannot be objected to on that ground. Turning to the published ac counts, it is found that as late as 1809 the company was onlv sunnlvine B4.15B lamnn. with a manual consumption of 007,093 units, the charge being 5d. per unit. Suc cessive reductions reduced the price in 1903 to 2d. per unit, and the number of lamps had then increased to over 347,000-and the consumption to 0,033.700 units. The ba lance available for dividends in 1809 was £7153, but in 1003 it had advanced to £43,907. If this experience were taken ad vantage of in dealing with the- electric supply of Melbourne anil suburbs, big profits and largely increased facilities to householders would follow. The gold returns for the first five months of the yenr in both Victoria nnd Western Australia show a decrease. Taking the actual mint receipts as representing fairly accurately the Victorian yield, we have the following comparison: — Crude Oz. 1902 283,104 . 1903 320,008 1004 .. .., .. .. 310,003 The decrease compared with the first five months of 1903 is- 10,2-45 crude ounces. The Western Australian figures for the five months compare thus: — inn. Crude Oz.

It is stnted that the mine returns arc taken in all cases as in crude ounces, entirely overlooking the fact that lor some considerable time past the ma jority of the big producers have been stnt- mg their yields nnd- deliveries for export m fine ounces.

Henry R. Merton and Co. Limit ed write on the London tin market, under date of 29th April, thus: — The tendency has been extremely sensitive throughout, and fluctuations in prices were of a see-saw character from day to day. This was due In great part to the existence of options, which expire at the end of this month, the prices for which arc in the neighborhood of £127 10/. Owing to the scarcity of cash warrants bears wore compelled to cover against these options when the tendency wns in an. upward direction, whilst hold ers generally realised when values reached the neighborhood of £128. Shipments from tho Straits for this and next month are expected to be large, and this Induced importers to sell metal for for ward delivery very freely, but at a certain level; leading operators absorbed large quantities, and from £120 for August delivery we improved again to £120 15/. On Thursdny it became hnown that the Banca production. for 1003-1004 would amount to 204,000 piculs. This quantity is somewhat be yond expectations, though not more than suffi cient to make up the amount required for the Banca sales during the remainder of this year as announced. The public was inclined to realise, and on some bear sales prices fell away to £125 6/ for forward delivery and £120- 6/ near prompts' closing about 10/ above the lowest.
