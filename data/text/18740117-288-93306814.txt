' (Loud Cheers.) Indeed; thw meeting' would easily understand^ , that no leuchdntention.opuld{for.0momfht^»e f entertained.

The substitution of Mr. Playfair, a Scotchman and Protestant, for the Catholic. Mir.

Thus the liberals' nave a majority on th« n«w Board, ipite of the political prayer meetings, and other devices of ^heir opponents. Precisely l;he ' same result' ha» followed as Bradford, Notting ham, and otheo place.' Yesterday the elections, for the Londpn .School Boards took pla©$/f The BonjQict has .been remarkable for' the' sudden action of the clergy, who dread the multiplica tion of Board . schools', and cry out against un fair competition. A, Committee' was formed comprising Lord Salisbury and LordShaftesbury tobxing forward thorough' Church candidates, uid some 20 were brought forward under their' mspioes ; the plan of operations being directed by Canon Gregory and the National Society. Fhe London Board cbnsiflts of 49 members, who i«re returned -y the ten divisbns ;of the metro- , polis. The City of London elects 4; Chelsea, 1; Finsbury, 6; Greenwich, 4; Hackney, 5; Lambeth, 5; Marylebone, 7; Southwark, 4; the Tower Hamlets, 5; and Westminster, 5. For the 49 seats there were 75 candidates at the dosing of th« nooainatioii lists, and in all. the ten divisions there were contests except Finsbury, where the candidates equal the required num ber of members. These candidates include four ladies— two pat up for Marylebone, one Miss. -Barbury for the city, and. one Miss Guest for Greenwich. Canon Gregory put up for the city, and with him was joined a Mr. Peck, who came out against the Bitting members, who jointly came forwarden the ground of religious education, the preserva tion .of ' voluntary '' schools and economy of the rates. The Canon has been a fanatical opponent of the London Board. He has op posed their schemes in both Houses of ParUa ment and was signally defeated. But his false statistics and misrepresentations, though oft refuted, have been again and again produced ; and for this occasion the Ritualists and Evan gelicals formed an alliance to return opponents pf the School Board, andlast Sunday, in a large number \ pt , jchurchea 'the . pulpit dram ecclesiastic n was assiduously beaten, -tVery few- of this membersof what is now to be regarded as-.the late Board ^sympathise with thu mpve inent ; . and many of them, Albeit staach Chuwsh, were opposed by the National Society's* Oominittee. This has given a good deal of 'ex citement' to the elections, and aroused a good deal of ? antagonism in the liberal press. For example, the Daily Telegraph, which . ii, de cidedly, favorable to the Church. Establishment, dwelt upon the issues of. tiie -contest yesterday in the following fashion i-j-. .'''.' . '' ..r Mr. Forater himself has almost gone out of his way »t; Livetpool to bestow, hearty praise on the ;fashion in which the London. School Board has met the religious difficulty.. Iti» true that some candidates have been unBcrapu lous enough .to write . and speak as if the bittle lay between religiqn and secularism.; but that: is an ampudent 'misrepresentation. .' CJ^uriph-r men, therefore, can. vote for the-and^nomlf national candidates with a aafe conscience. On the ot^er hand, the. denominational candidates are the s worn ^oes of 'the JEdncation Act ' Toey would jte^rjigto pieces if Jthey could. .They woulcf !aboiish' the* London ^School - Board to morrdW ifjfhey were able. We defy them -to. Contradict ; us when we say that they took ;- a place .among;, its . members in order; ,tp prevent it from, carrying -put the - design . of .the Education Act, .and in erder to make it sea engine of sectarianism. They demand, that 'cafechismsj creeds, dogmas shall be pushed lntojevery lesson, and M pushed by themselves. The system ia pursued with cdnsumma,te^kill by. the most logical of teach ers, -the Jesuits ; but the Conscience Clause forbids its full, development in all Church schools jthat accept aid from the -State, and the verdict jof the IkigliBQ people on the method has more thauence been, pronounced with historic emphasis. It is impossible to speak 'too plainly on this subject. We shall hot Tae -accused of displaying hostility to the Church ; but we warn OanonGrejgbryandhiB friends that whatever inay be the result of the elections to-day, the system of which theyr axe the champions can only stir up hostility to ihe Establishment. Denomina %iobaLeduo»tion is entitled tp fair play, and it has ^ot rather mpise, ' It did much to^ teach the young at a. tima when no national system existed, and 'its. aid is stilL welcome. .But we may remark that the; teaching given in . many Church: Bphools 'f& wretchedly, scandalously bad, oompjared for example, with the resoles of PrusBUUi educafeon. Jit is humiliating to find, si Mrl' John ^ jlejt has saidV ? ' that the - mass ? of thechU^ren leaving school at 10 or 11 49 so without adyieal, effective, or lasting facili-7rin the us ^ of . the ^simplest ^Intellectual iustru- . fi;ehts,n ana Jbe.cause' is found in the fact that managers of itne' Chnroh, .'schools care far more about the. Catechism .'than', about arithmetic. They are much lesB eager to make the children good schel%T8 than good;Churchmen, They use the BchooiWas. nurseries of. \ hostility to Dissent, llenoe. any. one who votes to day. for Canon (Jregory or Canon Cro in wejl votes for clerical bigotry and .domination, for sectarian hatred, for wretchedly taught reading, writing, and arithmetic;,, for stunted, intelligences, ;and for tbe destruction of the national system,, which is the greatest work of the present Parliament. ? Notwithstanding, however, the audacity : of the attempt^on tjbe part «f Canon Gregory «nd the National Sodety to lay their hands oa the' School Board system of London with a view to throttle it. they will aot be beaten as they deserve. By . means of abundant pecuniary resources, parochial organization, plentiful circulation of falsehoods, in the shape of bills. And posters, and sordid appeals to the rate payers, .they have been able probably to carry .some of their candidates. But the result of yesterday'-s elections will not, perhaps, be known till to-morrow morning,, except -in the case of ^isolated contests. My impression is, .that while^Canon Gregory and one or two of the clerical Beds will be returned, the consti tution, of the London Board will not be mate rially altered, and that most of the 30 members of the old. Board who have /sought re-election have been returned. Lord Lawrence, the late Chairman, ^retired, and; I dare say there will be a. majority ion the new Board to elect Mr. Bead, ftL P. , who Jtas, worked hard as Vioe-Chairman,^ «s :his successor, - London' is -so big and un-: wieldy that nothing will move it.

He said that in 1852 and 1853 only two veaaela O named the Osprey were in-Kew Orleans harbor. : The first was a steamship, commanded by Joh» : Power, which on tiie 17th of December, 1852, cleared from N«w Orleans for New York by way ' of Havannah.) He produced her original manl- £ fest. She was of 670 tons, and was built in : the Unitedfitates. (The Qsprey mentioned.hy : Luie was a sailing vessel.)

October, 1851. It contained a daily reeerd of the veaiel, within those-periods. He saldtiuze^ - - ' - was no entry of any other Osprey having left - ? theport ia 1851, 1852, or 1853. He also pro- : du'eed tiie original mantfests, as well as the-U«t of the crew of the Osprey, with the changes iar it. In July or August last he saw Mr. Whalley at New Bedford, and he was with him for from four and a-half to five hours. (A laugh.) He . ' went. with him to the City Library. In crosk-examinatioiu the 'witness said'' he ? had been in this oountry since October last.* Dr.- Kenealy said he understood that the object of the recent adjournment was to enable witnesses to be brought from ?

The scarcity in Bengal wilt affect about twenty-, four milnofla. of people, but it is hoped that ' Madras and Bombay will be spared the horrors ' ~ _ of famine. However, in a few weeks the Ge* yernment will have to provide a food supply ? for this immense population. The general aspect of the ease and the plans adopted by ? Lord Northbrook and his colleagues are thus explained in a letter from the. Secretary for . India, the Duke of Argyll, to^the Lord Mayor, who is uncertain whether he 'should start areUef : . ,- fuad in London. His Grace says^-' The state of the'Eastern dtstriots id considered better than had been expected, and prices wete not ex treme,, thou^i there was lfttle rice , in SnV-'':1'' market.

Besides tiiia the Lieutonant-Goyernor of Bengal has been .authorised to enter upon additional local works, arid to employ these who need work, paying wages In grain, for which purpose supplies are being laid in by Government from Burmah and BTadras. The railway rates for the oonveyanoe of4 grain to distressed distriots have, at the ' 'Viceroy's suggestion, been reduced one-half.
