The following appoared in our Second Edition yesterday "Nation Insulted" Italian Farmers Incensed MACKAY. .Tulv 20. A meeting of farmers of Italian na tionality was held In Mnckay to con- alder the refusal of mill employees to crush cane grown by Italian farmers. Resolutions were adopted setting out "That the action taken by sugar mill workers supported by olflclals of tho A.W.U. is apparently an effort to de-. pnve .Italians ot tne ngnts 01 citizen ship, nt the saino-timo (liimtqdnK their property and depriving them of a live, llhood." Tho resolution .also stated that as the sugar mill workers were crushing cane supplied by Germans, Spaniards, Russians, French, Swiss, Japanese, Chinese, and men of other nationalities they were of the opinion that the Ital ian nationality had been subjected to humiliation and Inhuman Insults which were both unjust nnd unfair, as In the Great War Italians fought and died for tho cause- of Britain nnd her Allies. Thej were much more entitled, they declared, to the respect and consideration of the British people than those who fought them. Italy was recognised as a first-class nation throughout the world, and when the American scheme of immi gration was adopted In 1922 they re stricted the people of German, French, English, Australian, Danish, Swiss, Russian, Spanish, and all other nationalities of Europe, but a certain number of Italian people were allowed to enter, and were treated with full respect. It 'was resolved to forward copies of the resolutions to the. Common wealth and State Governments, the Italian Consul, and Messrs. W. Forgan Smith (Minister for Agriculture), E. B. Swayne, M.L.A., and Dr. L. AV. Nott, M.P., requesting -immediate ac tion: also to the British l'rlme Min ister, and the Italian Prime Min ister, and to ask t''o Italian Consul- General to proceed to Mackay Im mediately.
