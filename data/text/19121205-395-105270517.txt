Burch, sen.. Glanvilic street, Glanville, Port Adelaide, eays: .'For some years a member of my family was suffering with pains in the small of the back. We procured a great many remedies, but none were of any use. One day 1 got a bottle of Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, and these Pills effected a complete cure. To backache sufferers I say-'(iet a bottle of Doan'e Backache Kidney Pills; they will put an end to your sufferings.' " Mrs. Burch says, six years later:-"Tho above statement is true, and I can now strengthen it by adding that the cure has proved permanent,. Doan's Back ache Kidney Piils have also cured my husband of kidney disorder, and these organs have been well and strong for years." Th^ kidneys are the hardest worked and most important. ?e> the most deli cate organs or the human body; then take care of your kidneys and give them help by taking the great kidney and bladder remedy, Doan's Backache Kid ney Pills.
