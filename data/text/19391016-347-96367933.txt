ANSWER TO CORRESPONDENT V.L.J., Pirie West: In reply to enquiries made by "The Recorder" on your behalf the following information has been re ceived from Mr. A. J. Baker (director of the Immigration Department):â€”"A child born at sea of English parentage on an English vessel automatically be comes a British subject, but there is a doubt, as the mother is a Dane and was proceeding to Denmark, whether the birth would be registered in that country. If the registration were ar ranged through the British Consul the child would be British, but if arranged with the Danish Registrar and the na tionality be not declared the child would be Danish. As there is a doubt con cerning the nationality it is suggested that enquiries be made from the Regis trar of Births, London, who, no doubt, would be able to supply the necessary information."
