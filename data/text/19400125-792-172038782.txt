Settlers from Scandinavia A BOOK of historical value, "Non-Britishers in Australia," by Mr. J. Lyng, Harbison-Higinbotham scholar, Melbourne University, 1927, was first published in that year. It was later reissued. The part played in the development and peopling of Australia by races other than the Anglo- Saxon and the Irish has not been, relatively great, but it is considerable. Not many fewer than 50,000 persons of Danish, Swedish and Norwegian blood have contributed their part towards the general life of this country. Just in what way is analysed and set out by Mr. Lyng in this interesting and important studyâ€”one in which evidence of research, industry and skilful co-ordination is easily to be noted. The history of Scandinavians in Australia is one of which they may be proud. It is interesting to note that, commenting on immigration in his Introduction, the author makes this observation: "Maybe some of these young, thinly-populated countries which now have closed their doors to desirable immigrants will some day cry out for them in vain." This furnishes one indication of the spirit in which this study is written. The part played by Scandinavians in New Zealand and the Western Pacific is here treated of for the first time.
