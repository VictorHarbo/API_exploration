The value of this well-known Family Medicine has been largely tested in all parts of the world, and, by all grades of society, for upwards of Fifty Years.

This' INVALUABLE REMEDY produces quiet refreshing sleep, relieves pain, calms the system, restores the deranged functions, and stimulates healthy actions of the secretions of the body, without creating any of those unpleasant results attending the use of opium. Old and young may take it at all hours and times when requisite. Thousands of persons testify to its marvellously good effects and wonderful cures, while medical men extol its virtues most extensively; using it in great quantities in the following diseases.: . Diseases in which it is found eminently useful -Cholera; 1 dysentery, diarrhoea, colics, coughs, asthma, rheumatism, neuralgia, cramp, hysteria, c - , EXTRACTS FROM MEDICAL OPINIONS. The Right Hon. Earl Russell communicated to the College of Physicians and J. T. Davenport, that he had received information to the effect that the only remedy of any service in Cholera was Chlorodyne. See Lancet, December 31st, 1864. From A. Montgomery, Esq., late Inspector of Hospitals, Bombay.-" Chlorodyne is a most valuable remedy in neuralgia, asthma, and dysentery. To it I fairly owe my restoration to health after eighteen months' severe suffering, and when all other remedies had failed." Dr. Lowe, Medical Missionary in India, reports (Dec. 1865), " that in nearly every case of Cholera in which Dr. J. ' Collis Browne's Chlorodyne was administered, the patient re- covered.'' Extract from the General Board of Health, London, as to efficacy in Cholera-" So strongly are we convinced of the immense value of this remedy that we cannot too forcibly urge the necessity of adopting it in all cases." Beware of spurious and dangerous compounds sold as CHLORODYNE, from which frequent fatal results have followed. See leading article, Pharmaceutical Journal, August 1st, 1869. which states that Dr. J. Collis Browne was the inventor of Chlorodyne that it is always right to use his preparation when Chlorodyne is ordered. CATION. None genuine without the words "Dr. J.

The Phos- phodyne acts electrically upon the organisation for instance, it assists nature to generate that human electricity which renews and rebuilds the osseous, muscular, nervous, membranous, and organic systems. It operates on the system without exciting care or thought upon the individual as to the process. It moves the lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, stomach, and intestines, with a harmony, vigour, yet mildness unparalleled in medicine. The Phosphodyne gives back to the human structure, iii a suitable form, the phosphoric or animating element of life, which has been wasted, and exerts an important influence directly On the spinal marrow and nervous system, of a nutritive, tonic, and invigorating character, maintaining that buoyant energy of the brain and muscular system, which renders the mind cheerful, brilliant, and energetic, entirely overcoming that dull, inactive, and sluggish disposition which many persons experience in all their actions. The beneficial effects of the Phosphodyne are frequently shown from the first day of its administration, by a remarkable increase of nervous power, with a feeling of vigour and comfort, to which the patient has long been unaccustomed. Digestion is improved ; the appetite increases wonderfully ; the bowels become regular ; the eyes brighter ; the skin clear and healthy and the hair acquires strength, showing the importance of the action of the Phosphodyne on the organs of nutrition. Finally, the Phosphodyne maintains a certain degree of activity in the previously debilitated nervous system ; its use enables all debilitated organs to return to their sound state and per-, form their natural functions. Persons suffering from Nervous Debility, or any of the hundred symptoms which this distressing disease assumes, may rest assured of an effectual and even speedy cure by the judicious use of this most invaluable remedy. - I DR.

The following letter has been received from WILLIAM BOARDS, ESQ., son extensive agriculturist and land agent, residing at Edmonton, Middlesex : " Nightingale Hall, Edmonton. Dear Sirs-I have recently suffered much from a most violent cough, proceeding from a tickling in my chest, which no remedy, out of many 1 resorted to, could allay. My head was constantly aching, and my whole frame entirely shaken. Having seen the good effects of your Balsam of Aniseed in several members of my family, I purchased a small bottle, and, when going to bed at night, took a teaspoonful in two tablespoonfuls of water, just warm. The effect was immediate ; it arrested the tickling in my chest, I slept well, and arose perfectly restored in the morning, with the exception of debility, arising from fatigue by incessant coughing for some days previous. My cough entirely left me and has never returned. Having since heard of a lady in the neighbourhood who for a long time had laboured under a most distressing cough, and who had resorted to every remedy Within her knowledge, I sent the remainder of the bottle to her and that long-standing, obstinate, and (as she thought) incurable cough was perfectly cured. You are at perfect liberty to make what use you may; please of this communication, as the contents are strictly true. I shall take every opportunity of recommending your in- estimable medicine, feeling as I do fully assured of its efficacy. " I am, dear sir, yours very truly, " WM. BOARDS."
