Tbc Margaret Thomp son was en the port lack, and was well over the South reef when the Martha Elizabeth w»s observed dose aboard on the lee bow, with no light visible. Captain Sul livan, of the Margaret Thompson, seeing at once that he could not pass to leeward, put his helm a-lee and, hauled down his head sails, btinging the vessel on the wind, at the same time calling to the schooner to keep away ; but she come on and struck the brig in the starboard bow, doing considerable damage to both vessels. The James left KotumB on the 20th February, at which port she reports the arrival of the harah Ann, from Sydney, which Tesecl had lost her mainmast and greater portion of bulwarks and deck cargo, and had a large quantity of water in her hold when relieved by the Clarence racket, ana piloted safely to anchorage.

Downs on thc 2nd December, and Ply mouth on thc Cth. After clearing tlic Channel she encountered very heavy gales ; thc bowsprit cheeks got adrift, allowing tho spar to work to such a degree that the vessel strained herself forward. Crossed thc equator on the thirty-nth day, and the meridian of Greenwich on the eislr-firtt day out, and passed Cape Pillar on the ninety-eighth day from Plymouth ; on tho flth instant in latitude 47-23 6., longitude 127-47 E, she brnached tu while running in a heavy gale, losing part of her bulwarks, and filling thc cuddy with water. Tihks ok BoAitn Ships oa in WjLnBHovsKS, &c.; — A finjply constructed 8&d; most efficient machine for extinguishing tires was tested on board thc bulk Cameo, at Mr. John Cuthbert's wharf, Miller's Point, on Monday afternoon, by thc patentee, Mr. John Korff, and thc No, 2 Volunteer Fire Bngade, in thc presence of some of thc Pin Insurance Companies, Consuls, managers of steam companies, and scientific men. When the small engine or thc brigade was set to work, the wa^cr was thrown all about the Bhlp'e hold in a very powerful stream, which soon gave her a thorough washing below, Mr. Sown, superintendent or the Insurance Fire Brigade, wne present, -who, with thc No. 2 Volunteer Fire Brigade, pronounced U a most ex cellent contrivance. Vbe whole of thc working is from the main deck. The following in a particular description of tbc machine:— It consists of a mnin and revolving branch, stancheon, pointer or index, and an endless chain or connecting tods, with a flange for resting it on the deck. A hole about seven or eight inches having been cut through thc ship's deck, you drop the branch and main through it until it rests on the deck flange The water hose is attochctl to luc main in thc usual way, end the force pump set ui motion, when a hoavy stream of water may bo conducted and thrown to any angle or place on thc under side of thc deck in thc ships betwbtt-decks or bold, &c;, &&, or may be. thrown out of the hole through which the main and branch have been passed. A man is stationed on deck with tho index in his hand, an officer on deck points to thc place where thc fire i& raging below, the man directs tbc index to tbc spot, thc water ie immediately brought to bear on thc under side of thc deck which is on fire, &c;, tire. Ono of the most essential points in this fire branch is th:it all thc hiitclies must be kejilon, and all openings doped. This up sists in extinguishing tbc fire by shutting olf thc current of air whilst tbe water is being conducted to that part of the sbip on lire by tho branch working in any required direction below thc decks. Another advantage attending this fire branch is that tho orifice in thc 'nozzle' (several sizes can be fitted) may be much larger than those generally used on thc common fire branch, and will therebv conduct a much more powerful stream of water on the devouring clement. Such is as correct a verbal description of this new invention as can well be given. 1'uf. Post BTr.rciExs Light.— Tbc Doeribang steamer, under the charge of Captain Pelley, left Newcastle for Port Stephens on Monday morning, at c^ en o'clock, having on board Mr. Dawson, Colonial Architect ; Captain Watson, Pilot department ; Captain Allen, Harbour Master ; and several other gentlemen; besides thc lighthouse-keepers, wilk their families, stores, furniture, &c; Thc weather looked somewhat threatening, there was not much sea— a fine breeze was blowing from the S.E. Thc steamer arrived alongside the jetty at Fly Roads at 3 p.m. The party, stores, &c.;, having been landed, an inspection of tbe lighthouse was made, and it was resolved to try the effect of the light out at si-a. Tbc light having been lit, the party again embarked on board the steamer, and proceeded out to sea at 9 p.m,, taking observations of the light from all parts of thc compass Ecawiird ; returning to anchor at 1 am. Next morning the steamer pro ceeded up to Canington ; unfortunately, it never ceased raining all day, which prevented the magnificent scenery from being pro perly appreciated, but, nowithsumduig thc unpropitious state of thc weather, the party apjicarcd to enjoy thc trip. Two of tho party having been landed at Currington en route for Raymond Terrace, thc Dooribang returned to Kelson Bay and anchored for thought. Yesterday morning steam was again got: up, and the steamer proceeded to Fly Bonds. The party landed, and having made on omcial examination of the light-house and out-buildings, returned on board, arriving at Newcastle at coven o'clock last evening. Captain Pctlcy kindly informs us that thc light is placed on Point Stephens in a most admirable position, and from the appearance of thc light from obserrations made when thc steamer was out at sea thc night previously. It is his opinion that the light can be seen for a considerable distance, and will be a most valuable light for vessels bound north. When the light is pcr mancntlv lit, Port Stephens will undoubtedly become a great har bour of refuge for coasting vessels.

VICTORIA. We give below, in a eomowutt abridged form, an account of tho voyage of H. M. B. B. Victoria, Commander Norman, and of tho movements of the expeditions of Walker and Ltinsborough, which is published in thc Eockhamplon Bulletin or thc 8th in stant: n. M. 6.8. Victoria, 7 guns, Captain Norman, from thc Gulf of Carpentaria (Suaecr's Island) on the 12th ultimo, is now InKcppol Day, (or fuel, on her way to Moreton Bay. She left Moreton Bay on tho 24th August, 1801, with thc . l'lrcny in company, having on board thc Brisbane part]- and horses. Arrived off tho Barrier on the 1st September, and in a heavy gale from tho 6.K., the two ships were separated. Victoria entered thc Barrier on the 5th; arrived at Sir Charles Ilardy's Island, found the Fire, fly a complete wreck on north Sir Charles Hardy's Island— twenty-seven of thc horses had been got out and were on shore— thc ship full of water— thc three dead ones floating about in the hold amongst stores of all kinds. The remains of a wreck, containing the carcases of twenty horses, which the captain of the Jeanie Oswald reported having seen on Sir Charles Hardy's Island was not the Firely but the Lady Kinnaird, bound for India. The Firefly was wrecked on a sunken rock north of the same island. On thc 11th thc ship was abandoned by her master, being past all repair for sea service. The Victoria's crew then lightened her ol everything, and euccccded, after great labour, in getting her ofl' and taking her round to tho Ice side, where she was cleansed, ballasted, and horses resbrpped, and thc vessel made thc best of, by patching hcrup, to tow her on to thc head of thc gulf by thc 22nd. Arrived at Booby Island on tho 23rd. After cxnmining stores there for shipwrecked seamen, and adding to them, proceeded, and arrived in Investigator Roads on the :'Ulu, The hulk wsb towed tho whole way, and In a fresh S.E. gale Inbound fo much, as to roll away licr jury masts, choked botli pump*, with vhrcc and u-b»U feel of water in ber hold. It was fcarcant this time she must be abandoned. TJio gale, fortu nately, nflcr blowing for thirty-six hours, decreased as fast as it rose— the sea mid wind going down suddenly, when, thc pumpn being cleared, thc water wus got out of her and the \caks kept under, which cnubtid her to arrive in Investigator Roads In safety, where the Gratia and Native Lass, colliers, were awaiting the Victoria's arrival. On the luih October, thc hulk was towed over to thc mouth of thc river. Gn thc 12th, cntctcd thc river, after grounding on tho bar twice. She was then towed by boats and kedged up as tar as it was iound nccctsnry lor lauding the horses satSy, which was nearly twenty miles from thc entrance. Oa tho 17th, all the hurscs but two— which were too weak— were safely landed. Thc hulk was then tnken up by tho same means, about two miles above Islund Reach, where she was secured to lorm a depot. Much labour and cure were required hi getting the hulk up, us there was only one tide in tho twenty-four houre— and it was always high water at night— independent of the hulk requiring almobt continual pumping. Thc colliers named, having com pleted discharging their cargoes, left for I3atavia on the 3UU On tbe 16th November, thc horses belonging to the Brisbane party, being in thorough condition, they were started on u south western exploration, and returned on the 19th January, after going about 200 miles. Walker arrived at the depot on December 7th for n supply of provisions, having found Burkc's tracks on thc Flinders Hirer, leading S.S.I;., but was unable to follow the trail until he re ceived supplies ; be returned to do so on thc 20th. His party wire in good or*cr and in excellent spirits. Walker was determined, if possible, to follow up Burkc's tracks throughout; he has now been seventy-eight days from tlic Albeit, and he may therefore be shortly expected in Melbourne His pvovitiplis were replenished by Captain Norman, his supplies being ample for four months, and with a little economy, capable of c ci vinfr thc party for five months. Hoizfcldt, one of Walker's party, has returned to Rockhampton, and his place has been nup lilied Ik a volunteer trotu the. Victoria, Mr. Arthur Moore. Thc journey from Rockhampton to thc Albert Rircr occupied 104 days. Thc country from tbc Victoria or Barcoo River, to the Albert, ie generally not inferior to thc Mitchell district, aud well suited for depasturing stock. Walker's party had several encounters with, thc natives, and he had a narrow escape, when akmo with a trooper, and within tho sound of Captain Norman's signal guns. Tli-y were surrounded by EiAty blacks, and (.scaped only by making a fi-co use ol' their rifles. The Albert and Flinders are slid to both be very fine rivers. The country near the Gulf, in the vicinity of those rivers is sxvunipy — to a great extent covered at high water, and at low Water presenting thc appearance of extensive mud flats with patches of mangrove. The country through which thc Albert flows is for the most port inferior ; but the banks of thc Flinders are excellent either fur pasture or for cultivation— there being conic five feet deep of block mould, and the laud is sufficiently bi^li at a few miles distance from tbc sea to be beyond the reach of tides or Hoods. Thc Lcichhardt is also a fine river. In addition to the three rivers mentioned, there arc other rivers and creeks Tunning into the Gulf ; but there Is an extensive bar stretching along tbc shore, and extending two or three miles out into the Gulf, obstructing thc entrances to these rivers. In thc channels or the Albert and Flinders navigated by Captain Norman, there were net more than five feet water on tho bar at high tide. A singular feature about the tides there is, that there is only one tide in the twenty-four hours, and that ahvaj-6 during the nijiht. The tides never rise to tbc full before about ten p.m., and they aie later every night, until they reach the hour of three a.m., or about that time, when they suddenly chop back to ten p.m. Landbbonragh'fi party abo staried off from thc Albert River, oil thc 101b February, in Burke's track, with four months' pro visions, but he will probably make for Brisbane. ~ Landsborough's party on the first exploration consisted of W. Landrtwrough, leader; H. N. Campbell, second in command; Captain Allison, assistant ; and two native troopers. Fisherman snd Jemmic, On the present expedition, the leader, Mr. Bourne, W. Lccson, and three native troopers, Fisherman, Jemmic, and Jackie, with twenty- one horecs ; the remainder or thc party are brought round by thc Victoria, which left Investigator Roads on the 12th February; Booby Island on the 15th, ana Port Bcnism on the 26th February. Strong S.E. gales, with squally weather and much rain, have been experienced thc whole way from Cape York to the South Cumberland Islands. Tbc Queensland Guardian of the 15th adds :— Commander Norman arrived in Brisbane by the Clarence last evening. We were glad to find him look so well, and to learn that his officers &nd; crew bad enjoyed good health. One sad event occurcd during the trip — namely, the accidental shooting of gunner James Frost. It appears that he was in charge of thc depot party at Suaecr's Island, and whilst lying in his tent he attempted to reach a fowl ing-piece, but something coming in contact with the trigger the gun went off, thc contents being lodged in the right side of the l-oor fellow. Be lingered four days, and was buned by his com nides. He was universally esteemed, and an excellent officer. Captain Norman states that the country on thc Albert is really pood, the banks of tbc Flinders being EtiUmore uudulating, and with better vegetation. In tbe channels or the Albert and Flin ders there is not less than four feet of water at low tide, with from eieht to twelve feet rise and falL We shall look forward to Captain Nonnan's reports with great interest. Much good will result fioin thc visit of thc Victoria to tho North; the fact of f. nding out that Burke mistook Flinders for the Albert, being wvonly miles away from the bitter, is a proof of the importance of thc trip , the track having been found. The Victoria arrived at Kockbampton on Friday, the 7th instant, and left that port on Wednesday, the 12th, sighted the Clarence off Wide Bay. She will take in coals and provisions, and leave for Melbourne during next weefc. THE LOSS OF THE BARQUE NORNA, AsKFxr.n is a copy of two communications relative to thc loss of tbe English barque Norna, Wilson, from Newcastle (N.S.W.), for Hongkong, on an uninhabited island in thc Pacific Ocean, known as St. Augustine, but as regards the fate of tho crew nothing is known :— ' H.M.

We arrived at this island, in aU thiny-onc bar.dp, in one longboat and two smaller ones, on the Mb of April ; and on thc 17th of April Captain Wilson, wife, and child, the chief officer (Mr, Robinson), one Kulntaker, tiro quartermasters, and two lascars, left this in the longboat, taking aU scxtantE, chronometers, and compasses, leaving nothing, in case they were lost.

Film ok Boaud the AnAnixr.*.— On thc night of thc 16th ultimo, between ten and eleven, the town was alarmed by thc ringing of the lire bell, followed immediately after by thc sound ing of thc alarm bugle at the Mount Cook Barracks, and it was not ten minutes after thc first ringing of thc bell that the military engine was seen proceeding down Cuba-street, but no fire was anywhere visible. Thc Liverpool and London engine was aleo brought out, but it was impossible to find out where the fire was. It was at last found to be on board thc barque Arabella, and was first discovered by Mr. Mason, thc tide waiter on board, who immediately gavo tho alarm, wben signals of distress were at once hoisted. Thc police, under Inspector Atchcson, the crew of the Albcmarlo, and several boats from shore, immediately put off to her to render eeBisuincc. Smoke whb discovered issuing from thc hold under thc chief cabin, and a number of mattresses, wlilch wero shipped for Napier, were found to be on fire, which, however, wasspccdily exliiiguifhed. A tin was afterwards found under the sails, con taining a piece of cunvas saturated with turpentine, which was imitlv consumed, and it is supposed to have been placed there purposely. Tho jury were of this opinion, for at an inquest that was held the next day, they returned the unanimous verdict, ' That thc vessel had been set on fire by some person or persons unknown.' — New Zealand Advertiser, March 8. By a letter received in town on Saturday from Captain Rcacrort or the Prince ltcccut, lying in Recherche, we learn that tho Nau tilus, Maid of Erin, and Southern Cross, wcro also lying there. Captain llencrort further reports that when off tho Chatham Islands thc Prydc was there, with the samo as last rcportod ; tho Emily Downing 20 tuns, and several American ships doing nothing, captain Beaeroft further says as follows :— ' I camo round tbc Three Kings, and through thc middlo ground, and there I eaw a vessel bottom up, on the llth January, 16G2, in lau 35 degrees 57 minutes 6., and long. 162 degrees 20 minutes E.

On thc 10th thc proposed scheme for establishing monthly steam communication between England and Australia, via tbc Cape of Good Hope, was brought under the notice of tho Chief Secretary and Minister ol Finance, by thc committee appointed for that purpose at a meeting held at tho Criterion Hotel, Mel bourne, on tbe 3rd, when tbc project was first formally submitted by Mr. BurstalL Both hon. cenUcmcn concurred with the pro moters of thc scheme as to tlio great desirableness of having a regular line of dtcutners running between this colony and tho mother country, for the convryuicc of passengers as well as the mails, and cxurcMeil a eeueral approval of the scheme submitted to them. Mr. BurstiOl explained tho leading features efthe project, which have already boon published in the Argus, and replied to some doubts which have been raised In our columns, by correspondents, as to the accuracy of bis calculations of tbc ex pense of carrying the scheme into operation. To confirm tho correctness of bis estimate u to the cobt of thc proposed steamers, he e'atcd that the cost of tie Great Eastern, including launching, was about £28 per ton ; and In bin estimate ho put down thc pro bable cost at £30. Mr. O'Shanassy asked thc promoters to fur nish him with a written statement of their scheme, setting forth tho assistance which they wished to rccclvo from Government : and he promised that be aid bis colleagues would give It careful consideration, and give a definite answer as to their news without loss of time. Strong hopes wcro held out that the Government and the Parliament of tic colony would bo willing to aid tho BChemc ; end a general opinion waB entertained that tho matter ought to bo pressed fontard without delay. The deputation expressed a confident belief that if thc Government would guaran tee four per cent.

Plymouth, Saturday, January 25.— The ship Moravian, 988 tons register, Commander William Edward, belonging to Messrs. George Thompson, jun., and Co., of SL'Hclcn's-plaoo, London, stxty-Bix days from land to land, or sixty-nine from Melbourne, is gone up Channel, bound for the Thames.

Tho Moravian brings sixteen passengers, among whom ore Mr. and Mrs. Bnndo, Misses Bunco, and Messrs. Trebor, M'Konric, and M 'Donald. Her gola freight Is 50,000 ounces, valued at £200,000, andthocargo includes 2B44 bales or wool.

Cairncross the Master ot tbe ship Cairngorm, appeared before Mr. Woolrych to answer a claim for wages made by Mr, James Edwards, late thc chief mote, for services on a voyage from London to Sydney and back. Mr. Smith appeared for thc complainant, Mr. Young for the defendant. It ipncared that thc complainant bad suc cessively tilled the ofilce of boatswain, second mute, and ohief mate, on board the Cairngorm, during thc voyage, and that he had been supplied with nlc, beer, spirits, and wiiieVUic steward, for which £15 13s. was charged. The bill was objected to, and it was alleged that an exorbitant price was charged for thc liquids supplied to complainant, and that thc ale, beer, and spirits on board sbip were free tram duty.— Mr. Smith said thc tame price was charged to complainant as was charged to pas&cu-; ern- and that, bi b matter of practice, thc owner i of a ehfp were not supposed to make any profit out of stores supplied to a mute on board. The result of the inquiries ho uiado was, that thc complainant ought to have been charged ubout one-half the £16 13s. named in tbe account. — Mr. Young objected to tbc result of thc inquiries.— Mr. Woolrich said thc question was, were thc charges fair and reasonable 2 Tho complainant objected in thc first instance to a charge or 15s. Cd for a pair or light plaid trousers of inferior quality.— Mr. Young said by his advice tbe defendant would take oft* £5 from tho bill ; that was a reduc tion of nearly one-third.— Mr. Smith : He is charged quite enough now. — Mr. Woolrycb : Thc reduction is a very fair one indeed. As to tbc trousers, that is nothing out of tne way, and 1 shall allow 15s. Od. for them. Pay tbc complainant £5 11s. Cd. and one guinea costs.— ttitchelPs Register, December 21. JIktout op ins SHirgrBAniDOM, Ross, from Sydney, (-V.S.W.) September 20 ; experienced S. and S.W. winds until round tne souih of New Zealand ; from thence to Cape Horn chiefly N. and N.W. winds ; fell in with Ice in longitude 1C3 W., and ran amongst it till in thc longitude of 91 W., had considerable de tention in rounding to. in auk, blowing, foggy nights ; most of tbe Icebergs considerably decayed. Passed Cape Horn October 18, and bod a moderately propitious passage to the tropic or Capricorn, where ihey were detained ronrtccn days witn calms, frc. ; crossed tbe Equalm November 23, nnd had good N.E. trades, which carried them to latitude 35 N. Was off Scilly December 12, where they experienced n heavy S.S. \V. gale, and lost several sails and spars. Made the Li/.ard on the ulght of December 13. In latitude 7 N., longitude 25 W., November 20, saw a schooner keeping on our weather bow, and, gradually stealing down on us*; sbe a&ioe; near us aboal dusk, and exchanged flfmalii, Fbe showing American colours. Directly she saw our flag she took In her small sails, jib, &c;, and reefed her topsail and dropped artcrn. I thought, at first, this might have been n schooner whaling, but not seeing whalcboats, I hardly knew what to inakcof bcr. She was evidently wcil manned, as sail was reduced very tmartly.— ttitc hell's liejtitcr, December Total Wbeck op the A. H. Stkvenr at the C»rF.— We re gret to have to add to thc list or casualties recently leeorded that or the wreck or tho fine American-built clipper ship A. H. Stevens, BD9 tons register, Copuiui Talbot, well known in Table Bay. Thc vessel sailed from Moulmcin on tbo lllh December, with a cargo of tcakwood for Falmouth, and experienced very heavy weather in tbc passage down. Near the line she tiglitcd a wreck supposed to be tbc Woverley, but waB horscll in such a plight that thc captain could render no assistance In a violent cyclone which she encountered off Mauritius she sprung a leak, and the crew had not been able to pump her dry for a fortnight, when tbc captain attempted to put into Table Bay yesterday morning. Missing the entrance to tbe bay in the fog, thc contain got too near thc north-westcm coast of Robben Island, and the wind failing, thc current carried the ship rapidly towards the shore. Vailing in an attempt to wear to the southward, thc captain let go the anchors In thc hope or staying her progress towards thc land ; but they dragged, and' he continued to drill towards thc spot where the Bernicil was wrecked, finally striking within a short distance of thc place where that Ill-fated craft met destruction. She struck stem foremost, and thc first bump carried away the rudder, and started thc stcrnpost. As soon as he perceived bis danger the captain made signals of distress, which being repeated from thc Lion's Rump were received at the Port- office at about half-post nine, and instructions were given for the screw steamer Albatross to go to tbc assistance of thc distressed ship, Unfortunately, the Albatross's boilers were empty, and her mo chuury was on the point of being disconnected ; consequently some delay occurred in fretting her off, and it was half-past nine before she got alongside tbc A. H. Stevens. Captain Tulbot, to ease bis ship, bad the maste cut away, and thc most strenuous exertions were made to get her off, but without efiect. She was so firmly embedded on tbe rocks that- thc utmost power of thc steamer was insufficient to move ber. Once the Albatross herself was injrrcat danger. The cable fouled tbe fan, and that being rendered useless, thc swell was rapidly carrying her towards shore broadside on, when, fortunately, the cable was got clear of the fan, and she steamed out again to a safe distance. Ihc ship became a total wreck. — Cape Argils, February 6. The Kent, 926 tons, Captain Ciavton, 82 days from Melbourne, arrived off Plymouth on thc 7th of January. She left Port Phillip October 15th, rounded Cope liorn November lllh, crossed the Line December 7th, and wae off thc above Don January Cth, at 7 a.m. Oh October 2;tb, in longitude 1C2 W., latitude 52 S., ice was sighted, and before 3 p.m. Cl bergs, some 200 feet high, were passed : they were observed north and cast as far as the syc could reach ; thc ship was, in consequence, run 6.S.E. under double reefs until 7 p.m., when scarcely any ice could be debcried ; at a, thc wind increased to a heavy gale, which continued until 5 a.m, on thc 28tb; only one berg woe then seen, which lay to the north ward. It was most providential that the Kent ran through this fearful ice ridec by day and birfore tbc storm. Icebergs, fiamc350 feet high and IA mile long, were, however, passed daily until November 9th. The Azores were made December 23rd, from which date to January 4th strong head winds from thc eastward prevailed.— Dome Kms, January 27 th. WBECK OF TBE AMERICAN' EiEClUE \VavEBLT.— The ECCOnd officer of this vessel has furnished tlic following account of her lose :— ' We left Moulmcin on thc 3rd or November, Amherst, 10th. On tbe 2Slh December we had strong K.N.E. winds, which increased to a gale. We shortened canvas and ran, our course being W.S.W., and kept this course until the 5th of January. We were thca compelled to hcavc-to under bare poles, thc ship making veiy bad weather. We then put her head to tbc north with great difficulty. This was on the Cth. We then found from heavy straining she made a deal of water. We bad to lasb our echvs to the fmmps, the sea making a clean breach over us, hut with the utmost exertions, she still gained upon us. We then concluded to cut away our masts, which was done, except thc mainmast ; thc sea came with such force that it washed us away from our lashings at thc pumps. Tire ship was thca settling so fast we were compelled to take refuge in the main rigging. We lashed ourselves to this, and even then thc sea made a clean breach over, us ; we expected every moment to go to the bottom. On the 7th, tbe soft cot smoother, and we strove to gel souic food by descending w the poop ; but alas ! when we got there we found not a vettigc remaining except some pumpkins under one of thc small boats lashed to the bcarcrE. ?Sail, ho! 'was turn critc, which proved to be a brig close to us, which certainly must have seen us. They did not take thc slightest notice of us. We spent thc remainder of that day and night in thc poop without food. The following morning we mended our boats, our onlv bone. This day was alto spent without food, as waB thc night following. On the 8th bo food, no water— our thirst was punishment in the extreme, A strong south-east wind caused the sea once more to wash clean over us. We spent tbo day in fixing the boats, which were stove in. At sundown not a sign of relief , This was on thc 9th. Discipline compelled even the merchant seaman to keep a sharp look-out, and trusting to him, and more fervently praying to the Disposer or £vonts, we endeaveured to sleep. Atteno'clock ?Sail ho!' was again cried, which proved to be tho Minahaha, from Calcutta to Glasgow, which hovc-to and towed us to Table Bay— thank God.'— Cape Argus, February 6. ExTnAonnniAiT DELivr.nAKCE.— An officer of her Majesty's sbip Topaze, writing to a friend resident in Plymouth, under date of September 30, 1881, from Esquimau Harbour, Vancouver Island, after stating that their ship had made a fine passage of forty-three days from CaUao, arriving at Vancouver Island on thc 20th of September, gives the following statement :— ' On thc morning of the 7th or September a boot under sail was reported to the captain, who at once ordered thc ship to be bovc-U», in order to let the boat come alongside, as thc wind was blowing from her towards us, when we gave her a tow-rope. There were only two men in her, one of wbom turned out to be an American and thc other an Irishman. Thc boat was a sloop of about twelve tons, with a deck on her, and at thc masthead was flying thc Yankee flag upside down. The men on coming on board seemed nearly famished, and they ate greedily thc food we gave them, until at length thc doctor had to forbid them eating any more. We towed thc boot astern tot four or five days, but one night, when we were going very fast through thc water, she ported thc hawser and broke adnft. When the men came round a little — for at first they were quite bewildered— we gathered from them and thc log they bad kept tbc following particulars:— They were In thc employ of an Englishman, who has a manufactory of cocoanut oil on an island called Fenning's Island, about four degrees north of the Equator. He sent tbc sloop with thc captain (the Yankee!, a cooper, an Irishman, and two Kanaka or Sandwich Island UuIb, to go to Washington iBland, distant about twenty-four hours' sail, for thc purpoEc of procuring staves to make casks for the cocoanut . oil. They could not sec thc island for a fog, and then adverse winds drove them out to gca. They tried to roach Fenning's island again, but could not on account of strong currents and ad verse winds. After having been many days out they fell in with a French ship, from which they obtained tbeir latitude aud longitude. They could not make out whether thc Frenchman said 156 or 108 longitude, nowever, they worked bv one of tbe two, and found themselves eo far to thc north that they tried to get to the Sandwich Islands. When they had boon be tween fifty and sixty days out tbc two Kanaka lads died, one soon after thc other. I think it not improbable that the white men murdered them, as they must have been very short or food, having only taken away with them thirty days' provisions, and. besides that, they occasionally caught a shark or some other fish ; and lbcy also had come rain, and managed to catch the water, or else 1 expect they would not have been alive so long. The last shark they caught was with a piece of Kanaka flesh lor bait. In tbc bold of thc eIooji we found a cask containing pieces of this flesh salted down like pork or boef. When we picked up thc two men thev bad Veen out ninety days, from June 9 to September 7. Poor fellows! they must havo hod a terrible lime of iL How providential it was that we should have come right across tbeir track 1 Thc day after they were saved (Sunday) our chaplain re turned public thanksgiving to Almighty God for their safe de liverance from thc perils and dangers of shipwreck.'— Mornina Star, December 20.
