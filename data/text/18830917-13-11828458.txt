MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1883. ? Tilo Public Sei vico Bill has row had the benefit of a toloiably full discussion m llio couospondcnco columns of the pi ess, and it cannot be claimed that any sonous biota have been pointed out feo many men so many opinions, may bo saul about tho details of tho civil sei vico an ango monts, but as rcgaids lending clauses it does not appeal as if Mimsteis would havo to îccast then measuie 'Hie ex toption is as to the selection of tho audit commissioucis as tho boaid to administoi tho act, a stiong opposition to tho appointment of theso oihccis having been manifested both m tho Houso and in tho countiy Pi o bably if any othei individuals had beon named they would not have escaped the ciiticism of tho fault lindcis, and no doubt tho speedy passage of tho llailway Management Bill vas gieatly facilitated by the utcumstanco that the futuio coinmissionois aie un known It is veiy convenient to separate tho creation of tho post from the solec tiou of the men 'iho Government have not yet taken the House fully into then confidence as to why tho audit com misionéis wcio chosen, and when tho clause is reached tho Piemier may havo a statement to mako winch may ycatly lnllueiKO lion mombois It seems to bo supposed out of doois that tho audit commissionois aio accountants and nothing moie, but as a mattei of fact it appeals that thoy havo been vigilant m scrutinising and in lepoitmg upon the disciplino of the departments And tho elhcioncy they havo displayed in this branch of then labouis has evi dently told upon Mimsteis In ollect, wo piesumo tho Government plea will be that hoi o we havo a board of oihceis who aro familial with tho sei vice, and yot who aie not of it, who havo shown ability as inspectas, and who havo vindicated then lespect for law and thoa independence of tho Government -for it will bo remembered that not even tho tcrrois of Black Wednesday pi evented the audit commissionois norn laying befoio Paihament ropoits omi nently distasteful to tho Ministiy m power, and this was dono, moieovoi, without feeling, but courteously, in dischaigo of tho obligations imposed upon them At tho samo timo no special chai m attaches to tho audit commissioucis "What civil sorvico loformeis havo con tended for is a boaid as independent as aio tile audit commissionois, and if the llouso is unwilling to accept tho gentle- men fust named, tho Government can hardly laiso difhculties about submitting some other pioposal Certainly if the ci cation of a nowboirdis thought neccs saiy, no objection need bo taken on the ground of expense, for theio would bo no gi eat diftoicnco between the two sellemos It tho audit commifesioncis undcitako the v.oik, an additional commission« is to bo appointed, and tho oflico is to be íclieved of coi tam woik, and tho expenso of performing this would piobably bo equiva- lent to anothei salaiy Thus a now boaid would mean only ono additional btipcnd, and if tho bouid is a success, it will bavo that sum a hundredfold Wo would suggest that tho nucleus of any now boaid should bo an audit commissionci, as it would bo of the first înipoi tance to seem o the sei vites of a gentleman with a gcneial practical knowledge of all the depaitments No objection will piobably bo taken to this proposal, but tho difficulty will arise with regal d to the two othei mern bei s If tho Govcrnoi in Council is loft to apjioint both gentlemen, it might well bo an mstiuctioii that in tho fust instance one of the ictncd heads of depaitments who aie now in the enjoyment of fat pensions and full health and vigoiu bhould bo selected Such an aiiangemcnt as that pioposcd with repaid to the Education depart ment, wheicby the teachcis of a certain j,iadc appoint a ropresentatn o f i oin the higher walks of then piofession, would doubtless be popului in tho servite, and it is a gi cat point to sceuro the good will and the confidente of the employes A County Couit judge finds favoui in the eyes of a numbei of people, thou0h what special qualification a County Couit judge 1ms for oiyiiiising and theekmg depaitments dots not appeal upon the sulfate 'lhe tntits of tho bill when thoy como to face the situation will piobably find themselves in th<» position of Mr J G DUM Y, who fiankly admitted that it was easy to deeiy the audit commis sioneiH, and difhcult to suggest who should take their plates 'Hie current complaint that too much power is givon to the board will be found to fade away for th<» most part on close examination At first sight theio seems great forco m the plea that when an officer ia charged with an offence ho can now obtain a trial before a boaid, but the reply is that ho will obtain a trial before a board undor the act The only différence will be that instead of the Governor m Cr val nominating a board in each mstanco, tliero will bo a permanent court, consisting of tho commissioners, and tho gi eat advantage is that all oflenccs will bo judged by tho same standard If tho sei vice would gain coiifidenco by an arrangement that serious charges imolving dismissal or dcgiadation should be hcaid in public by two 01 tho members of the board sitting with a County Couit judge as chan man, it might bo well to make that concession, and coi tamly it would bo better than establishing the appeal, which is sure to bo stoutly contended foi, to the Governor in Council 'Hie ftars entertained iii tho soi vico that a star chamber may bo created if tho boaid is left to work alone in theso cases is natinal, but equally ]ustifiablo is tho alaim of the lefoimers, that an appeal to Ministers m ly lead to political scandals A com promiso between the two courses seems desirable, and wo havo suggested one An appeal fiom tho classification of tne wotk of tho department, as inado by tho board, ought ceitainly not to be allowed, foi the service should bo dealt with as a whole, and no individual injury what e\ei canbcdoneif clauso27 issoamended as to piovido that if an ofhco is io duced tho piesentoflicer shall continue to diaw his salary until he can bo transferí ed to somo smtablo position equivalent to the amount of his remuneration At piesont as the clause stands, the oflicer is hablo to bo transferred to the lower class to which Ins woik ia assigned if tho board is unablo to pi ovidc him fit employment, and no doubt this prospect brings tho hcaits into the mouths of scores of civil servants But it is wiso, wo submit, even fiom the standpoint of economy, to bo as lonient as possiblo when dealing with existing interests, for this policy will enable tho board to classify work at its piopei standard, and thus to insuio a just expenditure in tho futuie as old claims d10 out Nor would the transfeis oxtond ovor many yeal a Tho concluding section of this clause mus-"If such peison bo found unfit " foi such higher woik, his salary shall " bo 1 educed to the maximum of the " said class to which such lower offico " shall havo been assigned, and ho shall " íeceivo as compensation for the 10 " ductiou 111 his incomo a sum amount " ing to one twelfth of such reduction " for each year of servico, and a pio I poitionato sum for any addi "tional timo less than a year," and if it ens at all it is on the sido of liborality Tho provision that any two of tho commissioners shall form a quorum, and that the senior membor shall presido and havo a casting vote, places gicat powci in tho hands of one man, and will havo to bo carefully con fined to íoutino matters It is certainly an aigumont in favoiu of a special public service board as against tho audit commissionois, who would have other duties to peiform, that a full at- tendance of its members could bo mado iî sine qua non to tho transaction of all important business Equity has to bo pioudcd foi, and it is well to secuio coniidenco, but it is as well to re mombei that a politically appointed servico is likely to havo leanings in fav our of political appeals, and that any demands foi the systematic whittling away of tho poweis of tho adminis tiatois of tho act should bo viewed with suspicion wherovor they como fiom T'-o add-esscs dohvered by tho pre- sident of tho lloyal Society at tho annual gathenngs of the membeisaie always worth reading, but that winch Mi El LI HY lead at tho tonveisazioiie on Friday evening is fullei of interest- ing matter than almost any of the pro vious ones Mi ELI FRY gave a

lccommond all who can spaie a few moments fiom tho absorb ingpuisuits of politics or money making to icad it for themsolves It will well repay pciusai Thero aio somo points in tho addicss, however, to which special attention may bo directed Tust of all it is to bo noticed with satisfaction that tho mcmbeiship of tho society is extending, while tho growing interest which tho community is taking in stientific mattois is shown by the fact that tho society's own rooms have bttomo too small to accommodate the Msitois who deslio to bo piesent at the annual meetings Mr Er LI HY reported that tho meet- ings of tho society during tho year had been fully occupitd with papers and dis- cussions on scientific and technical sub- jects, and ho was able to congratu lato tho members upon a healthy and vigoious progress, and upon the accomplishment of much useful work It is satibfactoiy to leam that this is tho case, but still 111010 so to find that tho scientific and technical departments established by the state aie tnjoying a vigoious and useful life The behool of technology has been doing good woik, whilo tho collections of tho Industnal and Tech nological Museum have bton largely mci eased Mr ELLHIY mentioned that tho knowledge deiivcd fiom tho collection of Indian limber which had been formed 111 the museum had led to tho opening of a new trade be tween this colony and India, and ho expiosstd tho hope that similar results would follow fiom tho exhibition at Calcutta of the extensive assortment of economic timbei wlnth has been pre pal ed in tho museum woikshop "In " tho chemical laboratory," wo aie m formed, " somo advance has been mado " in tho theiaistiy of waste animal " products, and it seems probable th» " when the laboiatoiy piocess is pro " perly applied to the noxious trades, " the manufactiier will find it profitable " to decomposo and save all offensivo " matenal, whethei solid, liquid, or " gas " This, Mi ELII'UY rightly says, is most important woik Out stieama and uveis aio polluted by the waste pioducts of manufactures, whilo tho au is poisoned by smoke Theso evils ait daily felt, and th>y inciease in intensity as yeaib go on It is withm tho

Mi ELLEEY that hboial provision should bo mado for tho prosecuton of such work Tho president was able to stato that tho progress vluch had marked tho past year's history of the Koyal Socioty had been

Darwin, and then between Port Darwin, Mel bourne, Adelaide, and Sydney, w ero the special occui ronces of tho pel lod Con cei nmg tho first of them, Mr Lu KUY fur lushed somo highly lnteiesting lnfoima tion, stating a fact with which few of our rcadeis weio piobably acquainted, namely, that at the Cape of Good Hope tho comet had been undei observation whilo ciossmg tho solar disc, and although iiovvoiful lnstiumcnts weio dnectcd to it dutmg all tlus time, not a tiaco of it was visible dining the pas- sage, thus proving that oven tho denser joitionsof these bodies possess little, if any, opacity As to the dotei initiation of Austiahan longitudes by telegraph wo gathei that the results of observations taken eight or runo months ago aio not yet i ully ascertained, but that in all piobibility the difleienco between the data ainvcd at by calculation on tho one hand and by tho exchange of tolegtapluc. bignals on tho othei, will amount to not moic than ono second of time It says much foi the exactitude of a trononutal woik when tho diner once between tho timo as calculated and as actually ascertained by telegraph is so slight In dealing with electucity, and the vanous pulposos to which it is applied, Mi ELIIRY mado special lofeicnco to a Biibject which has attracted considei able attontton in Mclbom no, as it has done in other lal go cities in vanous patts of the

The information was laid by Mr. T. D. Hammond chief immigra- tion officer under the 35th section of the Passengers Act 1855, at the instance of the passengers. The complaint alleges that water and provisions were not supplied in accordance with scale A of the dietary lists which provides that the daily allow- 3ib 8oz of bread and three quarts of water. The charge was made at the instance of the passengers booked for Melbourne, and it was stated that further proceedings would be taken by some of their messmates on reaching Sydney. A remand was applied for on behalf of Captain Ilbery by his solici- tor (Mr. Plummer) on the ground that, as the summons had only been served on the pre- vious evening, he was not ready to proceed with the defence. The agents of the vessel, Messrs. James Henty and Co., would become sureties for the captain's reappearance.

Burns re- ceived the announcement that he was to be executed (the Ararat Advertiser says) with the utmost nonchalance and he still main- tains an apparent indifference to his fate. Before his trial he appeared confident that he would not be brought in guilty, but on being brought back to the gaol after being sentenced he seemed nervous, though at first buoyed up with the hopes of the success of the efforts being made on his behalf in arguing the law points reserved. Some time since he, however, apparently resigned him- self to his fate, since when he has evinced great coolness and indifference. The Rev.
