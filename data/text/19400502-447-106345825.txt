Catholics Under the Swastika. NOW NUMBER 59 MILLIONS. LONDON, April 12. By his invasion of Norway and Den- mark Hitler has brought two more Bishops. 318 priests, 880 nuns, and 32,800 other Catholics under Nazi domination. This brings the total number of Catholics in German-occupied territory up to roughly 5.9,000,000. This is about a sixth of the world's entire Catholic population. Ger- many proper has 23,150,000 Catholics; When Austria was seized the number was in- creased by 6,000,000. When Czechoslova- kia was overwhelmed another 12,000,000 Catholics came under the Swastika. When Danzig was taken over there came another 157,000. Then Poland, and another 17,000,000. The 30,000 Catholics, of Denmark and the 2800 of Norway, though comparative- ly small bodies, are active. In both coun- tries the Church has been faced by the strong Lutheranism of exceptionally de- vout people. The Holy Father displayed great distress when he was informed of the German in- vasion, states the 'Daily Telegraph' cor- respondent in Rome. News of the invasion, he said, was received with indignation and sorrow at the Vatican. 'The territorial neutrality of two more countries has been violated,' says the ''Osservatore Romano," which gives no sort of countenance to the view put for- ward in the Italian press that Britain and France had intended to land troops on Scandinavian territory. 'Those who have defended against all and any the sacred rights of neutral coun- tries,'' it writes, 'cannot but regard with the deepest pain the sudden and dramatic extension of the theatre of war.' Denmark's First Bishop. A great step forward was made in Den- mark last year when the first Danish Bi- shop since the Reformation, 40-years-old Monsignor Theodore Suhr, a Benedictine, was consecrated as its Vicar Apostolic. Bi- shop Suhr speaks English fluently. Danes and English have close religious and ra- cial ties. It was the English Pope, Adrian IV., who earned the title of 'Apostle of the North' for his work as Papal Legate, to Scandinavia in medieval times. Catho- licism was emancipated in 1849, and a large part of its progress is due to the zeal of Polish immigrants. Denmark has 83 priests, 680 nuns and 33 churches. Norway is under the spiritual jurisdic- lion of the Vicar Apostolic of Selje, Bishop Mangers, a Marist. Two other centres of Catholicism are at Trondheim and at Trom- so, both in charge of the Marists. The Jesuits are the only religious Order for- bidden by law. The clergy there number 85\. They are helped by about 200 nuns and have 22 churches. Sweden, now said to be threatened by the Nazis, has 4000 Catholics. The Catho- lic leader in Sweden is Bishop Mueller, who resides in Stockholm. Although the country has been a vicariate since 1783, it is comparatively the least Catholic of the three, principally because up to recent times the Catholics have suffered many civil disabilities, from which they are not yet entirely free according to the law. The country has 15 priests and 90 nuns. There are 17 churches.
