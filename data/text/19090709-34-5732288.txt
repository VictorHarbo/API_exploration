The London tallow market shows a little more activity this week, bidding at thç auc- tion sales on Tuesday having been more spirited than of late, while prices for me- dium and lower grades advanced, finer qualities being fully maintained. The tota, catalogue covered 870 casks, of which 753 casks sold, the balance passed in being 117 casks. Prices realised were:-Fine mutton, 33/3 per cwt.; medium mutton, 31/6 pe^ cwt. (an advance of 6d. per cwt.); hne beef. 32/3 per cwt.; and med.um beei. 30/6 per cwt. (an advance of 6d. per cwt.); The following table shows the pr.ces ob- tained for Australian tallow at auction in London this week, last week, aud at the saleg in the corresponding week of the two previous years: 1909\. 1909. 190S. 1907. | Julv June Julv Julv 7\. 30. 7. , 8. cwt. cwt. cwt. cwt.

During the earlier part of the interval the market was very quiet, and prices gave way about Cd. per cwt., buc the demand subsequently improved, and quotations at close show very little change on the average. There has been a fairly steady demand for no color ? sorts for ex- port, and the better kinds have been taken pretty steadily both for home and foreign consumption. The output of home meit has been very moderate, and the bulk of the supply has sold readily at steady prices. There was a fair demand for parcels afloat, and a considerable business has been done at about the parity of spot values. For ship- ment sellers have been mostly rather too high in price, and transactions have not been large. South America ^continues to offer very moderate quantities, but very firm prices are asked for shipment. Th.* market closes finn.

Butter. The Australian butter export season dates from July 1. but the 1909-10 period has not yet been opened by any shipments from the Commonwealth. Writing with respect to the London butter market on June 4. Messrs. Mills & Sparrow said: Weather ig very unsettled: heavy rains have been frequent, but the temperature is altogether too cold for vegetation. Australian-The steamer Omrah arrived in due course, but only had about G.P00 boxes on board. There has been no life in the trade, although the few regular and known brands hive cleared at a reduction of ¿/ to 3/ on last week. New Zealand-Trade has been most disappointing, and the Paparoa's buttera are not clearing as anticipated. Buyers are holding off to the very last box, waiting events, and in the hope of getting on at lower prices. Danish-Quo- tation is reduced another three kroners. in con- sequence of lower prices ruling here. Siberian Arrivals hare not increased ad is usual at this Eca-on of the year. Quality is irregular, and prices in sympathy with Danish are lower. French - -The mai.e in France.ia_ .not-increasing ss was anticipated Quotations generally remain un- altered, although in some instances a reduction of 1/ to 2/ is made to induce business.

Breadstuffs. The local wheat market was without change. To-day farmers' lots (offerings light) sold on the basis of 4/10 per bushel on trucks, Port Adelaide. For shipping parcels there is a moderate enquiry, but a margin in the idea of values between buyers and sellers considerably restricts trading. There is, we understand, no difficulty in securing offers at J5/ per bushel f.o.b., but lowest sellers otk 5/05, and mo.-t holders are on the 5/1 per bushe' f.o.b. mark. The eastern States are advised as unchanged, Melbourne continues at 5/1 and Sydney at 5/4$ per bushel. Privnte advices from Lon- don to-day give the European,markets for Australian wheat as firm, but with little movement on the part of buyers. For prompt South Australian sailer or steamer bills of lading 44/6 per quarter is indicated, while .for cargoes nearing port of call the j value is, according to latest transactions re- | ported. 45/ per quarter c.f. and i. There is I no actual movement mentioned as regards j chartering, the wheat position in Australia not lending itself to any important develop- i mentB in this »Iii ection"just now. Flour re- , mains quiet at £11 15/ per ton for leading I eily brands, and £11 10/ per ton for coun- try brands, delivered in Adelaide. Mill offal continues to be quoted by manufacturers at 1 rSd. per bushel for bran"and 1/1 per bushel for pollard, delivered. An interesting re- port, referring specially to the German de- mand for wjie.it, and dated May 29. was re- j ceived this week by a leading Adelaide finn connected with the tiade. It is as fol- lows: One remarkable feature of this season has been the fact that Germany which has imported so much loss Uian during the previous season has been able to subsist for so long on the remnant of her old stock, and the balance of her native wheat of last autumn. Tills is due largely U> the fact that millers, bakers, and dealers have worked down their stock to the smallest possible compass, and also, in some measure, because rye flour has been so much cheaper than wheat flour. In recent jears_ within our mernoo', there have bren times when fine rye flour has beca considerably dearer than the corresponding grade of wheat flour. It ia not always realised that the German oats rye bread because he likes it. and not as many people suppose on account of cheapness. H is true lhat the consumption of wheaten flour in Germany isi increasing, but when coupled with a natural taste for rye bread, there is also the fact that it has been abnormally cheap during the past eight or nine months, it is natural that this should have some pffect upon the demand for wheat. That is actually what has taken place, but yet we. have re. liable private information which leaves us to suppose that Germany will continne taking near cargoes of wheat as they arrive at port of call. The large German mills are not going to shut down, and as there ia almost literally no native wheat left for them to grind fresh cargoes must be purchased. When some of the harvests in largo wheat-producing countries have net answered expectations, the possibility (writes the "British Trade Review" of June 1) of large exports of wheat and other agricultural produce from Siberia ae> miires a special interest, the more so as the practicability of an export movement in î-imiinr goods from Manchuria has been de- i monstrated. A correspondent of the "Novoe Vremya" says that exporters are buying grain in Western Siberia for the foreign markets, and that their enquiries through the winter have caused the locaj grain market to remain firm, although the harvest there was a very abundant one. It is gathered from the experience obtained in the dairy produce business that the grain | export may develop very rapidly, one reason being the strong emigrant movement from Russia into Siberia and the large area of land that the immigrants are .bringing under the plough. The correspondent siys one needs not be a prophet to predict that to carry the trame to the sea more railways must be constructed, and the whole railway line between Perm and Kotlass will have to be doubled. Of course, there is a con- siderable traffic between the northern coast of Siberia, or the Russian territory con- tiguous thereto, already, and with the fine navigable waterways available the prospect seems promising enough. General Merchandise. Tlie import markets continue steady with a good distributing demand, but no large transactions were reported to-day. The fol- lowing mail advice, dated May 29, with re- spect to the London market for coffee is of interest:-"With public auctions on'y held on one day this week the market has been quiet, and prices are praeticaljy uu .iltered. It is, however, generally ©xpccteJ that after the holidav Costa Rica, which has been arriving in large quantities, but has .had to be* husked and picked over be- fore offering, will be ready. The sales on Thursday and Friday next week should contain "a plentiful supply, and will be a test whether the present prices can be main- tained. There is confirmation of the vrc port. mentioned a fortnight ago, that the Costa Rica crop will not be so large as was expected, and a considerable part of it is badly damaged. In addition to the total, being smaller the proportion of fine descrip- tions will be much less than usual, and an advance for these grades is probable, though the medium and low qualities may be cheaper. In other kinds there has been no particular change, while the terminal market has continued quiet and business verv limited."

The supply was disappointing as regards quality. as a large proportion were in waste order, whilst many were in young and store condition. A few heavy sorts were penned, which met excellent com- petition, there being a full attendance of the local trade, besides several country buyers assist- ing. Prices were higher for all "classes, and an early clearance was effected, graziers purchasing quite 40 head.

Dry ewes were particularly plentiful, but best Merino wethers were rather scarce. Last week's rates were readily obtained at the open- ing sales, and prices quickly hardened, th*!ro being a good all-round demand.

Bacorors-A good average yarding, and although eurers were not quite so anxious to opr-rate ns they were last week, prices remained firm. ?' Heavy weights are still selling better than the lighter sorts. Porkers-The sup- ply was sufficient or trade requirements,. and prices were, just about on a par with late satis actory ratc3.

As of late, the yarding com- prised mostly store cattîev in poor condition, al- though a good sprinkling of butchers' cattle were obtainable, as 'well as some useful young springers. Bidding for all classes was airly brisk, more espe- cially for fats. Young cows close to calving are commanding high values.
