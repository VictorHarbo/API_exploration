For years Dannebrog stood. upon its trial, and then -a grand pury composed 'of the women of Australia hailed Dsnnebrog - as the conqueror. Madame Froljr, whose headquarters were at 165 Collins-street, Melbourne;,had-prov.: that Uumsebrog used sccesn.ully in tralian climate, and that it was superior to the electrical and other methods. Danne brog is popular everywhere,. and medical men recommended it. But it has achieved its remarkable popularity by its own pecu liar virtues, and because by removing lines of worry along with anrnoying'and.unsightly hairs it "ives the face a more youthful and beautiful appearance. A BLESSING TO WOMANKIND. Dannebrop is indeed .a blessing to woman kind, and in its operation it is swift-and. sure, and yet not dangerous as are some electrical and other methods when unskil fully applied.
