I have to thank you for the confidence in me therein expressed. As I have a much greater interest in the District of the Start than tiie other ^«'^i«l*^» in the field I am willing to stand, and in the event of my being elected I trust I shall be able to justify your expectations. As so little time remains before the day of election considerable exertion will be necessary to secure the day, and I trust my friends wiU not be behind the emergency so as to place me at the head of the poll. As I have had no opportunity of attending any of the public meetings I would state that my views on the leading questions of (be day are as follows : — I am a Freetrader, and favorable to any mea sures for encouraging native industry which do not involve an increase of our Customs duties: at the same time, I think the present tariff should be amended so as to admit, as far as possible, raw materials free of duty. I would support any properly-matured mea sure for opening the land to the bona fide agri culturist on more liberal terms. I am against having any Act whatever affect ing iwiwiTgr^^inp| believing that the Parliament should be free to introduce immigrants or not according to the state of the market Railways and Tramways we want more than anything else. From the formation of the country they are our most suitable means of communication. They would benefit our farmers in the carriage of produce ; they would benefit the squatters by ensuring the convey ance of supplies and stock ; they would tend largely to develop our mineral resources, and greatly conduce to the permanent prosperity of the province generally. A Branch Railway to Glenelg I have long considered should be made. The most liberal terms should be granted to parties giving some guarantee as to the proper working of mineral 1»wi«, Whether Government should subsidise edu cation is a difficult question, and all erants given for this purpose should be carefully looked after. We ought to leave nothing undone to culti vate and improve our trade on the River Muiray. I would advocate strict economy in the ex penditure of the various Government depart ments. Although objecting to pledges in general I can give one without hesitation, and that is that if elected I will neither seek nor accept an office in the Government ALEX. HURRAY.

PALMER. 9th Angnst. 1867. ? dl_ JUDGE BOOTHBY.— The following «l ADDRESS will this day be offered to the colonists for their signature. I have submitted it to them of my own free thought, believing that by bo doing, I shall afford them an oppor tunity of doing honor to themselves, and a simple act of justice to Judge Boothby, the necessity for which must be obvious to those who have read the repoits relating to him, which have been published in the past few weeks. My having been a colonist for nearly twenty eight years, during which I have ever taken a warm interest in the progress and prosperity of SouthAustralia, and my being unconnected with the Parliament or with the legal profession, are the excuses I offer, if any be needed, for thos presuming to ask my fellow- colonists to join me in signing this address.

The Directors, in making their Third Half Yearly Report, have again to congratulate the Shareholders on the almost total immunity from loss which has attended the operations of the Company during the past six months. The large increase in the business of the Company necessitates an immediate increase of the Capital, for which purpose a Special General Meeting of the Shareholders will be held this day, after the usual Ordinary Meet ing, at which the following Resolutions will be proposed: — First. That the Capital of the Company be increased to £50,000, by the issue of 6,000 new Shares of £5 each. Second. That Clause 7 of the Articles of Asso ciation be altered by striking out the words 'on the first Monday in February,' and inserting the following words—' in the months of Feb ruary and August' Third. That Clause 111 of the Articles of Association be altered by inserting after the word ' Members' the words ' pro rota.' In addition to the audited accounts presented at the last meeting, a further statement of the accounts for tile past six (6) months has been prepared, from which it has been ascertained that the amount of Premiums and Interest received will allow of the declaration of a Dividend at the rate of 124 per cent, on the amount paid up on each Share. The Directors, however, pro pose, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association, to pay out of this jymnnnt 10 per cent, to the Shareholders, and to carry the2i per cent, to the Reserve Fund, thus making the total of the Reserve £600. The Directors again appeal to the Share holders to favor the Company with their busi ness, as with the increased amount of capital at their disposal they will be enabled materially to extend their operations. A vacancy having occurred since the last meeting in the office of Director by the resigna tion of Mr. H. L. Vobz, in consequence of his leaving the colony, the Directors have sup plied the vacancy until the next Annual Meet ing by the appointment of Mr. W. M. Letch ford. W. MAIN, Chairman. wrt3 ? O. A.
