Go at once to a chemist, and get a bottle of Mrs. WINSLOW'S SOOTHING SYRUP. It will relieve the poor sufferer immediately. It is perfectly harmless and pleasant to take ; it produces natural quiet 'sleep by relieving the child from pain, and the little cherub awakes " as bright as a button." It soothes the child, it softens the gums, allays all pain, relieves wind, regulates the bowels, and is the best known remedy for dysentery and diarrhoea, whether arising from teething brother causes. Mrs. WINS LOW'S SOOTHING SYRUP is sold by medicine dealers everywhere at Is. 11d. per bottle AVARÉSSE'S SANDAL CAPSULES. Pure S AVARESSE'S SANDAL CAPSULES. Efficacious.
