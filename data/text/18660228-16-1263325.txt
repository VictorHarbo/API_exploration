CAPE MORETON. [BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.] February 27. Arrivals.-Boomerang, s.S., from Rock- hampton, short of coal; African Maid, brig, from Adelaide; Brothers, schooner, from the Riebmond River ; Liberty, schooner, from the South ; Traveller, schooner, from Melbourne. Departure.-Queen of the South, ship, for Callao, at 9 a.m. The brig Phillis, and schooner Traveller went into tho bay at 6 a.m. ; and the African Maid entered tho bay nt 5 p.m. The Liberty is bound to the Tweed River, and has put in for shelter. The Legion of Honor, ship, Johan Cesar, and Helen S. Page, were all at anchor off the Pilot Station at 9 a.m. IPSWICH STEAMERS.-The Ipswich, from the A.S.N. Co.'s wbnrf, at 7 o'clock this morning ; and the Settler, at tho same hour, from Raff's wharf. The Settler makes the trip to Ipswich and back to-day, and to-morrow she will proceed to the Bay to tow the Renown, barque, up to town. The Sarah Barr, schooner, cleared Sydney Heads on February 16, at 2 p.m., with a fresh south-easterly breeze, which lasted until she was off Cape Hawke. This weather was succeeded by northerly and north-easterly winds, which continued from the 17th until the 21st, and after that calms, in which the schooner was drifted to the southward by the coast current. On the 23rd, sho got a light southerly wind, which increused on the 21th and 25th to a heavy gale from tho south-east, with a tre- mendous sea. She rounded Cape Moreton at 8 a.m. on Monday, and beat across the Bay in the face of a strong southerly breeze From Seal Rock Point to Cape Byron the vessel had to contend with a strong current running at the rate of three knots per hour towards the south- east. The schooner arrived at Now Farm nt 8 p.m. yesterday. Tho Boomerang, s.s., left Rockhampton for Sydney at 5 a.m. on Saturday, and on Sunday she fell in with a hoovy gale from the south- ward and eastward, accompanied by a high sea. Yesterday morning the rossel was off Capo Moreton, and the wind was still blowing strongly from tho Bouthwnrd. As she then had no moro than two days' fuel on board Captain Chatfield determined to put into this port for n irosh supply. She will rosumo her voyago as soon a3 her coaling is completed. The wholo of her passengers and cargo aro for Sydney. The brig Phillis is from Adelaide, to the consignment of Messrs. Bright Brothors. She was working across tho bay from tho Pilot Sta- tion at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon. The City of Brisbane, s., left Sydnoy Heads on Saturday at 7 p.m. Sho had easterly winds, and cloudy rainy wcathor to Port Stephens, and moderate southerly winda and fine weather the remainder of the passage. A heavy easterly and south- east son was experienced nearly the wholo of the passage. She rounded Cape Moreton on Monday, at 6.30 p.m., and anchored at river bar at 9.45 p.m. Weighed on Tuosday, nt 5 a.m., passed through Francis Ohnnnol, and ar- rived at the Company's wharf at 7 a.m. A steamer, supposed to be the Yarra Yarra, was passed on Monday, al 3 a m., off the Clarence River. A schooner was at anchor under Cape Byron the same day, at 9 a.m., and a steamer bound south was passed off Mount Warning. At sundown last evening the arrivals at the bar of the Legion of Honor, Phillis, Picard, and Contest, were not reported. The ship Melmerby is to be towed out of the river through Francis' channel by this morning's tide. Mr. Wyborn was engaged the greater part of yesterday in unmooring the ship, in order to have her ready for an early start. The steamers to be ernployed are the Brisbane, tug, and the Nowra. The Melmerby is the largest ship that has ever cast anchor in the Brisbane River, and as she was brought into the river without mishap, we hope she will be equally fortunate in leaving it-in fact that she will not have to contend with as many difficulties as on entering, for the most awkward part of the channel has been considerably improved while the ship lay at Eagle Farm flats. THE MARY LAWSON. The barque Mary Lawson sailed from Graves- end on October 26th, and the same night brought to at the Nore. At 5 a.m. next day she again weighed, but at 3 p.m. she came to anchor off the North Foreland, the wind then was from the south-west, and the weather fine. On the 28th, at 4 a.m., the wind suddenly shifted to north-east, and an attempt was made to weigh the anchor, but owing to lhe heavy sea running, the effort was abandoned after the purchase of tho windlass had carried away. At 7 a.m. it was found necessary to slip the cable, and the anchor and forty fathoms of chain were lost. The Golden City and many other ships were at anchor in company with the Mary Lawson in that gale, and several of them lost their anchors and cables. The barque rounded the South Foreland at 9 a.m, and at 10 a.m. the pilot was landed off Dover. The vessel then proceeded down the channel, but nil her disas- ters were not over, for next day, October 29, at 6 a.m., there was a sudden squall from south- west, accompanied by heavy rain. ln the attempt to keep the ship from drifting on to the land several sails wore split. Thence to Madiera sho hnd vory bad wonther, with very hoary seas, which frequently broke ovor all. During this period BIIO carried away hor bulwarks and stanchions, and lost the live stock and part of her dock cargo. From Madiera to the Equator the ship had moderate weather, and thence to Queensland tho passage has been without any incident, worthy of remark. Cape Moreton was sighted on February 25, at 4 p.m., aud at 5 p.m. she brought to off the yellow patch on Moreton Island. At 7 a.m. on the following day she was boarded by Pilot Woods, who brought her up to the anchorage in Bris- bane Roads the same evening. THE LOG OF THE SOUOHAYS.

She was ordered away after remaining for days, and ar- rived here October 30. Sho reports that on the 5th August, in latitude 15 S., longitude 30 W., symptoms of a fire appeared, when she threw overboard thirty-five tons of coal. She has been surveyed, and tho coal below being found hot, 100 tons have been ordered to be dis- charged immediately. Tho Bodyddan, British ship, and the Ricardo, of Hamburg, both from Europe to Chili, are still lying with their car- goes on board waiting further orders.
