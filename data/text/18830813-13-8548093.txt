S UM M A R Y FOR EUROPE. POLITICAL. The ordinary course of legislation has been interrupted during the fortnight by necessary references to tho proceedings tho Government have taken for tho pur- poso of preventing the landing in "Victoria of tho Irish informers, who arrived from London the steamer Pathan. Some comment was also made last Wednesday, on a notico given by Mr Healy in the House of Commons, insinuating on baso- less grounds that tho Now South Wales Parliament contained members who were not of tho same pure standing us himsolf Mr Healy, it appears, resented on behalf of the Parnellito party tho action of an Australian Ministry in removing from tho commission of the peace justices who signed a disloyal address when tho Redmond brothers were visiting the colonies. Both subjects are treated under special headings elsowhere. Substantial progress lias been mado with the Railway Management Bill, which ought to be finally disposed of in committee m the Legislativo Assembly this week No alterations of any conso quenco havo been effected, except such as Ministers have themselves suggested, but tw o of thou amondments ai o miportant As a concession to members who liest tatod about making tho now system pel manent before it had passed tlnough an experimental stage, Ministers have limited the tonure of omeo of the first commissionois to sovon years After hiving sorved that time, tho commis- sioners will bo eligible foi io appointmont They will only bo removable prior to tlio teinunation of thoir firtt engagement on a joint address from tho Legislative Council andLogislativo Assembly, or onan addiess passed in two consecutive sessions by the Assembly alone Thou tonuro of omeo has boon placed on tho samo footing as that of tho audit commissioners An other notoworthy chango m tho bill is tho insertion of vv olds giving tho chairman of the commission an ovei ruling vote whoie ho drflers m opinion fiom his two co adjutois , his reasons foi deciding against thom are to bo laid boforo Parliament Tlio object of the amendment is to prevent the chairman, who it is intended shall possess superior quail lieitions for radway management, having his plans nullified by less experienced authorities Tho salary of the chairman vv is fixed by the Assombly, on the suggestion of Munsters, at £3,000, but tho House gave Mr Servico to undoi stand that he was empowoied to go con siderably beyond that limit, if necessary, in order to obtain a thoroughly capable man from England For tho othei com miBsioners a salary of £1,500 each was appropuatcd Tho Assombly has gone rally approved of the measure, and tho only pioposal onwhichtlieiowosadivision was thoone limitingthoterm of oflicoof tlio commissionois in the first instance to sovon ycais Majoi Smith moved that the jienod bo Ino yeius, but "sovon ye IIB ' was earned by an overwhelming majority Tlio Mallee Land Bill was brought into tlio Assembly on August 2 by Mr Tucker, tlio Mimstor of Lands Tlio Go vornnient recogniso the noeessity that eveiy foot of tho mallee countiy, which is 11,000,000 acres in oxtont, should bo occupied in order that tho wild dog and îabbit plague may be checked, and thero foio they havo to a great extent adopted tho South Austialmn system, under which tho ontiro mulloo on tho othoi sido of the bolder has boon takon up and is being improved It is proposed to grant 20 yo ira' leases, each lun, however, being divided into A and B blocks, the B block to bo surrendered at the ond of five yeais, by which timo it Bliould, undor tho conditions, be cleared of vermin No alienation what ov ei is to bo permitted dming tho cur roney of tho leases, and the settlors will recorvo compensation for wells, dams, and résolvons, m oidor that water con sen ation may bo oncouragod Tho Go vornmont takes power also to losumo occupation of certain water frontages, tlio feo simple of which has been parted with. The reception of tho mensuro was highly favourable. Tlio Becond reading of tho Harbour Trust Amendment Bill was moved on tlio sumo day by Mr. Langridge, tho Commis- sioner of Trado and Customs. It em- powers tho Trust to borrow£l,000,000 for carrying opt Sir John Coodo's scheme, and vests it with, tlio necessary lands. An alteration is ¡nado in tlio modo of electing tlio representatives of four suburban municipalities, who will bo chosen by the ratepayers instead of by tho local coun- cils. In return for tho onlargod powers bostowed upon it, tlio Trust will bo re- quired to extond its dredging oporations in Hobson's Bay, and to deliver silt for reclamation purposes to tho Government at a low charge. Tlio bill has boen ap- proved by the Harbour Trust commis- sioners. After Mr. Langridgo's explana- tion of tho bill had boon given, tho dobato on tlio second reading was adjourned. A possible conflict between tho As- sembly and the Supremo Court seemed imminent last week. The return of Mr. Jamo3 Shackoll, tho mombor for Rodney, wa3 poli-ioned against by Mr. A.V. T. Webb, the candidato next on tho poll, on the ground that the sitting member hold an office of profit under tlio crown-viz., tho post of official assignee at Echuca. Mr. AVobb also suod Mr. Shackoll, in the Supremo Court, for tho ponaltios ho was assumed to havo incurred under tho Officials in Parliament Act. Tlio Elec- tions Committee was tho first tribunal to deal with tho caso, and it arrived (though not unanimously) at tho con- clusion that Mr. Shackoll had boon duly elected. Counsel for tho sitting moinber argued that there was a dis- tinction between an appointment under the Crown and an appointment from the Crown. Official assignees aro ofHcors of the Supremo Court, appointod by, but not under the control of, tho Governor in Council, and their remuneration consists of fees taken out of the insolvent estates thoy administer. The committoo adopted counsel's view of tho law, and dismissed tho petition. Mr. Shackoll thon appealed to tho Assombly for directions as to how to proceed in regard to tile action, wliich was sot down for trial on the third day following that on which tho committee gavo their decision. Mr. Service submitted a resolution affirm- ing that tho decision of tho Elections and Qualifications Committoo was final in law, and as tho action in question wxdd over- ride tho committoo, directing the A.ttor noy-General to defend it on behalf of the House. Ho stated that, supposing the plaintiff was successful, the Governor would bo advised to remit the penalties, so that nothing would bo gained by a verdict. Ho added that ho made the announce- ment with a view of causing tho suit to bo discontinued, inasmuch as it. was most desirablo that no chance should bo run of a conflict botweon tho Houso and the Supremo Court. The situation was unfortunate, and the Government would fuel it thoir duty to bring in a bill to prevent tlio difficulty occurring again. In tho discus- sion which ensued, Mr. Cooper expressed the opinion that tho judges would regard the decision of the committee ns final, and would refuse to proceed with the suit, and Mr. Richardson was sure that if the plaintiff vonturod to go on ho would be dealt with at tho bar of tho Assembly for contempt. Mr. Walker stated his doubts as to tho wisdom of interference, but the House generally was acquiescent, and the motion was carried nan. con. The Supremo Court trial was awaited with curiosity, not un minglcd with anxiety, but the day after the House passed the abovo resolution, Mr Webb withdrew the coso, on the terms that each party was to pay Ins own costs Tho Legislativo Council was boon engaged duimg the fortnight in considei mg bills to abate tho dog nuisance, to amend and consolidate tho postal law, and to amond tho Local Government Act, as well as other measures The major portion of tho cstunates have been voted by the Legislative Assombly without discussion.

In connexion with this subject, we may add that the annual municipal elections through- out the colony took place hist 1 hursday In two of the suburban municipalities, Hotham and 1 lt/roj, special interest attached to the election, because in each a retiring councillor w ho had tried to secure the local town hall for the Redmond brothers sought ro election.
