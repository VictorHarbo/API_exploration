COLONEL CAMERON. A DOUBLE CELEBRATION. BRISBANE, Monday.—Colonel D. C. Cameron, M.P. for Brisbane, celebrates both his victory and his birthday "to-day. He is used to fighting. In his teens he joined the American forces during the Boxer rebellion. He had gone to China from Gladstone, and when the Boxers rose young Donald Cameron joined the nearest white troops—the Americans. Later he was refused admission to America under the immigration laws (some quota or other being full) but the Danish captain helped him to overcome the obstacles by signing him on as an ablebodied seaman at a shilling a month or so! So, young Cameron, A.B., got ashore at New York. When asked to say something about his victory in Brisbane all that Colonel Cameron, C.M.G., D.S.O., M.P., A.B., would observe was'that naturally he was gratified at the renewal of confidence.
