FIBST APPEARANCE IN ADELAIDE .of the MONTAGUE-TUBNER ENGLISH OPERA COMPANY, Headed by the Unrivalled Prima Donna MISS ANNIS MONTAGUE, And the Great English Tenor MB. CHARLES TUBNEB, Whose enthralling performances have caused a per ' feet furore in the other Colonies. TO THE MUSIC-LOVING PUBLIC OF ADE LAIDE.' The Management regTet their being unable to obtain the Theatre Royal, which they have tried for the past two years, but as arrangements have been made for the appearances of MIs3 Montaguo and Mr. Turner in England, and their time being so limited, they have been prevailed upon to give a Season in the above Hall, aa the best suited place after the Theatre, where every possible attention will bo riven to the convenience and comfort of the Public. jlis3 Montague desires it to be strictly understood that all that 13 advertised will be carried out, and that she will bo supported by Artists that possess voices that she is confident have never been excelled in Adelaide in English Opera. Knowing tho Ade laide Public are fond of good music and singing, and, also, are good judges, she will be proud to meet them. The Melbourne Argus says :— ' Miss Montague pos sesses a voice of rare beauty— soft, round, and melli8uous. It has been highly cultivated, and she manages it with accurate taste and skill. Her trills are clear and distinct E3 the ringing of silver bells, and the prolonged swellinR notes 'lengthened sweet ness long drawn out'— they seem indeed the soul of melody. Both in speaking and singing her articula tion is clear and sweet. It is a musical treat of no ordinary kiud to listen to Miss Montague's vocaliza tion. It is not alone as a perfect vocalist that we have to speak of this lady, but as a lyrico-dramatic artist of great intelligence and such sympathetic manner as reach the hearts of all hearers. It is to her honour to be said that as an artist she becomes greatest wherein most is oxpected of her.' Of Mr. Charles Turner the Argus says :— ' He i3 certainly the finest Enelish-tenor we have ever heard in Melbourne, with a fine commanding presence. His voice is as clear as a bell, and capable of giving forth sounds strong as a trumpet, as soft as the softest tones of a violin ; it is also of great register, reaching the highest notes of the music with the greatest eas-e. There is no straining or effort. He is a magnificent singer. We feel certain that thero are not two artists south of the equator who can excel Miss Montague and Mr. Turner.' Tho Sydney Horning Herald siys :— ' The success achieved by the Montague-Turner Opera Company is of the most pronounced description. The singing of Mws Montague and Mr. Turner has croatod quite a furore amongst the music-lovine portion of the community. Miss Montague's natural taste am' love of music renders her singing thoroughly sympa thetic. It i3 no vain display of ability, or the exhibi tion of a superb natural organ ; it is vocalism appeal ing to the feelings, that brings tears welling to the eyes, or makes the heart joyous and glad.' Of- Mr. Charles Turner the Herald says :— ' He is an operatic aitist of the highest order, with a mag nificent tenor voice.' Sydtwt// Exsgrrets,, Jane 4, says:— 'We have never witnessed' a1 more' genuine triumph than was achieved by the Montague-Turner Opera Company last night. Miss Montague's singing was sublimity itself, entrancing one and all. Such a storm of ?bravos,' hurrahs, clapping of hanife, beating of sticksand feet— in fact everything available was used . to express the public's intense gratification. We have never witnessed a greater and more genuine success. Mr. Charles Turner's flno tenor voice fairly excelled all we have heard of hun.' At the conclusion of the Company's season, in Brisbane, His Excellency the Governor, the late Sir Arthur Edward Kennedy, stepped upon the sta'e and presented Mis3 Annis Montague with a valuable diamond bracelet and an eulogistic address, conclud -ing-with, 'by the unanimous voice of all who understand music and by the acclamation of numerous and critical audiences, you have proved yourself to be in the universal kingdom of high art a veritable queen of song.' Supported by the following Artists, who are second to none in the colonies, most of whom have snppoited these great Artists for the past two years: — o»^,^^o a,™,. f Miss Frances Saville.
