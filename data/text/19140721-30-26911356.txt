Fraser) deals with migration in an interest.': ing manner. Inter alia, he indicates in his'. introductory remarks that an "unsatisfac-.. tory feature of the State-statistics in recent years" was revealed by an analysis of the nature of the figures. "For the year 1913," the Government Sta-, tistician reports, "it will be seen that of tis . total of 8,577, which the State gained by', the excess of immigrants over emigrants, no less than. 7,708 were introduced under Government ausp:ces, and consequently at. some expense to the State. whilst the small balance of 869 remaining is found to be made up as follows, namely, 312 British and 557 of other nationalities. Appended is a short. table showing the position with regard to previous years, which discloses the fact that, dluring the five years 1909-13, with the exceo tion of those paid for and assisted, we have only gained slightly, over 1,000 per annum.

The im. migrants introduced under Government aus pices numbered' 7,708, consisting of 2,626. adult males, 2,809 females: and 1,169 male and 1,104 female children, being an increase from th( previous year of 711 persons. The birth record also shows an increase both in number and in the rate per 1,000 persons, wholst the deaths show a decrease both in, the number and in the rate, per 1,000 per, sons. The marriages, though greater in num her. show a slight falling off in the rate per 1.000 persons. 'The decrease in the death rate is of a very satisfactory nature, being less than for any year for the past 11 years. "The arrivals, 37,525 (38,450) exceeded the departures, 28,948 (32,161) by 8,577 (6,289), the balance in favour of the State being com. posed of 4,236 (3,683) males and 4,341 (2,606): females. (The figures in parentheses relate to the year 1912.) "Tfhis net gain was mainly composed of 8,468 Europeans, of whom 7,935 were .of British birth, the remainder being chie8y made up of Austrians 25, Danish 21, Italians 133, Russians 72, Greeks 17, Swedish 38, Nor. wegian 86, Germans 92, Maltese 7, and French 21. "The total Asiatic population of the State was increased by 95, the Chinese and Manila men losing 37 and 33 respectively. There was a fairly large influx of Japanese, 450, 432 males, 18 females, as against 392, 371 . males, 21 females, who left the State; whilst 252 Malays arrived and 188 departed. These two latter nationalities however, are principally non-resident, being for the greater part employed on the North-West pearling fleet. "During the period under review the Gov ernment introduced 7,708 immigrants, viz., 2,626 adult males, 2,809 adult females, 1,161' male children, and 1,104 female children."
