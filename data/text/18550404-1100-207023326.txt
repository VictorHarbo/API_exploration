MISCELLANEOUS SHIPPING. The German Immigrant Ships.—A report reached Brisbane on Saturday morning that one of the German immigrant ships which have been for some time ex pected, had run on shore while attempting to enter the Bay by the southern passage, and that the other had safely reached the anchorage. The report turned out to be substantially correct. The Aurora, from Ham burgh, with 300 immigrants, was off the south passage to the Bay on Wednesday. It appears that there was no cliart of the coast on board, and that the captain was ignorant that therfc was any other entrance. Several guns were fired and signals made to attract attention, but as there was no appearance of any assistance, it was determined to attempt the passage into the Bay. In running in it was found that to prevent a total wreck on the shoal on which the steamer Sovereign perished, and to save the lives of those on board, the only course left was to run the ship on shore. All sail was accordingly crowded on her, and she was run high up on the sand, on the sea-side end of Moreton Island. She stands quite upright, and is accessible at half-ebb, boing dry at her bows. It is not expected that she will be got off. The females and children on board have been removed to Cleveland, and the crew and immi grants are in good health and condition. The other vessel (the Marbz), also from Hamburg, entered the Bay on Friday by the northern passage, and reached the anchorage without any mishap. She had, we be lieve, 250 immigrants on board when she sailed, but, in all, 47 children and adults died during the voyage from fever, measles, and cholera. The Health Officer, Dr Hobson, proceeded to the Bay on Saturday, and found the immigrants on board of both ships in a fit state to be landed, the disease on board the Marbz having occurred at an early period of the voyage, when much cold weather was encountered. The scale of diet on board of this last vessel is stated to have been utterly insufficient. Owing to the distance, the guns fired by the Aurora could not have been heard at the pilot station, but it is unaccountable why such a voyage was undertaken without a chart of the coast being on board. The immigrants will be brought up to Brisbane by the brig Palermo, which proceeds to the Bay to-morrow for that purpose. The Aurora is a very fine ship, only two years old. Both vessels, we believe, have cargo on board. The above are all the particulars we can find room for at present, but, so far as they go, we believe they can be relied on.—Moreton Bay Free Press, 20th March. Newcastle Shipping.—On the night of the 21st March, the American ship Rowena fell over almost on her beam ends, whilst lying at the wharf, and was for some time in great danger, owing to her ballast port being open on the side she had fallen on. It was shortly afterwards made fast, though with great diffi culty, and the vessel secured with spars from the wharf to her rigging. She took in three feet of water at the ballast port. The accident was caused by a puff of wind from the N.E. acting on a high-wooded vessel, almost without ballast; she had about 75 tons in her. She is now safe, and has received no injury whatever.— The brig Jean, in coming down the coal channel on the night of the 17th March, got aground on an old deposit of ballast, and, as the tide fell, she gradually lay over, until she finally capsized. As she at present lies she is not much in the way, and measures are being taken to raise her. She has i90 tons of coal on board, and is not insured.—Sydney Herald. VESSELS IN HARBOUR.
