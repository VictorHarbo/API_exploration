SCENE IN DANISH PARLIAMENT NAZIS CAUSE TROUBLE. (Australian Press Assn. Message) COPENHAGEN, Wednesday. After firing shots at random in the Parliament building to-day a young man, calling on Pastor Schmidt, who is representing a man minority in the Danish Parlia ment, declared that the Danes were narrow- minded. He claimed that the present frontier between Ger many and Denmark was established under the Versailles treaty, and could be wiped out as other things had been. He is reputed to be a Danish Nazi, and this faction is objecting strongly to the Government's immi gration bill.
