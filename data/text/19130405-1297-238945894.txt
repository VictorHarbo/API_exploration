For many years it has been considered very necessary— in fact, quite in .the natural order of things— to insure houses, furniture, jewels, etc. How strange it is, then, that so many fail to insure one of the most priceless of Nature's giie — a beautiful complexion! Jewels, houses, aud furniture can be replaced, 1>ut can beauty be as ' easily replaced once it has gone? All sorts of tilings arc apt to happen to the com plexion. Exposure to the wind, suu, or brine will quickly cause it to -become discolored and harsh.
