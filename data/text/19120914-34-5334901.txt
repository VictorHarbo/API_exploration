Senator Millen. of New South Wales, who is the leader of the Opposition in the State House of the Federal Legislature," was the principal ex- ponent of the liberal Party's programme, and his address on current Federal! politics was interesting and informative. -The an f unfilled promises- of the Labor Party, he said, would record' of them at the next elections, when the useful and competent work of the Liberals would stand them in good stead. He charged the Labor Government with extravagant expenditure, faithlessness to pledges, and favoritism in administration of public departments. His eloquent and forceful speech was punctu- ated with cheers. Mr. D. J. Gordon. M.H.R., also contributed an interesting fd- ; dress on Federal politics, and prophesied that the elections next year would result in a handsome victory for Liberalism. .'.'.

BUTLER AM) PORT ADELAIDE tOliXCIL ' / 1 The attention of the Commissioner of Public Works (Hon R Butler) was * directed on Friday to the proceedings at the Port Adelaide City Council meeting on Thursday evening, when it was decided to return to the Commissioner, of Public Works, a letter, which had been sent, to the council advising the amount of money the Government were prepared to give the council for the repair of roads which had been damaged by deep drainage works Mr 'Butler said -"As they decided, to return the letter, and some members of the council 'have, used language which in no sense can be justified, I must take up the position that until they retrace their steps ask for the letter to be returned to them and apologise for their discourtesy, 1 shalL not reopen the matter." -ss x - BY THE BOWDEN "MYSTERY."' Vi All the romantic theories formed'ras to the origin of the underground chambers, found in the course of some excavation work at Bowden early in the week have been rudely shattered by a most prosaic explanation given by Mr. William Blight? who worked, for several years at the Bow-' 'den tannery, the site of the. "discovery? v The mysterious chambers," he states, are nothing more important than" old refuse pits put down before the tannery was connected with the deep drainage system there fore deep drainage-cjune'into existences." l difficulty was experienced at the tannery in getting rid of the refuse liquid, and it was sometimes deposited on the surface of the land near bylands created a. nuisance.' As the ground frequently became saturated the only course was to dig large pits and." soakage wells fo^drainagejiBrposes, and no good number ("were put down. What was designated the "large, room" undertone of the walls was originally, an underground." tank These excavations had boards, placed across, and were covered with earth ; when the tannery was connected with the sewers, rapid with the lapse of years their existence -pas forgotten. * . « 7-5?

He had heard no dissentient opinions! expressed as . i tithe: wisdom of the policy: which the Go- Government. was carrying out- with a view j'tb'taking full advantage of the geographe ?;cal,position of South Australia. This was the central State, and if rates of: a uniform ? character could be declared in the other states and this no part of the Commonwealth should benefit as much as South Australia, because of the latters central positions From parts of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria the produce ,, would find a natural outlet" in South Aus- ;-.;tralian'ports,,l e, Although the Government :V_avërl;e_pcc6èd that any large portion, of -the trade, of the" South-East would find its ::way^ttf Portland, probably a certain amount of-it would do so. If they were real'' Federationists they would realise ., they: must - not expect advantages from the other States unless they were prepared to give similar advan 'stages. He was sure that-from the. Victorian territory adjoining the South Anstralian border between Renmark" and Pin . nàroo-^coùntry equally as good as that on the South Australian side-this State would get an immense. advantage from the railway communication proposed in the Jillard be introduced.
