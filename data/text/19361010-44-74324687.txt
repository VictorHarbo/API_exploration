DANISH SETTLERS FOR W.A.? Suggested Taking Over Of Abandoned Settlements PERTH. October 9. The possibility of abandoned and other holdings on group settlements in the south-west being taken over by Danish immigrants is being closely con sidered by the Consul-General for Den mark (Mr. G. I-. Hoest), who has re turned to the city from a visit to groups to assess possible openings for Danes. Danish diplomatic and consular re presentatives, he said, bad been asked to study the migration position in the countries in which they resided and, in view of the talk about migration, It was thought that Danish people might be allowed to settle in Australia. He had found that the farms on the settle ments would be quite good if worked properly, and would be satisfactory, if conditions offered by the Government were such that they could profitably be taken over for dairying by Danes. Mr. Hoest added that be would dis cuss the matter with the Agricultural Bank Commissioners.
