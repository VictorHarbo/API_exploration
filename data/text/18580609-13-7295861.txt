Its chief excellences, briefly stated, are- that It converts the commonest food into a cheap and nutritious feed for both horses and cattlo. It is free from all Injurions or minorai lngrcdionts, and is purely vegotahlo in its composition. It promotos tho healthy notion of tho digestivo organs. It fattens quicker than any other known diet. Its effects are shown upon tho horso in improvod condition, glossiness of coat, brightness of the eyo, looseness of skin, increasing' onorgy and powora of endurance. It will, given as a cordial or in a bran-mash, rovlvo the most exhausted horso, after tho longest day's woi k. From its portability a quantity that can bo cirried in tho pocket, given in a pail of water, will, in tho abeenco of othor food, sustain a horso through a long day's journey. In England, where tho prleo of corn Is of less im- portance than in Australia, it Is moro gonerally used as n correctivo diet, In addition to their othor food, for keeping horses in high condition. It Is used in Hor Majesty's stables at Windsor, by tho London Omiiibus Company, by tho largo railway carriers, in nearly overy training stable, and chief huntiug establish- ments of England. | Messrs. Henri and Co., of Hull, patentees, In thus first introducing it to tho notice of tho horso and ¡¡took owners of Australia, beg to solicit for It a fair trial, and refer to tho many testimonials In proof of us un- doubtedly beneficial effects wherovcrit has been used England.
