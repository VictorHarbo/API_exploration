THE REMARKABLE SUCCESS op thb ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTES, Since the opening of the Brisbane branch of the ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN MEDICAL INSTITUTE, thoro has been a constant incoming and outgoing of sufferers from the various forms of CHRONIC DISEASES so prevalent in our midst, all seemingly anxious to test a system that, from tho comment of both Press and Fablio, is undoubtedly decades ahead of all other known methods for the cure of all OLD- STANDING, CHRONIC DISEASES. "WHAT ARE "CHRONIC" DISEASES P They are Diseases of old standing, which have become deeply seated through neglect nnd improper treatment, and it is to the unprecedented success whioh the Fhysioians of these Institutes have achieved in the treatment of these diseases that they owe their high reputation. Among the Diseases of a Chronio nature whioh are invariably treated by them success fully, unless past the roach of allhuman aid, aro tho following: Catarrh, Inoipient Consump tion, Bronchitis, Nervous Exhaustion, All Female Ailments, Epilepsy, Bladdor Dis orders, Piles, Rhomnatism and Sciatica, Skin Diseases, including Eczema, Kidney and Liver Complaints, Asthma, Diabetes, Gravel, Throat Disorders, and Diseases of the Nervous System. Any of the following pamphlets will bs misted free on application: "CHRONIC DISEASES aud .Their Presence Amongst Us." "Diseases of .the LUNGS and CHEST," " Woman's Weaknesses," und. " Man's Responsibility." CONSULTATION FREE TO ALL. The Physicians of the ANGLO-AUS TRALIAN MEDICAL INSTITUTES are legally qualified and duly registered by the Governments of the various Australian Colonies, and throughout the United King dom, and they are justly recognised as beiug the HIGHEST AUTHORITIES on all kinds of CHRONIC AILMENTS. AU those who are suffering from any form of Chronio, Nervous, or Skin Disease, and have so far failed to find raliof, aro espeoialiy invited to WRITE to, or CALL at their INSTITUTE, and at least find out whether their complaint is, or is not, ourable by this new and advanced system. IfifHITE. — If you cannot go to the Institute for consultation, write for LIST OF QUESTIONS, enclosing stamp for reply. Hundreds are successfully treated every year by Mail. They have the moat perfect system for treatment by Mail ever used in the Colonies. ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN MEDICAL INSTITUTE, ' A.M.P. SOCIETY BUILDINGS, QUEEN AND EDWARD STREETS, BRISBANE.
