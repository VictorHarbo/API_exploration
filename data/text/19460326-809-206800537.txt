LAND OF THE FUTURE Migrants' Interest in Australia European -countries consider Australia the land of the future and intend to send as many im migrants as possible when the "official barrier" is lifted, accord- ing to Mr. Svend Irgens Hansen, a Danish Journalist, who has ar rived in Melbourne. Travelling from Oslo in the 6700-ton motor ship Troja, Mr. Hansen, who represents the "Venstres Pressebureau," one of Denmark's largest news agencies, which influences readers through out Norway, Sweden and Den mark, said his intention in Aus tralia was to accurately survey conditions for the millions of potential migrants. This informa tion would be passed on to poten tial migrants, he said, by many articles, and a book dealing with the question, which he had been asked to write by a leading Danish publishing firm. No country in the world to-day, he said, held the interest of so many people as Australia did. In Norway alone many Australian clubs, with potential migrants as members, had been formed, and had approximately 100,000 mem bers. In Sweden and Denmark similar clubs had been formed. Mr. Hansen said all types of people were interested in Austra lia. Professional, as well as agri cultural, people wanted to know all the facts. The reason for this was the war, which had left thousands of people dissatisfied with their own countries. They all looked towards Australia, a new country, as the place where they could begin again.
